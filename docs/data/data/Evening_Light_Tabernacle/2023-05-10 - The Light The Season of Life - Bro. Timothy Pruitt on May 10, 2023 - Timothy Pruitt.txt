these moments as we see Lord the miraculous Among Us and you moving in a very wonderful way Lord knowing the things that are upon our heart and what we've even heard just Sunday Lord have of this of our mouth and our confession and speaking the promises of God and Lord we just see you now moving and touching and delivering God what a water what a moment we're standing in father what a time that we're in Lord we just asked father that you would just come and touch each and every heart and every life or there be somebody that needs to take another step towards you Lord and surrenderance may they do that tonight father whatever it may be God have your way we pray we commit this to you in Jesus name amen let's turn to Joel chapter 2. also Psalms chapter 1. amen is quite an honor to be here with you tonight be back home amen we had a wonderful trip there as we went to the tent meetings there brother Sean's and ministered there on a Wednesday evening and and then others brother Jonathan Martin brother Wendell Martin brother Wayne Lawson and brother Ron Spencer brother Andrew Glover would Minister as well it was just a wonderful time in the presence of God and and uh I I feel honored to stand with men who stand in for this message that preaches it with all their heart and they don't back off but they hold the sword and they proclaim the promises of God and and it was very wonderful to be with them and brother Ron Spencer you know has been bad as we know been battling cancer but Saturday night he preached probably one of his best I don't say that very often because it seemed like it's always the better is always the next one or the now right but it was it was incredible to watch how God would use him and in those moments and time and then we'd follow him up on sun Sunday morning to his place and Minister and back at brother Donnie Reagan's on Wednesday night and I just thank the Lord for all that he's done and all the victories he's won it's it's his work it's his people and it's his promises and he's got it all in his hands amen amen so tonight I just want to look at Joel chapter 2 and Psalms chapter one very of course familiar Scriptures it says here in verse 25 and I will restore to you the years that the locusts had eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the Palma worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat him plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed and he shall know that I'm in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaiden those days will I pour out my spirit Psalms chapter 1 and verse 1 says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his light his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water notice rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly or not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveeth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish amen will let you be seated he's looking here in Psalms chapter 1 and verse 1 you'll notice there's progression in the scripture because it says blessed is the man that walketh or then it goes to standeth and then it goes to sitteth so it's a progression of this man that walketh or standeth or sitteth and then also counsel way and seat and ungodly and Sinners and scornful but blessed is that man that his Delight is in the law of the Lord or in the word of the Lord and he doesn't meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree planted by rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in its season I'd like to speak to you this evening on this the light the season of life I believe we are in the season of life amen we're in the season that is moving from this Dimension into a new dimension amen from in and from Mortal life to Immortal Life and we know that we're in the time of of darkness and the time it's not not don't have to explain that very well to know that we're in great Darkness but also in the time of great light it's quite a paradox that in the middle of Darkness there's a great light that is shining Upon A people that is bringing them back to a place of restoration and not just partial partial restoration or partial fulfillment for full restoration and full fulfillment of his promises and God is going to fulfill every one of his words there's not one of them going to fall to the ground and not be fulfilled but he will fulfill every one of them amen and no matter what he has to do well no matter how many kingdoms he has to raise or how many kingdoms he has to tear down amen he's going to fulfill his word and I'm thankful that we're living in a time not of death but a time of life amen we can see there in the the first age as it was a time of planting it was a time of actually going into the ground and it would go down to the Dark Ages but it would come up and this time it was a time of not planting but a time of reaping a time of harvest and that's the time that we're living in that God has restored us back to what it was at the beginning and you know brother Brandon would talk about this he said Webster says the word restore means to bring back to the former owner to bring back to the former state or condition it's if a claim has been made on something is to make that restoration you can enforce it to bring it back to its right place to restore is to bring back to who really owns it amen to who really owns it to bring it back to its natural estate where it was at the first time to bring it back to his natural condition in order to do this we have the right to enforce if there's a law that speaks him then we have a right to enforce the rightful condition of restoration he says like if somebody stole some property and they're holding your property Capital captive then you can go to the law and take the law to this person and the law will force that person to restore this property back to the rightful owner in its print to its prior and First Estate amen enforcement he said enforce then we have the privilege to enforce the privilege to enforce upon Satan that claims that God has given us for God has a law his word is the law see amen Satan can come against you but his the word of God the law of God stands against him and his claims upon you as we spoke about Esther just a few Services ago just right at the End Amen there had been a law that had been put in place for their destruction but before that law could be enforced amen the king gave them another command and told them to go and to destroy their enemy before they destroyed them amen and I love that because Satan wants to come and put claims upon your life and put claims upon your souls and put claims upon the things on your mind and your spirits but before he could lay that claim upon you there was already something else another law that was in place that God has given us a right to enforce therefore we can go towards Satan to Satan and tell him bring it back to his rightful owner amen you see and he has to do it see we where God in his word made certain claims to the church therefore we have the right to enforce these claims upon Satan and say give it back and he has to do it Hallelujah and he has to do it not by our mind not by our power but by his Spirit saith the Lord amen I don't have the ability to make him do one thing but I have The God Who amen who has the ability has the power and has the way to make him do what his word says he's going to do amen because we can take God's agent the Holy Spirit and we can go on our knees and say it's thus saith the Lord and he's got to give it up that's all because the holy spirit is there to make him do it the law of the land is to enforce it's by the land and for the land and the law of the spirit of God is to for Satan to give up that which is unrightfully and deceitfully taken from God Souls of men he took from God Souls of women Souls of children sicknesses of the body he's placed upon people where God Made Them In His Image to be like him and the church has been given the right the legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and to enforce this law upon Satan hallelujah amen that he has to give up the property of God he has to give up what God has rightfully given us amen I I I don't think it just happens to answer just uh just something that happened today that we saw right before our very eyes brother Tim giving witness to it amen of a thing that had happened to his daughter I remember when I was there with my own little daughter laying there in a very serious situation amen and I just begin to use the word of God and call upon the name of Jesus and I watch God bring it all back to the place that it rightfully belonged I saw God bring back my daughter to her right mind give her sight back give her mind back give her all these things back why because I hadn't right brought amen a place I'd come to the law of God and I'd called out to that law and there was a spirit there to back it up and to bring it back where it belonged Amen brother Brandon we'll talk about this in a car Amen in a little car they've been stolen from a brother and he said it you said what he said what was it he said there was a law we could go to and that law was wherever two or three are gathered in my name if they would agree I'll be in their midst and if they agree on touching any certain thing and ask it and don't doubt in their heart they shall have what they ask and it shall be given them so there was a law of God that is spoken of all this need and this situation of a car that had been stolen from a man and been taken away from him and out of his sight and out of his ability to be able to return it but there was a law that had been spoken and he said we took that law before the father and the Holy Spirit went and and brought that law into force and he said we got on our knees about five men and four or five men and we knelt down and I pleaded the case before God and the great Holy Spirit as he took the word to serve summons a vision broke and I saw a man going toward Bowling Green Kentucky with a yellow shirt on driving his truck and the Holy Spirit come upon Him condemned him and he took it right back to where he got it and I saw him come back and park the car on a certain street over across the river and I raised up and I said thus saith the Lord and when they started out and went on the road there was a car sitting there half empty with gasoline the tank half day where it's been filled up just enough to take him halfway to Bowling Green and bring him back and these men are sitting here for a witness what was it enforcing give it back give it back see that's it that's what we're talking about re restoring it bringing it back to the rightful order amen bringing it back I was back there thinking about this very story and I thought of that law would pertain to a hunk of metal and it would pertain to a car and pertain to something that's very temporary how much more would this law pertain to our children how much more would this law pertain to the needs amen they're not temporary they're not temporary Souls they're not temporary parties amen but children that God has given us and has laid them in our life as fruits from our our body and God has given them to us and Satan wants to take them out of our side and try to destroy them and empty their lives and bring them down into a devil's hell but we come together tonight agree and only two things where two or three are gathered in his name there I'll be and we know he's here tonight and he showed it very very suddenly just today as he would take a little girl being kicked in the face by a horse and scars would be on her face look like a broke bones but God rich in Mercy Amen in a Father's Heart we begin to cry out and begin to call back restoration Hallelujah God did this for a purpose for you to realize amen God's more concerned than some scars on the face he's concerned about scars and his soul and the devil's trying to take them out and Scar their mouth but there's a people here that sees a law there and says God you spoke it and we're going to hold to it we're going to hold to what you spoke Satan has robbed us but we're going to bring it back Satan is taking it but we're going to bring it back by the word of almighty God hallelujah it's a law laying over Satan Hallelujah and if Satan has robbed you up in the prayer of the privilege of being a son or daughter of God you have a right by the Holy Spirit to enforce the claim of God and bring them back oh hallelujah amen we're talking about our Bill of Rights oh we're quick to go back to our our Bill of Rights on the Constitution that was written by some Mortal men but what about this that was written by almighty God hey man we we talk about our right to bear arms and they better not take our guns but meanwhile we lay down and let the devil run over right over the top of us it's time for you to bear arms it's time for you to encourage yourself and fight and say devil you come far enough but I'm here to enforce my god-given claim that's my child and not only is it mine it's a Son of God it's a daughter of God and we're coming after them in the name of Jesus Christ oh if he Afflicted you and made you sick you have a right before God to enforce the laws of God by his stripes amen oh we want our rights well I'm trying to give you some before God to enforce you have a right bring them back turn them loose you've taken him out yonder to death but we claim them and we bring them back foreign he's trying to take some of ours out by death by cancer but we have a right to stand upon the word of God and say bring them back bring them back to the house of God bring them back to full health bring them back to Restoration bring them back it's an enforcement restored back to his natural condition a man's sick a baby's sick a woman sick they're out out of their natural condition then we have a right to enforce our claim not our claim but it's our claim because God give it to us amen is his promise by his stripes we are healed he was wondering for our transgressions by his stripes we are healed then we have a right to enforce the law and the law Giver the Holy Spirit himself is here the agent of God to see that is done exactly that way oh come on now amen do we believe he's here we're Among Us what is the law it's his law he said where two and three are gathered in my name there I shall be so we know he's here tonight because we haven't gathered under some denominational name we hadn't gathered them in our own abilities our own ideas no we have gathered under the name of Jesus Christ and At The Mention Of that name every demon has to flee under mention of that name every sickness has to Bow under the mention of that name every sin has to turn loose and the mention of that name demons will Screech to a halt amen we have a right the only way he can work is when you let him work how do you let him work by speaking his word do what brother Andrew to check check check my check seems to work there for him we'll see if it works for me the way you let him work is by speaking his word not speaking your doubts as we heard Sunday not speaking your frustrations not speaking the conditions around you and the wowzy wowzy Woos and I'm never going to amount to nothing I'm never going to be there no that's not what his word said what his word said I'm a more than Overcomer his word said I am blessed Hallelujah his wife just read it to you blessed is he God sends his Earth around the Sun and we know the seasons change the Earth turns away from the Sun and winter sets in he said that's exactly the way a sinner does he just gets away from the Sun there so when and when Earth begins to come back when it's out there death strikes it the winner it kills every living thing he can kill out there the Earth gets back around but seeds are laying down on the ground they're frozen the pulps run out of them everything seems gone but there's still some light preserved on the inside oh God it may look like those seeds are out there and they're frozen and they're all hope is gone the pulse out of them but there's still some life on the inside of there and when this Earth begins to come back as soon as that sun gets back in the position again upon the Earth there will be an Easter a restoration up comes the flowers again up comes the grass again all the winter it killed the Sun restores Hallelujah all the wit all the winter the death had moved in the son of life is restoring it's calling it's pulling back and so it is now with people all the winners coldest cold former religion that's killed out there and nearing of the Son of God in the last days coming into his church it has restored us back to life again I will restore saith the Lord so God restores the flowers he restores the leaves he restores his nature his seed of the earth and therefore we know then that God will restore also his habitation he will bring it back and restore his Eden once again he will restore everything that death has killed the only way it could ever remain dead is to let it lay in the wrong place but if it falls in the right place it's got to come to life he said oh God let us fall in the right Channel hey I believe we're in the right channel tonight oh my let us fall in the right channel for restoration all that winter kills the sun restores returning the Sun what does it do it forces death to let go when the Sun that spring Sun comes back in the line of the Earth again it actually forces death to give up its dead to a resurrection again for what a restoration to restore it back again what does it the sun coming that is God's law God set the Earth in laws gravitation has a law is that a law you don't ever worry about it do you throw something up it's going to come down it's gravitation it's called the law of gravitation somebody would figure that out and would name it the law of gravitation what goes up we'll come back down again I don't care if you put a jet engine on it sooner or later it's going to come back down again it's a law there it's an actor it's an action it's working everything in nature Works according to that law the flower served its term the seed served his turn it died into the Earth but then there's a law of restoration there's a law of Resurrection amen and now it may be laying dead there and it seems impossible it seems like it'll never come to life again it seems like it'll never come forth out of that cold dark gray dead grave but there's a law that was laying there it's what Jesus would speak of that law he said you he said he will not suffer his holy one to seek corruption he said you tear this Temple down in three days I'll raise it up again what was he referring to the law that was over his body so pilate thought he had the law amen the Pharisees thought they had the law everybody the Roman soldiers thought they had the law but there was another law in effect before they ever went into effect Hallelujah before there was ever a pilot before there was ever a Pharisee before there was ever a Roman guard that was already a law that had been spoken in three days he's going to come out Hallelujah so they could try to seal it up they could try to cover it up they could try to do all they want to they could put a Roman seal and a Roman guard around it but there was a law that was over that body and that body was laying there but on that Resurrection morning that law came into effect there wasn't enough guards there wasn't enough Devils there wasn't enough anything to hold that body down let me tell you something parents there's a law that's an effect over your children they shall be there and they're Offspring with them the promise is unto you and your children amen so I don't care how much the devil has done how much he's trying to cover them up how much he's trying to scar them how much he's trying to destroy them when it's time for them to come to life they ain't enough devils there ain't enough sin there ain't enough perversion that can hold them down amen because there's a law that's an effect over them before there ever was a devil before there ever was a sin it was already a law in effect it is the law of life [Applause] God said all of his laws in motion let it soak in now he said all of his laws in motion it'll work according to his word his word his laws work according to his word his laws does not work according to the conditions your heart is Sunday his laws does not work according to his conditions or its conditions or the conditions around you it works according to the word so if the word spoken that law is in effect he commanded the son he commanded the moon he commanded the Earth commanded nature and all falls right in line and all the laws work in harmony with God's spoken word and the law of life that's in us will also bring us to a resurrection ah come on now it doesn't matter how dark it gets it doesn't matter what laws man will pass those laws are not in fact there's a law that's already been wrote over over our life it's called The Law of life Hallelujah and in this season it will bear forth fruit when it's time there's not enough devils in hell that's going to keep it from happening listen they could they could get muster up all the devils in hell and put them around a little graveyard over there in Lebanon Cemetery but there's some seeds that are laying there and when the time comes for that Resurrection they can try to stomp on it they can try to cover it up they can try to say it ain't so they can try to say whatever they want to do whatever they want to but when that law comes into effect when that law comes to Restoration and the law of life begins to produce what is it it's going to take some old dry dust and it's going to bring them back up again to step from mortality into immortality but not only is it going to do over there in a cemetery or one down the road here or wherever the seeds of God Amen it's going to do it in your own body Hallelujah the devil's trying to cap you and clamp you down and say you'll not Beaver so much I want to tell the devil something there's another law that's in effect over my life you have no say in how blessed I can be you have no say in how healed I can be you have no saying and how saved I can be devil you have no say over our children you have no say over our young people you have no say over anybody that's a seed of almighty God they're going to come forth let's go ahead and rejoice about it as good as already done because it's not a man-made claw a man-made decree it's God's law it's God's law and it's enforced no matter what the devil says when the word spoke on us suffered my Holy One to see corruption neither do I leave his soul in hell there was enough Devils there wasn't enough time it wasn't enough anything to keep Christ in the grave his body was laying there but the law of God would bring the word to pass and bring the promises to pass regardless of how little we think we are how low we think we are how impure we think we are how Unholy or how sick we are how Afflicted we are the law of God's spirit by his word makes it obey him and forces the issue and says give it back Mercy oh if you just think of that it forces it regardless of the conditions regardless of how impossible it may seem but damn it seemed impossible didn't it I mean when I was looking at my little daughter Adriana it seemed impossible let's look at it brother Philip it seemed impossible when I was looking at any of us it seemed impossible but God had a word there God had a law already in effect over our lives it didn't matter how deep in sin we went how dark in darkness we went how impossible it sin it's regardless of condition his word will be fulfilled [Applause] so if I was you I would stop looking at The Impossibles and start seeing what's possible it might be impossible for you to receive a heal it seems like or Deliverance or whatever you have needed look beyond all the impossibilities because this is just beyond that is the possibility the devil wants to lay everything else and I know how I'd start telling mother Tim I know how what he does when God does something like that for you then he wants to come back well you know it wasn't just as bad as you thought it was yeah he thought you just thought all that was there you just thought well let me just say it like this and I don't even want to put I'm not even trying to pack put a cloud of Doubt over anything where's our little sister at I don't know stand up come on up here that's a good idea does this look like a little girl that took a horse kick right in the face does it look like one that took one in the chest said she couldn't breathe hallelujah what man might have thought was impossible God said watch this there's somebody calling on my name and I'm going to fulfill my word hallelujah hallelujah come here Joshua come here does this look like somebody that used to be a sinner and so scared and worried and Afraid there was a law that was laying over his life it was an effect before fear came it was an effect before any devil came it was already there Hallelujah does this look like somebody that was in the bar room and was out drunk and worked in the world no sir but there was a law that was an effect over his life and would call him from there and make him a preacher of the Gospel of Jesus Christ I'm telling you need to look past all your sadness look past all your unbelief look past everything that you can see and look to the outside it's more real tonight than anything you see around here there's angels of fire there's pillars of fire there's God walking up and down moving he said if I can just get somebody to take me out my word [Applause] if I can just get somebody to walk towards that fire I'm going to step in with them Hallelujah we ought to have a jubilee tonight listen God arrange this whole thing he'll allow what to be preached on Sunday amen Sarah watch your mouths and then he's coming back behind and saying look I got a witness right there of a man that would look past his fears look past the scars look past the plug and say God have mercy on my daughter and God in a minute would take that old brags off of her face and she be made completely whole let that be a sign to your moms and dance that's got children out there away from God and they're always seems impossible but one of these days the rags are coming off the riots are coming home and it's going to be Lazarus has come forward the word and power of Resurrection is Among Us it is in effect [Applause] said after his death burial Resurrection many of the Saints had slept in the dust of the earth rose up out of the ground what was what the prophet spoke the word and the spirit of God brought it to pass not only did Jesus raise but Saints raised with him it was a season of life death had been conquered and I want you to understand something death is still conquered death has still lost his hold death has still lost his ability to put fear in Believers hearts Hallelujah say the court writes out a certain certain certain things certain penalty to do so and so that's the word of the Court the law of the Court but the law has to enforce what the word of the Court says and God speaks something that's a law and the Holy Spirit though is here to enforce it for the believer you've got to have the badge of the believer you got to have the token somebody said you got power no but we got Authority not power but Authority we ain't got power to do nothing he said it's like a little policeman in Louisville standing there smaller than what I am little bitty Fella's hat pulled out over his ears 45 Maybe he's uniform about half hanging off of him walk out in the street cap pistol like on the side a little stick in his hand little whistle walk up there with a pair of white gloves on in them cars some of them 350 horsepower whirling down by the street like lightning zoom zoom zoom he couldn't stop a runaway Pony with his strength but he walked out in the street with that bad Shining he went he blew that whistle and he held up his hand brother 350 horsepower motors squeaked the brakes it wasn't the power of the man it was the authority he had [Applause] it was the authority half that's the church it might be a bunch of Holy Rollers so-called whatever you want to call it but she's got Authority it's the authority behind it that's what does it regardless of the conditions regardless you need to write that down regardless of the condition God's law works it won't work with your Creed it'll work with the word it works with the word it works with the spirit following behind it and bringing it to pass may not look like much maybe a hundred pounds soaking wet but you're in your your little one of your little sisters in there washing your dishes all of a sudden the baby comes in burning up with a fever you have the authority to lay your hands on that baby and Demon's brakes are going to squeak brother Tim did not have the power to do what happened I didn't have the power to do what happened to Adriana I didn't have the power to say brother Philip but there was an authority I never forget it as I was laying there looking at my little girl and her crossed eyes and her talking about she couldn't see and her eyes open and they're crossed all up and I said God I'm just like brother I think his bank Banks Woods wouldn't it or who was out there on fishing with brother Branham Welch Evans that's who it was and he was out there fishing with brother brannelman and he reaches over to grab a bass brother about him and called her something and a snake Timber rattle or something bit him on the foot and I it was going through my mind as I'm looking at this because we're just out enjoying nature out there at the state park with some young people and some other adults that were there and I I'm just looking at this like God I I think I I ain't doing nothing wrong I'm just out here enjoying nature I remember when it's like that with your prophet and how he began to pray and I just began to pray Lord I'm just out here enjoying this and the devil is coming struck her down and she says she can't see and I'm looking at crossed eyes and I asked God that you'll just give her back her eyesight and I watched those eyes come straight and I watched her and she began to say Daddy I can see you now I didn't have power to do that I didn't have power to fix her to pick some big enough strong enough glass to put on her eyes to give her aside I couldn't do nothing but God could and God came behind a little boy's prayer a little son of God and began to call upon him and he moved very quickly and I watched it happen and God began to move in such a way and that brother Matthew similarly would call my father same thing and he would pray God let there not be one broke bone doctors were sure she had broke bones her ankle was swelled way out and her face was all messed up and they've done all kind of scans and all kinds of things and then he'd come back he said look he said I'm going to keep her overnight because she was observed knocked out but otherwise there's no reason to to do this you don't have a sign of a brain injury she don't have a sign of a concussion she don't have one broke bone it's all okay Hallelujah and I know what God spoke to me he said what you saw in the natural you'll also see in the Supernatural and God very quickly brought the same thing that happened in the natural in the Supernatural and we still got living proof of it here tonight so the devil can say whatever he wants to say he can howl all it wants to have I could see a man that's been changed I can see a man who once was walking one way and God turned him around and he went the other way in his Amnesia is gone and the scars are healed regardless of conditions brother brother Tim make mention of this Sunday about Abraham and Sarah how Sarah was caught by abimelech she went to the change of life for the body change and here's a 90 year old woman a king's Desiring there's things there's things in the scriptures people don't ever catch but here she is and the King's wanting to take her for his wife he said he was all ready now to take her God said Abraham by Sarah you'll have a baby see what it was it was a law already in effect over her life so abimelech seed would not work amen God had said that to Abraham from you Sarah will have a have a child and here's a young man taking her you notice what God Said you know I not yes I know the Integrity of your heart the reason I've kept you from sinning against me but restore that woman to her husband for he is a prophet and let him pray for you and if you don't I'm going to wipe you off the face of the Earth there you are what was it God's word it has to stand no other man could touch Sarah because God had a long effect over her life Sarah type of the Church the true church the Free Church the free woman with a free child the type of the born-again Church of Promise let them say what they want to call us a Holy Roller call it fanaticism they try to stop it at Pentecost but they'll never do it just keep your hands off of it that's all God's gonna take that and do something with it just as sure as I'm standing here we're coming right down take your hands off of her there come the natural seed that's where the natural seed had to come if Sarah would have married this other man the natural seed would never been born so if God listen to this so protected the course for the natural seed how much more for the spiritual direct quote if God so protected the course for the natural seed how much more for the spiritual Royal Sea has he protected that Satan give him back turn them loose you're not smother them out there with organization and they they're free people you let them alone turn them loose they are the Royal seed of God there's already a law in effect over lives God speaking of Joel and hearing Joel God is speaking of his fruit tree that he planted God planted a fruit tree and he planted it on the day of Pentecost and he brought that tree there for a purpose God wanted it to bear his fruit word his fruit word God's word direct quote he wanted a church that would keep his word all down to the ages and I'll say this no matter the conditions no matter the conditions Eve had failed to keep it Jews have failed to get failed to keep it the law had failed all of it fell so God planted himself a tree and when this tree that God planted it was to Bear nine different kinds of fruit nine different kinds which means dying spiritual gifts nine fruits of the spirit that go with nine spiritual gifts that was God's tree he planted it and the Earth on the day of Pentecost and David saw this long time ago of his writings of songs for something joyful that it was the first thing he wrote about he saw a tree that was planted by rivers of waters and he shall be like a tree God's tree planted where by Rivers pure plural of water singular not Methodist Baptist and Presbyterian life no no just rivers of one water rivers of one water non-spiritual gifts by The Same Spirit nine fruits of the spirit coming in the same channel he shall be like a tree that's planted by rivers of water and David saw it he said blessed is that man because if he's planted there his leaves are not going to wither if he's been planted in that River amen he's going to bring forth fruit in this season no matter how they try to kill the tree no matter how the devil's trying to do it it's still coming forth his root won't die his root won't die and he said they can mock it laugh it make fun of us as Christians persecute persecution says a Christian to make him pray more and dig down and get a better hold so he can stand the storms trouble on the job situations in your family things that are going around you everyday life is to cause you to pray more and Dig Down Deeper Not Just Jerk it up and say well I ain't given no fruit don't allow yourself to go deeper into the word a deeper into his presence more experiences of God a greater experience I don't care if you're a 50 60 70 year old oak tree we all need more of God you never can get enough there's one feelings but many refillings and if you ever got the feeling you're going to want the refilling I can understand you're not wanting the refillings if you didn't get the feeling but if you ever got one drink if you ever he said because if you take this drink that I'm offering it'll quench something on the inside of you and you'll want more of it and you'll want more of it and you'll want more of it what if a man's planted in such things as by the river where the Springs nine different Springs feeding into them one of the establishment he has a man that's planted by the river the rivers of water one water one Spirit there's Gifts of healing Same Spirit Gifts of Prophecy Same Spirit All The Same Spirit many gifts and David saw him he was planted by the tree that would never die notice he had his life in The Roots the Roots were in the spring and up from the roots came to life and it began to Bear forth fruit now remember the tree will not cast as fruits you take a tree and put it away from the water first thing you know you got a little old Apple a little knotty worm eating apple it'll cast this crop he said that's what's the matter with the churches today you done got away from the river you got away from the gifts of the Spirit you got just church natural they get away from the spiritual things of God and they cast their fruits away what did they do they their Believers live in the world act like the world still cheat lie Smoke Drink gamble have bunco parties in the church pay the preacher everything else soup supper dances they cast their fruit it's just like the world and the unbeliever looks and say there's no difference in that person in me but a man that's planted not just stuck out but planted direct quote not just stuck out but planted by the rivers of water he's going to bring forth his fruit not your own fruit his fruit his fruit in due season we can read it there again Psalms 1 blessed is the man the Sid is not in the seat of the scornful stands in the way of the Sinners he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water he shall bring forth his fruit in his season and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly is not so he won't stand with them in the Judgment now we see shall bring forth his fruit in the season watch each his the personal pronoun here is his fruit God's fruit and the season that the prophet is bringing it it'll be in the prophet's season God's fruit In God's Time by The Prophet's season he'll bring forth his fruit in his season see if there isn't two if there isn't two his there bring forth his God's fruit in the season that the messenger has ordained it to come he'll bring forth now remember that messenger that brings forth the fruit of God will bring it in God's season it is the season of the bringer he's the season of the bringer he will bring forth his fruit in his season hey what is a bringer it's someone who brings a bringer is something or is someone who brings or provides you say I don't have no strength he's here to provide it I don't have no joy he's here to provide he's brought it in his service he's the bringer and he's bringing it out and he's passing it out to each one who will receive yeah you say well how how do I do it you just Reach Out and touch the Lord as he passes by what is it a touch of faith god this is my time the bringer was passing by that little woman with a blood issue and he's bringing her healing with him but she had to reach out and grab it by faith reaching out ain't just by hand it's by the words of your lips speaking the word speaking the word God I believe it this is my promise this is my service this is my time this is time fruit is going to come out of my life amen John 1 and verse 4 said in him was life and that life was the light of men it's the season of life life is a mystery it's the very force and energy that keeps us going listen this is this is I thought it was very good so I'll put it in here materialistic scientists have have to say is just the interaction life is just the interaction of chemicals that makes the body move and react and respond and enter through interact with everything around it it it is most clearly realized when it's absent life is most clearly realized when it's absent naturally spiritually realize when it's absent when death occur occurs to see a dead body immediately after death is to realize that something has left it so all that is left in the flesh that will Decay leaving nothing but dust something within the flesh gave up and no longer energizes the body into action for most of us the thought of Simply a chemical interaction is grossly inadequate we sense we feel we're something far more than just chemicals for chemicals have no Beauty they have no meaning they have no purpose things like love and creativity are just meaningless in a pile of Haven molecules that's my brother Brandon said you want to he said here's a quarter go buy me a court of love you can't do it go buy me a court of life you can't do it it's something else that comes from another place he said from a materialistic point of view we know that a human body needs a pumping heart it needs an active brain and when either one of them shuts down the body shuts down and dies we explain the brain activity as minute electrical charges flowing between cells causing stimulation that brings life but as we just said most of us also demand that is more than just that he said whatever men rationalize and reduce Humanity to Mere matter very soon after we find abuses of men by men because they don't look at it as something more than just matter they look at it just just like the tree out there matter of fact they begin to worship the tree more than the body that God created and there they would they would hang you over cutting down a tree before they would hang you over killing the body because they have reduced Humanity to Mere matter and when you do that he says you find abuses by men of men by men Hillary history is littered with such abuses it is only when we see man as something more than merely molecule activity does a man rise up to Greatness then we start talking about the quality of life and all this we're struggling to put meaning to this word life John though said in him was life speaking that it was something different than anyone else and everyone else life is imparted given to them at conception passed on by their parents but in Jesus this life existed independently of any other human being this life this energy that we understand we struggle to understand and exist in God alone the light the life the light the life the word life occurs 50 times in John's gospel often in the context of eternal life which is a life force or energy that goes on without end when the Bible speaks of our spirit it is that part of us that is a mysterious holder of this life that's energized which when a person becomes a Christian he's energized by the Holy Spirit you could see and it goes through many examples of when the spirit of God would fall upon men to the Old Testament in the New Testament it's a good study of how their life would become energized to where they become could do more than what was just humanly possible Samson's one that comes very quickly to my mind a man shrimp love a shrimp of a man curly hair look like a little but the spirit of God would fall on him and he would do things that seemed impossible it was impossible he would rip out a heart of a lion and he would carry the gates of God he would do all kinds of things kill a thousand Philistines at once for the Java of a mule but what was it it was a spirit that was energized and it was a spirit it was given life and every case of the Holy Spirit coming upon men he gave them ability it was like all their natural abilities were raised to a different height even a parallel pictures tried to explain it would be to say it was like a man with only black and white sight being given the ability to see in true color amen and raised it up to a whole new level to a whole new light to a whole new life with the arrival of God in power there's a flow of life that brings a transformation in man that is so dramatic that it changes him from what he used to be to what he can be it's like the sun breaking out on a cloudy day and Life coming forth in his body and he sees things like he never saw him before that's the transformation power of the almighty God at the light the life that comes into you and we have his Spirit the life the real God energy is flowing in us and we're transformed and then we can become what we're designed to be we start seeing things differently thinking differently acting differently talking differently this life in Jesus came into us and we are transformed but let me tell you it's more than transforming you into a new thought or a new thinking or a new walk begin with this because we're in the season of mortal life raising our children marrying and bringing forth families this is a season of mortal life but when we have been born above the body returns to the dust but the spirit goes up where it came from to God who gave it to us there will come another season there will come another season and that season that will come will be the season of Immortal Life and when the Son of God Rises with healing in his wings it will be totally impossible somebody say impossible it'll be totally impossible to hold these bodies in the ground any longer they'll come forth in the brightness of the Son of God for every nature to self testifies of it so if we are a Christian we're born of a spirit death can't hold nothing but victory for us because this whole corruptable body that Satan still has power over will drop into the dust of the Earth this the wrong season now this is Mortal season but Immortal season is coming Immortal season and coming and when the immortal season comes their mortal one will come and he will bring with him the immortal spirits that are returned from the earth and they'll come back in the resurrection for a great room in the Millennium and then shine in the glory forever Hallelujah we are in the season of Lies we're in the season of the Resurrection we're in the season of all things are possible we are in the season of the body chain we are in the season of death knowing it's master Hallelujah I'm here to tell you what you need to do is look at that devil that's telling you you'll never amount to nothing you'll never be anything say devil I'm in the season I'm in the season of The Immortal one the sun is shining on me I can't help but be blessed I can't help but be lifted up I can't help but it's raised to shine upon my life and change my heart in life forever you are in the season of life so if you're in that season why don't you just begin to rejoice in the light that you have heard this is my moment this is my time arise and shine for the light has come and you're not in the season of death no more even in life you're in the season of life we are not in a season of barrenness no more we're in the season of life hallelujah hallelujah I don't say that just on my own hell I say that on the ocean of the Holy Ghost we are not in the season of barrenness no more we are in the season alive we are in the season of life so if you're bearing and you're unfruitful come to the life always praise him tonight brother Michael let's praise him and I just lift up your hands I'm in the season of life I'm in the season of all things are possible gotta make a way where there seems to be no way I want to thank you right now for my child I want to thank you right now for The Impossibles to become possible I'm going to thank you right now that you're doing things you're working when we can't even see you working because we are in the season of Miracles we're in the season of Immortal Life Hallelujah so if we're believing for body change let's believe for healings and deliverances Hallelujah let's believe for our children to come back doesn't matter how impossible it may seem it doesn't matter what situations may look like it doesn't matter how dark it may seem foreign four days late but he's still the resurrection and the life oh God he's still the resurrection father we love you Lord love you father Lord we thank you for what you've done among us

people took punches in the face from that writer Called Death and they've they're laying down and they're defeated but Lord You're Going To Raise them up by the power of the Resurrection and you're going to bring them back to the house of God again and you're going to bring them back as Sons and Daughters of the king Hallelujah you want to heal their scars and you you're going to touch them in
