can say he still left the 99 for me didn't we amen as brother timothy comes tonight let's just sing that again there's no wall amen amen don't you know that's absolutely true there's nothing that could separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus hallelujah let's sing that one more time help me satan there's no [Music] [Music] hallelujah aren't you thankful for that aren't you glad he never stopped at any wall any but he life them all down to get to you tonight what a wonderful savior we have let's just bow our heads together father we come to you tonight lord just looking for you to move in our lives you to speak father you to touch hearts and love lord we need you lord we just ask father you continue to burn may this revival continue to burn burn out sin and lord unbelief the days lord of the apostles the day of pentecost lord the things that you've done in those days are once again re be repeated in our day we've seen it lord we're looking for a continuation father god that still heals delivers sets free god was so thankful there wasn't a wall that could stop you there wasn't a lie that you believed but god you believed your word and your word was sent forth and it healed and it delivered father we love you with all our hearts god we're thankful for every heart here today every life you've touched every life you've lifted up god we commit our lives to you father and our hearts to you with everything that we have we thank you lord for the things you've done among us for they are indeed great things we love you now in jesus name amen amen god bless you today amen it's good to be in the house of the lord [Music] amen amen i know not everyone was able to go but i trust you is able to stream the services amen uh well if you just catch a portion of what was there i believe you were blessed amen we just had such wonderful words of life and god moving and touching and ministering amen i'm so thankful to the ministry in this hour that i stand and preach the gospel amen preach healing preach deliverance amen preach salvation preach the holy ghost amen i i believe that we still believe in that amen and you say well you know what what's this all about well what you're seeing is a revival it's the bride's revival amen and you say well what about fire well fire is good if you want to burn up something and you know i was looking at just quotes on fire and brother branham says we need a good god-sent revival that'll burn out sin and unbelief and every kind of thing the devil's trying to put on us that's we want to keep building that fire that'll burn that out amen and so we're just thankful to every soul and every life that was touched if you could turn in your bibles to proverbs 18 and verse 21 amen i wasn't uh wasn't there i was there part of the time sunday night but i ended up leaving earlier than some of the things that had happened but as i went home this this thought began to uh come upon my heart and i began to think about it and think about these things and and uh tonight we just want to speak to you tonight on the light and darkness of the tongue the light and darkness of the tongue amen i believe that uh amen that we'll we'll hear some things tonight that maybe keep that revival going amen keep that spirit of god moving in your heart and your life proverbs 18 and verse 21 says death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it shall eat the fruit thereof amen we let you be seated what the scripture tonight that we've read is literally saying is the words you speak have the ability to give life to a person or to yourself or to a situation however they can also kill or destroy a person a situation or yourself or your testimony this scripture is a simple reminder of how much your words matter you know out of your mouth you have the ability to build up or tear down you have the ability to motivate or discourage you have the ability to lift people high higher or drag them lower you you have the ability to inspire to greatness or to push them to mediocrity all because of the words that have come in out of your mouth this is the life and death or the darkness and light that is in the power of the tongue you know jesus would say in matthew chapter 12 and verse 37 he says for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned so we see there's power in the tongue there's power in the word and brother brandon would speak many things on confession and profession amen are being the same thing that we must confess that god has done it before he can even do anything for us so it's very very important that you keep the right positive attitude towards whatever god's done for you in your life and and you continue to build by the words that comes out of your mouth and and to hold on fat to the fat hold on fast to that profession maybe in this camp you said i got the holy ghost well you're going to have to hold that amen you say well i got healed you're going to have to hold that brother brown we'll talk about somebody coming in the prayer line and says you're healed he said but you're going to have to hold that the you'll stay healed as long as you have the faith to stay healed amen and so i understand that we're sealed into the day of our redemption and those things but amen but still you have to continue in the faith amen you cannot let your guard down you cannot let words begin to come out of your mouth that does not line up with the word of god amen you know you might have thoughts you might have things but don't let those thoughts become words because those words become actions and those actions become a life that you live amen we could read in hebrews chapter 4 and verse 14 seeing that we have a great high priest that has passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession and on down in 10 and verse 23 let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise hallelujah how many believes is faith amen you know it doesn't matter you say well brother timothy what if i i don't feel like it doesn't matter what you feel like or you say well what if i don't i don't see it doesn't matter what you see amen you continue to profess or confess that he's the healer he's the deliverer he's the satisfier he has everything i have need of and you speak it amen out of your mouth until it comes to pass in your life amen you know you say brother branham had that that sickness in his body and i was just reading this amen back before i come out and and he said you know you see he ate that pile of beans and that that servant of beans and onions and the doctor said it was going to kill him but he began to confess that god's my healer he began to lay there and stay there in that place and it didn't matter if it felt it it didn't matter if there was something happen some chill that didn't matter to him what mattered is what god's word said and he began to confess it and he would he would he would eat it and his mama was screaming and said you're going to die the doctor said you'd eat a bite and he said i don't care what the doctor says i'm going to believe the word of god i'm healed and he would begin to profess that and confess that he'd swallow it he would try to come up he'd swallow it and he'd try to come up how you feeling billy i'm healed how you feeling i'm healed he said somebody told me i was lying he said no i wasn't lying i was only saying what god's word said hallelujah the devil wants to make you think you're lying when you try to say something but what you're saying is not your word you're saying the word of god you're saying what god's word said he said i could have the holy ghost he said i could be healed he said i could be delivered he said i am delivered he said i am healed he said i do have the holy ghost his word has declared it therefore i'm not speaking what i feel i'm not speaking what i see i'm speaking what god's word says and light begins to come out of your life and out of your mouth as you speak the words of god psalms 19 psalms 19 and verse 14 says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be accepted in thy sight o lord my strength and my redeemer 4141 verse 3 said a watch o lord before my my mouth and keep the doors of my lips amen so it's very important what comes out of the lips it's very important what you say it's very important what you speak it's very important amen what you allow to be voiced in your life proverbs 6 and verse 2 says thou art snared with the words of thy mouth and thou art taken with the words of thy mouth thy mouth now what you know we get so worried about what somebody else says about you what you need to worry about what you say about yourself what are you saying about your experience what you're saying about who you are what are you declaring amen he that proverbs 13 and verse 3 says he that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life but he that openeth wide his lips shall have destruction proverbs 15 and verse 4 says a wholesome tongue is the tree of life wholesome is a health or healing a healing tongue is the tree of life you know i was reading some things brother brennan would say about thoughts and i run across these and questions and answers said brother branham please explain how a person knows if he's thinking his own thoughts or if the devil is placing thoughts in his mind to make him think wrong especially if you know you don't want to thank them amen so it does matter if you're wanting to thank them or or if you're dwelling on them but if you don't want to thank them this is the answer he said if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking amen if it's contrary to the word it's the devil's thinking but if it's with the word it's god's thinking if it's the wrong thoughts it's the devil so let's put it where it belongs amen if a thought comes through your mind every one of us has thoughts either that or we're dead remember we all have thoughts we all have things that comes through our mind but if it's the wrong thing it's the devil's thinking hallelujah if it's good thoughts of the word and of god it's god's thinking the very next question if the case may be that the devil is placing thoughts in your mind about a certain thing how may it be i over i can overcome or get rid of it he says take the very opposite or vice versa of it if the devil makes you think if you know you're a christian if you know what god's done for you but he tries to make you think you're not a christian just take the other opposite side and say i am a christian amen as long as your experience is matching god's word say i am experienced and anything else the same way you say i'm a christian i'm saved i'm delivered i'm set free hallelujah when you answer this he said please pray for me to overcome this as i'm not by myself how many could say yes that's true god grant you overcoming every who you are may your thoughts just go right back to the other side and say i am a christian i am a believer satan you don't have no hold on me come on now satan i am delivered i am set free god done something for me god saved me he touched me i know he did but all the while those other thoughts are trying to come through what are you doing you're taking them captive by the word of god and you're saying that's not my fault that's the devil's thoughts that's not my thinking that's the devil's thinking that's not who i am that's who he is so literally the devil trying to put a thought in your mind he's only telling you who he is defeated bound going to hell not going to make it hallelujah amen that is the devil's thinking he has those thoughts every day he deals with those thoughts every day i have an end i'm not going to make it i'm going to burn in hell god's word has said so but you on the other hand you turn back to god's thinking i've already made it i'm already saved i'm already delivered i'm already set free satan you have no hold on me how many can say that tonight satan you have no hope now listen to this he says frankly i'm standing right here saying the same thing to keep from fainting right here in the pulpit that's right five or four times i've almost pitched over in the pulpit that's the truth god knows that's right so the prophet himself was dealing with the devil's thoughts amen what am i supposed to do well finally brother whatsoever things are true what sort of things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely what sort of things are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things think on these things amen see divine healing is what the prophet of god said divine healing lays at calvary the only thing that you can do is point to calvary that's where your salvation lays you wasn't saved just 5 years 10 years 20 years ago however long it was you wouldn't save you was saved before the foundation of the world he came down 1900 years ago and jesus died at calvary and he took the sins of the world away and you just accept your salvation so many years ago but everything that god can do but both sickness and sin has already been appropriated in calvary the only thing that a minister can do is point you to where it's at what god has already did for you listen he said a man can come to the altar he can pray all night he can cry he can beg he can plead he can walk up down the floor he can make restitutions but until he believes and accepts it he is still a sinner for hebrews 3 said jesus christ is the high priest of our confession profession the same translation he's a high priest of our confession he can do nothing for you until first you confess he's already done it but if your life is singing out the song of i'm depressed i'm depressed every day that i live i'm depressed you'll be singing for i'm depressed i'm depressed every day that i live i'm depressed when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head to rest i want everybody to know i'm depressed i am bound i am bound every day that i live i am bound when i wake up in the morning when i lay my head whose thoughts are you thinking whose thoughts are you declaring whose thoughts are you speaking the only way the devil has power over you by his thoughts is when you put him into actions or into words he's a high priest so you have to accept he's already done it and he will make good anything that's included in his atonement oh hallelujah and there he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisement our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed not will be or we ought to have been we were past tense already healed god did it back there at calvary the only thing to do is reach for it receive it by faith believe it and confess it amen brother would deal with negative testimonies he says if your number's called tonight and if god reveals to your heart and speaks to you and gives you deliverance here don't you ever have no kind of another testimony only that he healed you because if you do the one time you testify to the other side the negative side it'll come back to you worse than it ever was that's healing that's any kind of thing you want to put there amen whatever depression anxieties fears all those kind of things once you start giving testimony and actions toward that it'll come back worse than it ever was he said don't you ever have a negative testimony he said let him that's weak say amen just say in your heart say i'm strong say it with your mouth i'm strong i've now accepted jesus as my healer and never ever ever have a negative testimony anymore just believe it god's under obligation to bring it to pass because he's the high priest of your confession to make good before the father anything that he died for and you're confessing it goes another place says healing is not something you just say well yeah i believe it i believe it he said that's all right that's just the best you can do mentally just say yes i see it i believe it i accept it that if you accept it on those bases keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over keep saying i'm healed i'm healed i'm healed keep saying it till you actually believe it so this works on the other side too if you keep saying i'm lost i'm lost i don't have god then you're going to get to the point you actually believe you're lost and there's no hope for you and there's no coming back for you you went through too far he'll take you down a long dark path but if you'll turn back the other way and begin to speak i'm a child of god god called me by name he i am his friend i am his son i am his daughter and he'll bring you back towards the light till it becomes no more what you just say but it is what you believe and therefore becomes who you are say it until you believe it and then when you believe it then it's going to take place don't have a negative testimony listen the worst thing you can do to come to be prayed for is to come up and give a negative testimony well brother timothy i'm just going through such a dark time and i just don't know what i'm going to do i just don't know if i'm ever going to get you're not ever going to get out of it you're going to go back and you're going to be worse well i'm just i'm telling you i'm just old and i'm tired and i'm this and i'm that abraham was pretty old anybody in here a hundred i didn't ask if you felt like a hundred i asked if you're a hundred how many in here is a hundred years old abraham was 100 years old when he received the promise so i don't give any of us 90 85 70 65 50 50 45 40 don't give us any excuse your old age is not an excuse unless you allow it to be an excuse amen your situation is not an excuse unless you allow it to be an excuse come on somebody amen abraham could have made all kinds of excuses amen it's been now 25 years how's it going to come to pass but the scripture says he got stronger not weaker he got stronger in the faith he began to confess the word of god he began to say it it's going to happen if it don't happen today it's going to happen tomorrow and if it happens tomorrow to be a greater testimony than it was today and he kept walking towards the promise he didn't have no end date he didn't know when it was going to be he just knew god said so come on somebody we don't always know the end of our trials we don't always know the end of our sickness but we know god said so he said i'm healed he said i'm delivered he said i'm a son he said i'm a daughter he said i'm his i am his some of you already may have already walked back your testimony even from sunday night listen you're not always going to have bright and sunny days you're not always going to be on a mountaintop you're not always going to be in the just a bliss of the supernatural when things are moving and it's just not the christian walk we're going to walk through the valley of the shadow of death we're going to walk through temptations and trials we're going to walk through sicknesses and trials and problems of life and family situations we're going to walk through them but wherever you're walking that does not change who god is and that does not change his word so in the valley of the shadow of death i can still praise him i can still quote his word i can still speak the word of god it doesn't matter if i can see it being fulfilled it doesn't matter if i can see it happening around me that has nothing to do with it i know his word is true and i'm going to stand on it he says every time when you confess well i still feel bad today you go right back to the same rut he was in the beginning hello somebody it's time to get out the ruts some of you been in a rut too long your spiritual life's in a rut even somebody had thoughts of a man i wish i felt like them young people felt then i can praise him listen you can praise him abraham i don't care if you feel like a young person that's an excuse that's a crutch oh my goodness let me get back over here there's a rock you'll get right back into it there's some that were prayed for last year that this year that is back in the same rut but it was worse it was a deeper rut you know why it's deeper because they've been digging and trying to spin out of the same rut spinning their wheels and spinning around throwing this dirt there and throwing that dirt there and it ain't going nowhere why because of their confession and the devil bottles them up to where they can't even praise god no more and they can't give glory to god and he bottles them up and tightens them up so tight in their confession i just i can't i can't bless nobody i can't do nothing for nobody and they can barely breathe and they can barely operate and they can barely move because he's got it wrapped up so tight and the words that come out of their mouth there's not a man or woman here that's been baptized with the holy spirit but what would start your confession i believe i lost it i believe it's gone for me and you will go right down don't never have a negative testimony testify positive jesus heal me and i'm well go you go and you'll receive your healing no matter how you're feeling if you go feeling then you're certainly going to have bad feelings but if you get back to that every time you have a negative testimony every time that you look at your symptoms you're falling right then there's not a christian in here no matter how solid you are in faith right now something happened to get a hold of you and tell you that you're not a hit christian and you start out testifying well i'm not a christian no more you drop right then you're no more christian anymore that's the power of our words as soon as you testify you're not a christian you're dropped from grace right then you're fallen he said it's a strange saying that there's so much thought of so much thought of people they say well i'm weak my faith is not very much i'm not a very good christian that's just what the devil wants you to say you're just talking his language right then you must never say that don't ever let your testimony be negative let it be positive all the time i'm saved i have god in my heart i believe him with all my heart do you believe in divine healing with all my heart let your testimony always in your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it but when it starts don't entertain it sometimes you can't help it there's demons you walk when you walk through the valley of shadow death you walk into walmart you walk into places there's demons all around you and be honest with you they're not worried about those they already got but when light calls it comes walking in they realize there's something different right there and they begin to try to bring down doubts and fears and unbeliefs and things he said when it starts don't entertain it well you say i can't help thoughts for coming well that's be like the farmer said he couldn't stop a bird from flying over his place but he could sure stop them from roosting you can't help thoughts when they come but don't entertain them pass them on no sir jesus christ is my savior all things are mine by god and i'm going to keep them amen that thought has hit some of you you're not going to keep your joy you're not going to keep the experience you've got but you just heard the prophet of god you throw that down he said it is all things are mined by god and i'm going to keep them we got young people that's going to keep that experience in the holy ghost we got young people that's going to keep that joy and that fire in their balls we got older ones that humongous and says hey don't leave me hal i still got the fire of god in me it's still burning in me and i'm gonna keep it it'll take a stronger wind than this it'll take something greater than this to blow it out hallelujah i'm not here to blow out any fire i'm here to add to the fire just keep waving say come on we can have more deliverance we can have more of the supernatural
