scripture again today as we did last Sunday and I want you to mark your calendars we've invited brother Murphy Wong for the last Sunday of December that's the 29th and then Tuesday night on the 31st we will have a new Year's Eve service we'll be making more announcements about that brother Murphy is of originally from China and um he um um is one who has translated the King James English Bible into Chinese language and made it available for the Chinese people we were blessed to be able to go there some years ago and went into Shanghai and priest and underground churches where that ministered there and also talked to a whole group of about 40 ministers there and just shared with them the things that God has done in our generation so you know there's a great work that is going on there and um brother Murphy will be here I don't know maybe he will talk a little bit about that they just been able to meet with uh a group of them from China some ministers came over to the Philippines because they they could not safely meet there in China um things are very very tight now under the communistic regime so um they met in Philippines and had a a great meeting time there and a reunion time um brother Murphy has a um a an outstanding warrant for his arrest in China because if he goes back there they will arrest him because of of printing and and distributing uh the the the Bible they have a Bible in the Chinese language there it is one that is approved by the government and it is leaves out much of the scripture because they don't want anybody talking about end time prophecies or anything to do with Resurrection or Rapture or nothing like that so they uh have a very limited edition of the Bible that they will allow and it's approved but if you have one that is not approved well then you uh can go to prison and some of the brothers did go to prison uh the pastors that I know that I even spoke for over there and and was with went to prison for some time spent three to four years in prison and said they would do it all over again for the Gospel of Jesus Christ amen so brother Murphy will be here the last Sunday and um he'll Minister for us and then Tuesday night on the 31st and um next Sunday we will have communion foot washing you say well what is all of that about well it's just remembering the Lord's death and uh also why we are inent here and that is to serve and these are ordinances that Jesus put in place this is something that we do now if you don't partake in that that's all right you can come to service and we'll we'll have service and then right after that we will have a little dismissal and and the rest can stay for the communion foot washing and then we'll have a wonderful time together with a fellowship meal here together so Zachariah 4:6 then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord under zerubabel now not going all over the scripture again but remember he had seen these seven lampstands and he wondered what it was and he said this is the word right so what he was seeing was the word in symbolic form but now it would have to be made known to him through through the angel of God to know what the meaning was so he says this is the word the Lord unto zerubabel saying nor by might nor by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord of hosts who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plain and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen God bless you you can be seated now today we're going to be speaking on bringing forth The Headstone and and there are things that I want to look at again as we examine this prophecy of Zachariah because it is the story of restoration and worship uh of worship and the rebuilding of the temple and of Jerusalem and of course um Jerusalem is a type of the bride of Christ who's called the New Jerusalem so you know the the small picture is what um zerubba would be able to see as it was explained to him by Zachariah um it was just the the small picture but it was a much larger thing than God that God was doing and that was of course to uh bring a restoration even of his body the Bride of Jesus Christ and he here in zachariah's Prophecy it describes the restoration as an impossible Mountain to move but zerubabel is assured that the mountain would be moved by God's spirit and that he would bring forth the finishing stone or The Headstone so cap C capture on that thought finishing Stone was shoutings of Grace Grace of course you know it would not be by man's might or by by Man's power but he said by my spirit sayeth the Lord and it would be the grace of God that would bring it down now we are also in an hour of restoration it's the end of the world and it is Harvest time and it is a also time for the finishing Stone now at harvest the original seed that was planted and went through its stages of growth it goes back to seed again and thus it is the head of the plant so in its own way the grain or the seed is The Headstone it is also the foundation stone so we know that the headstone of course is of the church is Christ and he is the foundation of which we are built upon and then of course the finishing Stone will be the return of Christ and so even as a seed goes from planting to Decay and through the cycle of Life coming up as a blade and and from there in the developmental stages of growth of tsel and husk and finally the seed of again even so the churches went from one Harvest cycle at Pentecost where the Harvest is celebrated to the planting and through the growth cycle until we come back to the final Harvest cycle and bring forth the head of the plant the seed again now the and God's Great Harvest cycle begins right after the Passover and this is the way it was in ancient Israel and even so after the true Passover where Jesus became the lamb um began the Harvest cycle and in Jesus day there was a harvest of the Old Testament Church with the promise given of a harvest of the Gentile Church which would be marked 7 weeks later and would be at Pentecost and and this would be the celebration of the of the finishing of the seven weeks between the Passover and um and and the the final Harvest there at Pentecost so seven weeks would be marked from the Passover all the way to Pentecost and of course it is the type of the seven Church agent are the seven golden lampstands are the seven churches in the Book of Revelation chap 1 which was symbolic representing Seven Ages and and for Israel they were to bring forth the first fruits or they were to bring the first fruits of their Harvest and they were to wave it before the Lord as a testimony of his goodness in Leviticus 23:10 he said speak to the children of Israel and say say unto them when you are come to the land which I give unto you and shall reap the this Harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheath of the the first fruits of your Harvest unto the priest and he shall wave it before the Sheep before the Lord to be accepted for you on the tomorrow after the Sabbath shall the priest wave it and how fitting it is today to think about this how that Jesus was not only the Passover Lamb himself but and thus he was a kinsman redeemer but also he was the first fruit of the Old Testament to raise from the dead thus being the first fruit of the resurrection and the Apostle Paul recognizes the significance of this when he says in 1 Corinthians 15:20 but now Christ is risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept that's right so Jesus um W would be the first fruits of those that SLE and I want you to think and bear in mind and connect the the thoughts now the first fruits is the head or the first of the Harvest and it's and its own way this correlates with um W with what he says when he shall bring forth The Headstone the finishing stones with shoutings of Grace Grace into it now in the in ancient Israel and probably even today maybe they have different crops there now but in ancient Israel there were two major grain crops that were harvested the first of these was The Barley Harvest and then the other of course would be the wheat Harvest these were the two major agricultur crops and the Jewish Church Church represented the barley Harvest because the barley is the first to come to harvest and through their long growth from Adam The Original Seed where like a seed he died and and Abraham through Moses and law and the law and through the Kings and then through the prophets until finally the head of all of it came Jesus the King of Kings amen Jesus the greatest and a and the head of all the prophets Jesus not just the law but the lawgiver himself the word made flesh now and so Israel was required to bring a sheep of the first fruits before God to be waved and lifted up before the people thanking God for the Harvest before they could take uh partake of the crop and the the Feast of the first fruits would begin the day after the Passover celebrating the Harvest Time and from Adam only onward Jesus was the first of the Old Testament Harvest to come to maturity and with him came many other Saints if you look with me to Matthew chap 27 and verse 51 this is sometimes glossed over and missed but it says and the behold the veil of the temple was rent in Twain from top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent now stop for a minute and let's think about it here the temple was and and the veil of the temple is ran open showing there was no God in the old worship that's right he was now hanging on a cross amen now here he was and and God was showing now the veil was broken and a way made by him in order to bring you into the presence of God no no longer were you being kept out but now you are invited in aren't you glad for that amen the veil is no longer to keep you out the veil is the door in Jesus said I am the door I am the way I am the truth and I'm the life and notice and the graves were opened and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many oh my what a what a wonderful time that must have been amen look what happened there look look what was happening The Barley Harvest of the Old Testament Saints was now fully ripe and and ready ready to be harvested and on the first day of the week on Sunday morning tomorrow after the Sabbath as the priest as the the Jewish priests were were going through the motions of bringing the first fruits of the barley Harvest to be waved God as a high priest raised up Jesus Christ the first fruits of the resurrection and the spirit took and waved him and he broke through the tomb and he ascended on high and with him came the redeemed of all the Old Testament and they Rose and appeared to many the waving of the sheath what a wonderful thing that is now Isaiah made a prophecy and he said in Isaiah 28 and6 therefore thus sayith the Lord behold I lay in Zion Zion is another word for Jerusalem I lay in Zion for a foundation a stone a trag Stone a precious stone a sure foundation and he that believeth in me shall not make haste or be confounded amen so he he is the one who ties it all together you see all of the Old Testament Saints they they and everything in the scripture was prophesying one day the head of all of this will come that's right it's just like the blade coming up I'm not the I'm not the Great but there's one coming after me and it comes another and here comes the the the husk and I'm not the grain but there's one coming after me you see they were pointing to and prophesying of it and so Jesus was he was the Psalms of David he was the wisdom of Solomon he was the law of the prophets amen he was the prophecy of the prophet he was the word made manifest all of the word of the Old Testament was encapsulated in Jesus Christ hallelujah what a mighty God we have and we serve today to realize that all that Jesus was the Fulfillment of the Old Testament not in the sense that that does is no longer pertinent to us but he fulfilled the types and the shadows and he would he he he would now be the the very sacrifice the very lamb that was promised so he's the one who ties it all together he's the one the builders in Jesus time the Pharisees and the Sadducees rejected now let me tell you it's going to happen again in the last days and I I tell you why because the Bible said all the world will wonder after the Beast and His Image and they will all worship him so you see this is how all ends up is with the with the Cornerstone or The Headstone being rejected because even as it was rejected in that day so will the word in this day be crucified and rejected mocked and made shame now Psalms chapter 118 and verse 22 David now prophesying by the spirit and he says the stone which the builders refuse it has become The Headstone of the corner this is the Lord's doing and it's marvelous in our eyes Hallelujah this is the day which the Lord has made we will be glad and rejoice in it so it's a day of rejoicing amen when when we see that the the stone the stone the builders rejected the very word that they condemned has they refused and and the now has become The Headstone of the corner amen it's the Lord's doing and it brings about rejoicing now Israel with their Great Law and their Halls of learning and their scribes their Pharisees their rabbis or lawyers the the Sadducees as well who were all theologians yeah none of them could bring forth The Headstone and when he came they rejected him oh they were the scholars but they said oh he can't be it it's impossible so when you look at Romans 9:31 Paul tells us that Israel which followed after the law of righteousness had not attained to the law of righteousness wherefore because they sought it not by faith but as it were by works of the laws you see for they stumbled at that stumbling Stone as it is written behold I lay in Zion a stumbling stone and a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed so if you if you look here in the scripture this is what he said they they had the law of righteousness and they followed after it but they did it you know just as works it was it was only works it was never by by faith it was never by Revelation faith is a revelation so you see they they tried it by their works of You Know M that was going to keep everything just perfect and do everything just perfectly and if you didn't well then you received the penalty of of the law and and everybody's watching to make sure you didn't even do as much as pluck corn on the Sabbath day and Paul said they didn't attain with all their efforts they did not attain because they sought it not by faith it didn't come by Revelation you see that's the only way you can know Christ is by Revelation and he said they stumbled at The Stumbling Stone as it is written I lay in Zion a stumbling Stone a rock of offense and whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed but the day when he Resurrection Jesus proved that he was a keystone to the Old Testament Church he was the finishing Stone and when he connected and tie to every scripture and fulfilled the Old Testaments the Saints rose with him in that Great Harvest Time that was a wonderful wonderful time of harvest don't you agree amen but in this lays a prophecy because God wasn't through harvesting he was going to get a people for his name's sake all through the Old Testament you would see that he would not only call Israel and make them his chosen people but he' also say I'm going to pour out my spirit on the Gentiles he began to give a little clues about what he would do because he wanted to be more than the god of the Jews he wanted to be the god of his people God so love the world so that day he rose he rose from the dead he proved he was the Keystone and the Saints rose with him in that Great Harvest Time and so it was prophesying that one day in another Harvest cycle that there will come a first fruit and the spirit will lift them up and wave them over the rest and there will be a resurrection of all the dead in Christ of the New Testament who will rise and Ascend together with the living and meet the Lord in the air now so first was The Barley Harvest seven weeks later was the wheed Harvest and The Barley represented the Jewish dispensation and the wheat represents the Gentile dispensation and and that disp that that Gentile dispensation would mature 7 weeks later and and have its celebration at Pentecost and and of course as I've been saying that types seven Church ages from the Passover Lamb of 2,000 years ago we have marked now seven weeks seven Church ages until we are now in another Harvest Time what a wonderful hour to be in it's a time of Plenty it's a time of Celebration Pentecost is a Greek word meaning 50 which was a which was the celebration of the Harvest it was 49 days at seven days in a week s weeks 7 7 49 on the 50th day Pentecost also known by the Jews today as shabat which is a thanksgiv given for the first fruits of the wheat Harvest and it it marked it marks the end of the wheat Harvest that all that we've been waiting on all the years of growth all the time since the seed was planted 2,000 years ago it's all coming to maturity now that's Hallelujah there it's a time of harvest and the Bible said Jesus explained the parable of the Harvest and he said the Harvest is the end of the world and the angels are the Reapers now the first Pentecost was established around the harvest season indicating God's plan to harvest people from every tribe in his kingdom so after the Passover where Jesus became the sacrificial lamb there started the countdown of the weeks one week two weeks three weeks four weeks down of the weeks until the day of Pentecost as I as I reiterate representing seven Church ages from Calvary now far from the Passover started the countdown and and it would go all the way to the day of Pentecost and when the day of Pentecost was fully come there God their God again waved over the people in the upper room the Holy Spirit and they were the first I want you to get the word first we're talking about first fruits amen they were the first of Adam's race who rose from the dead by being born again amen born of the word like they should have been at the beginning can you imagine what God was doing here for the first fruits of his resurrection would be on Pentecost yeah now we're not talking about from the dead that Jesus did that but we're talking about those who had died with Adam because of Adam's sin and we were born into death and for the first time listen even the disciples walked with Jesus and they worked miracles and did signs they did wonders and they believed on the Lord and and they they were they were Sanctified is he said I you're Sanctified through the words I speak and and all of this but he comes down to Pentecost and the for the first time ever sir men and women were born again amen the spirit of God descending come down like a rushing Mighty Wind a waving fire over a congregation and God waving over and took them as a first fruit that's right and he and when he takes the first fruit he is declaring every other one is going to come to maturity just like this one every other child of God that comes is going to get the Holy Ghost just like they got it Hallelujah now Adam we know brought us into a place of death but when the spirit of Jesus the Holy Ghost took up those raised up those first fruits in Acts two and raised them up out of sin's trespasses listen listen what did what happened at Pentecost God took a a Lon betraying Peter a cursing a cursing Peter come on somebody you read your Bible took that man there that was just a a a liar he was a a betrayer amen he was a a a deceiver all of these things cursing Peter and he took him and he transformed him right in the LA of God in his life and made him a Son of God I tell you that's what the new birth does to a person it takes the old life away and behold you are a new creation you look nothing like what you did in the past amen but you have been made a new in Christ Jesus Hallelujah so he took them on the day of Pentecost and lifted them up into life exalted those first fruits of the Harvest and waved them signifying there are more to come amen and I know there's more to come because I'm one of them to come Hallelujah amen it was a wave of the Holy Ghost it came like a sound from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and the first time ever men born by sexual birth born in sin were filled with the spirit oh you say well brother Tim John was filled from his mother's womb and there were others in the Old Testament filled with the spirit not like this the Bible is clear about this when he talks about how that it would come in a new way not as an anointing upon the person not as something that just gets upon the spirit of a man and he prophesies but something that changes the nature amen he he speaks of it and and he says if any man thirst let him come to me and drink and out of his belly shall flow shall flow rivers of living water out of his innermost being shall flow Rivers of Life Giving water this he spoke of the spirit which they had not yet received for it was not yet given now this is and I'm quoting you Bible when I talk when I'm speaking that so those was at Pentecost were a first fruit the first resurrected out of sin and death the first time that God tabernacled sinful man man now God had tabernacled a man before but he wasn't sinful that was Jesus born of the Virgin and God had come in Tabernacle to him but now through the shedding of the blood through the cleansing at Calvary he had so cleansed vessels that God could come and dwell in them you see as long as sin nature is in your life God can't come and dwell there that's why there always has to be a Dy out of the old man before a new one can be born you see God and Satan cannot rule in your heart at the same time you cannot love two masters you cannot serve two masters you will love one and hate the other the Bible said amen so therefore again as we're looking at this we know that Satan has to be th deth in the life and that's what real conversion is it is the dethroning and the casting out of Satan so Mark 16 said in my name they shall cast out devils and of course this is the worst of kind that of sin now those at Pentecost they were a first fruit they were the first resurrected but they Pentecost of 2,000 years ago and this is what I want to get to you for us to see because you know if we're not careful we keep the Bible as something historical something that happened 200000 years ago something that God did back then and and somehow another you know it was then but not now but let me let me just uh tell you that they at Pentecost when they staggered out of the upper room under the influence of the Holy Ghost drunk or intoxicated with something they were calling new wine amen lives that were changed amen a lying curs Peter there changed amen changed there and now preaching the gospel and men and women giv glory to God in every language they were only typing they were only foreshadowing they were only prophesying of the end where once again at the final Harvest by the pouring out of God's spirit he will bring a bride Harvest people to maturity and wave them as the first fruits of the Harvest Hallelujah and why this is so wonderful is because just like as Jesus was the first fruit and brought with him the dead of the Old Testament this bride being the first fruits will bring with him the resurrection of all Seven Ages so let me recap for a moment so from the waving of the first fruits of the barley Harvest of the Old Testament Saints with Jesus Christ being the the first fruit of them that slept we begin to count down seven weeks representing 2,000 years of Gentile Church ages these are signified with seven golden lampstands this is the word of God it is shown symbolically in the Book of Revelation now remember the Book of Revelation is a is a book about end time and it is written in symbols because it's not until the end time is it supposed to be made known so because God will hold them blind in other ages making each one of them think that they were the ones who the Lord was coming for and he would hold it blind to the to each one of them because if they had known there had would be 2,000 more years or 1,500 more years or 700 more years or 300 more years they would have just been slothful Satan had done a lot damage with it that's right but God doesn't want you to know the day and hour of his coming we know it we do know it we know the exact day and hour we know the exact hour anyway of his coming is the hour you think not right that's when he'll come even naturally your death you don't know when it's going to be I I've said a lot of times you know when when when when I'm interrupted by somebody dying I said you know they they wasn't very C ious he could have given me a notice I'd like to have been able to mark it on my calendar made plans for this event but they just dropped it in suddenly because nobody knows and nobody's going to know when the Lord's coming but he come in the hour you think not so now but here again we can know by the signs around us and know by the scripture where we're at right that we are in the end time cycle that this is certainly a harvest season we can see the Bible said in Luke 17:30 as it was in the days of lot in the days of lot Sodom was known for his sodomites amen and there there they they they were was a righteous man by the name of lot who who whose Soul was vexed daily because of the evil amen so you see as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the revealing of the son of man so here we are again in the days of lot we can see just before the fire burns and remember this is the next judgment somebody help me preach now amen first he baptized it with water in the days of Noah second he put his blood upon it and Sanctified the Earth with his blood 2,000 years ago and then finally what will he do he will burn it with fire so we know the next judgment and what an age we're living in where man has the power to destroy this Earth many times over never has there been a generation that's come to this hour and we're closer now to midnight than ever right now here now is where the day of Pentecost is fully come here's now is the Gentile Harvest The Barley Harvest is all complete for it's come to his head with Jesus and all the saints resurrected and raptured and now in this day in this day the the Gentile dispensation comes to the Harvest Time and the seven weeks are now completed the seventh Church age is at its end and it finally wipes winds up with the coming of The Headstone Christ who will be who will come in the literal physical form and that is the summit that is The Headstone that Grace is bringing it was grace that brought a savior 2,000 years ago and it's Grace that brings back the Savior to Rapture of Bride in the last day but first there is a spiritual forerunning of that literal event what literal event the second coming there has to be a spiritual forerunning of that to have a Rapture there has to be a people brought out of the tombs of religion and religious sin and unbelief and dead Works amen there has to come and there has to be a voice of God to call us out of Babylon remember in the in in zachariah's day they had they had been urged by the spirit it was something you know even Nehemiah he could not do anything but weep because as he thought about Jerusalem and the need for restoration and they become a drive in their hearts 70 years had passed since they had been taken Exile and they had now their homes in Babylon they were they had their their um IND Ministry there the synagogues and everything there was in Babylon but there was something in the hearts of men and women began to yearn I want to go home I don't know how you feel this morning but that ought to be the desire of every heart today amen I want to leave this Babylon I want to go home I want to go back to the promised land where we belong we don't belong here so there's this first spiritual forerunning of the literal event where we will know see Christ as we meet him in the air and to have a Rapture there has to be a people as as it brought out the tombs of religion of sin dead works and the call is come out of Babylon so let's go to Revelation chapter 18 and verse one and I'm going to show you in the prophecy after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lighten with his glory so here comes a messenger and his earth the earth is lightened with his glory and he cries mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the greatest Fallen is fallen and has become the habitation of devil the hold of every false Spirit the cage of every unclean and hateful bird think about that this is this becomes the state of even religion to today the hold whereever foul Spirit comes together why you talking like that because too many people have religion and are never changed and they sit in the church or come to the church and yet and still with every kind of sin in their lives unbelief that has never been repented of and and they continue right on in their sins right brother the gospel is about changing your life amen not not ex you know we've sang the song Just as I am until we think that God's going to accept us that way and leave us that way no God will allow you to come just the way you are don't you don't have to clean yourself up to come amen but you do have to repent he'll clean you up am man you know sometimes I I I look and I see people that I know their lives are in sybles and I don't worry about cleaning them up I know that the gospel going forth and power will clean that life I don't have to do it I don't have to reform them it'll come by a new birth and they'll be changed so he's here he says come out of her my people look at look at verse um three now and it said for all nations have drunk of the the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the earth committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are wax Rich through the abundance of her dely and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not out of her plag for her sins have reached to heaven and God has remembered her iniquities and from there she'll be cast into tribulation and there are the plagues poured out upon her this is this is Mr Babin now come out of come out and go where back to the Homeland come on come back to the homeland of the Bible back to where the book is unsealed and opened back to where the truths are no longer a mystery yeah or some forgotten beatitude amen but but where the word has been unsealed and open now the work of redemption is in a three-fold manner now I won't be able to talk about them all today but I want to get to just kind of give you an overview because it is the work of redemption is completed in a three-fold manner the The Headstone must come to each each one of them must have a headstone Stone now first there has to be the finishing stone that is the capping off of the mysteries of God that restores the church to back it was what it was before it went down to Babylon now all you have to do is study church history and you will know that from from uh from the um book of Acts and that early church that there came a dispersal and and so there there was the a dispora as it was where they were dispersed and now there here it they go out down into Babylon they're out of the homeland of the Bible and so again down there you know they they're in among the Nations and you will find them in all nations whether it's the denomination of Catholicism or the denominations of protestantism doesn't matter the name of it they they're all down in Babylon scattered among the Nations and so Against All Odds and incredible as it may seem and as insurmountable as the mountain is for is sealed and I'm talking about the mysteries of God sealed with seven Thunders and no Theologian can guess accurately what they are so it will not be by man's might nor by his power but by my spirit sayith the Lord and it will require a prophet and is One Promise yes at the end of the Old Testament God promis a time of restoration he tells us before the world Burns as an oven and the righteous walk out on the ashes of the wicked before that coming behold I'm going to send to you Elijah the prophet amen Elijah was a restorer amen he would build up the temples uh the the old Altar and and he would bring him to a showdown on Mount Carmel and he would build up the old altar Gathering the stones and neglected stones and would place them back in together and make a place of worship and then put the sacrifice the Lamb on top of it and then God would send the fire down so you see Elijah is a restoring prophet and God promises in the last day he will send one the spirit and the power of Elijah a forerunner of the coming word and power one like Elijah who restored Israel uh from Jezebel and called them out to be to come out of her and the curses came down upon ahab's Kingdom and brought them back to the true worship of Jehovah so that is the first thing God will finish the Mysteries so second The Headstone of Salvation now this is the second one we want to talk about for you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost but what God good is a building without God in it you are to be the dwelling place of God but I wonder if if the veil is open and see on the inside of many Christians is there any God there this is really important God must be there it's one thing to be a religious Temple it's one thing to have a facade and a sign upon you but it's another thing for God to dwell on the inside so you are the Temple of the Holy Ghost and look the church is the temple of the Holy Ghost and and some parts may have been restored to Luther and Wesley more power in isus the street but it comes in our day where the finishing stone is brought forth the fullness of the spirit poured out not simply justified by faith or not simply Sanctified by Grace or not just empowered by the spirit but the person of Christ himself Christ must be The Headstone of every man woman boy or girl amen he is the stone that the builders dis allowed but to us he is precious Hallelujah and when he comes in the light it comes with much rejoicing Hallelujah because it's Grace Grace coming down on the life when God caps you off with the finishing Stone of the Holy Ghost and there may be mountains of sin in your life and mountains of unbelief there but I'll Tell You by my spirit sayith the Lord that mountain will be removed and The Headstone will come crying Grace Grace third Redemption is not finished without bringing the headstone Jesus Christ and a literal physical body with the meeting in the air that is the hope of the ages now but first the original and fullness of the word has to come down in order to bring the fullness of the spirit and power now surely you can see what we're talking about this morning cuz for the first time for the bright age for Resurrection out of dark denominationalism is a message that the full maturity of the word has returned back in power and is being waved over the people again by the same signs and wonders that he did there because I live ye shall live also that's what he said to his wife the bride amen what a resurrection that was but what a resurrection this is amen not only that let me tell you you you you know Christ is no more in the Tomb and he cannot be sealed there no matter what you do and his bride cannot be sealed in the tombs of religion come on somebody amen you broke out of a Baptist tomb a Methodist tomb a Catholic tomb or whatever but you broke out of that broke the seals of death and we are not any longer dead but we are alive forever more and we not go back to be in another denomination again a work of man cuz God never ordained one of them amen so he was waved to him the word to them the word which he was waved to them on the day of Pentecost the word made manifest I want you to get it the word was waved on the day of Pentecost and the Word was Spirit and the same holy ghost that came in Acts 2 is poured out again in the evening time Harvest of the Gentile dispensation Joel chapter 2 says in the last days I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh this is shown also in Revelation 10 you see God had a mature elect bride in the beginning there in Acts he must have a mature m Bride In the End she goes from as the wheat plant from seed to seed both were Harvest times the Alpha and Omega bride now if you look with me in Mark 4 verse 26 and Jesus says now the kingdom of God and so let me just translate that for you so is the Holy Ghost so is the kingdom of God so is the Holy Ghost somebody help me now get your thinking caps on because the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost it's where God is King if the kingdom comes in your heart in life that's where Jesus is Lord where God is King somebody help me preach and so is the kingdom of God so is the Holy Ghost here in the realm of the Holy Ghost as is as a man should cast seed into the ground and he should sleep and Rise day and night and the seed should spring up and grow up and he knoweth not how but the Earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear and after that the full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because the Harvest has come so Jesus tells us right here this is what the Holy Ghost the kingdom of the Holy Ghost ghost is going to do it's going to be as a man planting a seed I'm in this in this dispensation of the Holy goes I'm going to plant a seed and as men sleep one generation dies and another comes and another generation dies and another comes as men sleep and Rise day and night the seed Will Spring forth and it will grow it's going to start heading back to to coming back to the head again to The Headstone to the Grain and then he said it will come first the blade and then the ear and then after that the full corn in the ear and when the fruit is brought forth immediately he put it in the sickle because the Harvest has come and the the putting in the sickle is the rapture that's right now so he says okay so what's going to happen Jesus said I'm going to plant a seed I'm going to start with the seed and I'm going to end with the seed I will have Alpha and I will have omega now in between is going to be a growth period it's going to die it'll rot it'll lose it it's what it had it'll go down into Darkness but it's going to come up and when it comes up it's going to go through stages of growth and there will be again and he brings forth the blade and then the ear which is the chaff or the Shu and then the full corn in the ear and when I get to the full corn when it comes back to grain again there's going to be a rapture Hallelujah thus Revelation chapter 10 is our Pentecost it is the coming of Christ the Holy Ghost returning in power not a portion but the fullness of the spirit let me this just for reference give me Revelation chap 10 verse one we'll read a couple of verses of it Revelation 10 verse1 I I I want you to see because remember this is a symbolic book so it it is written there it is written with in parabolic form and and it's but because it's it's left there to for people of other ages not to get not to understand until you come to the end time and he said and I saw another Mighty Angel notice this is a messenger Angel is a messenger I saw another mighty the angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud Jesus said behold I come with clouds clothed with a cloud and Let Me Tell You Through the Ages he has been clouded over and Through the Ages we've only looked at him through the as I said through the lattice through the tipes and look he was clothed with the cloud a rainbow was up on his head and a rain is symbolic of the full Covenant with the seven colors of the rainbow amen it wasn't it wasn't to represent the the LGBT movement it was it was the rainbow was up on his head amen it is the Covenant of God the Covenant Angel the angel of the Covenant it is Christ himself no not Jesus not the physical body but the spirit of Jesus Amen coming down and he his own messenger look and a rainbow is up on his head and his face was as the sun full light no Darkness I want you to get it it's the word coming in power that's right it's the word coming with no shadow over it it's the Mysteries revealed and his feet was as pillars of fire and there's only one place in the Bible where that is where it speaks about his feet and his feet the Bible said is a church he had put all things he made him to be head of the church and put all things under his feet which is his body the church that fth all and all and there on the day of Pentecost we didn't see a pillar of fire there's a pillar of fire in a burning bush there was a pillar of fire leading Egypt but there on that day of Pentecost he was not a pillar of fire but God divided himself as pillars of fire amen the lick of fire was was given birth offsprings of himself sons of God being born out of the same Light Of Glory the same power the same Holy Spirit and his feet were where he touches the Earth where he walks today is in a body called a bride amen and they are as pillars of fire they are God In Action upon the [Applause] Earth pillars of fire give me the next verse and he had in his hand not a closed book it was closed in Revelation 5 but in Revelation 10 he been opened seals removed Mysteries revealed and he had in his hand a book open and he sets his foot upon the land and on the sea upon the sea and his left foot on the earth now I want you to get this for a minute because what you are seeing in Revelation 10 is a symbol IC representation of the descending of the spirit in the end time bringing the Holy Ghost in his fullness say both word and spirit as it was at Pentecost so let me stop just a minute and look at this give me that verse before verse two he had in his hand a little book open and he set his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the Earth this is not a two mile high Jesus this is not some huge gigantic God this is symbolic of what he is doing footsteps are possession if everything is under his feet I want you to understand every devil is under your feet even if you're just a skin even if the bottom of the bottom of his feet if you're part of the body this morning every devil every spirit is under your feet and here in the Bible there was those those was a beast that rose up out of the sea well the Bible's clear rose up out of the water he said it was multitudes Nations tongues and people amen it was a populous place it rose up you can read the Bible it describes it as a a city that sits on Seven Hills it's a Beast with with with with with seven um that with seven horns and all all of these symbologies there is describing it describes it and it only even describes the one writing on her on it is a woman a prostitute why in the world are we talking about prostitutes in the Book of Revelation because a church prostituted the word and gave over to m other men rather than Christ himself and they made daughters like them so she's a mother of harlots yes and I want you to look here there's this power a beast is a power it rises out of the sea out of there comes Rome with all her catechisms her misinterpretations of the scripture I'm not talking about Catholic people they're good Catholic people there are nice wonderful Catholic people we're not talking about that we're talking about the system are you with me amen I'm not I'm not disparaging any of them I'm talking about the system amen but look I want you to know he did what he put your foot on the very head of the Beast itself rising up out of the sea amen and let me tell you you're no longer affected by the power of Rome you no longer worship her Pope you no longer bow to her her goddess to Mary you know no longer come on Church you no longer are are have her patron saints you no longer worship the dead you no longer pray to Spirits you know who God is why God put your foot on the very doctrines of Rome and gave you possession but what about our the land well out of the land is where there is no people which was America and God is also giv you power over the American Spirit listen you do not have to bow to the gods of Hollywood come on Amen America's gods are not our God Amen her Idols are not don't belong to us we worship none of them Idols why because by the Holy Spirit he has give you power yeah To Tread on serpents and scorpions and nothing shall by any means harm you amen so he put his his right foot on the sea his left foot upon the earth and the next verse and he cried with a loud voice he shouted and this is a part of his coming in the last day for he descends from heaven with a shout and when in his shout seven Thunders uttered their voices now what we are seeing in Revelation 10 is symbolic representation of the descending of the holy spirit that happens at the end time and I want you to understand it brings the holy spirit in fullness is both word and spirit as it was at Pentecost now let me declare plainly it to your ears today that the word that Paul preached came as a direct came as a result of a direct outpouring of the spirit of Truth at Pentecost now so out of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit the word came through a prophet now let me tell you again and reassure you what came down at Pentecost was the cleared deed the open book it was not sealed now this is where the confusion comes because you get over here in Revelation and it's sealed well you know that must have been sealed in Paul's day well then why are we going back to the original and preaching what Paul preached when when the book was sealed it wasn't sealed to Paul it was an open book now Paul made some declarations I'm going to go through this for the next half an hour so hold on your seats Paul made some declaration and he says now in first Thessalonians 15 Our Gospel came not into you in word only now you said I'm bringing you word I'm bringing you word I'm teaching you predestination security of the believer I'm teaching you uh you know about about all of the different things separating law From Grace I'm doing all of this but I said Our Gospel didn't come to you just in word only it wasn't just a Doctrine but also in power yeah so where's he pointing back to Pentecost amen and then the Holy Ghost and with much Assurance as you might know what manner of men we were among you for your sakes now he tell you in 1 Corinthians 2 and 4 he said and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in demonstration of the spirit and power he wanted them to see the word is not just a a theory it's not a theology it's a power and he said that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of man but in the power of God how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor the the princes of this world but that that come to not but we speak wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our Glory look he said there were things God hid and God kept from the others but now you know has now God has ordained it that it would be revealed this hidden wisdom because there was hidden wisdom in Abraham's life there was hidden wisdom in Esther there was hidden wisdom in Ruth there was hidden wisdom in Solomon all of this was hidden wisdom of God that was written in the tipes and it was all symbology and the Jews ought took it as literal and so he said in verse 8 he said which none of the princes of this world known cuz it knew cuz that they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory it's it was such a dark time spiritually to the church world it was going into darkness the Jewish dispensation was dying their light was going out blindness was upon the people do you know it happens with the Gentiles in the same way and Le O TOA they prophesied to be blind but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither entered into the heart of man the things which God had prepared for them that love him you know he would say Abraham didn't realize it he didn't know he didn't understand what he was typing out he didn't understand abble did didn't know when he when he pulled up a w woolly lamb that there was coming another lamb of God he was just operating by Faith by Revelation he was told you know take a lamb offer its blood he didn't know that there would be thousands of years later the real lamb come right so he says he said I have not seen ear not heard they didn't know in other words they didn't know it never entered in the heart of man the things that God prepared for them that love you but God ha revealed them unto us this hidden wisdom this knowledge this understanding as he would separate Love From Grace God revealed them to us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God well sometimes today we want to come along and say well praise God in this message we got something new we got something different from old Paul bless God we're we're we're a lot better off than any other age let me tell you something you got something a little wrong there can be no other gospel this is where we got into the mess we're in is because we preached another Jesus and another gospel right there can be no other gospel God will judge the World by Jesus Christ as Paul said according to my gospel and that's Romans 21:16 put that up he's not going to he's not going to he's not going to judge the World by the Baptists the methodists the Presbyterian the Catholics or or even in light Tabernacle he will judge the World by Jesus Christ when he judges is the secrets of Man by Jesus Christ according to my gospel so everybody will be God to judge according to the gospel of Paul that Jesus he preached that's right now let's go on down a little further Galatians 1:10 for now do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if I that please men I should not be the servant of Christ said if I'm a man pleaser I'm not Christ servant that's true with every Pastor if he's a man pleaser he's not a servant of Christ but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached to me is not after man for I neither received it of man neither was I taught it but by the RO revelation of Jesus Christ amen now this is a really the definition of ever God called man amen I didn't receive it of man neither was I taught it but by revelation of Jesus Christ for you have heard in my conversation but means my past life in Times past the Jewish religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion among many of my equals in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my fathers he was really religious this was a great denominational God from the Pharisees representing their denomination well amen and was zealous don't don't mistake zealousness for the Holy Spirit that's right come on but watch when it please God you know said when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace you know that's when it happens to every person every person has that time in their life amen Jason tager you was raised on a church pew you went to church you heard the messages you would even say I believed it and all of that but whatever you got whatever you had wouldn't keep you and out in the world you went to every kind of sorted life right but when it pleased God that was a Divine appointment for your life amen when it pleased God who separated me from my mother's womb you know what happened when the word went forth the drugs went the alcohol went to Tobacco went it all went Hallelujah That's The Power of this Christ when it please God who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace to reveal K his son in me that I might preach him among the Heathen immediately immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood neither when I went up to Jerusalem to them which were Apostles before me but I went into Arabia and returned again under Damascus and after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days he's and he's just showing he said I got this what I received I didn't get it from man I'm not even preaching what Peter told me to preach it was revealed to me and he said another the other Apostles I saw none say James the Lord's brother and these things which I WR un you behold before God I lie not afterwards I'll come into the regions of Syria Andia and and there was a known by face and to the churches of Judea which were in um Christ but they had they had heard only that he which persecuted Us in past times now preaches of Faith which he once destroyed and they glorified god in me so he said I didn't get this I got this from the outpouring of the spirit what happened at Pentecost came into me and when it came into me it revealed the word now you you might protest but the book of The Plan of Redemption has been hid and sealed up from since the foundational world and and I just say that's a valid point the Old Testaments would get prophets they would get a glimpse of it and they would prophesy of it but yet it was not made known you know I've often thought about that day when when Isaiah was prophesying by the spirit and they the man wanted to the king wanted a sign to know that he was to do a certain certain thing it comes out of his mouth he comes rolling out I'll give you a sign as he gets under the inspiration I'll give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son what a a virgin someone that don't know a man will conceive and you know that doesn't know a man what come on I I imagine he want to step those words back in his mouth but God had taken him over and he began to prophesy of a sign that the Israel would look for that would happen 700 years later I want you to see this they get a glimpse so they prophesy he'll come to a virgin it be a son is given his name will be called wonderful counselor he'll be the Mighty God the Prince of Peace he'll be the Everlasting father of his government and his rule there be no end that's Isaiah 9 and6 so he see so the Old Testament prophets would get a glimpse of him but I want you to look um in Romans 16:25 now to him that is a power to establish you according to my gospel watch how Paul does it my gospel that's the way we ought to look at the word is mine and Paul said this is my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret since the world began I am preaching to you things that were secret that none of the other ages knew that had they known it this wisdom they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory but look here I am preaching to you the revelation of the mystery which was Kept Secret yes sir yes since the world began so Paul is preaching secrets that had been kept or shall I use the word sealed from other ages but I want you to look but is now made manifest and by the scriptures of prophet and according to the Commandment of the Everlasting God made known to All Nations for The Obedience of Faith so now it's made known what was Kept Secret we're making it known this is what I'm preaching this is Pentecostal preaching hallelujah amen this is Pentecostal preaching Pentecostal preaching is making known the Mysteries Ephesians 1 and verse 7 in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom oh Bountiful Bountiful toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he purposed in himself so here again this was the will and testament of God he was making known his will according to his good pleasure let's go to ver chapter 3 and verse two of Ephesians if you heard the dispensation of the grace of God which is given to me given me to you word how that by Revelation he ha made known unto me the mystery I got this by Revelation the mystery watch as I wrote in a before in a few words whereby when you read you may understand mind acknowledge the mystery of Christ the mystery of Christ my knowledge of the mystery that which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of man as now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit the spirit that came down on Pentecost was word in power that's right and we saw the display of his power as it changed man but as it changed man it brought forth the word it unfolded the Mysteries that the Gentiles would be should be fellow ARS in the same body of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel it was not made known in other ages that Gentiles would even have a part although it was typed in the scripture come on it was typed in the Scripture it was prophesied in the scripture Joseph when he's away from his brethren in Exile amen been sold for almost 30 pieces of silver cast to a pit thought he was dead lifting him up and put him there went to the right hand of pharaoh but amen while he was there he got a what a gentile bride then he reveals himself to his Brethren again the Jew news which will be happened after the during the tribulation period don't you see how it all works amen it's written in every type of the Bible it's written in the scriptures it's prophesied but it wasn't not made known it was there in symbols in parabolic form so he said unto me who am the least of the Saints of All Saints is this Grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles the UNC spiritual Riches of Christ I'm preaching the riches of Christ and to make all men to see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from be from the beginning of the world has been hidden in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the attempt that now unto the principalities and powers in Heavenly places might be made known might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which his purpose in Christ Jesus our lord I'm trying to tell you Paul preached things from an open book let's go to Colossians 1:23 if you continue in the faith grounded settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and which was preached to every creature which is under Heaven whereof I Paul am made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is my is behind the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body sake which is the church whereof I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which was given to me for you to fulfill the word of God even the mystery which had been hid from ages and from generation but now is made manifest to the Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery of among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory oh Hallelujah who we preach warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus and if we have been brought back to what Paul preached this is what's happening things that have been kept secret from the foundation of the world that Paul was expounding to the alpha church now again revealed to the Omega Church so he would preach the mystery of godliness verse Timothy 3:16 without controversy without argument great is a mystery of God is God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on the world and on in the world and received up in the glory he would preach about the blindness of Israel and he would talk about that mystery of the blindness and he said Romans 11:25 but for I would not Brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise and your own conceit that blindness and parties happened to Israel until the fullness of the of the Gentiles has come in so he said they would be blind for a time until the fullness of the Gentiles do you realize where we're at we're Israel's back in their Homeland there's a nation of Israel now they have gathered right there why for the revealing of Christ to them but it can't happen until the fullness of the Gentiles come in and that's where we're at he would preach on the mystery of the Resurrection he would preach on the mystery of the Rapture he would say it happens in three phases he will descend with a with a shout with a voice with a trump he would say in 1 Corinthians 15:51 but behold I show you a mystery it wasn't known in other times come on church do you realize this is why the Sadducees didn't believe in a resurrection they really couldn't find any script scripture for it but I'll tell you it was a mystery it was hidden come on it was hidden in the scripture Hallelujah that even even as Abraham went up to the mountain and received his son as one raised from the dead that there would come a resurrection where God would show himself as Jehovah jyra the one who would provide a lamb it would be over and over and over I don't have time to go through all the types of it but prophesying of a resurrection but it was shadowed so he said it's a mystery and behold I'm going to show you a Myster we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed and the Rapture doesn't happen like a moment of twinkling of eye but you'll be changed next verse in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that's your change at the last Trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised Incorruptible and we shall be changed I'm telling you friends he was preaching the Rapture the resurrection he's preaching the fullness of the Gentiles when they reach their fullness the gospel's going to go back to them and he said always remember he said you're like the Wild Olive Olive Branch that was grafted in you're going to be cut off one day the Gentiles will be cut off God will take a Remnant a bride home and cut off the rest of them he would show in Ephesians 5: verse 22 all the way down through 32 and and where he would say in verse 32 about a woman and he take a woman he said Christ is the head of the church and the man as the man is the head of the woman and so on like that and how they should the the woman should be submissive to the man and he's the head of the house and all these other thing how he should love her as Christ loved the church and and he he takes and he describes all of this and he's showing it he said but this is a great mystery verse 32 this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ and the church not only that but he would tell us when it's given to us we are stewards of the Mysteries 1 Corinthians 4:1 let a man so account of us as Ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God Amen as Servants of Christ Ministers of Christ we have a responsibility to serve the mysteries of the Kingdom this is why that he said um in Ephesians 6:18 praying always with all prayer and supplications in the spirit watching there unto for the perseverance and supplication of All Saints and for me that an utterance may be given me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the Gospel he says in col Colossians 2 and 1 he says he he talks about it he said for I knew that you knew not what great conflict I have for you and for them at Leo deia for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto the all Riches of the fullness full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of the mystery of God and of the father and of Christ in whom are HID all Treasures of wisdom wisdom and knowledge then he asked for prayer in Colossians 4 and3 said pray for us that God would open to us a door of utterance to speak the mystery of Christ that'll be the prayer you pray forever Minister open the door of utterance allow them to speak of the mysteries of Christ look at it look again he would speak in 2 Thessalonians 2:7 he would speak of the mystery of iniquity amen the mystery of iniquity death already worked so he would say not only am I revealing you the mystery but the the Antichrist is already working and it's a it's the mystery of iniquity and so even the identity of the Antichrist the false Church her daughters would all be hidden and it would be a mystery so here Satan would be working undercover and as he kind Goes Forth he begins to close up the truths of the Bible and they become sealed with Seven Seals I'm telling you how the book got sealed and then he tells us in Galatians he warns us Galatians 1 and verse 6 I Marvel that you're so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Christ to another gospel he said already already in this early age the mystery of iniquity is being preached I me already some are being removed from him that called them into Grace to another gospel verse seven which is not another but there be some that would trouble you and would pervert the gospel so Paul is already showing you here he's working now the Antichrist he's starting to work and he's working undercover and what he's wanting to do is steal the truth from you and replace it with another gospel now he's not through watch as he says they would pervert the gospel it wouldn't be something totally different it' just be a perversion of it so he comes along in verse eight and he says but though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that what we have preached unto you let him be a cursed as we said before so I say again if any man preach another gospel unto you than what you have received let him him be accursed so the Antichrist was already there and the the apostles knew it if you'll go with me to first John 4 it's known now beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are going out in the world how be it hereby you know the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ Christ has come in the flesh is of God every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit the Antichrist you know here they they hardly are removed to the last Apostle and people already say it never happened and then he says what's now and this is that an that Spirit of antichrist which you heard that should come and even now already in is in the world so the Antichrist is already working in the church the spirit has been poured out but the Antichrist is working and he's bringing another gospel what's now 2 Corinthians 11:2 for I'm jealous over you with a Godly jealousy for I have a spoused you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ watch his wording look at what Revelation shows a great and Harlot daughters I'm jealous over you with Godly jealousy for I have a spouse you to one husband that I may present you as a Chase virgin to Christ but I fear I'm so afraid lest by any means just like the serpent begal Eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted the mind is the womb of the spirit so that your womb should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in Christ for he that cometh if he that cometh preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached are you receive another Spirit which you have not received or another gospel which you have not accepted you might well bear with him I'm afraid this is what you'll do you'll actually accept another Jesus you'll actually accept another gospel you actually will get another spirit that I did that God didn't give it would be an impersonation it would cause the church to stray and it did and she became the great whor go to Revelation 171 and there came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven bowls of judgment vials and talk with me sayth unto me come hither and I will show you the Judgment of the great horde that sth upon many Waters Waters is Nations kindreds tongues and people she rules over many with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication oh my can you can you imagine imagine this drunken you get somebody drunk they can't even see clear anymore they're looking over there and they're seeing three Gods instead of one amen the whole scripture becomes distorted because they become drunk oh we are to be drunk we're to be drunk on new wine the wine of the spirit of God that's why he said don't be drunk with wine worry in this sucess but be filled with the spirit get drunk on Jesus amen it speaks of them in the in the New Testament as being intoxicated with the word there is an in toxication that should thrill your soul that should make you doubt your doubts amen that make you see your enemy is defeatable come on church amen like the story of a little mouse one time that had been chased around and around by cat all his life and was tormented and everything one day they had a big party in that house and there was a big bowl of wine and here here that little that little mouse that little mouse you know fell over into the wine and as it was going down is drinking too much of it and after a while he gets totally emed and you know finally crawls out of there and and he shakes himself off and he's said now where's that cat come on you ever get filled with the power of God you look at the Devil and say now where is he he told me to submit myself to God resist the devil and he will flee from me amen this is what you look at the enemy you look at your troubl and you'll realize I can't overcome why because I'm empowered by the mighty angel I'm empowered by the Holy Ghost hallelujah look what he says now he said I'll show you this they're drunk on with the wine of her fornication the wine of her adulteries and he car carried me in the way of the spirit I saw a woman on a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy and I'll just tell you to call ourselves after anything then the name of Jesus is blasphemy names of blasphemy amen never never never in the Bible are we to take on the name of denomination or name of a church come on don't even say I belong to evening light Tabernacle say I belong to Jesus Christ amen there's no belonging evening like Tabernacle you can't sign our books amen you can't join our church but I tell you you can be born into the kingdom of God and everyone that's born in the kingdom of God is our brother and sister Hallelujah and the woman was AR raay and purple and Scarlet colors and Deck with gold and precious stones and pearls and having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness and fornication and on her name forehead was named mystery Babylon so Babylon is here in a mystery form so that's why there had to be a call come out of Babylon back into the Homeland so zerubu and Zachariah there they're not far off are they here they have come out of Babylon zable means one who has come out of Babylon and that's who we are one who's come out of Babylon Amen to do what restore the temple to bring forth The Headstone to bring forth the finishing Stone amen what's now now watch and the woman was drunken verse six verse six well let me start with verse five Mr Babylon the great the mother of Harlot she was a mother you know mother of harlots who go right back and do the same thing Mama did taking seeds of man instead of the word of God and I saw the woman and she's drunk with the blood of the Saints and the blood of the martyrs of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration this woman is a church if the if the if the true church is a woman the wife of Christ This is a woman who started out a virgin pledged pledged to Christ and committed adultery taking in other seeds and bringing forth children you see that's why we don't want to just be another and that's why we don't want a bunch of little Tim puits running around we want not not people born of man we want them born of God watch Jude 1 and three beh beloved I give you diligence to write to you of the common salvation as it's needful to write into you in order and exort you to earnestly contend to for the faith that was once delivered to this age we're already losing it and I want you to contend for it fight for it for why there are certain men crept in unawares who before of old were ordained to this uh condemnation ungodly man turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness into license to sin live any other way you want to and the grace of God is going to cover you and denying the only Lord Jesus Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ and slowly the book and his truths became closed and sealed with Seven Seals and when the first one was open who was it that had sealed it up not God he don't close his word up from you but Satan Revelation 61 and when and I saw the lamb open one of the seals I heard as it was the noise of thunder and one of the four Beast said come and see and I saw and behold a white horse and him that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer so it started out as a spirit and be remember he it it came and well look and then a crown was given him because you can't Crown a spirit but when it becomes a pope it can be crowned and so it started out as a nickan spirit which the Bible which which means conquer the Ley it was the enemy coming in to conquer the church and subdue it and make it subservient amen come on but well look he starts out his un Nicola and spirit in the church and he's a spirit you can't Crown a spirit but 300 years later he becomes a pope and you can crown him now and under that she becomes drunk with the blood of the Saints until the fox's book of martyrology will show you 68 million down to the ages that's still has not been repented of here we come right down you see it began to start was kind of a saying then it became a Doctrine and next age it became crowned and so it comes right down and we look in Revelation 2 and 4 in the first church age nevertheless I have somewhat against you because thou H has left thy First Love here's my problem with you you're supposed to be my wife the church but you're already leaving your first love remember therefore from which Thou Art fallen so she's already fallen and repent and do the first works or else I'll come to the quickly and remove that Candlestick and the light of the Gospel began to dim and the book became closed slowly very slowly and its truth became Mysteries and finally in Revelation five it's held shown held in the hands of God sealed with Seven Seals and so has it been since the early ages sealed clothed closed and hidden and the only one that can open it is the same one that opened it to Paul this mountain shall be removed but it won't be by man's might and schools of learning but it'll be by by power sayith the Lord before zerubabel those that came out of Babylon it shall become a plane and ye shall bring forth the finishing Stone crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace let's stand to our feet this morning God bless you hallelujah oh the word is
