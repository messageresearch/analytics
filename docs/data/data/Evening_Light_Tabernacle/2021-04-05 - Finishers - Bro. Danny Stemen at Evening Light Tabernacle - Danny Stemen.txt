to you amen we're thankful for that we have brother milco rabar that's in critical condition in the hospital and just leaving prayer today very lovely he said some more to move on his behalf also brother bryce patton asked for his wife sister tanya having back issues issues really bad back pain so i remember her today how many would have a need you want to make it known to the lord and ask for pastor brother tim to come and amen just pray for these needs [Music] amen we're going to go to prayer here in just a moment my way thank god for all he's done for us amen i want to ask one more request as we go to prayer this morning and that is that the lord will send a revival to every church in the bride across the world amen that they'll just be a part of what god's doing in this environment amen but the holy spirit is just moving their lives and their hearts bring deliverance healing salvation amen let the work of grace go for amen i want to share with you a little quote here on this easter morning this is zero hour amen this is a moment of time that we have been called to listen to these words here and the preachers of that day had to give an answer for this stir because it was at the feast of passover and they screamed out who is this maybe some people are wondering who is this what is this what is this that's moving what who is this that's coming among god's people and causing such a stern amen the anointing of the holy ghost coming down and delivering lives and setting people free who is this among us and the air was charged and the coming of the lord jesus to jerusalem had charged the air with expectations and it looked like the teachers ought to know what was going to take place it looked like that the high priest would have noted it looked like that all the other priests would have known it and it hasn't changed any today because the holy spirit is forerunning the coming of the lord jesus and as the holy spirit begins to stretch out across the earth revival fires are broken out everywhere great signs and wonders has been done healings has took place prophecies have went forth and all the gathering of the apostolic blessings has come back to the church again so as it was then so is it now the spirit of the unbeliever still cries out who is this well i'll tell you that who it is it's the same pillar of fire that appeared in the burning bush it's the same pillar of fire amen that anointed jesus and came and dwelt in him it is the i am that it is that i am it is the same pillar of fire that sent a prophet in this day and is leading the church and is here among us today jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever i got the answer as to who this is amen and he can put a fire in your life that the devil can never put out amen amen let's talk to the lord now father we're your children today we come under the charge and the authority of the holy ghost you're not a man that you might repent lord but you're one that stands by your word you send out healing and deliverance you send out salvation and your glory has arisen upon us and we're here in a day in the hour where the hour is charged with expectations we're seeing you come among us we've seen you move in our midst we've seen demons have to obey the name of jesus christ and fall at your feet subdued we have seen the holy spirit go forth and bring healeth oh as the son of righteousness arises with healing in his wings we have seen lord the great resurrection signs as lives of him and chains of darkness and delight and we're just asking god that you'll continue to let that sun rise as it's risen even today in the glorious sunlight bring a restoration upon your people today around the world may your spirit move may you speak to lives and hearts lord bring healing and deliverance wherever they are father i ask in the name of jesus that it'll go down into south africa lord right into little homes as i received pictures from last night four o'clock in the morning there but they're praising god and young people delivered by the power of god lord you're god all over you're not just god in america you're not just god and even my tabernacle but you're god around the world and i pray in the name of jesus let the spirit of god move over your people and sweep across the world calling your bride to the attention of the word for it's going home time lord i pray that it'll go down over into the hospital room where brother milko is a faithful servant of yours touch that man lord and raise him up i pray god for the doubt and manny lord those saints down there that are calling on god we need a touch from the lord for for a need a wife a situation i pray for brother bryce and the the family and the church family there meet the needs of your people

home at last never to rejoice [Music] look up on his face [Music] and when before me fill those rights from the mighty jews then my lord directs my hope he does safely king and he leads me gently on to this world below he's a real friend of me [Music] is [Music] hallelujah the lord amen we're going to sing that course again i'll ask the elt youth choir to come sing for us right after they threw

heavenly father we want to say what a privilege has been to be in your presence oh god and even this morning to feel you stirring and moving amongst us the service is not over lord we we still have time and we ask you lord that you would move in a special and personal way you know who's here i'm preaching to a crowd but you're preaching lord to a person and i pray father it should move in that oh god may we not be too tired may we not lord lose attention but may we give all our efforts for one more time lord to realize every soul is precious in your sight and you said i know them that are mine and i'll not lose one of them i pray o god that you had come lord and give me strength in my body as i needed oh lord but lord we're giving our energy and we're giving our our mouth we're giving ourself to you this morning you can use us lord for your glory that we get ourselves out of the way that you would have the preeminence i ask lord i pray your blessed service the remainder of it in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen if you're turning your bibles to the book of hebrews the 12th chapter amen hasn't it been a wonderful time that was a little weak amen you know jesus has been passing by and we say amen i think it's been wonderful and i i tell you the power that has been in these meetings if our president was here he'd be able to talk right for vice president here and make her a lady i mean the power that is here aiming to change lives forever we can't take these moments lightly amen what a precious time it is i just want to tell brother tim thank you for the privilege of being here and we certainly have appreciated your ministry for all the years and the friendship that you provided and and the camps that you've had for our young people have many i have many young people in my church that have been eternally blessed and some of them are young parents now and they're here with their children and helping other young people and and i know that uh the reward is great and brother tim has just been like an older older older brother to me and he's not old i just had an older brother and he has been and he's he's helped me and he's given me much advice that i'm just thankful for one one piece of advice he gave me at youth camp one year i kept telling the young people i'm just like them that i'm just another young person i was in my 40s by this time and brother tim after one service says you're not a young man anymore from then on i've been old so i've uh but i certainly amen have valued their friendship brother ron spencer they've just been a special family to me to my family and at home in our church and i believe that god has placed us all together as the body of jesus christ and as the times get longer and and closer to the end we ought to stick that much closer together for satan is doing his best to to separate us and to try to try to bring walls between us but i believe between the bride of jesus christ or cannot be he's come to break down the middle wall is that right so we appreciate all that the lord has done in these meetings and i know when you have meetings like this and and you have the response that you have and you have the emotion that was here and is here it can even raise questions amongst people and people that have been around the message for a long time we want to talk a little bit about that today with the help of the lord and if i can title this this morning i'm just going to uh title this one word and i want to title it finishers finishers amen and if you're turning your bibles hebrews 12 we'll start at the first verse we're just going to read two two verses wherefore seeing we are also we also are com compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god you can be seated may the lord bless the reading of his word i'm just going to quote a verse or two out of the book of john as jesus is very close to his crucifixion and we know this is resurrection morning and what a morning it is amen but jesus when he's just a few moments away from his crucifixion he said he makes the statement i have glorified thee on the earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do so jesus says i finished the work you gave me to do i want you to think about that statement because they were trying to kill him to stop his work but he said he had finished it you see they couldn't kill him until he had finished they were fixing to kill him because the prophet said they didn't want the power that could heal the sick that could raise the dead that could clean up the mary magdalenes among us they didn't want the power that discerned that could forgive a man of his sins so they crucified him but jesus had said i'd finished the work when he was on the cross and he's giving up the ghost he he said it is finished amen so i want you to know the one who has called you is the finisher and paul has written he said we look unto jesus who is the author of our faith in case you're wondering where this message started it never started with brother branham jesus is the author and and services like this if i could just put it put it put it in a picture services like this are so important because i i believe in ministering to moments ministries about moments amen you asked moses after 80 years of contemplation and a training and knowledge and of message knowledge and of teaching by from his parents and teaching about god and all of his pedigree behind him and then all of his education and all of his science amen had not brought him closer to god until he had come into such a stalemate that his life he had forgot amen even thoughts of freedom he thought god would not use him he knew intellectually who he was amen but he didn't know experience by experience who he was you asked moses about those five minutes amen in the presence of a pillar of fire amen i want to tell you something you think drunk children are strange what about burning bushes amen amen if we had some burning bushes around here people would say hey that can't be god but you asked moses if it was god and moses's attitude toward the burning bush is what changed his life that bush said take off your shoes if he had not listened god would have never spoke to him again moments you say brother danny but i've seen people jump and shout and scream and get drunk live like a hypocrite i have to [Music] i have two what's that got to do with anything i mean there's people out there laundering money all the time that don't stop you from using it [Applause] people rob banks you still go to work how do you know it's real brother danny how do you know it's real let me tell you my father had cruel hatred towards this message hated it with all his heart as i said the other night that he told he told us children as as little ones he told us and i can remember him taking us to this church and he would tell us not to believe what our mother believed and tried his best and his way to to to uh put in our minds what my mother was in was something wrong she was in a cult and i can remember him making my mother make a choice you stay with me or go with what you believe but you lose me and you lose your children he made her choose between her children and her god i want to tell you when you get to a point that when nothing else matters every relationship on earth doesn't have the hole that god does when you begin to realize that the lord jesus is the one that brought you here he's the one that gave you your children when you begin to realize that that's the one that called you amen then if you try to hold on to everything you're losing amen but when god saw her make that stand that i will choose amen to follow god amen it was just a moment where my daddy was trying to pressure her and i'm telling you it wasn't six months it wasn't six years amen but it was a moment of time that my drug came down in the kitchen it wasn't even in a church amen and he turned around and said i'll take you to the baptism i want you to know it's that kind of god that has come upon our young people because that moment amen in that moment the one amen that has called you has now let you know he's gonna finish it you don't have to worry about your children you don't have to worry about your family you got the one that created them in you you don't have to worry about what the doctor says you don't have to worry about who says what the guy that called you [Applause] he said brother name we're in the message we believe the word we're going to get to that you asked paul about the road to damascus you asked him what happened there amen in a moment he went from persecuting the church to leading it what did that the same pillar fire that spoke to moses came in the same pillar of fire amen that hovered over the earth the same pillar of fire that talked to abraham the same pillar of fire that had its photograph taken the same pillar of fire that's been in these meetings [Applause] you asked paul about it this is resurrection morning the prophet said what a resurrection that was but he said what a resurrection this is because we have been resurrected out of cold dark denominationalism so i got to ask you this question does this church look like the first one that's the answer that's the answer we're looking for does this church look like the first one because it's what the word says that counts it's not what a preacher says it's not what a critic says it's not what anybody else says over your experience it's what the word is said that's what matters brother ram said that jesus christ was the person the man god he was the manifestation of god he was god in a body form to reflect the word of god for that age to make that age see god's promise for that age and the holy ghost is the same thing today it's a spirit of god upon the written word trying to find somebody to reflect itself to this age to prove that he's the same yesterday today and forever saint john 14 12 the works that i do shall you do also jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever see constantly trying to find a way to reflect itself they couldn't do it the people thought so much of their denominations and their little nests that they had and so forth they called their churches so they wouldn't listen to it and so they do it today same thing they crucify him afresh and peter on the day of pentecost he said you men that dwell in jerusalem and in judea hearken to my words these are not drunk as you suppose and he said if you'll stand still i'll show you what it is and he goes ahead and explains to him now just bear with me a little bit this morning that we get so worried about the hypocrite we get so worried about the crooked preacher you know we hear so often you know why why should we listen to preachers you know they take you into false doctrine you know just get it straight from the tape you know it ain't going to go wrong if you push play well let me talk about the holy ghost a minute see because the bible says the rain falls on the unjust and the just well let me just say it right it falls on the just and the unjust you know brother branham you know god sent you a prophet that explained his experience to the baptist church and through the pentecostal church and and the gift that was in his life to discern and and he he talked about his experiences in the early pentecostal church and and the things he saw how the holy spirit would fall upon the congregation and they'd raise up and speak in tongues and he talked about the two men he said one was a real godly man but the other man was living with another with another woman other than his wife and he said if that's the way it is i don't want nothing to do with it because he didn't understand it you understand how god could fall and anoint a person like that but then one day god showed him and he read to him out of the book of hebrews and showed him how the rain falls on the just and the unjust and and he said it came to me amen that the same rain that makes the weak to grow makes the weeds grow and the same holy spirit that can fall in a bunch of people can bless a hypocrite just the same as it blesses another i you know i think our god is really big that he would not only bless his people he would bless those that weren't his people that at least they'd have a moment he may not go to heaven but to have a moment and the same holy spirit can fall in a bunch of people and can bless a hypocrite just the same as it blesses the other and jesus says by their fruits you shall know them not whether he shouts whether he rejoices but it's by his fruit you shall know him i said there you are i got it lord and that is really the truth a man could have gifts without knowing god so then i was getting too critical on speaking with tongues you see but then one day god vindicated that to me amen i i want to make a statement see because you're young people you've got to take something home with you you've got to take what has happened here and not leave it here god isn't asking you no you can't replicate a service like this every time but god isn't asking you to do that but you know god has to shock your system sometimes to get you out of something you know you've been pulled by the devil for years and years and years but one of those moments can shock you amen and to turn your thinking where it's a paradox brother adam said where you were going one way and all of a sudden you turned and all those devils who have lived and encamped in your life for all those years think about him in the maniac of godera asked him about it was it teaching that brought him out of it or was it a man that met him on the road amen that man had been in he lost his family and he's up in the tombs and he can't help himself and no man can help him but jesus said i gotta go to louisiana because there's somebody there that is bound and they can't be free and i'm gonna give them a moment i'm gonna give you girls a moment i'm going to give you boys a moment amen it's going to change you you've been bound you couldn't dress right you couldn't live right you couldn't talk right but then jesus came do you think that man some of you just looking at me like a mule looking a new gate go ahead and enjoy it do you think that man said i learned that in the baptist church i sat down for six months under some teaching and i learned i had a devil there was a desire in that man well we've used this before i'm going to use it again because it's another generation there is desire in that man amen when jesus came that man was standing in his way because something had pulled him down there and it was his desire he wasn't free yet but his desire had brought him there and he was called legion what's your name legion a couple thousand devils could not stop one man's desire they might have made him live wrong they might have destroyed his family listen to me young man they might have destroyed his family amen they might have made him strip his clothes off they might have made him lose his mind but they could not stop a predestinated seed that laid on the inside of them this man was not a hypocrite this man was election and because election was there leoducia couldn't stop it even no preacher could stop it nobody could stop it he had to get to jesus jesus had a bunch of jews in his boat they're the revelated ones you know they're the ones with the knowledge of the message and they're sitting there they don't have a clue what's going on jesus said let's go to the other side satan knew it he knew jesus went everywhere with purpose he's come to do a work he wasn't coming to play games these meetings are not games he'd come to finish the work so satan knew he wasn't playing games and he looked upon that boat and he tried his best to sink it but jesus has said let's go on to the other side i got a purpose in going over there to that country i'm not going to people like you jews but i'm going to somebody that's got the same seed inside of them amen that you have inside of you amen and that election drew [Applause] god your election has drawn god then some old pharisee will step back and look at some young drunk person say that's not the way our church believes it well i got news for you i didn't come because of your church amen i came because of the word and the word said he who the son has set free is free indeed don't tell me how to act there ain't no church can tell me how to act there ain't no church you can tell me amen who my god is amen if god is inside of me it'll express itself because the word said he would amen brother derek he's the same yesterday today and forever you asked that maniac about that moment well that's better yet let's ask those devils about that moment i don't need to ask any preacher it's all right if you do i don't need to ask anybody what those devils thought about it they were hoping that that maniac would push play brother danny you're touching something sacred really all i'm doing is touching your cold dark denominationalism it was not god that told you to quit preaching [Applause] i said it wasn't god but you know there's a lot of preachers messed up i do there's a lot of people messed up too but i'm going to tell you one person who's not intimidated if others preach his message and that's the prophets and i'm going to tell you about another prophet stood up to a young man stand up phillip you're a young man perhaps you've got a call in your hearts but you're a little shaky because you don't know somebody's told you we don't have to preach anymore every call of god whether you're an evangelist your teacher your pastor whatever you are amen got good news you don't even have to study just press play somebody else will even tell you what to press isn't that wonderful all of the burden has taken off the ministry it's wonderful i can tell you sit down timothy you know exactly what your name is philip come here i'm using the bible phillip i know you're a little worried somebody's told you to quit on preaching i used to walk like candy can't do it no more it's like plop plop hey man amen philip i know that you're trying to hide that gift in you but i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna preach to you a minute you me timothy we're gonna have a conversation okay amen paul paul i'm down to the end of my road amen but you're a young man and i want to tell you something don't stop amen but i want you to preach the word timothy amen i don't want you to neglect the gift that is within you but i want you to stir it up for the spirit speaketh expressly at the last days amen men will give heed to seducing spirits and they'll give heed to all kinds of doctrines and devils amen but what are you gonna do timothy you're gonna finish amen i've called you to preach the word i've called you to finish what god has started thank you buddy i love you there's a devil around our message let me tell you again there's a devil around our message it is not an alternative doctrine it is a seducing spirit that doesn't want the holy ghost to rise up in your life and preach the word because god has said you are the final voice to the final age under the messenger of the rage come on out of babylon come on out of those cape churches come a lot of dark denominationalism come on you maniacs come on out that ain't the word tells you to stop preaching well who do i stay with him brother tim or brother branham who do i stay with if you'd actually listened when you press play you would know why are you saying that brother danny well it ain't in my notes it must be in your heart it's in your heart i'm going to say it the devil's lying to you and he's made you to trust in another doctrine of balaam and put your comfort in a building and some son of a prophet god never called you to be that way he called you to be a son and if you're a son he gave a spirit to confirm it that's what the holy ghost is that's what this resurrection is all about i may get in trouble that's all right it's a fight worth fighting every one of you young men it's a fight worth fighting it's a gospel worth preaching amen i said it again it's a gospel worth preaching amen we're not sitting here with nothing to say we got something to say because the holy spirit has given us utterance ask that maniac what that day meant to him because it's about moments tell you what the prophet said prophet said stay with the word so that the spirit of the word will be upon the people he never said stay with the man he said stay with the word because the word will produce a ministry that has been born of the word but when you have a pulpit compromising or promoting a certain doctrine that doctrine has seed that will produce its own ministry and that ministry will only reflect the doctrine that's been promoted in the personality of the one promoting it [Applause] help me lord but when a ministry starts under another holy ghost ministry it can only reflect the holy ghost and have the boldness that comes from operating in the holy spirit and not the boldness of another man's personality seen so much of that copycat ministries but the holy ghost has a ministry it was a paradox there was a moment it was a moment on acts 2 where a bunch of cowards were turned into bold preachers and witnesses they had knowledge they'd seen miracles but now the holy spirit come amen and how then people in the upper room there they were afraid of the jews and they had walked with jesus but when the holy spirit came they weren't afraid no more out into the street they went screaming and falling and acting like a bunch of drunk people you ever seen a drunk person yes last night we saw a few yeah i've seen them on on alcohol he's so drunk remember one time being another brothers is in the wintertime he's in another country region we're driving down the road and there's snow everywhere it's bitter cold we see a man down in the ditch and he's stuck on a barbed wire fence he can't get off of it well he stopped the car we better help this guy we went down there and that guy was so drunk he didn't care if he was hung up on a fence he was hung there and we're trying to he was so big he's bigger than both of us brothers put together and we're trying to trying to pick him up and get him over the fence it wasn't working i can remember i can remember very clearly that the only way i could get him over the fence was put my my foot on his his back and i pushed him over and i pushed him over and he went on his nose landed in the snow laid there for a minute he got back up and he looked at me and he goes hey he didn't care if i had kicked him he pulled his wallet out and he was trying to give us money and the man was drunk he didn't care forgot about something about being drunk you start forgetting there's one thing god wants you to do is you want you to learn to forget what the enemy has done so that you can realize the power of god is bigger than any memory any action somebody might have treated you wrong but our god is a good good good good good man amen he owns a cattle on a thousand hills he's the prince of peace somebody might have done you wrong you might got scars in your life but he's got a couple he wants to show you himself then there were your scars he engraved you in the palms of his hands he said i'll never forget you and i'm going to give you a moment down here at easter camp that you'll never forget me but does this new church this new revelation the gospel malachi 4 produced drunk children is that really of god brother danny i want to tell you about a moment in our church and tell you in the church i came out of we never had those moments we didn't even know how to say amen we were so dumbed down that whatever the preacher said we've blindly followed it because our safety was in the denomination my mama believed my daddy believed it they all believed it so i'm in it i must be all right so i remember one time very clearly my cousin asked me if i was still preaching and i said yes and he said you're still preaching what william brandon preached i said yes and he said i said why do you ask and he said because he's went to hell and i said well i said because you asked that i want to ask you a question how many books of brother branham have you actually studied or tapes listened to to say this man has went to hell here's what dark denominationalism will do this is what fallen a preacher will do because i haven't read any but my daddy read one book and told me it was no good so you read one book and sent a man to hell it wasn't it wasn't that it was the denominationalism you're under that don't want that power they don't know their bible and if they don't know their bible how can they rightly discern and if you don't have the spirit of god in you how can you rightly discern and if you don't have the spirit of god in you and say that what's fallen on the kids is not of god you're not going to like it either and i don't care if you are a preacher we had it happen in our church drunk kids laying all over the place the police even came they came and our kids ran to the car it says great save a cop defund the police the right way let them have nobody to go after. i'm serious they were hanging out of trees they were laying on the ground on the platform and some of them today are so far in the world then they couldn't have been a god because if it didn't save all of them then it couldn't have been a god stand up seth stand up joshua hey man i'll tell you what came out of that rain deacons sunday school teachers song leaders some of them aren't here preachers that came out of that rain they got drunk i think these guys are pretty good i happen to think the holy ghost did a good job i'll tell you you said i know you guys want to keep standing but you can say we had others it fell on we had to carry them they was laughing they was carrying on they were drunk as those guys and they're so far in the world today and if i would spend all of my time looking at them and say see what happens to drunk people [Music] i've totally missed it that's right because it's not about those that never continued and it's not about those that started and couldn't finish it's time to wear your coat buddy it's not about the starter it's about the finisher and god never called me here to start and remember the one that started this work is also a finisher inside of me he never taught me to stop he called me all the way to a change of my body [Applause] hallelujah i'll tell you who the spirit fell upon if the spirit did not fall upon you and make you a son you were already sons but it fell on some who weren't sons so they jumped like other sons but they had nothing in them to finish but when it falls on some suns where were you job where were you job where were you joe before the foundation of the world i'll tell you where you were you were in the mind of god you were in his heart and he brought you down to this earth to express his heart and i'm going to express it if he finished his work we're going to finish ours if you trust me amen it fell upon sons who did the holy spirit fall upon its core and sons who did it fall upon the day of pentecost sons it did not make you sons you are already sons it only brought you into your adopted position as a son as you were in the world you couldn't cast the check amen but now that you've been baptized you can cash it ask what you will and it shall be given unto you sons but but but brother danny we know better than that and people in people spoke in tongues got the holy ghost you know we're in the message now we've went a little bit deeper lord give me my breath please he said you're over 50 deal with it hey lord will i watch judas stand there and point his finger and so devils they may come out how can i trust anything like that amen amen your concern is not the judas is among us your concern is not the websites among us that are preaching against a prophet amen i'll tell you you would turn to judas and say where does he reside why are you going to listen to a man that had a god-given holy ghost ministry but couldn't finish you want to criticize something like this i'll tell you what your problem is i'm not nobody's telling you you have to run the shop to have it nobody has said that but what god wants to do to you is get you out from behind your shell [Applause] if you stand there like a post and the holy ghost comes upon you and pulls you out of your shell and you stand there and you just say oh god amen that's good enough for god but it's what comes after and if you spend your time in a service like this looking at that well that's not god that's not all you're telling me is you've never come out from behind your shell i don't care if you're a preacher and you've been in the message 700 years that's a long time if you're counting if you've been there that long and you know all the quotes you can quote it better than every preacher on here combined it means nothing to god amen because if he hasn't come to you in a moment on the sacred sands of revelation and change you there amen to a new creature in christ jesus baptizing you into the body of christ you're as dead as judas is we got too many people that know about the message but not the god the sinners until you brother brahma says we haven't come to talk about it we've come to get under it we come to try to absorb teaching we come to get under the word amen the devil's lied to some of you and thought the more you knew about it what then you would have it that's not it amen the more you know about it the more faith you should have amen the more you know about it the more faith you should have not more criticism not more criticism come on these doctrines of devils that tell you that you listen to a tape a day or get the holy ghost that's a doctrine of the devil because the devil wants you to think you've got comfort in something mechanical and you can listen your ability to listen is not going to give you the holy ghost amen your ability to surrender amen is when the god comes into your life and he said i will change you amen until you're not the same brother danny have you had if you had hypocrites in your poll no doubt probably have some more i don't know i should have said that no i don't want that but you know we're not allowed to know everything that's right and if you're worried about that ask jesus why in the world he looked at you said hey come follow me [Music] you guys know that brother branham had some boys with them turned into homosexuals what kind of message are you in same one jesus is in that called you just come stand with him the same one that paul was in that asked demas to follow him had guys in this congregation like alexander and harmonies we got any of those here just checking you know alexander and heiminis had more revelation than paul did they said the resurrection has passed already paul and it's because what you said we are now seated in heavenly places incredible glory to god if we're in heavenly places the resurrection is already over and overthrow the faith of son you know the lord has already come well i got you to be quiet anyway you know where the bride do you know this is the bright age for me to say that did not give me the right to start another doctor [Applause] or to even tell you we're in the bright age we're in the layout of seeing age what is the bright age it's the age of maturity it's the age of finishers it's the rapture age it's the harvest age it's the cycle the full cycle age don't go tell me we've left that age oh brother danny the prophet is no longer the messenger to the bride now now the holy spirit is but if you'd actually read your bible you find out he is actually the messenger in every age if you actually read your bible but because men want to be the leaders they've got to promote something that'll put their flesh in it amen god never called you to be like that amen he called you to be the final voice under the final age amen in this layout of sia to prove to satan he's not interested in proving it to other preachers he's interested in proving it to that son of a morning he's interested in proving it to lucifer this bride this bride this bride is not like that one she's not like that eve just stay with the word she'll believe the word she'll finish [Applause] finishers god never gave any minister the right to change the age that a prophet didn't [Applause] [Music] how dare you think you're more spiritual than the prophet that came by god behold i send them to you he elijah oh you said brother danny but you said if you don't you don't have to you don't have to push play to believe we listen come on now you got more with you than that you got more in the tank than that god wants to use you what is he saying god wants to use you like never before young people what you got in you tell you some people have trivialized the holy ghost made it a little simple doctrine that we get now we go on and we learn all the great things i got news for you the token is what was needed to follow the seals that little simple doctrine and here's what the scripture says young people i want you to know something you might have felt real good last night and jumped up and down the screen that's wonderful and i love it for you it's a moment that you should never forget now tomorrow you may not feel like that but now god wants to tell you what has happened and paul's going to echo his voice brother branham's going to echo his we're going to echo ours here's what the holy spirit is he's your guide he guides you to a place and he can guide you out that's right he never guided you to lay out a seal and then they change the gender of people and he says okay i don't know who they are anymore i can't guide him he's the guide not only is he a god this is why satan wants to trivialize it he's a comforter holy spirit is god he's a comforter the one that comes along amen and when the devil begins to fight throw arrows in your brain and nothing really happened there there's a comforter there brother liddell amen that begins to tell you amen don't forget what i have done amen that i have started the work i'm also able to finish it i'm your comforter [Applause] i'm a comforter when you wanted to quit when the pressure got so hard when the devil said if that's the way it's going to be i no longer serve him he was the comforter wanted to be a quitter somebody help me just can't take it no more i've been abused i can't take it no more i've been told this i can't take it no more i don't give up i have wanted to quit but i got good news for you some of you drunken folks that were rolling around on the floor a finisher moved up on the inside of you [Music] and when a finisher goes in nothing can take him out amen what is the holy spirit he is a guide he is a comforter he's a spirit of truth he can discern between right and wrong so i get really concerned when people start criticizing way people act well that's out of church order brother danny he's out of church order how dare you try to say what church order should be you go home with a temper to fight a buzz off your home's out of order your life is out of order but the church is not in order i got a question for you and if anybody here wants to answer it please stand up and answer how can a man without the holy ghost know what church order is well that's harsh brother anyway it's better to hear it here isn't it just trying to be a blessing yeah he's showing off now he's acting too funny and let me just tell you something i learned that from the proof let me just tell you something you know why shouldn't i act that way if you know where we came from you know the family that god brought us out of i could be in order in some denomination and be dead as a doornail hey remember when i saw my god bring me out of the mirror clay i got a little bit of david on the inside of me amen i want you to know amen i'm a part of that word that is returned in this hour amen i've got to finish her brother jack said i got a finisher inside of me hey man you can't stop me amen you can't stop me come on old woman stop me from dancing a little bit come on brother come on we got to go amen we got a god we got a god we got a god and brother's out of bondage we've got a god that brought us out of bondage you want to tell me i shouldn't dance you want to tell me i shouldn't rejoice you want to tell me i shouldn't love the lord we got a god hey when you healed the sick who gets the holy ghost you want to tell me i shouldn't praise god come on devil come on devil this is your hour this is your time you lost the battle hmm i've spent all my life listening to some critic in my ear telling me i didn't have what i had and i want the devil to know i am not a victim i'm a son of god i've been called to this age and i'm going to overcome you might have been abused girls some mans might abuse you but you're not a victim satan was just trying to stop you you're not going to commit suicide amen come on out don't believe the devil's line renounce the devil renounce the devils and go home and be genuine um you know why you're not gonna quit for the one who started this work he is also able to finish me the god that started it is the drive that's in you that's right comfort the cop that started you is the god that's going to finish it for us [Applause] why shouldn't i praise the lord hold on a minute my family's going through some hard waters deep waters lately i have a sister here we prayed would be here god came in a real personal way last night and he said john my but my dad is in heaven john i've come down for your girl now you want to tell me i should just stand there and say amen come on pretty good pretty good you know but

glory glory glory if god is spoken to my family i say glory i want to tell you what a prophet said in india and i want you to know where you're at we're not in india amen but i want you know what he said when he was in india and he had the vision of that blind man he said all that day i sat and listened to all of these different doctrines and different churches say how wrong christianity was and how theirs was the right one but then god showed me a vision amen of a man receiving his sight amen and i turned around and i looked upon all those religions and i said all you do is get one man to move from one religion to another [Applause] change the way he worships but i ask you then what then he said i invite any of you to come up here and give this man his sight he said i felt like elijah amen on mount carmel because god had shown me he said brethren amen neither can i but i'm serving the one and i want to tell you what he said brother ron and this is for you he said it was only a drama then it wasn't a question it wasn't will i make it it was only a drama it was only a film that was being played that god would show he is the god of gods he is the lord of lords i am the lord
