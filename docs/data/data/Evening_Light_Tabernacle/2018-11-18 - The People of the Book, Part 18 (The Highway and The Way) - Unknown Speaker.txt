hold this little one I meant to present it to the Lord I feel this is a very special moment when we think about our Lord who said to allow a little children to come to him and forbid them not and he brought them they brought them to him and he blessed them and today we want to bless this child in his stead or in his name and so we're here to represent him and how wonderful it is we can hold these

abounding in love a man and this is what he would say in sums 145 and 8 God's a God that abounds in love and mercy and grace and when we name our children we named them after something special that our God is to us and that is that he is a God full of grace full of mercy full of love and he he holds out pardon and forgiveness His grace is way bigger than what we could ever imagine amen his mercy endures to every generation and is new every morning so what a great God we serve today and how we appreciate him let's bow our heads as we take this little one to the Lord father we bless your name

privilege of serving God together a man good to have each one of you that are here assembled with us those have already been given greetings we want you to feel welcome here today and and and just believe that God will speak to you in a very special way we have brother EJ Parker here that's been coming to church for some services and today he wants to be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen there's a law amen well that's what we must do it's a part of salvation and begins with repentance if true repentance has followed them by water baptism in his name we believe you'll receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but that promises us and our children and to them that are far off amen and I just told you you can expect your children amen those that have straightaway you can expect them to come back home and many gatherings wings hey man your loved ones just expected this is what we should expect today I've got a little something I had brother Michael to do for me and this has to do with our scripture reading this mornin and it's not exactly the total portrayal as I'd like to have had it but it's the best I could come up with but nevertheless it's um it just shows you a highway and in the center is the way we're not looking at this as a two-way highway coming and going although you know the latter that Jacob saw he saw angels ascending and descending but on this on this highway Jesus is the way the truth the life and it's a one-way street amen and so we're we are gathered this morning then we have a highway and away the scripture will say and we're going to read that here in a moment from Isaiah 35 before we do I want us to sing a an old song it's a highway to heaven none can walk up there but to pure in heart it's the highway to heaven I'm walking up the Kings Highway how many will take a walk with me amen god bless you brother Kirkland getting to have you this morning god bless you welcome home well it's the high [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] hey man I'm in walking up that Kings Highway well if you're not there I'll tell you it's the only way to walk amen god bless you good to be together today turned it with me to Isaiah chapter 35 and verse 1 we're going to read this scripture together this morning before you're seated and as we stand an honor to the word Isaiah 35 we'll read from the first verse down through about oh we're gonna go down to about the 10th verse so let's read this together the wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them the desert shall rejoice and blossom as the rose is a blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it the excellency of Carmel and Sharon they shall see the glory of the Lord in the Exynos excellency of our God strengthen ye the weak hands and and confirmed the feeble knees say to them that our of a fearful heart be strong fear not behold your God will come with vengeance even God with a recompense he will come and save you and then in the eyes of the blind shall be opened the ears of the Dead Deaf shall be unstopped and then shall the lame man leap as in heart and the tongue of the dumb sing for in the wilderness shall waters break out and streams in the desert and the parched ground shall become a pool and the thirsty land Springs of water in the habitations of dragons weary sleigh shall be grass with weeds and rushes and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those the wayfaring man though foes shall not air therein no Lions shall be there near nor any ravenous beasts shall go up there on it shall not be found there but the redeemed shall walk there and the ransom of the Lord shall return and come to Zion with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads they shall obtain joy and gladness and sorrow and sighing shall flee away what a promise what a word of consolation this morning god bless you you can be seated I'm going to be speaking today on the highway and the way and as we go along this will I'm sure become more clear to you what we mean by the highway and the way brother Branham would tell a story in the message it is the rising of the Sun he would tell of an experience by the way of a dream that his mother had and she dreamed that brother Branham was standing by the side of three steps and he was preaching to everyone that they must walk up these three steps before they hit the highway and on the highway is a little pearly white line that runs straight to the doors of heaven to the pearly gate and that pearl had been stretched out to the top of these steps and he said if that's not my message of exactly today of the justification and sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to walk that highway now there was a lady come by you know what kind of shoes people had on 35 years ago and of course now this was 65 1965 when he says that so 35 years before this and there was a lady came by with had a great big pair like to wear today of spiked heels shoes and she came by and said I said wait a minute you can't walk that highway with that said you can't do that and she turned her she turned and said I looked around to wrestle women and said don't believe him he's a madman don't believe him I'll show you I can be justified sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and still walk that and he said I just let her go I couldn't do no more about it couldn't stop her and she jumped up on the highway and then she looked back at the sisters and said I see I told you so and she started to run and he said that she ran like described in Isaiah the 5th chapter you know like the wood without stretch next you know because they have to because it pitched over in those spike heeled shoes and they'd have to twist Minson as they go and making a tinkling with their heels the daughters of Zion in the last day in she started up that highway just as hard as she could run and and after a while the road got narrower and narrower and she started reeling mincing like that and off she went and and in the dream his mother said I heard that the harmless screams I ever heard in my life was that woman falling into those flames and smoke going down like that and I turned around and said see she just obeyed every word but everything but one word everything but one word and then he goes on to remark Pentecostal women can be saved sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost and then failed absolutely men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds and she failed it and as I said she would have went when I went on all right but she failed to listen telling her what was ahead and he wrote the gospel by the disciples apostles of doctrine of the apostles and prophets and so forth and they won't listen so you know this shows you that you can jump on this highway and if there's no true anchor within the soul that causes you to want to keep the Word of God and keep the way of holiness that you're gonna wreck up somewhere because if you look on this highway right here it's it's over here on the edges on either side whether you can fall away god-made away but it is on the side of the road only on that getting to the extreme one way or the other losing your balance that will cause you to fall off and and lose the the victory that you started out with you see you're going to wreck up somewhere because there's nothing in the control tower of the soul that keeps you from going to the extreme to the right or to the left it's got to be a balanced walk and so don't try to walk this highway without the seal of God now this is very important for you to understand you know you're in order to walk this highway you've got to have the seal of God you can have experiences of justification sanctification and even baptisms of the Spirit but if you don't have something that will cause you to keep the Word of God and live true to the word you're gonna fall off somewhere when the road gets narrow Amen now again if you if you're truly filled with the Holy Ghost and sealed to the day of redemption you're never gonna fall off this highway so let's get that straight as we go because you know it's not uh it's not that our salvation is not secure our salvation is secure and then we're sealed to the day of redemption but if you don't go into it right and get on this highway and go to runnin you're gonna go to the extreme one way or the other now this is what we're gonna be talking about today now I'm brother Brandon would talk about his own ministry and he says about his own selfie said I'm not a legalistic neither am i and Armenian are a Calvinist and and he said I believe that each one had a doctrine in one of them was was was legalism and the other was extreme grace but he said that run off on the deep side of it they they just stayed with that and didn't balance the thing up there's a highway and a way and the way is the road a highway has a post way over here in a post way over there but in the middle of this highway comes the road and you can be and you can be in a highway and being a gun now you just envision our highways today and and you know they're the highway has a gutter on this side and a gutter on that side all of this is in the right-of-way of the highway and here is where you see the wrecks along the side the road how many crosses do you see and memorials with people's names on it that are on the side of the road where people left the road a man then left the road and they wrecked up somewhere because they went on this side or that side they didn't stay in the road now remember in this road there's no way you can wreck if you stay in the middle of the road because it's a one-way street hey man now so it's a it's a highway and away and there's a conjunction which brings the highway down to a way and then and here's where your travel is in the way that's where the smooth running is you remember they call it the way in the Bible all that was found in this way is called away now brother Branham would also speak of this in the Hebrew book and and he would share about the Nazarene people and the Nazarenes predated the Pentecost to move and they were holiness people and he said the Lord blessed those dear people old fashioned sanctified Methodists is what they were and the Church of God and Nazarene and pilgrim holiness and many of the good old holiness churches and they used to sing a song on I'm walking in the grand old highway telling them where that I go I'd rather be an old-time Christian Lord than anything that I know and so he says I'm they talk about the highway of holiness but he says there's a highway and the way it's not just good enough to get on the highway you must stay in the way or in the middle of the road this is called the way of holiness and the answer it's it's the road is he said the way of the road is in the middle of the road is built like this so the waters will wash off the trash to both sides keeping the road clean you don't have puddles standing in your road all the time or you will have if it isn't built right the way is the middle of the road on this side when people get converted now listen closely their minds are set right on Christ so now you're aiming right straight toward Christ and and if they're just a little scholarly and they don't keep under prayer they'll get real cold and starch and stiff and starchy and then different so here we got one extreme over here on this side and this causes some direct amen because they get this you know get they get educated in the message they become scholarly and stiff and cold and starchy and indifferent now this is real important you understand they get indifferent because there's no burden for the lost soul hey man it just becomes about us for and no more it just becomes a you know a very narrow-minded me and us and that's all that's gonna make it and so there's no there's no concern for anybody else remember there there is no fellowship with anybody else it's just us you know we're we're we're on this Highway and they and they get cold still start seeing a difference and then if they're just a little nervous he says if you don't watch they go to the other side which he calls the radical and wild on this side and they're going to sensations and everything else when the end so he says is so here again we have another side the road and the other side of the road is is radical and men and wild nervous you know again sensations little feelings becoming real spiritual where that nothing nobody can tell you anything you don't have to go to church you don't you don't have to be subject to anything because you're so spiritual you're so radical you're having your own little visions and dreams and God's talking to you you know as if you're the only one in the world and and so you know and whatever you get becomes the absolute instead of the Word of God and so you have this radical side on the other side and we both so we've seen them all and then we've seen them where they're radical and we've seen them where that they are scholarly and then different and cold and man there's two sides of it but the real church I mean wants to be a real church the real church is a real sane gospel right down the middle of the road it's not cold and starchy neither is it fanaticism it's a real good old warm gospel heartfelt love of God going right down the middle of the road calling from both sides in other words calling those their fanatical you don't come on come on in and get here in the center calling those that are scholarly and and cold and indifferent and and lukewarm get over here get in the center you walk in the edge over there you're going to wreck so well I've been justified and sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost yet but if it doesn't cause you to go go according to the word you know you might be on the highway but you're not gonna last long now so again it's calling them right back to the word notice verse eight again and a highway shall be there and a way and it shall be called the way or the road of holiness the unclean shall not pass over it but it shall be for those wayfaring man the one who's the travelin man the man who's making progression this road is not to sit still on a man to stay where you have been for the last 20 years and you know sometimes even hear preachers while I preach the same thing I'll have for 40 years and I say well shame on ya and then you oughta progress somewhere you ought to want a little deeper in Christ you the order you oughta advance somewhere man and again you said well I'm exactly where I was 20 years ago what shame on you the menu you need to be you need to be traveling down this road it's for the travelin man a man and me and the fools or even though there is simple in other words they will not air therein it's well marked a man is it's it's well marked out for you straight as a gate narrows away and we don't you to be that find it but it's well marked for the believer all the way a man so now you know the in the endless and then dealing with this we we're living in a time where you know there there's been these two extremes we have we have the denominational world that on some of them were on one side of the cold starchy formalism of just accept Jesus as your Savior and you're safe so you got that one side then you got the other side that went into fanaticism with sensations all the way to the extremes of not just tongues or speaking in tongues but blood in the hands and all in the forehead even things in other words it wasn't scriptural and dependent on seals and certain feelings or tongues is an evidence instead of a change life what you're one to see is a change life I don't really care you know how it comes to you as long as your life gets changed and then something summer real summer real vocal and and they stream out in the shower and they um you know just a real real vocal others are really quiet and and their stream runs deep and you don't you don't hear a lot of noise but you see a life and that's what we want to see is we want to see a Christian life a man we want to see that instead of but instead of keeping the balance man many as went to the other ditch of and even in the message you can see it happen that they go into the ditch of no emotion or no feeling hardly a name and and turn the message into cold creams now like I said the reason why that most of the message people are in that ditch is because brother branham made a correction and man he made a correction because of the extreme fanaticism of the Pentecostal groups that he was working with he really hammered against the extreme fanaticism and that in some jerks so hard made the corrections so hard until you can hardly get an amen in the church you can ever can hardly have any worship in the church there's no healings there's no miracles there's no prayer lines there's no altar calls and then there there's no experience with God it has just been replaced work for another called a confession of faith now again I want I'm gonna share some things about it because here's what he was dealing with many of those people join those big classical things just to be popular they shouldn't it ain't no different there the spirit of life that works in the world would tell them that that's different if they got any spark about him and then he talks about they go after these fantastics of frogs jumping bugs are flying shake him jumping running everything else where they know that's contrary but they go with it because it's a sensation now during this era of time brother Branham was dealing with Pentecostal contemporary ministers who were who were testifying of heaven Budd in their hands and all in their foreheads and they were claiming that this blood that was coming out of even some of the women's hands were we're on Oh had redemptive qualities and he says this is true it takes away from the power of the blood of Jesus Christ and makes it unnecessary so you know brother Branham was coming out very hard against the sensationalism that was going on he said I don't care about sensations I want thus saith the Lord that's right what the word says and I believe and I believe in a heartfelt religion now don't get it wrong just because we're coming out against sensations don't mean that we don't believe in a heartfelt religion now I believe I am the joy that I can know the joy I can know if I can get to it this morning I want to speak about that from the scripture you know the joy that I can know I believe in the power of the Holy Spirit I believe in divine healing I believe in all the manifestations of the gifts but they must be reverently placed in the Bible body working exactly in harmony with the word so you know when brother Branham was recounting some of the things that had been restored before the open and other seals one of them was something that he as he would he gave a whole list someone that he got from Schofield and and from his notes and some that he added like the truth of serpent seed and and then this is another one I want to bring it to you in the services is this a time he said the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but the personal Christ performing you that works that he did so he talked about the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation now you know once again as I as I've cautioned you you can't build a doctrine on one quote nor can you build it on 1/2 a quote just like you can't build a doctrine on just one scripture for example what if you take Matthew 28:19 and refuse to look at acts 2:38 that brings you the understanding and enlightenment of what Jesus said to when he said to be baptized in his name what if you only take that one scripture you see then then you're baptized and entitle and not a name right so again you can't use one scripture it must be something from Genesis to Revelation it cannot be just one scripture and then in the case also you're gonna have to when you when you hear something said don't isolate one little statement and then build a doctor knowing it amen look and see it all the way through the Bible all the way through the message are you with me now in this case a doctrine has been built on half of the quote and that is again stressing the mystery of the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation now sensation means without feeling or without knowing it without any eye without any intelligence that anything happened and so this becomes that idea that we can get the Holy Ghost today and not even know it and that we can have the Holy Ghost and has no feelings with it we see you can't run that from Genesis to Revelation you can't run that even through the message hey man but because here's the other half of the quote here i'ma bring it to you but the person of Christ see not a sensation not just a feeling but the person of Christ because he you can have you can have a feeling and not receive the person of Christ you can have a sensation or given vision I have a dream and they need me spiritually even come to pass he didn't speak and real genuine Holy Ghost tongues and still remain unchanged within the soul having not received the person of Christ so he said but the person of Christ performing and you the same works that she did the same works that he did now here's the other half of the quote you see and here are some of the works that he did a man what some of the works that he did was holiness a holy life obedience to the world a man faith a belief in the word healings miracles tous gifts of the Spirit you know because you know again we have to match this with the rest of Scripture in my name he said these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devils they will speak with new tongues a man they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover all of these are the works of Christ so when we have the person in you he will perform the works of Christ not just one work of a healing or miracle or sign or a wonder or a tongue or a job or dance but but all his works aim of all his works so you see again these are these are the things that follow a believers if you really believe these follow now brother Branham would talk about this and God hiding himself in simplicity as he approaches the seven seals and he said we find out that people get so smart in educated now I want to show you another then so he takes this one side smart and educated and he said and the other goes to the far to the other side they become fanatics trying to be religious now we have that group they go to the other side now you said that's where I differ with the group of brethren and he's talking about a group of people up in Canada that that they they just couldn't see the phenomenon of it being done unless they made themselves a group and what they did is they even just took some words and brother branham and Ansem lee even teaches and he did and ran with with a thought Oh manifested sons and they then then they were the manifested son speak in the word and now they're going to lay hands on different ones and and give them a ministry you know and and so they they were prophesying and given ministry they called ourselves a latter rain and it started out with a with a genuine move of God with an outpouring of divine love and the world the the spirit just fell but in stay instead of staying humble with it they took it over into fanaticism and he said then they condemn their other thing and that they and and the taste and the things till they come from on to the other side so they they condemned so much the the word and knowing the word until they go to the fanatical on the other side now he said so there's one side that is highly intellectual cold and and different and they deny everything there and then the other only gets on the other side and it's a radical bunch of emotion and deny the word but the real true church again who wants to be a real true church stays right in the middle of the road now so like we said look on the side of the road even look at this example where do you go I mean if you follow this highway where are you gonna go you're just falling out it and the tumbling over into into eternity somewhere off of the highway it's never going to take you anywhere radicalism will not do it neither will formalism you've got to stay in the middle of the road you can't be over here in emotion and deny the word but you can't get on the other side in its word word word word and there's no life no emotion no power no no spirit or nothing else it's got to stay right in the middle of the road there's a highway and the way it isn't good enough to be on the edge you're gonna fall off you've got to come into balance and every Christian all this tried to cover the balance in their walk with God and like I said look on the side of the road how many memorials are there with names and flowers because people left the road for a ditch something knocked a moth throat again in the garden simplicity's said if you notice it's got the Bible knowledge of what God said and his spiritual enough to be warm in his heart it's just a road I say you said it would be that way there's a highway and the blessing of precious Friends of Nazarene Church Almighty little move of God started up but what they do when God began to speak in tongues in the church they were so religiously and so self starts till they called it the devil and you see what happened to them so here again they're they're on this road and they're they get on the road and they get over here too far to to the left that get over here in Orem sup works you know of well you can't wear this and you you can't do this and they get really ordering extreme of fanaticism and make their religion about what kind of clothes they wear and what kind of things they don't do and when when the Holy Spirit began to speak in tongues they went so far they just shut the wheel so far away from that until the the Nazarene Church went into backslidden condition to worry even they even lost the holiness that there once had because they wouldn't even go on with God now so he said again when we'd got begin to speak in tongues in the church they were so religiously and so self starts that they called it the devil and see what happened to them then holier-than-thou and and so we find he stays that goes to seed and dives right out notice that go to seed on there rather than staying humble walking with God that go into fanaticism our formalism now he said the other side becomes a fanatic and the other side becomes cold and starchy now I say it said it would be a highway and denies rains many of the holiness people that bless an old highway glory to God we walk in the highway but remember that wasn't exactly what he said there's a highway and and and as a conjecture conjunction and away and it's somebody called a highway of holiness and it shall not be called a highway of holiness but the way of holiness and he said people try to make themselves holy and when you do he says it is like I said before it's like a buzzard trying to put duck feathers in him and trying to make a dove out of it when his nature is still a buzzard and man see it would be like a crow trying to put pigeon feathers in or peacock say and see I'm a beautiful bird and it's something manufactured and this is what has happened to often is we are we've taken crows and buzzards people without a real change taught them how to dress right do right come to church even you know pay your tithes be a good person and yet unchanged on the inside and he said it's exactly like a crow or a buzzard trying to put in peacock feathers and say look I'm a peacock you see doing that and change you but if you are changed it's going to grow from the inside out it's not that you won't have the right kind of feathers you need that you won't have dug feathers or in the case of peacock peacock feathers but if it's peacock is gonna be a peacock from the inside it's going to be a dove from the inside and that's the whole idea is not change our outside but change our inside word that things can grow from the inside out that's a mistake we even make a lot of times with new Christians you know it's kind of like kitchen fish you can't clean them till you catch them catch them first a man catch them with the gospel bring a beer get him down to an experience with Christ and then God will clean them up then they'll be humble to the Word of God a man now but he said a peacock don't have to worry about whether he's going to have peacock feathers I'm not Doug doesn't have to worry what he's gonna have dove feathers or not as long as his nature is a dove he will have dove feathers and the holiness people begin to say the women must wear long hair and long sleeves and these things long skirts and not wear wedding rings and jewelry of any type and he said it became a self-righteous holiness see that's a matter of fact your holiness now listen you can you can quit cutting your hair and any even brother metals that don't do we're talking about the women now you quit cutting your hair and he said don't do it because the Bible said not to do it or even I said not to do it but do it because there's a change on the inside of you you see and that's the mistake people make they are trying to live the word without a nature change and it becomes a self-made self-righteous holiness and down the road they get off they get into radicalism in and are somewhere there's a formalism one of the other and offs they go in the fall away they new you see converts are not one to Christianity by its governments by its rules and regulations and that we when converts by an experience with Christ getting them to know Jesus and then letting Jesus become the Lord of their life and when he's Lord and ruler he'll bring everything subject to the word hey man but a lot of times we're going to this backwards he said looks what's happened to the denomination now no I know I know I know you say well now wait a minute brother Tim well then we sit and we sit like our young people we shouldn't you know they're not converted so just let them just let no you can't do that you have to tell them what the Word of God said they know better you can show them in the Bible but the law just and you're striving against so all just means you need Jesus God took the whole law thou shalt thou shalt not to prove that no man could live right that is and the law was given that it might bring them to Christ and make them realize I need a Savior I don't need a law I need a Savior I can't keep this word I can't do everything right it's impossible for me to live right and so the law the law reveals to you I need Jesus so when we preach about holiness and things like that what we're really trying to tell you is you need Jesus and if you get Jesus on the inside you'll never need another sermon about holiness because I holiness will come naturally from the inside and going outside amen so it's automatically lived so again again you see today there's a lot of manufactured holiness and and and and it is Pharisee ISM thank you brother Aaron it is just pharisee ism and they could do that so well but Jesus called them hypocrites you know I you know what hypocrite men actor that's what they called the stage the guy the guys playing that on the stage you know they call him hypocrites or actors they were pretending to be something they were not in reality a man and that's what a hypocrite is he's pretending to be something but he's really not that and the gospel makes you something real and the world is not looking for an actor the world is looking for something that is real something that lil something that works something that change life better change your nature and make you a son or daughter of God amen now again you know the mentality of the of the church world today is you just gotta say never everyday but you see you don't have to you do it because you willfully want to and the reason you willfully want to because you never died to yourself when you know when when you die to yourself you become a new creature and but when you see these other things like the world and cutting hair and paint even to come out against the Word of God what does it show shows the Holy Ghost isn't there that's what it reveals shows that person needs Jesus that's not a bad thing that's a good thing hey man let's just let's just make it straight we need Jesus and that's a good thing to need it is a good thing to find out that you need him before the rapture because here you wait down the rapture day and find out you don't have the token the ticket to go you're left behind now but God wants his church to and wants to bring his church to maturity so that they can walk this road down the middle of the road call him from both sides now again he would he would brother branham would tell us and what was a Holy Ghost given far he said what is the Holy Ghost it's got Enya what's it for to continue his work among his people to bring his church together to bring a church to a place in this day beyond Lutheran and Methodist and Pentecostal into a place to adoption it and rapture Grace and when that one this part of the church when the spirit moves in this church here it'll just raise and it'll bring forth all the redeemed that's been touched by that spirit and those losers who stood there with all the light they had and justification and those Methodists that fell on the floor and throwed water in their face from the spirit striking them through sanctification those Pentecostals that walked up and down the streets and they call them tongues demons and jabbers and goofs language and all of that they'll stand in the righteousness in the sight of God is that day just as certain as the Bible stands here if you believe me to be a servant you call me as prophet I don't call myself that but listen I'm telling you in the name of the Lord those entering Christ will God bring with him as his coming and his resurrection and those only those that are in Christ so there's got a cup of church to majority there's got to be a people with balance right here at this end time that walks in balance that are not on the extreme one way or the other are you with me and that's what God is loading to adopt is a people a church that he can cause to raise higher and end them raising higher they bring as their brethren I tell you it's about time that comes a call out of this bride that says to the people before us raise up a man and they raise up and they say that their brother raised up over the to verse seven ages they all rise we are in resurrection tower and there must be a mature Church a man who are who is an adopted people who are people who knows a god of people who does exploits are you with me now now this is very important when God proves remember on the individual with God proves and God loves when a man proves and God loves him he takes him out some word himself following the Roman custom of adoption there in the front of angels he does something for him he lifts him there in the presence of God this is what the message is to do for you is to lift you up and around higher I meant it's to advance you on this highway I managed to bring you in the glory it's not to leave you here at ground level it's to bring you at the glory and matter where the people reaches there they're gonna be calling their brother there's going to be a resurrection are you with me Church he lifts him he lifts him up there in the presence of God and gives him and feels him and sets him out that's the age we are living in I want to get it to you that's the age we're living we're living it more than a dip of the spirit or measure of Christ or a measure of the word we're in the day and the hour where the fullness has come the fullness of the word with the fullness of the Spirit to bring a church to Maternity now again the same Holy Spirit II said that saved the Lutheran sanctified the Methodist baptize of Pentecostals is now setting in order coming of the Lord Jesus how many believes this and then when it'll be so powerful that body will come into this group of the church that and draw the rest of them from the grain there'll be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is far that's why we have come back to this homeland back to the Holy Ghost is so that there can be a resurrection so there can be a meeting in the air so there can't be a rapture hi ma'am now the church should be a full age now it's preaching about this last Sunday and I hope you got it would but beautiful term I was using that word full term this is the church now we're coming down to this church not just this individual church but the bride worldwide it must be a fully now we're here I just want to say we are here already we have arrived to the place where that the Sousa Street people came 50 years ago we have now had our 50 years hey man we have a it's it's jubilee time and brother madam said if that child was obedient then there was a certain day would it be come of age now the Pentecostal church ought to be of that age 40 years old or better or 50 so it should be of age so he talks about the Pentecostal church they should be of age they're about 40 or 50 years of age listen when I started out with the message 15 year old boy preacher man I thought this was it I thought you know the rapture should come any moment I had no idea that that just by receiving the message though that that wasn't good what God had in mind he wanted he wanted every name that was on the book and there was more than had to be manifested there was more that had to come and we are carried now where we're coming down we'd be another Jubilee we're here with comer our 50 years pastor open another seven silver that are 50 years past 1965 we're weird fillets and God is going to adopt a people he's gonna he's gonna take a people and grant that people know we're not talking about individuals though that's true with individuals but I'm talking about the church he's going to give them a new robe come on he's going to change them come on the redemption of our bodies is that right he's gonna give us new bodies he's gonna give us a new robe the drunk driving by your place watching you rake the leaves I see I see brother butts out there it is brother butts but it's his brother drawn but brother Lovett butts we put him away in the grave here's something some years ago you know and I see time ticking along we're moving down we're not you know we're not young we're not young kids anymore and I want to say about the church now and I'm not just even talking about this church but I'm talking about the bride worldwide she's not she's not just a young church no more she should be a mature church and so it should be of age now if you come to age and your behavior does not meet there the adoption requirements you don't get the robe you don't have be handed the keys and back to the matter agent goes to tribulation so either either we come to maturity or we don't come to maturity if we come we go on a rapture if we don't we go we go right right on into tribulation because we're to end I want to I want to just quote do another brother branham assay and here you him that child did not obey it was not about Father's business God would raise him up another son a man couldn't get loser to maturity couldn't get him to go on God raised up another son the Methodists he couldn't get them to go on God raised up Azusa Street another son he couldn't you know they was in too extreme they wouldn't keep a balance they wouldn't come into maturity and God raised up another but after this they ain't no more listen what he said he says that's what he's done through the ages raising a polluter raisin of a Methodist raising up a Nazarene raising up a pilgrim whole ants raising up of Pentecost he will keep on raising and raising and raising until he gets one but we're out of Aegeus we're out of messages we're out of angels I'm not talking about heavenly angels I'm talking about the seven angels we got the last message the last messenger darn no more to cover you with me he'll keep raising and raising and raising until he gets one I hope to least see that church I hope they'll live to see that church when she raises in the power and the beauty of the Resurrection with the powers of God working to her sons and wonders following the believers like it did in the New Testament God in his power and his might oh how wonderful now that's the kind of church rather random look for and that's the kind of church we must be and here we are at the end time and listen look the look where the world is the world is sitting right in Sodom condition with enough firepower with enough atomic energy with enough dynamic power is somebody with me now with enough nuclear wealth on the firepower to burn the whole world and fulfilled Malekith for that the earth shall burn is another layer there Israel is over in their homeland they are there I'd say bride where are we to be ma'am I'm speaking to this church but I'm also speaking to the world where are we to be what are the church to be not to be a church I mature Church but people who know their God of people who have eaten this book but people who are prophesied again of people who are going for than power of the Resurrection and can I just say it is happening it's happening we're just we have just seen the very edge of what God is beginning to do but I say oh god don't let some immaturity keep us out of it but let us be a mature Church an anointed Church and anointed people Russia says he has a mother of all bombs the rub nation North Korea has been working quietly and previously now threatens the world our mountain is coming hey man it's coming the few fires the little fires we see in California ain't nothing like what's going to strike the nation any mountain so it's in this hour and this time when that's their setting ready easels over there setting ready to receive this word mmm but now notice brother brendensen but now when we need it the Spirit of God raises a standard and what is he's poured in a spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave or under the altar as the scripture says crying how long Lord how long how much longer God is waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church in Christ becomes so close together till Christ becomes visible among us and raises our dead and we go in the rapture we should be no I know I'm bringing not just to the church here but to thee to the to the bride movement worldwide he said why would you concern yourself outside of your own shirts I'll tell you why because even the light Tabernacle cannot go in a rapture till they're ready to go to and no matter how we think we're prepared we cannot go until every predestinated seed has reached that point of maturity that God has ordained for them that's why we're concerned with the rest of the world we should have been matured and ripened in the presence of the Sun and got all the immaturity out of us a long time ago but instead now here's here's what he was talking with the Pentecostal church who is of age he's trying to get them to this point I wonder I wonder what would be said about the movement today the tudor reporting back to the father remember the tutors the Holy Ghost now not to gods is just is just a scenario is showing using a type here's the Holy Spirit wooing calling sending word messages tutoring we've been well taught there'd be you know gone are the days go to the days of the reel-to-reel tapes were that you listen to those tapes and you couldn't go back and find where you what you heard before gone are the days of the other cassette tapes where you know a library of them were were $10,000 unaffordable you know go to the day's listen the message is in your hands I like something sister Helen said the other day to me you know when some were asking about you know I'm investing you know wondering what brother Tim would think about his investment in marijuana nobody should have to ask me that seriously you gotta ask me you don't know that where you been where you been what's what's on the tapes just listen to the tapes man I shouldn't have to tell you that you ought to know that hey man but oh to dead but today you know we wound up you know the church where it should be down so far down the road and it ain't because we don't have resources it ain't because we don't have the teaching or the message to turn the heart it's because the people have refused and just they just turned it into another Church meeting or another another gathering or whether social event this is not a social event I mean this is not another denominational gather this is where the body of Christ the church the bride meets together in heavenly places to hear the words and the here it's a slide but instead to church all separated and divided arguing and fussing disputing over little petty differences unbelief unthankful unholy without even natural affection when we should be in love with the father this is what brother Branham was talking about Zack forty fifty year old church bring it up today oh we are arrogant and dilatory and arguing our little religious differences splitting hairs and such nonsense our character are fussing fighting making a dick making differences separating Brotherhood there's no fellowship among they're jealous of each other I read what he said this is what this is what God was saying of the Pentecostal church mana and and the reason why they couldn't have the rapture I know what just said of me his children are separated by denominational barriers think about that and you think of denominations just being on there's something that's got a name and in a certain building there's got a certain headquarters no that ain't yet denomination is anything any Kingdom that sets us up up against the word and you could be a one-man denomination in fact of the matter is I want to just tell you you know you got that there are those that are indicted that was not in denomination because brother Brennan said I indict this generation and he said the denominations and many of the independence one of the ones who itself I'm not a denomination brother praise God we know we believe the message okay well then whoa what is all this separation I mean what is all this splitting hairs what is all this perverse teaching around you know at first at first you know in the message case he corrected false doctrines but unconverted men using their gifts have taken the message and perverted for the purpose of kingdom building they man they're even teaching perverse things that the days of miracles is past now can you imagine Tim can you imagine perverse things that God taught only brother Branham could pray for this thing oh you're not to have paralyzed oh we're not to sing only believe you know cuz that's brother Branham so all these other ideas that came along which were which were barriers and fences and denominational movement's member not walls and man Traverse things are you with me that the days of miracles are past well they better not be past we need miracles in this church this mortar we need divine healing but we also need soul healing which is even a greater divine healing hey man oh he said how they've made will accepted man-made dogma doctrine instead of the Bible the truth perverted right to them and they turn their backs and excuse me the truth presented right to them and they turned their backs and walk away from it there you are because their organization don't believe it and they know it's the Word of God and no other scripture in the Bible but that if it's truly the Word of God it'll be from Genesis to Revelation to be the same thing so so he says they build a tower that they thought that their organization could draw the whole world to them what about these towers that men have built that if you don't come here you're not gonna make it what Oh what about these towers if you're not on my hookup I think you better be on the hook-up you better be hooked up with Christ man and the holy spirit flowing down through your life that's the hook-up you need to be on a man but you but again you know they built himself a tower that they thought through their organization that can draw the whole world to them the truth presented right to them and they turn their backs and walk away from it there you are because their organization don't believe it your children can't even agree with one another long enough to have a meeting and then that's the truth you're not a meeting like we had the other day you know we're men of God what would become and preached under anointed and believers that claim to believe the same message wouldn't dare even gather in the same building with you how in the world is that going to come option how in that world or are they you know how in the world will with this kind of immaturity get us anywhere ecclesiastical walls petty differences we're broke up as bad as any of them not to do this is what I'm saying let me just say it we're broke up as bad as any other can't fellowship we've got these one man or two men organizations which are just as bad as one that numbers in the thousands and then littered around every message Church in there in every in every community there's little groups that refuse to fellowship and support a work of God I wonder what's gonna be one day when you have to give an account when you have to fast and before God and explain why I'm an men you know yeah I think about it kind of like this you know with people with their own little ideas you know there was a man one time that they say was discovered on an island he had been all over shipwrecked in that sea for years and years and years and thought he would never be found and finally one day he was discovered on this island so they were looking around to see how he has sustained himself so he was showing him the little different of us that he had and he said here's my house where I lived all right that's wonderful I don't you got three buildings here what's that 100 that's my church yeah okay you know that's where I go to worship right there that's my church I built that church for worship and as well what's that other buildings and that's where I used to go to church and that's about the way it is can't get along with yourselves so self-centered come on where's this maturity that we're going to need for a rapture I meant wait we separate over songs and over music and over Christmas over fellowship halls and you know we use quotes for reasons why or not to fellowship and divide rather than to bring us together hey man while brother Adam said when he when Satan get someone failing to to operate with the church someone failing and pulling off and getting it different that's a cancer in the church it's a devil in that person that's right and it closes the whole church to be sick over the best thing to do is how I was a spiritual operation oh man listen listen I I don't want to call anybody shucks and I don't want anybody to be said in fact as I say if that's where you are in your experience come on up you you know apply in the plant it can't change that from being a shock to a grain but you can I mean you if that's where you're at because there is a separation that is going on in this day but it isn't the grain that's pulling away it's this shop pulling away from the grain and when you see the pulling away and the perverse teaching you can see it ain't nothing but shock and like I said you know I'm not condemning if you're shuck come on up you don't have to remain there hey man as his brother Brandon would say and thirst him for life the pleasure of a Christian is serving the Lord at the house of the Lord you don't have to sign no cards you can't open the door quick enough what he's referring to that he said he had a pastor friend who was having trouble getting people to come to church now you know we used to didn't have that problem but a message stirred I'm now by default a senior pastor in the message so these young kid young kids these young men call me and say brother Tim you know what go what to do I can't get people to come to church so that won't come a winds tonight and have them are going on Sunday and you know they're they're out you know with Leo to see you you know one's got the other ones got this to do and one others got that to do and they're pleased you're mad and crazy we can't hardly even have Church 97 Shane used to that's what we pointed back to denomination and said that matter used to be there all the time out on cruises and hunting trips and this and that and the other and missing the house of God but anymore is right here in the message hey man well go ahead you can remember to bring your rail rotten tomatoes so next Sunday if you forgot them this morning and you need them man the play you know it ought not be it ought not be it ought not be that movies have come back in the church I'm talking about in the homes it ought not be that we're feeding on this vomit of the world when we got a message and we're told he decked up so he was talking about cards he said have another pastor said to him I can't get my people to come to church so he said now he says you know I get them to come on Christmas or I get him to come on Easter rather and I wish them Merry Christmas because I won't see him till next Easter so he said I've got to where he said you know lately he said I've come up with something then I started mailing out to all my people for them to check on their card and Mail back to me that they would try to attend a couple of Sunday's I was out of the month and some brother branham said you know he said to brother branham he said whoa whoa what are you doing for yours he says um he said you got a big crowd that's been coming on wins tonight and you know you got people there and for prayer-meeting and Sunday and they're packed out with what are you doing he said oh I give them pills satine's what kind of pills he said Gospels we get him so in love with Jesus they can't stay away he said the brother and sisters hug each other and cry or that sisters hug the sisters brother and her brother and they cry on each other's shoulder crying ah you know that day is gonna be so long before they meet together again hey man but then you know and you can remember when that fervency was in the church and God bless you some of you hey I know you is still there you're driving our to church and you you're-you're here faithful and I'm not knocking you and I'm not knocking anybody I'm talking about the spiritual environment that is going on in this last day of the Leodis zeal spirit that wants to take over the body and if the members love one another instead of just mid put a little clicks and pulling away from the church if you love one another so much it just hurts your heart until you get together again that's the way it should be hey ma'am you know God God is gonna happen all that people he's going to somehow another get a pride out of this mess I don't know how he's gonna do it but there's somebody gonna come to Maternity that's somebody gonna walk down the middle of the road brother Brendan would say and this goes back to Timothy sermon Wednesday night great sermon God is able of these stones to rise children to Abraham's God's able to heal an opossum or fish or anything if he will bring his message forth and the people won't believe it God can raise up a possum - believe it hallelujah God can raise a dead fish he can raise a dead opossum he can do anything he wants to but what a rebuke to this generation when they stumble over it and fuss about it and said you didn't do this and didn't do that and God sent a simple animal in I wonder one day when we when some of us get there even a little opossum won't be a witness against us he cared that possum came to the prophet of God the possum came for healing come on and many of the church members you know they got they're too busy to do something else you know let me just ask the question what are men accomplishing were these little cliques what are you what are you doing are you accomplishing anything for the kingdom of God you just want to ask you your little clique one or two three four or maybe a little family group or whatever how many souls are you baptizing how many are getting filled with the Holy Ghost what kind of mission outreach are you having so then is what you're doing fulfilling the Great Commission is it sending the gospel out to every nation kindred tongue and people is it accomplishing that well I'll tell you if you're they've accomplished and that I would get out of that click and find something with life in it it's gotta have the power of God moving in it amen brother we've got to come together where there is healing where there is miracles where there a soul saved where there are people baptized where the gospel is preached where missions are set out it's gotta be alive but oh we pull away because sermon they just the way we like it or Church order isn't done a certain way or the song service and choice of song ain't our taste random said in rejected king the holy spirit wants us to have no fences no boundary lines he wants us to be one in him we are children brothers God doesn't separate his children I'll give them one would give this when cornbread and beans another ice-cream and pie he doesn't do that he doesn't let this one starve to death in the other he feeds them all at the same table the Holy Spirit should lead the church I wouldn't sit in a place where I was starving a man come to the fountain come to a place find somewhere God's gotta have somebody somewhere a man but they don't want it that way that one the King don't wanna be like the rest of the world when the Pentecostal church the Holy Spirit first fell 50 something years ago if they just would have let it alone and let God add the church daily as what would be saved it would been like the APUs it was an apostolic age but we had to draw fences we had to be like the rest of them with the Methodists as a denomination we must be and here somebody come along Jesus is coming on a white cloud no he's coming on the white horse oh all right we'll just separate and get me a group you get a group and what difference what difference does it make he said he's coming in how it doesn't matter how he's come in to think of it is are you ready to go with him when it comes that's the main thing don't matter how he comes what for me comes in unless just be ready to go but they split hairs on little bitty things and form another organization and that's just the way the world did it so then he goes on is it and then how they're making fun of your people that's been called out and filled with the Holy Ghost they don't believe in the supernatural anymore these are the tutors report about a church that it's trying to get to me nerdy and then they they they're making fun of your people that's been called out and filled with the spirit they don't believe in the supernatural anymore oh listen brother Branham would that in the message respects sometimes you know we ought to just go and just listen to some of these sermons respects how you ought to respect he said even maybe you don't think it's exactly right respect it you don't exactly agree with it you think it's a little he said respect it and God in the in the same way will respect you in return amen so he said when we received the Holy Ghost is not shaking hands with your pastor receiving the Holy Ghost is receiving Christ into you because he's God's messenger for the day the Holy Ghost is God's messenger and we must respect him when he comes don't say he look at that woman shouting there and crying and tears run running up down her cheeks look at that man there shaking his hands and trembling and crying you know what that is that's a bunch of what evolution listen you're blaspheming the Holy Ghost you've got to respect that I wonder how many have blaspheme seeing God move and see him God working and seeing the supernatural come down amen but because he wasn't do a song you approved up or you didn't like this or you didn't like that or you didn't like how long the preacher preached and you saw that you wind up making fun of the whole thing and blaspheming and calling it of the devil listen the Holy Ghost is not a sensation the Holy Ghost it is the Spirit of God a in action in you and that Holy Spirit and action will cause you to keep the Word of God oh man it's not it's a life it's not a motion it's not of fleshly evidence but it's the person Jesus Christ the Word of God established in your heart to quicken every word of this age so you see it's got to be an action he said not so much in demonstrations but and man so again we we have a restored truth we have the restored truths of the new birth you may remember Jesus originally used that term it was it was his first doctrine that he preached in John chapter 3 and verse 3 he said verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God this is Jesus first doctrine so the new birth that was taught by Jesus can only come by true repentance may public by water baptism which is an outward confession of an inward happening and then by receiving the Holy Spirit this is why he says in verse 5 when he explains it because Nicodemus wondered how can this be so he said in verse 5 verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God so Jesus would when he would say this it was a it was promised tillie yet a promise for the Holy Spirit had not yet been given and the Holy Spirit would not come until a future date on the day of Pentecost amen when the Spirit of God would be poured out for the first time on all flesh yeah I understand you know there were men in the Bible that would called filled with the spirit who were anointed by the Holy Ghost but the attina could not come tabernacle man until the change of a nature come and until that old nature was killed and wiped out the deity of Christ could not come into him so he could anoint men of the Old Testament about but to be truly filled as in the term of the New Testament it was impossible until Calvary and when Jesus died on the cross and when he his spirit his life he was here that nature came back to dwell in man again remember the blood of Old Testament could not remit sin are you with me it could not prepare a man he couldn't it was as brother Brennan said there was only one birth under the Old Testament so therefore you had to be born in the lineage of Abraham because there's only one birth but he said in the new birth that's not true we have another birth now that brings out all the cause hallelujah now so again you see he would say in John 7 2013 8 he that believeth on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water so again if you believe on him as the scripture says to believe on him then when there's that true faith on the inside when there's a reality of a living God then out of your innermost being will flow rivers of living water but this he spake of the Spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost has not yet given because Jesus is not yet glorified and jesus told His disciples remember to wait in Jerusalem until they receive this promise from the father let's look in the Luke chapter 24 49 hey man I've got just a little further to go in fact I got a lot further to go but I don't know how far on this highway we'll get today I wish we'd get to glory man Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tarry that means wait in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high now they had believed on the Lord they'd even been they've even were and went through works of sanctification but they needed that power the powerful to live an overcoming victorious life now what they had before Pentecost did not bring conversion because of Luke 22:31 he said Simon behold Satan has desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I prayed for you 22:32 and that you'd that faith fail not and with our converted strengthen that brother amen so you know here was Peter a liar he was a Peter but a betrayer yourself I 101 who would would deny the Lord somebody with me curse but he needed something that would hold him in an hour of trial and he didn't have it hey man Jesus that I prayed for you that your faith fail not and when you are converted because this is a fruit of Jesus Prayer I gotta get this one to Pentecost because if I don't get him to Pentecost he will have a life of failure all the time even though he believes on me and he confesses me and Savior he needs that in Douma of power to give him and overcome in life a man when you are converted strengthen your brother God hiding himself in simplicity Jesus told Peter the night of the material he was already saved now if you're converted strengthen your brethren that's right you accepted Christ as your Savior but when you're converted is when you're really changed that's right and he wasn't changed yet he cursed before the Lord he denied him and everything but after his conversion after thou art converted strengthen your brethren is that right that's what the scripture says that makes it right Jesus told Peter that followed him cast out Devils done miracles everything you're not converted yet but after you're converted didn't strengthen your brethren there was not a new birth until Jesus himself was filled with the Holy Spirit and then from that Holy Spirit there he himself there gave it on the day of Pentecost for man to receive of the Spirit of God it was impossible before that time now that's 1:8 and you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem you know how your witness a guy's not a witness that said well I have a friend that said I he saw that act and that accident out there you're not a witness your friend is the witness you're not the witness in order to be a witness it had to happen to you it had to be your experience and that's exactly what it is you cannot have Mama's experience daddys experience pastors experience you must have your own experience are you with me hey man so so again I'm you shall be witnesses first chapter 2 verse 1 when the day of Pentecost was fully come that we're all in one Accord and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of fire as it sat upon each one them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and begin to speak with tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance now this is where it was this is what everybody knew was the new birth oh man you had to have all three elements of yet on the water the blood and the spirit and then you had to be justified in other words you had to make a profession of faith and say I believe Christ is my Savior and in that day to profess Christ menu and you can be crucified and man you could be under terrible persecution today it's a popular thing today oh yeah I believe Jesus - I accept him as Savior it's more than that it's more than a mental conception man here it is our repentance our turning around and receiving the Spirit of God in your life that's the new birth water blood and spirit hey man notice um dude during the Dark Ages of truth in a new birth become lost and the new birth becomes only comes only by being baptized and the true new birth comes only by being baptized filled sealed with the Holy Ghost but during the ages this truth was gradually lost and God then restored it back again one step at a time the Catholic Church would start out saying in order to be born into a Catholic family on a you know makes you automatically a Christian and being baptized as an infant into the church that was all this necessary for salvation early Baptist believers realize the need for a person to be baptized as an adult and so they they were called rebaptised began the end and these revived toddlers became born-again when they were baptized after making a public confession of Jesus as Savior by baptism with the my immersion so to the Baptist born-again meant making a public confession Martin Luther you know brought about a Reformation declaring faith as the method of being justified or declared righteous by God he brought it away that dude penance crawling on your hands and knees and praying and saying the Hail Marys that that would not save you works would not do it you're justified by faith you're declared righteous by faith but simply believing you receive Christ as your personal Savior and then then again you know it goes on the method has come along and and they said well you know that's true but you've got to live a holy life too and so if something's got to happen to you for this holiness to come and after you have believed on Christ and they actually called it the second blessing but again it was not the new birth as Jesus taught it then Pentecost come along and they said in the Souza's free well you got to speak in tongues like today don't they a Pentecost and many of them spoke in other tongues and they said this is a new birth and it wasn't it was receiving a gift of the Spirit and not the spirit himself and they would get overjoyed and speak in tongues and shout and jump and still cheat on their on their wife or their husband are you with me I don't mean all of them they were godly people in all of these movements are you with me but many of them did speak in tongues just like this said and could live right why it wasn't the Holy Ghost he was a gift of the Spirit but the message of Malachi for is somebody with me now and then this message is to turn the heart a man to bring the people back to the original faith and my three original new birth now here we come right now you know the Baptist said well like you know like maybe some of them on the day of Pentecost well we've waited so many days now and and we waited long enough I I believe I believe with witnesses accepted by faith but no he said you know wonder that one of the others said uh-huh wait a minute it ain't no except about faith he said we would get power the Holy Ghost would come and it ain't count let's wait a little longer a man and so so get again brother Branham said wouldn't you seek the Holy Ghost you do the same hey man yeah you wait a little longer I'm going to you're filled with the Holy Spirit till you're dead to sin he said you can't accept it my praise you have to accept Christ by faith that's exactly right and you accept the Holy Ghost by faith but then let the Holy Spirit come and give the circumcision as a witness that he has accepted your faith a man so he said we must wait on the Holy Spirit is somebody with me now until it's done something hello until it's done something not necessary cuz we spoke in tongues not because we dance now because we got emotional or we shout it but until we are changed until something actually happening I don't care what form it comes in just so it happens that's the main thing and my people people are looking for something oh well I speaking on when I shout well I'd answer well we'll have this chill or will I have this sensation or you know I'll I just believe I'm just gonna believe I got it no wait until it's done something until your life is changed you're a new creature in Christ and if your life has been changed what they rejoice in that I'm on quit whining and pouting and worrying and fearing if your life has been changed and your heart is set on Calvary and your dare in the middle of the road quit the whining and the crime and the worrying and the fear and believe that God has done what he said hey man when he the person the immortal spirit of Christ comes your personal Savior and changes you and throws your views here's what you want your views straight in the Calvary to this word then something happens something has happened no one will have to tell you about it you'll know when it happens it is an emotion no emotion accompanies it it isn't sensation though it is sensational now here again remember we started out the holy ghosts without them the mystery of the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation now watch this and this is a sixth seal some months later now in the seals here all it is it isn't emotion let's get it straight what the Holy Ghost is not it is not a shout it is not a jump let's go to the other side it's not even an education into the message it's not a profession of faith the Holy Ghost is not that the Holy Ghost is not tongues that's a gift from the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not a holy dance you can dance and dance in the spirit the real spirit and still not have the Holy Ghost it is not a sensation but it is sensational it is not an emotion but it has emotion with it you cannot get it and not know it now you might be taught wrong and you know therefore be confused but you can't you can't have it and something not have happen to you here again it is in the seal book I didn't finish it here all it is it is an emotion though emotion a convincing it just like I said smoking drinking isn't sin it's the attribute of sin it shows you don't believe but when you truly believe in your heart and you know that on the basis of where you're sitting there you accept it with all your heart something's gonna happen right there it's gonna happen then you can stand as a witness to it that something happened oh man it happens an inmate every kind of different forms as brother man said I don't care how you get it just as long as you get it you said what I want to sign by the gym well you will believe the word hey man you welcome subject to it it'll cause an accident you and Anna bring your body septic to the Holy Ghost somebody help me preach hey man he'll make you agree with the word hey man now again you know that the Methodist said when we sounded we had it but they didn't the Nazarene said they lived holy they had it but they didn't the pinnacles who said we speak in tongues we got it but they didn't god unfolding himself not in sensations that's sensations yet with it you see the place he just gets it so humble till anybody can see any of you if you don't try to put inject your own mind to it and your own thoughts it's God so you see God unfold in himself not in a sensation but in sensations with it now what is this sensation a feeling something happens I've been touched by deity well I got it and didn't know it well you mean you got it and it didn't change you you got it and end was the same person now all the time and just pretend you got it no you got it if you got it it changed and that's what you want to look for in your life not how high you jump at the altar not how much you speak in other tongues and you are the one is vegan tongues Paul said so Paul said I would did you all spoke in tongues rather than she prophesied a man for big mouth speaking in tongues you ought to desire spiritual gifts but listen even though that should be your desire that then your gift is not is is not your evidence the evidence you're looking for is your walking dead this road calling from both sides not fanatic not legal balanced are you with me now brother branham's head in world falling apart in 63 you people stand-in here now look don't you rely upon some emotion although it has emotions with it you see we come to a point where that the church goes all the way to extreme well we just accept the message and believe it well no that's just being able to read the tokens got to be on display the life of Christ has to be on display to be attained on display in your life you ain't got it the blood hadn't been shed and been hadn't been applied for you all right now so again he tells he tells us in the deceive Church by the world the reason people go on enjoy an organization substitute a handshake instead of the new birth they're wantin to bypass a new birth they don't want the new birth and they know we teach it in the Bible so they want to substitute something for it and if Pentecostal people are just as bad trying to substitute something they want it in class it must be so classy we shake hands and join the church and be sprinkled and baptized or something they're afraid of the new birth and I believe sometimes I sometimes believe that Branum Tabernacle is getting afraid of it now we know all what a birth is I don't care where it is or whereabouts it's a mess if a baby is born on a ship pile on a hard floor and a pink decorator Hospital roof it's a mess anyway a bare birth of the cat births of anything is a mess and the new birth is nothing less mess but people get so starchy we'll go over here where they SiC hands we'll go over here where they don't ball and cry and beat on the altar and cry out you don't want to be too we want to you want to be too human what we need is birth down out to bring forth spiritual bring forth life now do you see now this is unchanged you come all the way down to birth pains in 1965 this whole thought is unchanged he said a baby if it's just born by still birth no sound no emotion that's a dead baby and that's what's a matter with the church today the system we got too many stillborn children and I'm gonna say it again this is why we have had fallen away around the message people walking back out in the world to send the smoking drinking or denomination or whatever why because too many stillborn babies and the Turks they didn't come all the way to Calgary they didn't come all the way doing the breath of God came in their relevance of what they need is a gospel spanking amen like a baby when it's born if it doesn't bring the doctor sakes expects it does something try to get it breathing oh man the old-fashioned doctor would just give it he would call it a protoplasm a stimulation posterior stimulation and he get that baby there to move in and respond in reaction crying out man he said you cry out in the night no language a man whatever we can't have stillborn children he would go right over to the place and and and and listen if you think this is is it not a problem in message churches today you're you're mistaken and man we found that we have had an s full of rotten eggs and we've made them deacons and trustees and preachers and everything else and gave them position and everything else and we found out that they were never with the make I meant so therefore they are nests full of rotten egg now then the Burstyn and causing to speak everywhere spread around the internet and everywhere else us speaking the churches separation and problems everywhere why because people didn't get with the mate they didn't receive that german life on the inside of them and it produced a hybrid christian a hybrid product that ever little just sees it comes along they catch it every little spiritual disease it comes along they they're affected by it pulled over here and they're unstable but a genuine original plant does not have to be sprayed bugs won't get on it is it's not you know it's if that hothouse plant he said that you have to have two sprays and what you need is an old rigid is an original old digging out and tearing down a man as i said let's not clean out the nest and start over again that's right you can make deacons out of them but everything else but they'll never do no good pat him on the back and call him brother but until they're born again of the spirit of god they're just a nest full of rotten eggs and it'll never hatch we need the baptism of the holy ghost and he said i don't mean a dry handshake in other words I don't need you somebody I believe the message we need to dine out we need an old-fashioned birth remember sin becomes dead and myth as midnight a man now so again remember isn't it's neither side scholarly or emotional it's the middle of the road a man some some will get right there and and not ever make the middle of the road but the middle road is a sane sensible born-again spirit led endowed Church of living God going straight down the road to Christ the real one coming from the both sides one went one way - and went the other chose fanaticism either scholarly too stiff to bow and then know more about the word than they know about the author - no the word is not life but to know his life to know him you don't have to be a scholar you have to be a submitted person hey man now just in case you're wondering brother Branham felt like it was safer to err on the fanatical side then it was on the scholarly stiff starchy side where ninety percent a message churches happened to be falling off today you don't think so brother Brent's talked about he said I'm more of a fraid of a person that's afraid then I am the person that is a fanatic oh my I'd rather have a little wildfire then no fire at all sure I would I'd rather be around a fire that's popping and jumping anytime if the world's cold than to be around an iceberg don't pay to fire you get you can't get one by painted fire you've got to have some real fire so many of us would pay the fire you know this is what happened 40 years ago brother we gotta have that same fire right here in our church we can talk about the pillar of fire brother Brendan's meeting the pillars I better be in this meeting oh man your honor being leading the church today moving among the people healing the sick casting out Devils [Applause] bringing people to Christ you say well I'm afraid I'll get a little fanatic brother branham's word I'd rather have a little fanaticism than to be still and do nothing I sure would said I was preaching one night the woman got to screaming and shouting said a Baptist brother told me next day I was enjoying your message Billy until that woman got to screaming I said you know what it made children down my back he's a brother you're living the quietest world you'll ever live in if you go to hell there's gonna be weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth if you go to heaven there's going to be screaming and shouting all the time what man he said that made chills run down your back what will it do when you get to heaven while you're freeze to death when you get there you'll be so out of place and man we ought to be in here the way we would be in heaven we oughta what's appear like they do in heaven we ought to sing here like the sing in heaven we are to dance and shout like they do in heaven hallelujah he said God is an object of worship and he said heaven you'd be so out of plow out of place for even angels where their wings over their face and hands over their feet and over their face and singing holy holy holy Lord God Almighty holy holy holy you think it was a quite holy holy holy no it was screaming until the post of the temple were moved by the power of their voice well tell you not to be in the Church of God whether such a scream goes out from the turkey get that post move the people move the stubborn heart smooth huzzah everything is move holy gasps beep hey man Oh God is a mom being of worship God is worshipped worship how now listen to this and get rebuked by it and then if anything I honor the Pentecostal people far is to let loose and worship God there are me listen what he said then if anything if anything for any reason I honor the Pentecostal people for is to let loose and worship God what about that you backslidden mushy people today don't know how to turn loose and worship the Living God amen God is the king of kings and the Lord of lords and he deserves our worship back he deserves our praise your your prophet said the reason the reason people don't believe in shouting but will scream in a ballgame is because women top such things have been kept away from the glory of the presence of the Lord Jesus that gives him that satisfied portion hallelujah hallelujah it oughta make the joy bells rolled down on the inside amen to know we've been called to worship hey man brother Branham would talk about the nightingale he said I heard an old Nightingale would sing outside my window and he said he would just sing to the top of his voice at night and he said I got to readin upon him and he said the reason when I've ever studied him said the nightingale and when he sings he looks around and he sees one star and as long as he can see one star could be a dark cloudy dismal night but a nightingale will start singing if he can just see one star he will sing at the top of his voice why he said he knows the sun is shining somewhere and saving on that star so he sings oh ma he said if I can hear one good old-fashioned a man if I can hear something take place I can sing to the top of my voice to know that Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever as long as the light is movement that's long if we can see a star and he said oh I think so let God let me sometimes when the the Bills of darkness are rolling over sometimes when the revival seems like all they want is to be formal and ungodly and but he said once Allah I can hear a good old fashioned amen glory to God and I said glory to God the Son it sounded somewhere hallelujah what makes a real believer shall a man that caught a glimpse of the Sun hallelujah and the sun is shining on that they can see there's a light in the evening time but it's not all doctorís but it's a time of light I feel like everything I've done is background it's time to preach third by this time the preachers time to declare hey man he said well I can hear a good old hearty Amen and once in a while hallelujah or somebody jump up and scream and cry a little bit i know the sun is shining somewhere well he said it gives you a real good feeling I'm starting to get a real good feeling close the light is beginning to shine the darkness we're the people who claim to be in the interval in the holiest of Holies brother Branham says here he said I know you think we're an awful noisy bunch well brother I can prove to you if if there ain't no Z then there ain't no God there oh my take that some of you morgues out there I meant if there's any life and there you ought to listen to that I can prove to you if it ain't noisy then there ain't no God there listen no Testament when Aaron anointed with the roses Sharon and when he had the northern oil that run down his bill of his beard to the hymns of His garment he taken that sacrifice who wasn't the holiest of holies when he went beyond the curtain across the garment he had a pomegranate and a bale a pomegranate a bell so they hip together and when he walked it played out holy holy holy unto the Lord he said that's the anointed church moving into the Holies of Holies and lookie here brother the reason they did that that's the only way they could tell he was alive talking about the breach they listened to hear if there was any noise and if there was no noise he was dead and that's what's today a church that's born again going into the Holies of Holies anointed with God's pomegranate bill yes sir you know I don't know what about you but I don't want to become a morgue with our temperature down 40 below zero and cut full of some kind of embalming fluid but some kind of of something that will keep you dinner than what you already are with the joy of the Lord if it comes our strength some of them said well brother Brennan it's emotional well I can scientifically prove to you anything without emotion is dead so if your religion hasn't got any emotion bury the thing that's right because it's no good it's dead hey man now these are the works of Christ that will live in you not a sensation but the works of Christ he said again greater than Solomon there's something about the working of the Holy Spirit that always stirs up a move it brings the emotional part of the people out amen again said last evening when I seen those people coming around from the balconies and around weeping standing around the altar accepting Christ their Savior I'll tell you there's something emotional when the Holy Spirit sweeps out of over across an audience see their face light up with some kind of radiance that this world can never produce nothing like it to see a little house woman with a little checkered dress on some bashful she couldn't meet the insurance man at the door and stand and sing the praises of God it's emotional God moves in that and it stirs up an interest a man oh he talks about when you're born again there's an enthusiasm with that birth that sets the soul of fire you think that changed well in the easter cele said I think we must never lose i really azzam amen then again again I want to write I want to read one more quote to you before we try to find a place to stop here but in Palma Lucas in caterpillar where brother Branham talks about the meeting the bugs eating off to the leaves in the bark and everything and God promised a restoration he says I say this my beloved people listen to me I'll spend with you some day in the day of judgment I have to answer I'll never answer to a Creed so help me God I'll answer to the Bible that's the book I'll stand by there is no place in the Bible is everybody everybody hook up with me you know listen in real close tidying right now there is no place in the Bible where they ever receive the Holy Ghost without having emotional speaking with tongues and shoutings and praises of God and prophecies and manifestation they never do and just walk up and shake hands with the preacher and walk away there's no place in the Bible like that hey mouth you see the Holy Ghost gives you an assurance now that we're dismissing winds tonight so let me grab a little bit of that time there bar and winds tonight hey man this is a Thanksgiving banquet right here hallelujah the Holy Ghost he comes with much assurance and that proves your election let's turn to verse Thessalonians 1 and for I want to go through some scriptures because brother Branham said there's no place in the Bible so there's no place in the Bible for any doctrine that says you can have the Holy Ghost not know it so therefore is without feeling no way you could know it there's no place in the Bible verse s lunians 1 for knowing beloved brethren beloved your election of God first of all you can know your election how do you know your election well I tell you my mom dad told me that because I believe the message you know that I'm predestinated and I and because only predestination can receive this knowing brethren beloved your election of God first right for our gospel came not unto you am the word only here's how you know your election it's know because we've received the gospel there's not just a lecture a word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and then what much assurance so the Holy Ghost comes with much assurance not something you guess I wonder about now if you go to compare and your experience with somebody else that's not wise God works with you as an individual don't compare your experience just experience compare your life with the Bible does it make you in love with Jesus does it make you want to keep his word do you want to serve him with all your heart amen are you leaving sin behind does a conviction of convince you of sin does it lead you and guide you into all truth all right so it doesn't remind you of things that he said in other words when you look at sin you're reminded what the word said all right so this is much assurance let's go to - to Acts chapter 1 and verse 8 now let's just see no place in the Bible and let's just look no place in the Bible except that they they knew so but you see receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witnesses both unto me both in Jerusalem to Judea to the uttermost part of the earth acts 2 and verse 4 and when they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance now not only did they know that they had taken this new wine but everybody else knew right acts 4 and verse 31 when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assemble together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the Word of God with boldness so again something happened it was an experience let's look down there and I accept her 8 verse 14 this is this is at the house of Cornelius when the apostles were at Jerusalem heard Denis sameera Samaria had received the Word of God they sent unto them Peter and John who when they I were come down prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Ghost for his yet he was fallen upon none of them they were baptized of the Lord in the name of the Lord Jesus then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Ghost now something happens so phenomenal that there was this soothsayer named Simon in verse 18 when he saw that bat through the laying on of the Apostles hands the Holy Ghost was given he gay he offered them money so he saw some results he saw something happened when the guests were something that happened hey man now let's go down to Philip in and they the unit acts 8 39 and when they had come out of the water the Spirit the Lord called away Philip and the eunuch saw him no no more and he went away rejoicing now here he's baptizing him in water and manna and the Spirit of God picks Phillip up and transforms him to another place miles away and he's found preaching somewhere else but the eunuch sees this come on and he went his way rejoicing so something happened phenomena was taking place supernatural was going on let's go to Acts chapter 9 and verse 17 and let's just go to 18 - the same time immediately this is solved being prayed for the Apostle Paul when he was blinded by by on the road to Damascus and and sent to Ananias and immediately there fell from his eyes as it had been scales and he received sight forthwith any roads and was baptized something happened axed him to 44 house of Cornelia finally getting to it when Peter spoke these words the Holy Ghost fell on them which heard the word and they are the circumcision which believed were astonished as many as but Peter because on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost far they heard them speak with tongues and magnify God so the answer heard them magnifying God in other languages now I don't really care what language you speak in it ought to cause your life to glorify Jesus Christ that's the whole point hey man now again Acts 11:15 Peter recounts I began to speak unto them the Holy Ghost fell on them as on us at the beginning so he points right back to acts 2 what happened there happened here hey man so what happened in acts 2 here come a sound from heaven like a roar rushing mighty wind it filled the house where they were sitting and Men the cloven tongues of fire come down on each one of them and they were filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak in other languages as the spirit gave them utterance something happened so nobody got it without knowing it a man verse 8 God would snore the art bear them witness giving them the Holy Ghost even as he did this and put no difference between us and them purifying their hearts by faith here comes Acts chapter 19 here Paul is going down to some disciples of John the Baptist and ain't even heard that there was such a thing as the Holy Ghost and he preached to ask him how were you baptized so well we were we were baptized under John's baptism and so well you got to take on the name of the one crucified to be baptized in Christ Jesus verse 4 in soceity that's when they had heard this that were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied so yea I won't point out to you in in all of these occasions it did not say they spoke with tongues that's just one of the manifestations of the same Holy Ghost are you with me but in several of the cases they speaking other languages and so that care that are also something the Holy Ghost does but tongues is not the Holy Ghost is a gift of the Holy Ghost hey ma'am now again so we we come right back down be sensation brother Brennan said I don't care about sensation I will the set the Lord I believe in a heartfelt religion I believe in the joy that I can know I believe in the power of the Holy Spirit I believe in divine healing I believe in all the manifestations of the gifts but they must be reverent and so on and then he said don't try to get a sensation that I take place of the Holy Ghost see the other extreme neither do you just come with a cold intellectual conception of Christ and never open up your heart to him there again you know this this is this is where we are two sides that people are falling off they think well I spoke in tongues hey ain't I got it and they'll it don't don't have a change life you got on the other side well I believe the message I believe in Christ is my Savior and don't have a change life we want a changed life the middle of the road amen now in that middle of the road there's joy there's shouting there's the Holy Ghost there's the power of God and the salvation and listen it is not a sensation but it is an experience it's a happening something happens it's not an imagination not something that happens in your mind it's something happens Christ comes and he changes you till he does it's better felt and held because you can't tell how it feels hey man you know what has happened to you and you know your life has changed amen now you shall know John 14 20 year she'll know that I'm in my father and me and you and you in me and first John two and three hereby we do know that we know him see so you can know a man this is this again he speaks about it him first John 2:28 he said little children abide in him it's not a comin in a going it's not a leaving him his stayin its abiding in him and when he comes he abides with you forever Amen he'll never leave you or forsake you in for him first John three and one beloved what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God yet it doesn't appear what we shall be but we know that listen we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every one that has this hope purifies himself even as he's pure and verse John 3:14 we know we have passed from death unto life Wow because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth and death verse 18 said my little children let us not love in Word neither tongue but in deed and truth and hereby we know we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before Eden so you know how do we love our brothers do we do it by hugs and warm embraces our popular you know proper affection is always needed and how do we love one another we love one another by walking with God by producing an example for others to follow by mentoring some of these fatherless boys fatherless girls by not casting a stumbling block and some others other persons way well I could live I could do that yeah but are you casting a stumbling block hey man by giving a helping hand by encouraging our youth in our elderly for the and those that are weak in faith that's how we see express love for the Brethren all of this is a part of a Christian walk is not one thing but we want one thing so we say we got it and now that we got it then we can just get back in ease enzyme it is a walk with God and as you walk with God you call from both sides and you're neither fanatic neither are you just intellectual but you're walking down the middle of the road you get in the Word of God you hear what it says and then you apply it correctly and scripturally and then you love your brother enough to let God do that with him the way he did it with you in God's time do you love him this morning let's walk down the Kings Highway let's stand together walking down the Kings Highway my load is brighter my load is lighter rather my route mine my way it gets brighter walking up the Kings Highway there's joy and knowing with him I'm going amen a sleigh aside ever weight ever sin all unbelief don't walk either side don't let yourself getting over here fanatical legalistic only on one side judgmental of everybody I don't do you know I tell you but God do something why don't you just be a Christian and let God be gone if when you see something you don't quite agree with maybe I wouldn't agree then take it before the Lord in prayer say Lord we want a mature church help us for these things Lord give us wisdom in these things give us knowledge love him with all your there's gonna be a rapture don't have it's gonna happen in spite of ourselves his word declares it thing about it is you want to be ready you want that maturity in your life they will use this powerheads just for a moment yeah I know I know sometimes things gets a little lengthy but we have to have some time some time just to lay some of these things out and I've had these for months trying to get to these places studying preparing crying out to God Lord let me deliver it in the right way give the people here and here Lord I know you want to church this without spot or wrinkle maybe you have been a little dilatory maybe you've been one side too much sore one side this other way you don't have a balanced Christian walk and you would say Lord today I don't want to walk the edges no more I found out that's the danger zone in so many of shipwreck look at the crosses and the names along the way the memorials to those who fell off in to oblivion some thought oh they could abandon holiness they didn't have to listen what the prophets said they they they got their own views I wonder if you got the view it came from the Spirit of God the angel of God what about you what about is there balance in your life what about the extreme the parent and the husband wife relationship and as I said the parent let your children act different ways and don't treat them and and tutor them he said well I you know I don't want to inhibit their little spirit oh you better you better bring it in check because a child that goes unchecked ones up in in jail in prison and in all kinds of extremism when you see your children misbehaving you seem that misbehaving in church and distress tracked and in church have enough Holy Ghost about you to bring your children in order and worship them how to worship right be mature people in all things honor him I just wear it wherever the Holy Spirit just directs the word to your heart maybe sure remember your attitude toward Christ he's shown in what you do and it's gonna have a real effect on your children that has to do with church attendance tithe paying air air any any party it's an attitude toward Christ and that's gonna have an effect on your children don't you want to have a family that's ready to meet God don't you want to be in love with Jesus you know I'm not just sometimes he preached and you're very very little seem very very hard and legalistic I'm not that way I know grace is what takes the favor of God but let's don't take it over either to extreme and to some kind of greezy grace where that sin is accepted and we just think the favor of God will cover it up once you let your life change in his presence would there be someone here today they just want to move toward God just where you're out in your seat not asking you to come down for prayer there's a time for that and even even there you know you shouldn't come down here to the altar every time for prayer some people do it officially over and over again you can't can't cast the net without somebody getting in it don't do that find some balance learn how to pray yourself be grown-up sure I don't want to inhibit you from coming from father's time you need to come from prayer right there where you are be a real Christian surrender that life to Christ put a nine get an anchor down in Christ get in the middle of the road find a balance for your life ask him I want to live the way he wants me to live it would be the kind of Christian I want this church to be a Holy Ghost Church I want the power of God to move in it I just tell you his song brother and who let us do it so moves my heart come back home children come back to the homeland yet in the center of his will get in a place where God can bless you get in a place where you can just bathe down he scattered his people I didn't gather you they did encounter you there I'm cata you and his presence we find a home in the Word of God in the homeland and the Holy Ghost the sweetness of the Holy Spirit this emanates out of your life you guess so in love with Jesus all the world just goes to him and you just can't see nothing but Jesus just so in love with you oh no I'm not no miss man mr. fake I'm not some hard cutting man I have to say some things sometimes that are really sometimes cutting and hard trying to get you back in the middle of the road what about you and your walk with Jesus is the word supposed to be if it were it's supposed to be maybe maybe you're on the highway but you walk too close to one edge of the other causes you to have feelings toward others this fellowship and causes you to not respond properly to the Word of God that warm sweetness and the Holy Ghost is not yours this is the cold just a cold something far away in God's so far away from me he wants to be close he wants to tender your heart this morning some of you just need to get on the highway we just ask him wherever you are in your life this morning come Holy Spirit come and change me in your presence bring that balance in my life that sweetness of the Holy Ghost to realize mercy rewrote my life rather miss me so concerned I'm so pleased with how everything goes let me be concerned about mercy writing somebody else's life changing them I may not be selfish let me put my fire together with others and others cannoli man maybe just a little move toward God that's all you need this morning just have that breakthrough you just want to raise a hand toward God and say Jesus I need you I really need you I really need to god bless you God sees you sees you he hears a famous heart cry he knows just how to touch your heart just one moment he can change you make you something real take all the fake out of you play in church hypocrisy makes something real and you're not just pretending but the reality of Christ is living in my life it's not just a gift of the Spirit of God but it's the person of Christ living in me working in my life father you call whomsoever you will you said he that comes to me I will in no wise cast out may ever person Lord reach out to you today your arms not too short you can't reach them you can reach them today Lord I pray you'll reach ever heart never life speak to every soul in Jesus name hey man hey

there in exile for many many many years but today he's coming home amen never to Rome again amen but we'll know more Rome after he takes us under his wings and I believe that illegal spread out his wings found another one of his sons out there who's been lost in darkness we can read in the scripture all through the Bible Jesus would tell us to go into all the world and preach the gospel and baptize them it would tell him to Bab - tell us - baptized in his name the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost all through the Bible we've read numerous occasions today where the disciples in acted this baptism in obedience to the word of Jesus were by that they would actually immerse them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ this is all - the Bible this is why we baptize this way we believe that he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned we believe that baptism does now also save us not in the putting away of the filth of the flesh but to answer a good conscience toward God that we've obeyed him fully and we're going to walk with Him today I have here from the EJ Parker that is repented of his sins his wants to walk with the Lord and he's coming as a repentant sinner and the old man is dead the old man caused him a lot of sorrow and heartache down the road and sin paid it's wages but today is where the wages of sin has ceased he no longer worked for sin he worked to serve God with all his heart his sins that were slight scarlet to be made white as snow all through the Bible we can see this there's no place anywhere in the Bible where anybody was ever baptized in any way except in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's the only way of salvation I showed you today the road Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life and no one can come to the Father except by me so we must come calling on the name of the Lord that we might be saved today the eja has repented of his sins we have prayed with him down at the altar he has been sometime there reflecting not just today but through the weeks reflecting his life wanting everything right with God and today he comes to bury the old man the old eej that he can walk in the newness of life brother AJ the Lord Jesus sent me into the world called me in this last day to preach the gospel he commissioned me with the great commission to go in all the world to preach the gospel and teaching them baptizing them in the name of the Father and other son and other Holy Ghost in obedience to that divine command i baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ and the performance is your hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Jesus hallelujah he promised the Holy Ghost [Applause] with this presence hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you for your word
