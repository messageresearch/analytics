they we spent some time with them this week and they fixed us some Chinese food it was so good and had lots of Fellowship together talking about the things of God and the message that God has given us in this day and and he as he mentioned the the T the the name Menan means bright light or Lighthouse so you know we're a lighthouse here in this area but I'm thankful we're not the only one God's got a bride around the world my goodness who is that smiling person right there God bless you Sister jeie my let's welcome her this morning God bless you amen praise the Lord we're so happy to be in the you're in the house the Lord today amen that's Victory I'll tell you you see been through a battle with cancer and the Lord's been with her every step of the way we could have made it without the Lord could we we must have him and we're so thankful and he's brought her through those um very difficult times just like I explained to her you know we believe in Mark 16 if we take any deadly thing it'll not harm us so we believe that with all our hearts and uh every time as I instructed every time you had to take that stuff the doctors recommended you pray over it I say that with any kind of medicine it's off the tree of knowledge it's not off the tree of life it's off the tree of knowledge and it has good and evil in it it has its side effects but we believe in Mark 16 we believe that we'll lay hands on the sick and they shall recover cover we believe that God heals even without doctor's assistance but if God chooses to use a doctor that's he'll heal through that way too medicine cannot heal doctors can't heal it's God that's a Healer I'm the Lord God that he said that heals all thy diseases so therefore it's all inclusive what he does he he heals us today we have a a prayer request that it came in but it was missed it was for little our little brother Jed Mitchell he's been real sick since camp and and uh sickness in the Mitchell Family I know there are many needs here in this building today and you've got desires on your heart maybe you'll just lift a hand to God and say Lord Don't Pass Me By today will you just speak to me in a special way God sees your need you just hold that request before him right now just real sincerely now position yourself as a child of God Washed by the blood of Jesus you're not worthy on your own but we are worthy because of his grace look to him today look to him today ask him to just come into your heart speak to your life minister to you in a personal way he's a personal God he cares he cares about you your situation dear God as we bow before your throne of grace Lord we come in this sincere as we know how Lord asking Lord that you would just make us that righteous man through your blood because it's through the righteousness of Jesus Christ We Stand it's not on our own merits it's not because we've done everything perfect but is because you gave your life for us shed your blood for our Redemption we thank you for salvation today we thank you for the Holy Ghost that's in our lives that has changed us took the chains of sin off our lives and made us Sons and Daughters of God and Lord as those Sons now we approach your throne of grace because it is there we find favor and help in our time of need Lord our little brother Jed sick in his body do any other requests that was read across this desk that's already been prayed for we just lift them to you right now father May our prayers go up as the incense off of The Altar and and go up with our praise and our worship to you and be received in your presence right now and Lord you just receive them and breathe back favor to us oh God your loving kindness is greater than life and I pray father that you would just forgive us of thy loving kindness in thy life today Lord you know the desire of everyone there are hands that's went up across this building Desires in their hearts and needs in their lives but I pray God that you would Minister now to their need in a very special way that many brought their burdens and they did they brought it to the right place they brought it Lord in the presence of believers who believe and Lord that's what we do we believe we're Believers and so Lord with that we profess and confess that it's already done that you have already paid the price and that healing is on the way for every one of these Lord we rebuke the hand of Satan that would want to hold back the blessings of God from God's people Satan you are a defeated being and we will not have you and we'll not walk in your atmosphere but we will walk in the atmosphere of faith and believing and seeing God work we're asking it in the name of Jesus and even for those that are listening in around the world wherever they are tuned in at this moment or days from now oh God I pray in the name of Jesus on the wings of this prayer may faith come into their heart to believe the Word of Promise as we commit the service in your hands in jesus' name amen amen amen Why Don't We Just Praise Him right now from the depths of our heart say thank you Lord amen that's right thank you Jesus thank you that you heal all our diseases that you supply all our needs according to your riches and Glory that you haven't left one thing out for us but you provided it all thank you Lord for your goodness we thank you for your grace amen God bless you before we turn to the scripture this morning I want to say thank you for all your support to the youth camp and uh that's uh to the ministry team the deacons the gator Patrol the musicians the technical team those who um worked so hard on registration and and um you know the the the lunch mon and so on like that those that supported our youth um in whatever way the the wonderful skit that the young people gave and they they just they just blessed us so much sister Linda um writing that brother Aaron helping out with that it was such a such a blessing we we uh received a a note and and I can't remember exactly what it said right now but said I'm a I'm a a sister and I'm 73 years old but I watched the camp skit and I laughed and I cried and I shouted and I rejoiced and you know it's it's wonderful you know when when the hearts can be touched and our choir and everything else evening light Tabernacle you made me proud and I want to appreciate you very much today and thank you for what you've done and uh for the blessing that you are to me and to the bride of Christ and and to those that came to um sit down under our oak tree and find shelter and uh get get a blessing there in Camp and we had a tremendous time a a prayer line that lasted probably till nearly um midnight and then shoutings that and rejoicing that just kept on going till the wee hours of the morning so you know God is still moving he's still delivering and I know there there are many many reports that are coming out we we are not a defeated people we are Overcomers we aren't surprised when the Devil comes and hits back you know after we make such a bold attack upon him and his kingdom we're not surprised that he comes back and and attacks us you know but we just we just stand our ground and hold the promise firm amen knowing that knowing who has called us and sent us in this hour if you'll turn with me to Exodus 12 we will read again from this passage of scripture I want to speak from it another time and today we're going to be speaking on the token holy ghost power in action if you'll read from verse 21 with me now then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and the Passover and ye shall take a bunch of hisp and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lentil and the two side posts with the blood that is in the Basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning for the Lord will pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lentil and on the two side posts the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come into your houses to Smite you amen I'm going to let you be seated but I want you to turn with me to John 14:12 for another scripture reading John 14:12 and I want you to remember that this scripture um it was not only speaking of a prophetic Ministry in this day where we saw the ministry of Christ repeated but it also speaks of a uh of every believer this is not just for a prophet alone this is for every believer and it says verily verily it says which means absolutely absolutely I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it and then turn with me to Mark 16 and verse 14 where we read the Great Commission of the Lord and remember because in this day that the seals have been taken off the book and has restored the Gospel of Jesus Christ to us that we are the ones now that are commissioned to fulfill the scripture because the gospel must go into all the world and not only that be preached into all the world and and um be demonstrated look what he said in verse 14 afterward he appeared unto the 11 as they sat at meat and up braided them with their unbelief and Hardness of Heart because they believed not them which had seen him after he was risen and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what a wonderful promise that is Amen brother Leo I'm going to ask you a question and I want you to think about it as we're as we're doing this for a moment um I want you to be able to tell me about how many Christians in the three self church and then how many Christians Al together and now how many are message Believers estimating today so how many in the three self church that's the government church for Christianity is did I understand right 70 million all right and then how many um all total of Christians in in China 100 million and then about how many Believers now do you estimate are in China about how many more than 1,000 all right so we have Believers there in China and um you know today God has done marvelous marvelous Works already as the gospel goes there and you know I I think about many years ago one man had a burden on his heart that was brother John le and he went he went there into China not knowing anybody not knowing how to speak the language um but just had a burden and and started taking Bibles in in and from there uh taking the message in and now there are churches that are started all over um where I when I was there in Shanghai I've ministered to over 40 pastors there that was 10 years ago and uh the government has done what it could to try to to to shut things down and to keep uh Christianity out but it just keeps rising up and you know God's going to have a bride no matter what amen he'll have a bride and she'll be without spot or wrinkle or blemish or any such thing but to think about it you know we have a a responsibility then as the bride people to take the gospel to all the world and what a day that we're living in when God has made available even even through the through the meain means of internet and and the website so we can get it out and right now um on the message Hub is is almost every sermon I'm pretty sure it's all complete of uh brother bram's sermons that that he preached that is available to the people and we've been doing some of the same things for the Japanese Believers and and so there are many of them there today that are out there for the on the web that anybody around the world Chinese Japanese can go there and listen to so you know it's just um it's it's just the gospel going into all the world because we have a commission to fulfill amen and so as we are looking at this today I read these three scriptures one of course from Exodus that we have been speaking about on the token where that he he told them to take a lamb according your families and kill the Passover and then take the blood and that is and put it in a basin and then take a bunch of hisp and dip it in the blood and then strike the lentil and the two side post of the with the blood that's in the Basin and so the blood has to be applied and of course the blood was representing a lamb had died and it was also the the the sign of the life of the Lamb upon the doorpost and and so of course today we don't have the literal paint of the blood we have the literal life of Jesus Christ which is the Holy Ghost which we apply instead of with hisp we apply it by faith and of course it must be applied to every house then of course we read from Mark uh John 14:12 where that he talks about the works that I do shall you do also so there will always be then signs as in Mark 16 that follow that Believers and of course there had to be signs over the doorpost over over the doorpost of the every dwelling and of course we bring that down to every individual must have it upon the lentil on the two side host in other words the body the spirit the soul everything brought under the blood and of course it's not just that but families our house must be under the blood and we have spoken about a lamb for a household and and just the practical application of it to our houses to our homes to our family life and all of those things and now we're speaking about the token upon on the church because it is also a house every house must have the token applied now the the Destroyer is passing through the neighborhood now and nothing is safe except that which is under the token it must be under the blood which in our case is the Holy Ghost again we do not have the literal chemistry of the blood the the substance of blood we have the life that is of the the blood of Jesus Christ and that life is the Holy Ghost so the Holy Spirit must be applied to the to the individual it must be applied to the family home it must be applied to the church and as I have as I spoke some time ago on being in Passover that we will be in Passover until the time that we hear the trumpet sound for us to leave this world of Egypt so we will be here not going out from under the blood staying under the blood eating the lamb and the bitter herbs with preparations made for the trumpet sound cuz any moment we're going to hear the trumpet sound now so but as we know the Destroyer is in the land everybody knows even that and and they telling us over and again we are on the verge of World War II and and of course you know in these kind of times we have a job to be doing and that is that is to make sure the blood is applied even to our church that under in the church the power of the holy spirit is working amen but we need it for salvation we need it for healing we need it for deliverance the Holy Ghost is is not an option it is a must amen and and of course as a church our job is to impart life by having Jesus Christ in action now I want you to see brother brandham told us in the message that day on Calvary and as I paraphrase this he says the Greater Works was to have power in the church not only to heal the Sick by prayer and cast out Devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to the Believers amen so the The Church Must Be a place where the holy spirit is present and the atmosphere is there where that eternal life is imparted now I cannot give you eternal life as far as even by laying on of hands or by praying a prayer over you or by certain rituals but we impart eternal life and return and remit sins just like they did on the day of Pentecost repent every one of you and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so The Church Must Be imparting eternal life and and to do that the you see the the church had had to receive the eternal life coming into the hands of the church to impart life and that really that's what Calvary meant if it if it had just stopped at the at the shedding of the blood and Jesus had not come back in the form of the Holy Ghost we would be just as bad off as they were in the Old Testament our sins pass forgiven but no power to live it amen but this Holy Ghost is the power to live it it is to put Jesus Christ in action in our lives and in the church and we are the continuation of the book of Acts because of having been restored back to the place that the original Church fell from down to the church ages we know the truth was lost Luther brought back a strand of Truth with justification Wesley did the same with sanctification but we today are no longer holders of scattered truths holding strands of loose ends we have the fullness of the word and with the fullness of the spirit for the with the restoration of the word comes the restoration of the power amen the Church of Jesus Christ is not to be a powerless church but she she is not to be a lukewarm church but she is to be a church that is on fire where the spirit of God is in action working in lives and hearts Healing The Sick saving the lost and forgiving sins filling with the Holy Ghost casting out Devils It All Belongs to the church and she must be Jesus Christ in action upon the Earth and shall I say she is hallelujah she is the Holy Ghost is here not in a person not in a fragment as was given to Luther or Wesley or even ausa street but it is here in its full power amen the Holy Ghost and the true church makes it a continuation of the book of Acts looking back through history of the ages you can see how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it and making it lukewarm and formal and Powerless but that is not where we are today that is not we are what we are under amen but by the opening of The Seven Seals it is exposed Satan revealing the man of sin and his Works were were not were not only would he destroyed God's people through the Dark Ages but discredited God's word but he today has been exposed if you notice with the seals it was not only revealing Christ it was also exposing the animal Christ why because God is determined there will not be a people deceived in this last day but there will be a people who are victorious Overcomers who are the continuation of what was lost in the book of Acts now so therefore Luther's token sign was justification Wesley's token sign was sanctification tongues was the Zeus's streets token sign but there is a people on the Earth today who have the supernatural Supreme token amen the abstract of title with every Creed of man every false Doctrine struck off every mistruth corrected amen and a book that is no longer close to us and his promises withheld to us but I want to say that every promise is more real to you than any other age since Pentecost since the early ages amen but God has done a work of restoration to restore a people back to the original word with its original Power amen now brother Brandon would tell us in the message token he said now we have a token in this day we have been a to given a token which is an anot type of that type of that natural token he's speaking of the Lamb's blood we have been given the supernatural Supreme token amen all that was foreshadowed has been given to this generation think about it even while it's forshadowed in Luther or Wesley or isusa Street has now been given to us even what even what we saw in the early Church in the book of Acts has now been restored back to us so all that was foreshadowed has been given this generation has been given the token now we have the Holy Ghost is our token and it is our identification that we have accepted the death of the Lamb Not only was Jesus's human life to come back on us but it was God himself manifested in the flesh amen that brought us back upon the adoption of sons that we are now Sons and Daughters of God Amen think about that we didn't just receive a man's spirit and this message is not about receiving a man's Spirit it is not even receiving the spirit of of a man of you know of William brandom or some great preacher somebody it's not about receiving his spirit it's that Spirit of a man won't do you any good you be just as lost as lost can be but if you ever get God's spirit that came by Jesus and receive of the Holy Ghost let me tell you friend amen that life will give you overcoming power it'll make you Victorious hallelujah amen it brings you back to the adoption of sons amen praise God that now we are the sons and daughters of God think about it the adoption and the you know the adoption that we're speaking about is like not adopting a baby but taking a man when he's he comes into his full statue and when he's fully matured and in that mature State he has given the father's Kingdom he's put a robe upon his shoulders he is he's given a special robe he's put a ring up on his feet finger that identifies him with the right to use his father's name amen he has the father's seal amen whatever he stamps is stamps whatever he binds is bind whatever he looses is loose Hallelujah that's what I'm talking about this Holy Ghost positioned you as a son fully adopted fully positioned with the robe upon you amen you don't have to wait for something to come you don't have to wait for persecution or squeeze right now you are the sons of God every promise is your promise every word is your word it is our identification that God has accepted us we are accepted in the Beloved in Christ the message of this last day is a revelation of the true church and what she stands for it is a revelation that she can do the Greater Works and that the blood has made the death angel pass over we're talking about the death angel that is killing fatherhood that is destroying motherhood that is Wrecking families that is destroying a nation that is ruining a society amen that that is the bane of the world let me tell you I you know the other day I saw a couple of girls with enough metal in their mouth to build a new bridge over Boston with with their hair purple what is it what is it it's the death angel amen you are seeing the effects of death the Destroyer is upon their life you think that's going to give them liberty no it's bondage it's a hook in their jaw it's a ring in their nose it is something there it is something there where Satan has a a hold upon their life and it's a sign that they're in bondage that they're in sin amen I see boys who don't know how to be men eminate necklaces and bracelets mhm M pering their hair and all kinds of stuff amen effeminate what is it you know it's the destroyer and you can see the effect on their lives amen we see we see people even young girls coming to Camp lewd and crude and lesbian Behavior why is it the Destroyer is in the [Applause] land the Destroyer is going through home hes amen going through churches amen it's like the like the four horse riders of Revelation you know speaking of the Seven Seals of the white the the white the the the red the black and the pale and the pale is of course it's the same writer and he just morphs as he changes and his name is death and Hell follows him and I'll tell you what he'll ride right into the church amen if you're not careful he'll ride right into evening light Tabernacle and pack you out amen because he can get to anybody without the token no matter how much blood that we have here it's only for those who have come under it who have embraced the Holy Spirit who have received him in their life listen our nation is dying not only is our national Deb spiraling out of control our sin debt is rising it's out of control sin like you never dreamed of we're worried about the national debt and they talking about it but nobody's talking about the sin Deb amen our sin Deb is spiraling out of control you look at the squatter situation where people can come and take your property and push you out what is that it's a spirit of of lawlessness amen the spirit of lawlessness and instead of protecting the citizenry it's it's protecting the criminal catch them release them without bail what is it it's a sign of the time where lawlessness is taken over the world and and its people you can see it happen but let me let me say that's not my largest concern that's not my biggest concerned I don't even have a thing for you to r or take over but let me just say you know the this the that same Spirit of lawlessness is happening in the churches sin is not being cast out the sick are left to lay without being healed come on the atmosphere is not there for the Holy Ghost to move amen what is it it's the spirit of lawlessness as a US we have a constitution as Christians we have a constitution it's against our constitution to let the sick lay it's against our constitution not to have new births by genuine birth of the Holy Ghost it's against our constitution it's against the word of God it's against the dictates of the Bible onlu we can talk about George Washington fought for this Constitution and this one there he signed it and this one gave his life and this one said Give me liberty or give me death we can talk about them but let me tell you for a moment Peter stood for this gospel Paul stood for this gospel amen Jesus gave his life for this gospel amen we we have too many that have fought to win the prize and to give us the word of God and the Constitution amen how dare we to let a spirit of lawlessness come in and squat you're not taking over our church you're not welcome here amen I I may not have a double barrel shotgun but I got an action 238 Hallelujah I've got a promise from the word of God that will cast out Devils amen that will speak in new tongues if we lay hands on the sick they will recover we will recover [Applause] all let me say this again though the message of this last age is a revelation of the true church that's what the message is about it's a revelation of the true church Christ in the true church and what the true church stands for it's a revelation that she can do the Greater Works I am speaking to a bunch of can do people who have been told you can do you can do the Greater Works amen that that it is there for you to do and you can let me just say again it's a revelation that the blood has made the death angel pass over that we stand Justified and pure before God as we stood back there in his mind before the world began so therefore we can do the Greater Works this makes us an invincible Army for Satan has no claim on us I'm looking at a people today that Satan has no claim on you if you have the Holy Spirit today you have the abstract of the title deed that means that every debt that was against you is struck off there's no leans against you Satan has no claims on you hallelujah amen I'm preaching to a people that Satan has no claims on I am telling you this morning that Satan has no right to your property he has no right to your health he has no right to your body he has no right right to your mind he has no right to your soul you are free people you are not to live in bondage

Israel Invincible to the Destroyer read the Bible amen the Destroyer was coming but the blood made Israel invincible and provided freedom to escape the hell of Egypt the bondage the gates of Egypt could not Prevail against them for 400 years it had held them captive but now the blood had come and with the death of that lamb the penalty of sin was gone paid for by the blood of the lamb and there issued in a freedom Hallelujah now listen friends with this Revelation in our lives of what we are who we are and what we stand far and that we can do the Greater Works the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us either but we will prevail over them I don't care what situation you're in this morning I don't care what the doctor has said I don't don't care what your your checkbook says it

perish that's the only thing you don't just come together and say well I believe it you know you get beneath it you get it into it how do you do that well the Bible's clear by one Spirit we're baptized into one into one body so by one Holy Ghost baptism that's how we get in the body you want to know how to get in get the Holy Ghost amen it's the most important thing that there is today is his Spirit without it you're lost amen and now if you truly believe and you've applied the blood then it has taken effect amen if if you you see like medicine you how do you know you're just getting a placebo if it if nothing works nothing changes right amen there's too much that too many quack pharmacist today that have taken the power out of the word out of the medicine amen let me tell you it I

you to reform this is not a Reformation this is a transformation well if we can get you to change your habits it's not about turning a new page it's about receiving Christ and having his life within you and then it's the power of God in you is Jesus Christ in action so you see it's not church is not to be for a treatment center we are to have a cure you wonder why they can't cure cancer well a lot of money in it a lot of big farmers in it lots of fundraisers lots of people getting paid amen I don't want to be a conspiracist here but you know I'm just saying just saying there's a reason people make a lot of money off of it so we we we work and work and we we take funds and more funds and we don't ever get a cure but that's not what Jesus did amen he paid sin's debt once and for all and he provided not a treatment for it but he provided a cure for sin hallelujah amen let me tell you it'll cure the worst disease there is I don't care if you're an alcoholic a drug addict a

hardly stand to get food from them that's right I look at them and you know something coming out of their nose it's gross but it's a death angel It's a death angel all tatted up with all kinds of things you know tatten up their bodies what is it it's the death angel amen your body's holy it's not for every sign of of the world on it you are to be a sign amen you are to be a sign but not that come on but it must take effect it must they are a voice for that they are a voice for the rock and roll or or for the rap music or whatever it is they are a voice for that it's living out their life it's an action in them well what I'm trying to tell you is you are to be Jesus Christ in action of the Earth in your life the way you dress the way you present yourself ladies looking like ladies men looking like men not just looking but I but living like men real men real fathers real mothers Christians see it must take effect there was a story of the wealth survival happened in the in Great Britain in the country of Welles Britain is made up of of several different countries like England and Welles and and there Scotland and then and then of course there's Ireland and and over in the all in the British Isles but in in a meeting in Wales in 1904 this is just before the isua Revival they had a gathering of people there it was um it was a time of a Revival destru truck where they they estimated nearly 100,000 people would converted in those couple of years there just in in those countries and it was a precursor to the isua Street Revival in 1906 and it would be in February 1904 that in in a meeting there one young lady her name was Flory Evans she is quoted as saying that she just got up and made a proclamation and she said I love the Lord Jesus with all of my heart and that caused such an impression it was said with such fervor with such a uh with such sincerity that it drove others to their knees and a Revival was started this event would actually initiate that Revival and this this uh this would spark an Awakening to the rest of of Britain Scandinavia parts of Europe North America the mission fields of of India and the Orient and Africa and Latin America and there were great men who had heard about this and they were dignitaries some of them were doctors of divinities with all of their collars maybe turned around backwards and they come from the USA to see what this revival is all about they want to discover how it happened you know people want to know how it happened I'll tell you what how it happened just get in love with Jesus you want Revival in your heart that's it get to the place like that I love the Lord Jesus with all my heart amen that that'll do more for it than anything else opening your life to Revival and here it just walking down the street looking for the building where it was being held where where where the where the Revival was happening they saw a policeman who they heard whistling the hym and so they walked over him asked him directions to where the Welsh Revival was and asked him said where is the well survival and this little cop you know was directing traffic and all and he just said the W Revival well the W Revival isn't me I am the W Revival you see they wanted to know what building it was in amen but you see he had become the we Revival let me tell you the Revival the bride's Revival is not in a building it ain't contained and even even like Tabernacle but if a man or woman can get on fire for God the brides Revival will be in their life and they will be the bride's Revival Hallelujah and that will make them be Jesus Christ in action upon the Earth but Jesus said because I I live you shall live also my life will be in you and the works that I do shall you do also you see we must get to that place he promised it would do it and it's got to come that way you see but it's not just to the individual it is the church must be displaying the token as brother bradam told about it in his token sermon where he preached about this he said today every church every individual that isn't and cannot display that token of the Holy Ghost is spiritually dying and will die so every church I want to emphasize because we we've dealt with the individual we dealt with the home now just telling with the church every church that cannot display that token the token has to be on display it must be seen you see it it's got to be displayed amongst the people making him Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever we must have the word the word is important you see you see we must have the word but the word in his power we must have the word in his power but to release that power it must be mixed with faith because Faith releases the power from the word you remember in the book of Hebrews said the word preached did not profit them because it was not mixed with faith in them that heard it it is not enough just to have the message but it also must have of that Faith there that quickens it the spark that makes it alive in other words it cannot be just the mechanics it must also have the Dynamics because the mechanics without Dynamics is no good the same as as Dynamics without mechanics is no good you can scream and shout and run the aisles and dance all over and not have the word of God and you still it's no good you'll never get anywhere you're just cranking on the engine you're just spattering there and making a bunch of Noise We don't want to just be a church that makes a bunch of noise amen but we we do want the noise because it's a sign of life life amen you can't crank an engine and there not be noise amen and young people like to have a nice nice loud muffler on Amen and you get a bunch of young people filled with the Holy Ghost they make a lot of noise Glory hallelujah thank you Jesus and I tell you it it gets at the old people they will start making noise too and they will be shouting and rejoicing hallelujah amen but but you see it's not one without the other it takes both of them a mere confession of faith of of I believe the message is isn't sufficient but when we really believe it it'll display his power you see when the true word is preach in the believing Church it will create an atmosphere of faith now when when that atmosphere is more than a more than a mere confession of oh I believe the message is true but when we really believe it it will display his power remember the blood was applied by hisp by faith the life on display is what makes the death angel pass over it is not enough to have it in the in your Bible it is not enough to just have it in a bucket it is not just enough to have a collection of paraphernalia or or a message library that ain't enough come on Church am but when the word is believed and obeyed you and the word become one and it works through you you remember the works that I do shall you do also now when the word in you become one that it lives itself out and you become a walking Bible an Epistle of Jesus Christ you are the Living Word now what good is the blood if it doesn't give power over the death angel what good is the Holy Ghost if it doesn't give you power over sin hello if it isn't keeping the Destroyer the death angel from your door see your body is to be the Temple of the Holy Ghost and it must be the blood must be on display there if it isn't keeping porn out of your temple what good is that blood the Destroyer is coming destroying if it isn't keeping adultery out of your marriage if it isn't keeping you clean of alcohol and tobacco and vaping and Sexting in your texting amen you know then I ask is it really the blood of Christ if it's really the blood it's going to keep that out of your life it not only will save you but it will keep you clean I'm glad today to talk about a power of the Holy Ghost that just will do more than save you from hell but will save you from the hell on this Earth of [Applause] sin in the Old Testament the blood of bulls and goats could not take away sin our sin desire it could only treat sin it could not cure sin had no cure for sin in the Old Testament you see it as the inoculation that they received wasn't too good it's kind of like you know this covid shot they gave government required it I couldn't couldn't go to Canada without it so I took it but did it keep people from from Co no no it you know it the inoculation wasn't too good so they tried this one and they bragged on that one and this one will do it and you know this one will do it and everybody line up and get it you know the president shows he gets it but it doesn't do no good he gets Co but you see the inoculation wasn't too good and that's the way the Old Testament was you know it's a big claim the blood of the lamb and and slay the lamb and whatever and it just rolled the sins ahead amen it it it could only cover sin it could not annihilate sin right so you see there was always a conscience of sin and every year he had to come back again make his offering year by year but the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews that the worshipper once Purge has no more conscience of sin in other words no more desire to sin the whole thing is gone from him you see you do not no matter what they tell you have to sin every day amen you do that because you willfully want to and the reason you willfully want to is because you've never died to yourself amen yeah that's right because when you die to sin that thing is gone the desire is gone amen but you know people are doing what like a black bird trying to put a peacock feather and say look I'm a peacock you know he's not a peacock he just got something to stuck in himself it's got to grow from the inside out and that's a whole deal this is not about a Reformation this is not a even about changing your way of dress and I'll conformed to what what the word says you know and I'm going to do this because that's what's preached here listen that won't save you it's got to be a change on the inside it's got to grow from the inside out it's got to change sin's desire so when you have the world in sin and cutting hair and painting that comes out against the word of God it shows the holy spirit is not there you know it's a direct evidence so you would call it we would call it prostitution because you're you're you got two lovers you're claiming to love God and still sering sin I'm going to preach a little bit about this and I'll bring a balance here in a minute just for those of you that thinks I'm not but until then I'm going to just leave you hanging right where I've got you amen so you see you see the Bible said he that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin for the seed of God remains in him so how can he sin when a sinless God is in him when he's in a s when he's in a sinless God how can he sin no matter what he's done the blood's covered him he's a new creature now he his desires and ambition is of Heaven because he's changed from a cuckle bird to a wheat his desires are not the same as it was and he displays you say I believe that and still s it nah you're deceived you see it can't display nothing but the token the token of the Holy Ghost must give power over the Destroyer are it's worthless amen just just like I said you know when I was preaching about the illegitimate child if the IL you know if the blood of Jesus Christ could not take the sin away of your parents something you never did and it would keep you out of the Rapture then the blood of Jesus Christ is no more effective than the blood of bulls and goats it took 10 generations to breed that out 10 Generations before they could come back in the house of the Lord that's how bad adultery was but by one offering he has Sanctified you forever you don't have to go 400 years back in your pedigree and prove that there is no illegitimate Birth come on you are born again you've got another birth and in that birth there is no illegitimacy Hallelujah but you know the devil wants to hold things over people's lives and let me just tell you Friends when the blood takes care of it it's all gone no matter what your mother did your daddy did your grandparents did or whatever did it's all gone amen you said well brother Tim I got a quote just read the just read the whole quote that's all just just don't stop just keep reading you'll see exactly what I'm talking about the token of the Holy Ghost gives power over the Destroyer the blood when I see the blood the Destroyer will pass over your dwelling the token of the Holy Ghost The Life of Christ gives power over the Destroyer let's go to Luke 24:49 and I want you to see this and behold I send the promise of my father upon you but tear you in Jerusalem the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high glory to God wait into the city of Jerusalem this is what his instruction and what was they going to receive they would be endued with power I want you to see the holy ghost's power so if you read acts 1 and8 you'll see also that but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you right amen so the Holy Ghost is power when you receive the Holy Ghost it's power amen the Holy Ghost is not weak the holy ghost's power to overcome oh don't tell me that sin still has dominion over you and you got the Holy Ghost don't tell me you can't love your brother and you got the Holy Ghost that's right don't tell me you can't create the right atmosphere in your home and in the church and you have the Holy Ghost is somebody with me don't hang up on me I ain't through I got a lot more to talk about this morning to preach about amen but don't tell me that sin still has dominion over you and you got the Holy Ghost Amen in other words that you got the Holy Ghost and you still remain sin slave when the token was given when the blood was applied they were no more slaves they were free to go the blood was their Liberty amen amen the Bible said that sin shall have no more dominion over you so how can Jesus be Lord over your life and sin still reain over you too you cannot serve two masters and Christ will not share a throne with the devil amen the Bible said you you are free from sin it is no longer your master amen do you know the Holy Ghost will give you Mastery over the devil how else could you cast him out come on the Holy Ghost will give you Mastery over the devil how else will he flee from you now you see the Holy Ghost is power the word in the Greek is dunamus it's from the it's from the root word what we use in English is dynamic amen so really when we're talking about Dynamics we're talking about the power of the Holy Ghost so this is what he says when he talks about mechanics and Dynamics and the Dynamics is the power of the Holy Ghost the word without the Dynamics or the power of the Holy Ghost is no good so you see Dynamics is something is energetic it's functioning it's live it's operative it's working which describes uh which is marked by uh usually continuous continuous and productive activity or change and that which is dynamic is characterized by energy or forces that produces motion as opposed to that which is static our motionless or lifeless so I'm telling you the Holy Ghost gives unlimited strength that is at your disposal unlimited strength show me where Jesus limited even your prayer that's right ask the father anything in my name I'll do it if you would even say to this mountain and be removed and be cast in the sea it will obey you Jesus did not put limits on the power to Believers amen I'm talking to people with Mountain Moving Faith Hallelujah that has Mountain Moving power come on church amen dunamus which is power especially achieving power you know what it refers to it refers to Intrinsic our inborn power or inherit ability when you are born again you have an inherit power that you inherited from God by your new birth there's no weaknesses in God so you didn't inherit weakness you inherited weakness from your parents so did I but when from this parent and this birth there is no weakness to inherit it is the power of the ability to to car carry out a function it is a potential for functioning in some way power might strength ability capability the power residing In A Thing by virtue of its Nature by Nature you have power in you when you're born again of the Holy Ghost you have God's power in you amen you receive power from on high because of your new birth from the spirit that comes into you by the new birth it is the energy and the power to make Satan move it is the force to cast him out amen it is it is the power to complete completely defeat sin until it is dead now I know that is contrary to all of Christianity secular Christianity Today denies us power because their religion is powerless it just instructs you to do good and try to do better now and although claims are made to be converted to powerless against sin so they're like this they're described in 2 Timothy 3 and5 having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof so they go to church you might be that way this morning and you go to church and you have a form of godliness a profession of Faith say well I received the Holy Ghost I shouted I spoke in tongues or I danced or I did this I did that having a form of godliness but then deny the power right you you see the point is that the so-called godliness of of these men's is a sham because it's devoid of any real divine power to break the power of sin you know that and and of course those that possess the indwelling spirit and and have this Divine dunamus this power have been inherit have inherit are the born ability to wage Victorious battle with the three with the believer's three mortal enemies the World the Flesh and the devil amen all of them are seeking to turn you away from God and self the Flesh and its ungodly Unholy attributes and actions but let me tell you the Holy Ghost gives us victory over the flesh because Galatians 5:24 said they that are Christ and you can only be heed by birth and that birth is the indwelling of the spirit of God and they that are in are Christ have crucified killed the Flesh and with the affections and lust so you see we are crucified let's take an important scripture for a moment Romans 6 and6 knowing this oh yeah that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin so our old man is crucified with Christ if your old man is still breathing if he's still living if he's still controlling you you need to take him to the Cross get him crucified and killed out self-willed dealt with that the body of sin might be destroyed that from hisence forth or from now on we should not serve sin you see this is it if our old man is crucified from then on we do not serve sin slavery is over amen verse seven for he that is dead is freed from sin now you know if you have died that old man has died then you are freed from sin watch knowing if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him so this is why Paul would say in Galatians 1:20 put that scripture up please Galatians 1:20 he says I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live not I did I get it wrong 220 try again one more time I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me and the life which I now live in the flesh I'm living a life and it's in the flesh but I live it by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me I'm no longer a Slave to sin Hallelujah the blood has made me free and he that the son has set free is free indeed Hallelujah so in verse 8 where we were reading in Romans 6 knowing that Christ being raised from the dead died No More Death have no more dominion over him amen so does death have dominion over for Christ it has no more dominion over you either because in that he died he died into sin once but in that he liveth he liveth to God likewise reckon yourself also to be dead indeed to sin but alive unto God through Christ Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it in the luster of Amen you say are you saying are you saying we are sinless I am well how is that now here I'm going to reel you back over it's is it because we never made a mistake no but it's because the desire of sin is gone and when you do make a mistake it's like stepping into a pile of manure now I got a neighbor around here that they got a dog and when I walk in their yard I have to watch for the manure I have to watch it as I go in the house and when I get into my car because I don't want to step in the stinky stuff it tracks it's smells it contaminates it gets on me and I hate it I will not purposely put my foot in the middle of it amen but if I make a mistake I will quickly wash it off and you do not do that on purpose purp but when you do Jesus blood washes you and cleanses you from all sin Hallelujah that's why he said if you sin willfully you have to come into the knowledge of the truth there's no sacrifice that remains for you in other words if you sin willfully you got to go back to Calvary cuz you don't have a sacrifice but if you got a sacrifice you're not going to be sin in willfully you're not going to be purposely doing things wrong and willfully doing things wrong oh yeah you do my you'll do things wrong you'll make mistakes along the way but it will not be something you contemplated it won't be something you desire are you with me now you see you're not living under the old Covenant and its blood because it had no power to take away sin desire it loved sin amen now the life that's in Christ came back upon the repented Sinner and that life being the perfect life of Christ sinless and righteous then the guilty one could go free for he had no desire to sin the life of Jesus had come back upon him and that's what has men in Romans 8 and2 the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from the law of sin and death hallelujah amen amen now we are sinless right but now let's think of it we are sin we are sinless because his blood has cleansed us but in the other sense I'm not sinless I got plenty of things hanging on me but every hour I confess it I constantly when I see my wrong I turn from it amen and I try to do what's right I wouldn't try to go to heaven on my merits I I wouldn't get there on my merits amen I'm trusting solemnly in Jesus Christ you know you know what I I I I do the same thing I do the same thing when I walk through that neighbor's yard and they have that dog and I watch out for the piles I do the same thing when I get on the internet I watch the piles and I avoid them not because I desire them but because I don't want to be contaminated the thing stinks and I don't want it on me and I don't want to be contaminated with it amen I hate it the desire for that is gone oh those beautiful women them women are beautiful they're the gate to hell they never make you a wife they're not even real a woman a woman like that there's a model out there she won't be a model all her life baby or two if she ever becomes a real mother it'll stretch her out I mean I'm telling you they're not real amen that's why you want a real wife a real woman that'll be a real mother and you don't want to be looking over this and trying to compare with that it's filthy and besides that it's sin the Bible said if you look upon a woman to lust after in your heart you committed adultery with her already in your heart Hallelujah so what is it you walk You Walk Through This World you're in this world but you're not of it right say well brother Tim I walk down the street and there's pornography there and then and I look over that way and there's another bunch of girls with pornography and I look over there well start looking up when you see these things come to pass turn your head and look up for your Redemption draws nigh sure we sin we make mistakes but not willfully sin desires are gone what I'm trying to do today is tell you to step up in faith amen come up into a higher sphere there there's a higher life than what you're than than that where that you are endued with power from on high where the powers of God come down as the rain from heaven and we are to live in Heavenly places where there is nothing between us and God and that that would hold back the rain from Heaven you know the nominal church with it has its cold professions just rituals and they get a little very little of the spirit because of its rituals and and and cold professions or La an umbrella holding back the spirit trusting that their profession of faith in Christ will has saved them but saved them from what still habits of porn and alcohol and cigarettes and vaping and rock and roll and wrap and all the other stuff is just a cold profession well I'm in the message brother Tim that can be a cold profession maybe some are Justified or Sanctified but they need to move higher then you get in the Full Gospel ranks of the zoza movement they get a little more many times fanaticism holds them back from the full blessings maybe get the Holy Spirit on their human spirit and and they'll shout or dance or even manifest A Gifted tongues but they too need to move higher we've got to move into that this next sphere into the fullness of the spirit where nothing neither cold forms nor rituals nor nor fanaticism holds back the blessings before we can ever have the Rapture you see God wants us to have more than ritualistic forms this would this had happened even with Israel and and God's complain against him in the in the book of Isaiah he said you have comeing with your sacrifices in your worship and you make me sick he said your your offerings you know in your sacrifices are they they nauseate me he said because you're coming in with just a ritualistic form you know and yet it's the truth you're doing exactly what I said do but you're not doing it with sincerity you're not doing it in the right atmosphere of realizing I sin I'm wrong I you know I'm bringing a lamb but it's me that should have died you see originally that that's the way it was they took this lamb they kept it up and you know it was it was a pet it was it the life meant something but after a while you know money got into it and you could just go buy your lamb you know do you ever raise something and have trouble eating it you know we were talking the other day you know I I was I was a farmer and so you know brother Craig Bo he was City Slicker come down to our place and and I gave him a bottle to feed the baby calf you know we didn't have a market well we milk goats and so we didn't have a market for the milk cuz it's illegal Louisiana to sell it so I could I could feed it to a calf and raise a calf and sell that make soap out of other things so anyway you know I could do that or make meat for the table so he looked at that little Jersey calf you know which is not really a meat animal but you know could be used for that purpose little little steer see his big brown eyes you know and and reach out his tongue and wrap it around the big nipple on that bottle and sucking he's oh this is so cute so cute what's his name I said [Laughter] tasty but you know it's like that you know when you when you know there it's sometimes hard you know to to eat Betsy when you raised her you know but but the same thing was with with them you know to begin with there was pain in this there was pain in this you know you took a a lamb and and you said I should have died but this Lamb's going to die in my place and they didn't do like we did take a 22 and end its life and then cut his throat they would hold it back there and then they would cut the juggler vein and with every heartbeat it would spray out blood and the worshipper would get blood on him I I'm sorry this is Gory I don't mean it that way I'm trying to get a point to you that it came with feeling you know with remorse of taking a life of the seriousness of a sin but it got where we just go buy one at the market we just go get one you know we just offer it well that's what we've done for Generations that's way it CS with church sometimes well Mama went to this church and Daddy went to this church and Grandpa went to this church and it begins to lose its feeling and the sincerity isn't there you know and and there there God I'll hide my face from you I don't want it it stinks in my nostrils read the book of Isaiah and you'll see it that they had come to the point that that there was the the atmosphere wasn't right the feeling wasn't there the remorse for sin wasn't there and and the Bible warns us that in the last day the church would get away from sincerity and faith that they would have a form of godliness but would deny the power thereof and God hates a powerless religion any religion that doesn't have Christ in it is powerless amen any religious that any religion that Christ in is is under his own blood and it's got power in it you know God hates a religion without power that's why he told this leoan church you are lukewarm you make me sick yeah and it will get to the place right there in the very Church itself where sin will be done and wrong is done but then the power to live above it is denied because we have a form of godliness but the power to live an overcoming life isn't there so it's never in action I'd like you to turn with me to Ephesians 1 and verse 18 in this letter to the Ephesians Paul did not pray that Believers might be given divine power but that they might be aware of the divine power they already possessed what I'm trying to tell you with the Holy Ghost you have been given power and it must be displayed it must have the inoc to ward off the destroyer in Ephesians 1:18 the eyes of your understanding be enlightened that you may know the hope of his calling and what is the riches of the glory of his inheritance of the Saints and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usw who believe according to the working of his mighty power which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead and set him at his own right hand in the Heavenly places far above all principal ologies and power and might and dominion and every name that is named not only in this world but in that which is to come ain't that a wonderful scripture look what he says I want you to understand you've been given a power and that power is the same power that raised up Jesus from the dead that quickened his mortal body so don't you know if that Holy Spirit did that to Jesus dead in the grave what will it do to you who are dead in sins and trespasses and Quicken you and make you alive in Christ Jesus it'll raise you up to serve the Living God so it is not powerless it has power in it to take a man dead for three days and raise him up again so much power that it'll take you and raise you up to walk in the newness of Life notice what it is he he raised him up far above principalities and power and might and everything that is every name that is named you name it Christ triumphs over the Holy Ghost that's Christ isn't it they're not three persons in the godhead there's one person and that's Jesus Christ are you with me we believe in a one God Bible am don't we here oh Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord there's one Lord One Faith one baptism one God one Holy Spirit and the Holy Ghost is the spirit of Christ and if you have the Holy Ghost you have the spirit of christu Hallelujah and it's Triumph now you name it come on fire above all principality fire above Satan far above every work come on far above any Kingdom and power and might and dominion and every name that is name not only in this world but also in the world to come I'm telling you that's the power of the Holy Ghost it is the power over kingdoms of hell it is the power over sickness it is the power over sin it is the power to make you live a righteous holy life it's the power of God into Deliverance look at verse 22 let's just read it down and then I'm going to go into ver chapter 2 look now and he has put all things under his feet Hallelujah let's don't just read over this and and gave him to be head over all things to the church so he's the head of the body and the body has the feet come on somebody amen he has he is the head and his body on the earth is the church and we are his feet we are his boots on the ground amen this is where he's living this is where he's acting this is where he is raining he is now raining on am through you come on and gave him the Bed Head Over All Things to the church and put all things under his feet so then therefore it's not just under his feet it's under your [Applause] feet Hallelujah every one of them are already defeated you are fighting with a defeated foe I am announcing to the devil today Satan you are defeated your works are defeated your power is vanquished amen that Jesus is Lord over all and he lives in my heart and greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world Amen and he listen now look what he's done he has lifted us up now watch this is his body the fullness of him that filth all in all look now and you and you ha he quickened who was dead that word Quicken is Made Alive amen when it says Quicken it means made alive when it said the word of God is quick that don't mean oh it's a sword that's really quick no it means it's alive the word of God is living it is alive it is powerful more powerful than a two-edged sword amen it'll cut coming and going it'll discern right down into the innermost parts and you happy quickened who were dead in sins and trespasses next verse wherein then times passed you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the air atmospheres Satan had control over the atmospheres of your life amen the according to the prince of power of the air the spirit that now worketh in the children of Disobedience verse three what's now among whom we also had our manner of life our conversation that means manner of life in Times past in the lust of
