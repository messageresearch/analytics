need our abilities he don't need our resumes and what we have done or what we can do but he just needs our emptiness amen and he can he can still take the things that are obeys and make him great you can still take the high things and make them low because he's God Amen and amen I'm thankful tonight to be a part of his great Plan of Redemption amen God bless you brother else you're good to see you all this evening sure good to see everyone here in the house of God everyone on the table to be here tonight I know the devil's upset uh sending sickness around him things but we're happy tonight amen because we've got the victory amen over over the devil over sickness over sin over everything we've got the victory tonight and I was reading today the prophet of God said we are his victory so amen I was just studying the other day and praying and I got to reading where the prophet of God said we are his victory and I don't know what just struck me if anybody the devil fight it'll be this bride amen because she's been identified as the victory of Jesus Christ and we greet you all to see in the name of the Lord we sure counted an honor and a privilege to be here with you all and I want to bring your greetings from our pastor brother Sean Martin the Saints there at home at Faith Tabernacle send their greetings to you as well and sure appreciate brother Tim and the friendship and the invitation to be here tonight and speak to you and appreciate this assembly and what you stand for the message of the hour and this you're glad to have my wife here and I think last time we was here a little Malachi was on his way but he's here and that we're sure thankful to have him with us this evening and I told somebody the other day I said if you hadn't seen him yet just hold on a few minutes you'll hear him as he enjoys church amen and I believe we enjoy the presence of the Lord let's just buy our hearts together this evening let's ask the Lord to come and how many has laid upon your heart something you need the Lord to do for you tonight amen he's a Healer he's a deliverer he's here tonight to meet that need Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here on this Wednesday afternoon Lord we're very well aware that we're not in this building by ourselves but Lord there's a host of unseen Angels Lord that have lined the walls of this building father before your children go to war you send angels in to the midst of the camp Lord and father I reminded of your Prophet when he stood there that night in the Houston Coliseum and Lord he said there was hundreds of Angels in the building Lord father I believe those same angels are right here in this building tonight I believe there's an anointing upon this assembly father by this word for it as We Gather here tonight we've not come to be seen we've not come to be heard but Lord we have come here for one motive and one objective and that is to lift up the name that is above every name that at the name of Jesus every sickness has to Bow ever disease ever flesh eating disease ever ever infection in the body has to bow to the name of Jesus ever ever blood condition everything has to Bow Lord every demon of habits and strongholds Lord has to bow at your name so Lord we lift up the name of the Lord Jesus Christ come take your preeminence among us tonight God may you be the welcome one Among Us may you be the Unseen guest but father Lord we're asking you don't don't just remain the Unseen guest but Lord help us to get ourselves out of the way so we can see you Lord help me to move myself aside as the speaker Lord may you anoint me to get myself out of the way but may you anoint the hearers as well Lord to move themselves out of the way and Lord whatever is accomplished here tonight we'll be sure to stand back and to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it to do your wonderful name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen and amen if you have your mindless this evening while you're standing with us we want to turn to the Book of Luke the 19th Chapter The Book of Luke the 19th Chapter I think I saw brother Abraham back there God bless you buddy amen a camp Camp friend of mine it's sure good to see you all God bless you the Book of Luke the 19th Chapter we want to look here in the 41st at first everybody love the Lord amen Luke 19. in verse 41 and when he was come near he beheld the city and wept over it saying if thou had us known even now at least in this thy day the things which belong unto thy peace but now they are HID from Thine Eyes isn't that a sad situation for the day shall come upon thee that thine enemies shall cast a trench about the incapacity round and keep thee on every side notice this and shall lay thee even with the ground and thy children within thee and they shall not leave in thee one stone upon another now one thing could have avoided all of this and he said because thou knew is not the time of thy visitation had they recognized the time of their visitation it would be a different reading in the previous verses but they did not recognize the time of the visitation now in the book of First Peter the second chapter I want to pull one verse of scripture with you from there in First Peter the second chapter and the 12th verse Peter 2 in verse 12 Peter here says having your conversation honest among the Gentiles that were as they speak against you as evil doers they may buy your good works which they Shall Behold glorify God in the day of visitation we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon I want to on this Wednesday evening for just a few moments I want to speak to you here and I want to draw our title and our thought from a prayer brother Brown and prays in the uncertain sound I want to read it to you 1962 Spokane Washington he said heavenly father I pray the prayer for them with all my heart I give them to you he says they're trophies of the message they're trophies of your visitation I want to speak tonight on trophies of his visitation they're trophies of the message they are trophies of your visitation being here tonight sin you walk among us doing works that has never been done since the foundation of the world until the these last days here they are they're your children now I commend them to you Lord you give them to us and we give them to you in the name of Jesus Christ watch over them and raise them up at the last day I may never be able to shake their hands on this Earth but when the battle is over and the last trumpet is sounded and the dead has risen from the grave and the life has been called up together with them to meet the Lord in the air then may I have fellowship with Jesus Christ and them around the throne and through the Eternal ages to come he says Grant it Lord they are yours in the name of Jesus Christ amen I believe that's a powerful prayer that a prophet was praying over the church that you're not just church members you're not just citizens of a state or citizens of a country but you're actually amen trophies of something that is of a higher power your trophies of the message your trophies of thy visitation now when you look at this word visitation Webster says it is a special dispensation of divine favor or wrath so a visitation nation is a special dispensation and it's either coming upon whoever let me put it this way however you recognize it will depend on the effect it has upon you if you if you recognize it it is a time of favor if you don't recognize it then there will be a time of Wrath to follow and that's what happened there in Luke the 19th Chapter amen as Jesus told him he said listen amen the time will come and these things will happen but because you did not recognize amen what was being done now your children will be laid in the ground within thee and the enemy will Compass thee amen but if you recognize amen the time of visitation it will be a peace unto you it will be it'll be a special season of favor now when you start looking at this word visitation in the Bible the Bible actually speaks of visitation in job 10 verse 12 he says thou has granted me life and favor and thy visitation has preserved my spirit how many how many can say the visitation of God has preserved your spirit amen thy visitation has preserved spirit in Psalms 102 verse 13 He says Thou shalt arise and have mercy upon Zion for the time to favor her amen yea the set time is come so Zion amen is a type of the Bride right amen and you are the Bride of Jesus Christ so the Bible here says amen that if you would actually go and look at God's calendar there was a time amen that God would favor the bride and he said the set time amen it's not coming and it not has been amen but the set time is now to favor her remember him send me the power amen reached down and pick up the people and shake them Lord and let them realize that this is the day of their visitation this is the time amen that the Lord has said this is the time of their healing now amen I love the way brother remember says that because it's not the time that a man has said it's not the time that a church has said it's not the time amen that a preachers thought well you know now's a good time to go favor amen but actually before the foundation of the world amen the time was set by the almighty God of a season that he would favor amen the end time bride and I'll say it to you like this amen that time is here you say well amen I'm too young or I'm too old but according to a prophet every generation amen receives a visitation amen the prophet of God said we're thinking Our Kind Heavenly Father for this great visitation Amen in our generation that we're now living in Amen to see these things come to pass amen we're living in the time amen where we're not having together three times a week and talk about what God done amen and we're not Gathering to talk about what God's going to do amen but actually we have a focus of what God is doing right here amen we're not just gathering tonight to say well 50 years ago amen God delivered Rose Helen Griffin in 50 years from now if God Terry's just coming he'll deliver somebody else but actually amen we can turn our attention from the past and the future Amen to the present and say what God done amen is what God's doing and what he's doing now is what he will continue to do until the changing of our bodies listen I don't believe the church and living God has got to live amen looking in a rear view mirror I don't believe amen that the best days for this bride is behind her amen I believe they're right here upon her and I believe they're in front of her listen you say well we've seen a lot of healings but I propose amen will see more amen well we've seen a lot of Miracles but I propose amen will see more miracles well brother Andrew we've seen a lot of prayers answered for unbearing wounds amen but I propose we'll see more prayers answered amen because this is the time amen that God is Not favoring the generation of Noah he's not favoring the generation of Samson but he's favoring the generation of this end time bride now amen I think thee tonight Holy Ghost he said for the visitation of him amen right here in this building the Holy Ghost is right here in this building he said even here right now and the Very Spirit according to the word of God which is infallible and cannot fail amen the very spirit of God is infallible and it cannot fail and it's in this building he said the same spirit that raised Jesus from the grave is right here in our midst now he meant the same spirit that raised our Lord amen from the grave it's not in the grave in Jerusalem tonight it's not in a tomb in Jeffersonville it's not in a building in Jeffersonville amen but the spirit of the Lord is in his word and his word is in his bride then I propose to you tonight amen that my God is not dead amen my God is alive he is well he is still saving he is still delivering he is still healing he is still Breaking Chains he is still giving the Holy Ghost he is still revealing himself listen what he was is what he is and according to John it's what he shall always be amen the spirit of God is not dead it is right here in our midst now amen I'll say it to you like this if there's ever been a time amen now is the time somebody look at somebody next to you and say now is the time if there's ever been a time now is the time you say now is the time to do what preacher Amen to realize the seriousness of the visitation of God Amen I want to go on record tonight and say Amen if there's ever been a time to preach this message amen right now is the time to do it if there's ever been a time Amen to enjoy the blessings of the Easter seal that has been released upon the church now is the time that people say well someday we'll shout amen someday we'll dance someday we'll believe I say well when are you going to do it if you're not going to do it now amen we're not going to need healing in the Millennium but we do need it here we're not going to need Deliverance in the Millennium but we do need it here so as long as we need it amen God is that God is supplied and there's going to be somebody that's going to enjoy it and they're going to raise up out of the condition they're going to raise up out of the situation they're going to raise up out of all the circumstances and realize that God has visited Our Generation Amen on this ear monitor if you can turn it up and let me control to be great amen the gospel is being preached just like it was in the days of Noah now to the world is fanaticism our Holy Ghost Gospel is fanaticism to the world Amen but it is glorious and welcome to those amen who are willing to come into the Ark of Safety and the Ark of Safety is Christ amen I'll set you like this if there's ever been a time Amen to get in this revival now is the time to do it I'm on church if there's ever been a time Amen to get into what a prophet taught Now's the Time to do it if there's ever been a time to turn your ears Amen to death here to everything contrary to the voice of the seventh angel Now's the Time to do it if you ever want to serve God Amen Now's the Time to do it if you ever wanted to rejoice in the Glorious Liberty we're with Christ has set you free Now's the Time that they're if you ever wanted to break out in another dimension amen and believe God for the impossible amen now is the time to do it if you ever wanted to see this since now is the time to see you if you ever wanted to see demons cast out Now's the Time to cast them out if you ever wanted to see the Holy Ghost amen change a sinner into a son and daughter of God Now's the Time to do it I'll tell you what we what the devil sell us amen some idea about something coming in the future but I refuse they meant to miss one more blessing in the visitation of the Holy Ghost and the age I'm living in oh yeah the Ark of Safety is Christ now amen of divine favor somebody say now now thank you brother now is the time of divine favor for the sons of God I love what First John 3 1 says behold what manner of love hath the father bestowed upon us amen that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth is not because it knew him not amen but beloved now somebody say now now we are the sons of God it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is amen that little word now is a very powerful word it means at this time it means at the present time it means now brother said now is the hour now is the time now is the accepted hour this is the acceptable year of the Lord he said now is when healing is supposed to be somebody say now is when healing is supposed to be amen now is when Miracles take place amen now is when Christ is revealing himself here we are now not in the future amen the devil keeps pushing it off and that's Catholicism amen but now is the day this is the hour this is the time amen this is the place right now this is the day I know there's a lot of critics and I just got to preach tonight amen but how long are you going to let the critics amen talk you out of the greatest Revival that has ever hit the face of the Earth amen and how long you're gonna let the credit sit around and say well it shouldn't be here and it shouldn't be there amen I got one question for you why not even like Tabernacle amen why not this young person amen why not this ministry why not our sisters why not why not amen give me one good reason why not amen I'll tell you why you can't give me one good reason it's because there's not an anointed good reason there's an old critical good reason amen but I'm not looking for critical reasons amen I'm looking for Faith Amen in faith can break out in the heart of a Believer right here in this church tonight and say now is my Miracle now is my healing now it's my Deliverance now is when my particles coming home now is when I receive the answer to my question now is the time I receive the Holy Ghost now is the time I see the dead raised back to life now is the time or I want to climb up on my highest point and say not tomorrow and not yesterday but right now got a right he meant to break out into another dimension with God we put these things off in the future they've been so long people can't even talk about it no more but you're not crazy to believe it right now right now you are the sons of God remember him said these things that we're seeing today they couldn't happen 20 years ago things you're seeing happen today he said they couldn't happen 20 years ago amen or even 40 years ago but it today it happens because this is the hour [Applause] this is the time this is the time it's fulfilled why because God promised it and here it is amen so when you recognize that now is the time now is the hour now is the season today is the day amen and you are the generation receiving this visitation then it'll open up a whole new meaning to you when I call you a trophy the problem of God set the end of the prayer of token 1963 he said if there be a seed anywhere that's predestinated Lord to hear the word of this last day may they come now amen sweetly and humbly and lay their trophies down at the cross now he said if there's a seed anywhere and they hear this word he said may they come so they as a person right so here comes a person and they lay their trophies down at the cross Now watch how he turns his and says or their self as a trophy so he no longer is calling it an object amen but now the trophy has become you oh God now the trophy is no longer something that you are holding in your hand as a representation of a victory past or a victory future amen but he said may they come and as they're laying their trophies down may they recognize it the trophy is not marble amen it's not granted it's not gold they've been but the trophy is the human and may they lay themself down as a trophy of the grace of God that's called them and may they be filled with the Holy Spirit oh God and this play the token of the life of Jesus Christ in his resurrection as long as they remain here on the earth I could preach on that quote for 30 minutes amen because in one prayer amen Silas he changed amen the trophy from being an object to being a person then he included the token and then he said may as long as they remain on the earth may they be a trophy of the grace that called them amen out of Darkness into this marvelous life listen I'm gonna go ahead and say it you don't have to go to heaven to be a trophy you don't have to die to be a trophy I mean you don't have to wait till till the bind by or the great Hereafter amen but according to a prophet amen you are to be a trophy as long as you remain on the earth amen I believe that there's a bride who's not waiting to get to heaven in order to enjoy him and amen but she's enjoying Heaven on the earth amen because the baptism of the Holy Ghost has brought a discipline has brought a deposit of Heaven into your soul listen friends I don't think we got to wait until we get on the other side Amen to shout and rejoice amen but I believe right here on a Wednesday night when the word is being preached and the message is having preeminence I believe we got a right to shout I believe we got a right to Rejoice among church do you realize what you are you are the answer to the Father's prayer you are the answer to Our Father's prayer when he stood upon the Earth he said father let thy kingdom come he said let thy will be done amen where On Earth as it is and heaven in other words there would be a kingdom people who would be regenerated by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the blood of Jesus and they would be manifesting heaven on Earth listen I believe somebody is going to manifest forgiveness here on the earth I believe somebody is going to manifest the ability to live above sin right here I do not believe these things are just in the future Church I believe your trophies of the grace of God that has called you now a trophy has got to be displayed anybody anybody ever got a trophy in anybody two of you three of you you ever got a trophy you never took that Trophy and hit it but you wanted everybody to see it come on now and then you hung it on your wall you come on people even build what they call Trophy showcases amen cause they want everybody to see amen their trophy I remember I remember in high school it's about my junior year it was graduation and awards night and they was giving out Awards and trophies and so they're sitting there passing them out and here gets somebody up for a 3.5 GPA and here comes somebody for a 4.0 you know and I'm just kind of sitting there saying thank God for open book tests you know it's the only way I graduated and I'm just sitting there and then all of a sudden they call my name and I said well I said I don't know what I'd be getting the trophy for because him grades ain't testifying to them numbers and not that time they said Andrew Glover we award you with the trophy of Christian conduct now I know some people probably looked at me like that's crazy amen but I shouted higher about that than I did about a 4.0 they say well why would you shout amen because I was thankful that somebody amen could see what Jesus Christ had done in my life and not acknowledged me but acknowledge Him amen where did the strength come from to get it it comes from Jesus Christ where did the grace come Amen to manifest a christ-like character it did not come from school it did not come from education it comes from the baptism of the Holy Ghost that God In My Soul as a 12 year old boy in a room in Dry Creek Louisiana and it's never got out because it's Jesus and he made me a trophy I may not have much I may not look like much amen but in the eyes of my father I am a trophy of the grace of Jesus Christ and it's called me out of Darkness it called me out of confusion it called me out of the past it called me out of stars it called me out of Destruction I think it's time we let a lost and Dying World see the trophies of almighty God a trophy is something that ought to be displayed now when you look at the word Webster Webster's definition of trophy it means something gained it means something achieved or given in Victory or Conquest especially when preserved or mounted as a memorial it is a representation of such a memorial as on a mantle see it is a game animal or a fish that is suitable for mounting as a trophy I love this part it is usually used attributively so actually what a trophy is is a trophy is an expression or an expressed attribute of victory a trophy is an expressed attribute of Victory now the problem said God's secret mystery he had before the world began he said now in the back part of God's mind he said there was something he was trying and was going to achieve what is a trophy it is something that is given Amen in exchange for something that is achieved amen he was going to try he was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't an atom there wasn't a moon a star a molecule anything he was God but he actually wasn't God at that time because God is an object of worship and there was nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted those attributes to be expressed and in him was love in him was to be a father in him was to be a son in him was to be a savior in him was to be a Healer and all these great attributes we see already expressed they were in God now you know the first thing created there Amen in the mind if God was Angels right amen and Angels what could they do they could hear him say I'm a father and they would say yes you're a father they could hear him say I'm a savior and they would say yes you're a savior they can hear him say I'm a Healer he would say yes you're a Healer brother brother will you make it hear him say I'm a deliverer and they would repeat back to him yes sure deliver amen but those angels had no clue what they were talking about they had no clue what they were talking about amen because they had never experienced what he was talking about so they could he could say I'm a Healer and they could say yes you're a Healer he could say I would liver and they could say yes your liver amen can I go and say it angels are not trophies they meant of the attributes of Jesus Christ amen because they've never experienced they've been the powerful force that's in those attributes amen but who has more power before God Amen an angel that is never sin or a redeemed son and daughter of God and according to a Vindicated Prophet a redeemed son has more Authority before God than an Angel that's never notes him listen the angels can agree by hearing it amen but you can agree by experiencing it amen and he can come to this building tonight and say I'm a Healer and something in your hearts will begin to scream out yes you're a Healer amen he can say I'm a deliverer and something in your hearts amen will bring you to your feet and you'll say that's right Prophet God you are deliver amen not because you delivered my friend amen but because you delivered me you can

system politics sins all kinds of evil spirits that the world is contaminated with and all the heavens above us in here contaminated with evil spirit he said in our bodies that we live in now what's put on this Earth when God created it because you're out of the Dust of the earth it was all laid out here when God himself created you were in his thinking and in him the great Eternal was the fault

because you're Eternal with eternal now the problem that God said The Rock will blow it off I cannot tell you how the devil how much the devil is trying to withstand this fire can I tell you how powerful this fire is remember sending the future home he said this fire that is coming up on the earth he said it's going to renovate the Earth he said it's going to do the same thing to the Earth that the Holy Fire did to your body he said it changed you he said the Holy Fire is going to change this earth now you go read your Bible and you'll never read the name Jupiter in the Bible you'll never read Pluto you'll never read Neptune or Venus or Mars you know why because Earth is the only planet that is mentioned in the book of redemption so the Earth has got to be redeemed in order for the trophies to live upon it come on church amen this Earth is not going to be redeemed amen for cancer to live upon it amen because cancer is not a trophy of God's visitation this Earth is not going to be redeemed amen for brain bleeds to leave upon it amen because brain bleeds are not a trophy of God's visitation among church this Earth is not going to be redeemed for pornography Devils Amen to still find houses to live in because this Earth was not made to be a Showcase of trophies for devils and unforgiveness and bitterness amen but this Earth was made to be the habitation of every holy thing and that Old Devil contaminated but I want to put notice on every devil in hell there's a fire on the way boy there's a fire on the way it's going to burn the Republicans off it's going to burn the Democrats off it's going to burn the Liberals conservatives Independence come on somebody it's going to clean this Earth and you know what it's going to make claim for for you because my Bible says the righteous will walk out on the ashes of the wicked and you are not a trophy for the Demons of hell you are not a trophy for the spirit but I might as well preach since I'm here hat now you're not a trophy for depression you're not a trophy for cancer you're not a trophy friends have to come on eating a lot you're not a trophy amen for every little critical voice that goes to the Airways to say something you are a trophy of the blood of Jesus Christ you are a trophy of the revelation of Jesus Christ you are a trophy of a God who can take a nobody and make us somebody out of him I want to go ahead and tell that devil amen you're going to get this building someday but as long as we're here we're going to enjoy it look around and you say well one of these days I'm going to get it that's exactly right it'll be cannon fodder amen but the people that's on the inside of it will be Eternal trophies arriving safely back at the trophy Showcase of the Lord Jesus Christ now oh my I got to get out bad or I'll be there all night and then but I want to tell you how powerful this fire is it's coming the part of God said it'll blow up everything are you ready he said even the water will ignite now come on when you see a fire what's the first thing you think about go get some water because the water is going to put out but whatever is in this fire oh God whatever's in this fire not even the water is going to be able to withstand it whatever is in this time when it strikes the water it's going to explode the water you know why because God's get Mother Earth ready even for his bride to return upon as a sinless spotless amen redeemed Earth hell glory to God hallelujah he said wait till the Earth receives that baptism he said then you'll see it now when Abraham speaks about these trophies in the message I love it because he mainly refers a mentor trophies in prayer and remember say when you go to prayer he said the first thing you do is you go to God with a worship and a Thanksgiving right so when he's praying he's actually worshiping God and giving God Thanksgiving for trophies which are not objects but they're humans he said like this they're trophies of this meeting their trophies of the message they are trophies of the presence of the Lord they are trophies of the grace of God they are trophies of the spirit of Grace they are trophies of this revival they are trophies of Christ's love at Calvary they are trophies of the Gospel that has been preached they're trophies of your word being made manifest preached by the spirit of the Lord their trophies of the message that even in the lifetime I love this when they're trophies amen of the ministry of the seventh angel so you're not just church members you're not just fathers and mothers and husbands and wives and young boys and young girls amen but you're actually trophies of the visitation of God in this generation now when you start looking at this trophies amen then brother man will connect these scriptures with trophies he'll say it like this in John 5 24 verily verily I say unto you he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me half everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation but it's passed from Death unto life in John 6 37 all that the father giveth me shall come to me and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out in John 10 28 I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand for my Father which gave them me is greater than all and the one and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand remember said all these are trophies that God has given to his son Christ Jesus by the power of His presence and the word of God my you are a trophy that God has been given amen by the power of His presence by the power of his word and by Jesus Christ that in other words the message of the hour amen is a claiming message amen that has claimed you for a purpose can he say Amen the blood REM said I claim them for you tonight Jesus as your own personal treasure as gems in your crown as members of your bride I claim their lives now you may say what claims me what brother what claims me well the prophet said and may every child of God that's in hearing distance of here or either the tape shall strike at the time I claim them for the kingdom of God up on the basis of knowing this is the word that's being revealed then what's claiming you is not brother Tim it's not brother Timothy it's not these other men of God what is claiming you is the word that's being revealed I'll come on church if something claims you then it's claims you not on by accident but it's claimed you on purpose amen for a purpose and by purpose can I say it to you like this you were claimed to be a trophy the message did not claim you to be a debater the message did not claim you to be a better quota the message did not claim you they meant to be a better memorizer amen the message claimed you ain't meant to be a trophy of what it was doing in the generation that you were living in in other words God's trophies are living trophies somebody say well amen everybody that's dead must be trophies but according to Ephesians 2 and verse 5 even when we were dead in sin have quickened us together with Christ by Grace ye are saved look at this word dead it means spiritually dead it means destitute of a life that recognizes and is devoted to God people say well someday when I when I when I breathe my last breath and I go on to Eternity man I'll be a trophy over there but I believe there's going to be some Believers that still got breath in their lungs well brother Andrew I don't know what program said here is those who were dead and has been raised up there is those who have been in accidents and were smashed up and they are healed he said I see Miss Wilson standing there not long ago she was hemorrhaging to dance with TB years ago but here she is tonight the doctors didn't just give her but just hours to live but here she stands tonight and all around through here lame blind crippled in wheelchairs everything he said they're standing tonight as living trophies why is it Jesus Christ lives and he is the same yesterday today and forever come on church amen an angel has visited this generation and it was not some angel that was hatched out of some man's Revival but it was the angel of the covenants it was the angel of the Lord and his return to this generation come on church and we've got innumerable manifestations come on right come on right here in this message alone we've got innumerable manifestations of the supernatural visitation of the angel of God in the generation we're living I say it's time to start picking up these testimonies and fighting back against that devil I think it's time to quit letting testimonies pile up and just be memories and landmarks of what God done I think it's time to pick up a testimony tonight and throw it back if that devil I think it's time to pick up a testimony of a young person getting the Holy Ghost and throw it back at that line therefore it says God don't give the Holy Ghost I think it's time I think it's time to pick up a testimony of a lying devil that says God don't heal cancer and throw a witness if that devil well it's the truth whether you want to believe it or not there is more with us than there is with them [Applause] I said there's more brother Derek with us than there is with him and the prophet of God said I guess in the providences of Canada alone there was over 250 or maybe more than that cases of cross-eyed people with their eyes straightened and mutually numerable to count them for there was multiplied scores of them that came some were deaf some are done some hard of hearing everything were made perfectly whole that's only done through the visitation of the angel the death only here through the visitation of the Angel the blind only see through the visitation of the Angel oh God help me Lord the dead are only raised to the visitation of the Angel amen you you get a breakthrough only because of the visitation of the angel now God gives four warnings amen signs of his visitation in other words God does not show up unannounced but according to a prophet he said if the death don't hear and the dumb don't speak and the blind don't see and the cripples didn't walk if Prophecies of sin isn't foretold the people and your sins from the time that he was a child foretold then believe that this Angel has come to me as a false and I'm false with it come on if the deaf don't hear the blind don't say the dumb don't speak he said sins revealed told from childhood things if that's not if that's false and I'm false with it he said but if it manifests itself here on the platform amen before you you believe it and repent of your sins and disbelieve for the hour of his visitation is Drawing Near that's right he only done those things to confirm his word then pray tell me why was Jesus Christ the son of God Amen laying a foundation of John 14 12 before he even left the Earth amen because there was a bride who was coming behind him that would do those Greater Works he said Greater Works in this shall you do because I go to my father amen notices Greater Works than they say you do now brother said can I can I break this down for you he said Jesus in his ministry he said Greater Works than they say you do he said now nothing could be any greater than what he did he said now what's happening there is it's the same thing he did he promised the church to do the same thing Jesus Christ did is what he promised the church to do only more of it than what he did so the only thing that changes is not the quality it's the quantity he stopped nature he raised the dead he spoke to Nature brother Daryl he took a fish and bread and fed five thousand amen what greater could be done than the creative power of Jesus Christ manifested in his son upon the Earth amen but in the end times the same God that was back there is going to return to the church that's here and it would not be equality it would be a quantity so it would know God it would no longer just be in one man it would be in a many-membered body Universal which would be fulfilled in John 14 12. now I just got to preach my heart amen because man is not doing these things come on have we have we come so far removed from what a prophet said the greatest prophet of Our Generation the greatest Ministry since Jesus Christ could stand on the earth and say I was not the one that done it I was only standing there when he done it come on church amen I just got to preach my heart to you amen I've heard guys testify and if I didn't know any better I wouldn't think anybody in the building was there but them amen because everything's brought upon me I wouldn't even know Jesus was there amen but because there's a real body and there's a real bride amen every one of these brothers sitting here recognizes they don't have power Amen in their physical body to release you from them demons and torment amen but they recognize the angel of God is in the church and if he is here then every demon is subject if he is here ever sickness and disease that's lost its hold among church it's not the man it's the angel come on you say preacher why do these guys get up and start song service and say now clap your hands and say amen amen because the Angels here and he comes reasonvided but he only stays where he's made welcome and don't you think it's time Amen to start entertaining the angel you say well brother Andrew how do I entertain the angel you got to wake up and forget about who's around you and forget about who's not here and forget about who didn't Shake whose hand and who didn't invite whose party well I feel like preaching I might as well hat now come on church and realize we're here for more than a social Gathering amen but the angel of the covenants has descended into the church in the last days to make good his Divine promises somebody entertaining I said somebody entertaining they say well preacher how do I entertain him hallelujah thank you Jesus that ain't nothing but the truth I tell you how you entertain the angel you don't make brother Tim preach his guts out and then finally decide to say Amen from the very first word go you say amen that's right come on church I I I'm just going to preacher for a second can I preach amen you're a man unlocks another dimension in these meetings come on brother Tim can spend 80 hours a week he can sit in the room with a Bible and his computer and the tapes amen and get every bit of manna and come this pulpit and he can labor and labor and labor and labor and I'll tell you what brother Tim will do he'll get it off his heart because he's not a hireling he's a preacher but if you want to see that gift go into another realm amen get off the nonsense before church and come in the house of God and from the very first word go say that's the truth speak to me Lord I entertain your presence and you're a man will reach into that gift and will unlock the power of the Holy Ghost and it'll break out in the church and the word will discern situations it'll change circumstances I still believe in old-fashioned Holy Ghost Land Son of God inspired preaching say we ought to open up the anointing we ought to open up the channels we ought to open up the atmosphere you got to open it up well I don't feel like it you got to open it up anyhow well I'm too tired you don't think these men of God come out here sometimes and they're physically drained but if they get out here anyhow and they preach their heart out you know why because they're doing it as a sacrifice of praising to God well I don't know how I got here but I'm here amen sometimes you gotta sacrifice a little bit and get out of your comfort zone and acknowledge the presence of the angel you're unlocked your amen unlocks the supernatural now well brother Andrew we've seen enough I don't think we have I think there's more to see [Applause] hello testing one two you're still working I think there's more to see rather than do we see Miracles I think there's more to see rather than do we sing God come in and bring prodigals home I think there's more to come well but Andrew I think we've had enough Revival well I think you have but I hadn't so give me some more come on church I'm not a little fish that's just barely getting by I am a rainbow I'm a rainbow trout and you know what I need I need that fresh Manna I need the Waters of joy and the Waters of Salvation I'm on friends I know what we've done amen we put God on a Time clock and we got him down to about a 25 30 minute song service in about an hour and a half sermon and then a few prayers and it's time to go amen but do you know the greatest Miracles I've seen is when people are willing to forget what time it is and remember God is still God and His word is still true and his power is still here come on you say well it's Wednesday since when did God become limited to Sunday my God can move on Monday my God can move on Tuesday my God can move on Thursday my God can move on Friday my God can move on Saturday he's an on time anytime anywhere God because the words look and think the devil anywhere Anytime Anyplace under any condition I have not forgot look God I'm serving I'm still serving the Jehovah Miracles and the Jehovah the old is the Jesus of the news and if he did it in Jesus he's going to do it in you if he did it in William Branham he's going to do it in Aaron if he did it in Paul he's going to do it in teams and Timothy and Joel he's going to do it he's going to do it and change he's going to do it in charge he's going to do it in June because he's God he's not limited he's the unlimited God yeah well glory to God whoever the Ender we've seen it but we shall see more now brother the Bible said can I have a few more minutes here [Applause] the Bible said in John 21 25 when they come down to the end of Jesus ministry they said there are so many other things which Jesus did the witch if they should be written everyone I suppose that even the world itself are you reading what I'm reading the world itself could not contain the books that should be written but hell he's still on the Earth he's still here in a corporate body and they're all ready saying what we've seen in this three and a half year Ministry could not even be recorded in books brother Brandon comes along and says wish I could testify a little bit of the things I've seen happen just in the last few weeks oh and I could testify you know it was John that said if Jesus done with me putting books there wasn't enough books in the world to write for him just what I've seen in my own Ministry seen him do you couldn't pile them in volumes on this platform here if I wrote it in the details when I seen him do just in my own Ministry seen him do see he had more success in my Ministry than he did in his own now remember he had more success now not me he had did you catch that word sister Debbie now now he had more success in my Ministry than he did his own he said he had more success in Jeffersonville than he did in Nazareth you say why because he finally broke through here he had more success right here than he did in Capernaum or Nazareth in that day see now notice this he done it now I never said I've done it see no cause I didn't do it I just didn't now can I tell you what he did though to see him do what he did to have more success in his ministry than in his own he said I just loved him and submitted myself to him and said what he said and the Holy Spirit went to the other people and they believed what he said then he'd done the work I just loved him I just submitted myself to oh I feel like preaching and I said what he said and the Holy Spirit went to the other people and they believed what he said then he done the work see then in Luke 19 first Peter 2 he speaks of this day of visitation so you got to love him that is visiting you're going to submit your heart to him that is visiting see it's the day of visitation it's the hour of visitation it's the time of visitation now the Bible is speaking here of the coming of the Messiah which was the very presence of God himself now the Bible said in Luke 19 41 he beheld the city and wept over it saying it foul had its known even thou at least in the day the things which belong in thy peace but now they're hid from thine eyes for the date shall come upon thee that thine enemy shall cast a trance about thee and compassionly around and keep being every side notice this because thou knew is not the time of thy visitation somebody said that word newest thou knew it's not the time of thy visitation now you say brother Andrew why are you drawing that point out because he only appears to those who are looking for him he only appears to those who are looking for him you say who is he appearing to he is not appearing to people brother Derek based on who they are oh God he's not where people say well bless God I'm a message believer so he's got to appear to me well but Scotty don't come on well brother I tell you who my daddy is he's going to appear to me well I tell you who your daddy is and he still don't have to because it's not he's not appearing to you based on who you are he's appearing to you based on what you will be come on Church the Pharisees saw him the Pharisees heard of him and they remain Pharisees they remain critical in different nitpicking come on decisive tearing everything apart amen his visitation did not change their condition his visitation did not change their position but can I tell you about one she's called the woman at the well [Applause] the woman at the whale said I know that Messiah cometh which is the cold Christ and when he has come he will tell us all things do you know what that word no means it means to have an interview with it means to visit so I know when Messiah comes oh God and I have an interview with Messiah and a visitation with him it will change me Jesus happened to her I am he that speaking to eat notice this remember said the woman at the well recognized her day by the sign of the Messiah when she recognized her hour of visitation she became a trophy of his visitation remember said if you receive him to them he give power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name so many of them missed him in that day don't you miss it in your day not me now him it's the day of his visitation I'm just a poor substitute of anything but it's him moving it's him working he just give me away a gift to heal myself to him and do these things for your benefit not for mine for yours so it's for you listen in other words as many as recognized him and entertained his visitation to them he changed their condition you all remember the Book of Genesis 18 when Abraham and Sarah sat in the tent right and here come the angel right and the Bible said Abraham kind of looked around and blinked his eyes checked his phone stretched a little bit and said well maybe Sarah will get up and do something go somewhere it's not what my Bible reads brother Jimbo my Bible says Abraham a hastened into the tent and the Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal and need it and make three cakes upon the Hearth and Abraham ran into the herd and fetched the calf tender and good and gave it to a young man and he hastened to dress him and he took butter and milk in the calf which he dressed and said it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat what did Abraham do he recognized this is my hour of visitation he was setting in the tent door on a real hot day he said there was a lot of complaints coming in Lately by the herdsmen if the grass was all gone the land was dried up and the cattle was becoming very thin the water supply was just about all gone you know sometimes amen when things are going wrong We Know by Nature that it's the darkest just before day and many times when we see disaster things happen like that especially to Believers we must bear this in our mind that it's Satan trying and to block the blessing that's on the road can I just preach to you in the line there's a blessing on its Road there's a blessing on its way there's a blessing in the building there's a miracle in the building but you know what that old dirty devil does I don't Slew Foot Creeps in and he tries to mock the blessing but if you can break beyond the Temptation Of The Devil and recognize this is my hour this is my time this is my message now is the time for healing now is the time for miracles now is the time for the supernatural now is the time for Jubilee now is the time for Freedom now is the time for answers now is the time for miracles now is the time for signs and wonders if you can break out of that old condition that you're in and recognize the time of visitation is upon you brother brother God said well uh Blue Devil I'm gonna preach it anyhow he said what happened was can I drive this home to you he said Satan was trying to tempt him to feel they had done wrong when Abraham and Sarah was fixing to receive a body change oh God That Old Devil showed up to tempt him if they had done wrong y'all know what I'm talking about come in the house of God on a Wednesday night amen just come out of a good hot camp meeting man power of God moving Holy Ghost Fallen Miracles taking place amen and go home and start facing Devils go home and start facing situations and you know what happens amen you'll come in here Wednesday night and that devil say shout now Dance Now raise your hands now you know you thought something wrong you know you said something wrong well I might as well preach that now you know that's what the devil does you know what he's trying to do he's trying to convince you that you've done something wrong because if he can convince you you've done something wrong then you'll never acknowledge that the angels in the building because you're afraid the angel is going to condemn you rather than forgive you amen but there's a mighty Angel and he's not controlled amen by 16 elements of humanity amen but he's a loving angel he's a forgiving Angel and you know what I found I found if you'll just start entertaining him he'll whip that devil every time if you'll just start praising him and giving him a little bit of worship he'll bind the jaws of that old long tongue Slew Foot and will release a blessing upon you that they'll have to pack you out of the building to Karen come on church I'm talking about a dissertation of the Mighty God in this generation get it now it's at the hour of visitation is when the hour of Temptation comes but the Prada God said that God has made a way of Escape now the Bible says but will also with the Temptation also make a way of Escape now watch this before a just God can pour out his judgment Upon A people he has to make a way of Escape for everyone who desires to receive it so before you God in the house of God and old sleuth but started talking to you and you started entertaining his old long tongue lying negativity and ignoring the angel the angel already made a way for you to praise God he already made a way for you to receive a miracle he already made a way for you to receive a blessing come on church so you know what I challenge you to do I challenge you to look at slew foot in the eye and say shut up and look at the angel and say I want more I want more of your love I've heard enough for that online Devil's negativity I want to feel you again I know it's Wednesday and I know I failed you but I want to feel your presence again I want to feel your touch again Lord I need a brand new touch I know I shot it on Thursday and I ran the aisles on Friday and I come home on fire on Sunday but I fought some battles I faced some hard times God I want to feel you again don't you ever let nobody put a cap on this revival oh I know what they try to do but I might as well preach that now I know what they try to do it's Devils of intimidation I feel it here someone preach it right out of here it's Devils of intimidation it's Devils it tells you you've come too many times you've been prayed for too many times you've been through too many prayer lines well brother Tim can I can I break into a sacred part of my heart here I've never even shared this before but I remember it's about an eight nine year old boy amen some of y'all probably remember on the videotape said Happy Valley as a kid you didn't see me up at the altar for prayer amen Wednesday night if I was there Saturday night Sunday morning going up for prayer amen somebody come to me one time they said I better be careful they said like this they said why do you go after prayer all the time I said cause I'm praying for something special I said what are you praying for I said I'm praying for something special they said well what do you keep going up there for I said cause I'm praying for something special like somebody one time got around the Altar and God's praying and somebody come out and they said well that's a little loud up here I couldn't understand the thing they were saying I just looked at him and said that's okay they weren't talking to you hey we're talking you that's talking to God maybe you ought to talk to him something well preach preacher think I believe I will I was praying for something you know what I was praying for I was praying to see my mom in the house of God and you know what I say thank God I didn't let that Old Devil of intimidation amen intimidate me to sit back you know what because today my mom's in church and she's serving God you know what I say I say it's time to draw our sword and cut every negative devil of intimidations head off you know what I say if we want to have a prayer line we'll have it if we want to have an altar call we'll have it if we want to have a shout hallelujah time we're going to have it because now is the time to have it if we want to run the aisles we're going to run the Isles if we want to dance we're going to dance you know why because now it's a computer and for all you gang Sayers out there look here if we're going to preach the message we're going to preach it right now because Now's the Time to do it brother Tim somebody's going to preach it and somebody's going to believe it and there's going to come a union between faith and the preaching of the word and it's going to transform you from the woman as a whale to a trophy it's going to transform you from a condemned son to a redeemed Son of God I'm not a crazy man I say don't quit I say don't quit well come on Church well I miss close to it might as well preach that now them same old people that want you to quit that want nobody to give up on them [Applause] well glory to God I'm preaching for young people stay with me they didn't want you to give up on you oh no have prayer services well then why should we give up on these young people [Applause] look at you like you're an idiot like you go to youth camps and young people shout and don't have the clue that some ain't living right I'm not stupid I know that but what about the ones that are well you need to clock them prayer lines down you need to quit having so many prayer lines because it's just weakening faith I know a prophet said bad amen but what about the ones that's getting faith stronger every time they go through come on church I still believe somebody go through a prayer line 31 times sister Lydia and on the 32nd time could be the night they step in their miracle well it's here some might as well entertain it I think it's time to let go and let God have his way we're not here to be trophies of criticism we're here to be trophy you all know what I preached over in Oklahoma amen the devil has come to its end I'm gonna preach on it here for a second the devil has come to his hand you know what I told you I feel like I just feel it on me so I'm gonna preaching brother Tim you got to put your foot on that devil you got to put your foot on that devil you are a devil stomping serpent bruise and trophy of the visitation of Jesus Christ then you got to put your foot on that devil I'm not gonna read it to you I'm just going to preach it to you the Bible says in Genesis 3 amen that the Messiah said amen would bruise the head of the serpent right who was stomping do that again that felt pretty good amen amen the serpent whose head would be bruised by the by the by the seat of the woman and the Bible said that that devil would bruise its heel would Bruce is healed and the Bible says in in Luke the 10th chapter that I beheld Satan thought I'm going somewhere I beheld Satan Paul from heaven like lightning amen you know what that word fall means that word Paul means come to its end so in other words Jesus said I saw Satan fall from Heaven and I saw him come to his end and the very next verse the very next verse he connects the devil's end to your foot leave me on the very next verse he connects the devil's hand to your foot and he says I saw Satan and I saw Satan fall from Heaven like lightning but the whole I give you power what is that power to do it's the tread on serpents and upon scorpions now you want to go a little bit further let's go that word tread means to crush that word tread means to stomp on the devil's head and when Jesus Christ defeated Satan that day at Calvary he released the power in your body to go to your foot and put your foot on the devil's head now I know what somebody's saying right now you're saying well brother Andrew brother Brian said we don't stomp it that loud and you're exactly right he did say that but he also said 31 times that Jesus Christ the son of God is in this building and he says you got arthritis he said but Jesus Christ heals you about arthritis he said now go stomp on that Devil's Head I put him over in Oklahoma amen devil stomping amen don't defeat a devil but it sure gets you defeated one on their move a lot quicker brother Tim I don't stomp on the devil to defeat him but when he is defeated y'all know what I'm telling y'all brother Mark when he is defeated I'm gonna Rap by the words to put my foot on the ground and let that devil know he's defeated and Jesus Christ the son of God Reigns in Victory Jesus Reigns in Victory He reigns over depression He reigns over suicide He reigns over nervousness He reigns over false Doctrine He reigns over up and down services [Applause] [Music] but Timothy you got your you got you a stray animal around your property and you won't get rid of that thing take your shotgun put a little bit of lead in it that thing might stand there and bark at you but he's already defeated the LED's already hit him so while he's standing there barking you know what you do you say get out of here get out of here well Jesus Christ that day at Calvary put some land in that big old devil call Lucifer and he's straying around here right now and he's staring somebody do something about it but I say tonight Church put your foot on the ground and say get out of here depression get out of here division get out of here unbelief get out of here negativity get out of here put your foot on that devil you know what we need to do we need to bring some good old-fashioned footstop and religion back in the house of God ain't nothing wrong brother we're standing up and stomping on a defeated devil I can take it a little bit further if that's okay I found out God don't just tell natural arthritis he also heals spiritual arthritis young people that heard some of this but I feel it here so I'm gonna preach it amen and you know what I found brother Tim I found we got a lot of spiritual arthritis in the church you know what spiritual arthritis is it's the stiffening and the less movement of joints as more AIDS creeps on it in other words the more age you get the more stiffer you get I found out we got some people amen this gun arthritis in their hands they can't shake hands with certain people no more because they got arthritis and they've seen too many faults in them and they've seen too many mistakes and they've seen too many failures so their hand can't shake hands with them no more you ain't got nothing but spiritual arthritis well that feels good in here don't it that Devil's on the run you know what else I found I found out people got spiritual arthritis in their arm they can't brothers can't hug their brothers no more and sisters can't hug their sisters no more because 20 years ago somebody done somebody wrong and they're still holding and they've let 20 years since spiritual arthritis spilled up in their hand and in their arms then you know what else I found sister Elena I found out some people got it in their shoulders when the songs are sung no more they can't raise their hands no more because they got enough Revelation through the years and it's too Pentecostal to raise their hands well I might as well keep on going I found out some people got some spiritual arthritis in their knees they used to stand up when the preacher is preaching but now they complain because everybody in front of them standing up you got spiritual arthritis anywhere else I found they got it they got it in their ankles you know what they can't dance no more they can't shout no more they got so many years to sit in a Pew on them but they can't enjoy the blessings of the visitation of the angel of God but you know what if I didn't do nothing else when I come here but this I'm going to do it in the name of Jesus Christ spiritual arthritis is defeated in the house of God it leaves your hands it leaves your shoulders it leaves your knees it leaves your foot the moon Jackson put your foot on it with me amen put your foot on that devil that devil is defeated I think it's somebody reminding him he's defeated [Music] remind that Devil he's defeated he's underneath you but Andrew I don't know I know you know how come I know because I recognize the visitation of the Angel and the age I'm living in now I'm just going to say it because I'm going to say it or I'm gonna bust Ram said like this he said I challenge you to Stomp on every imaginary devil he said stomp on that unreasonable fault that is prophetica that brother that is prophetic instruction he is instructing you to put ever imaginary thought under your foot and stomp on it you say brother Andrew imaginary thought oh yeah I'm picking him up right now by the word amen nobody loves me nobody cares for me amen I don't fit in the youth group I don't fit in the adults brother Tim don't have time for me brother Aaron ignoring me Timothy ain't call me in two weeks Joe don't like me amen that's an unreasonable imaginary thought from the pits of hell you know what you need to do put your foot on that devil put your foot on that devil I said devil trying to get you out of the house of God as a devil trying to talk you out of the blessings well come on church that's a live devil but it's time to put your foot on that devil come on Aaron show us how it's done put your foot on that damn boy come on brother Timothy come on brother Tim come on brother Joe put your foot on that devil J come on in your might as well put your foot on that devil and back up it's an unreasonable imaginary song from the pits of Hell put your foot on it I think somebody open them doors and let that defeated devil out of the building that devil is defeated I think we ought to swim the extra time get out of here devil we're not a bunch of trophies of bitterness we're not a bunch of trophies are credulous and unforgiveness we're trophies of the visitation now I can take in the Book of Esther the seventh chapter and the Bible says that Haman had plans I got in there the other day Heyman had plans he had plans to spool and to root out amen the Jewish people but the Bible says that Mordecai and Esther have been full of the devil's plans I think I preached that here years ago when God cancels the devil's plans are you hearing me Mordecai and Esther amen fooled the devil and they foil his plans haman's plans fell right in front of him you know what the Bible says the Bible says they hung Haman in The Gallows now if you get to studying something I found this brother tell me about how to run and fit you get to study that it was called the Feast of Purim which in the feast appear him thousands of years ago was a lot more pure than it is today it was actually a worship you look at Purim today and it's just a big it I probably says compared to your Mardi Gras it's just a big old a big old conglomeration of everything but back then they had a day of feast a feast of Freedom they had a day of Joy a day of Celebration and you know what it was to do it was to remind one person he was defeated and his name was Haman you know what if I did how I'm about to punch a devil square in the face you know what they did every time haman's name was mentioned they made noise you know why they make noise because the more noise the louder it be and the less echo of haman's name would go through the feast but I found something Brother Jay because the people they wanted there the most you know who they wanted there the most was the kids they invited the kids the most you know why because they was good at making noise [Applause] well give me some preaching room right here I know we got a bunch of people let's get a little bit aggravated our kids making noise amen but I might as well go ahead and say it Jesus Christ invited them to be at this Feast because their enemy Haven is dead and we're going to make so much noise with this message and with the promises of God and with the Praises under Jehovah well glory to God come on musicians I'm done amen but you know the next thing they done was they took the name Haman and they wrote the name Haman on their foot and every time they heard the famous mention of the name Haman they just stopped they just stumbled you know what they could be standing there talking to you and you're just having a conversation and out of nowhere brother Tim just kind of stomped their foot and then they say well I didn't hear it it didn't matter if you heard or not I heard it and that Devil's lost his power over my life this ain't a universal praise this ain't everybody in the church place and you can be here on a Wednesday night and brother Tim and brother Timothy are one of these men of God be preaching and everybody's sitting around you sleeping and you can just stand up and start stomping your foot because you've heard the word of the lord your enemy is dead Haman is dead you think I shout now You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet you think I dance now you ain't seen nothing yet you know why because when I leave this earth by the way of the Resurrection or by the way of a Rapture I'm not leaving my dance here I'm taking it with me because I got over there reading the other day brother Jude in the Book of Revelation the 20th chapter and the Bible says the devil was cast down and a lit was put over that devil and he was spent with a chain of circumstance and you know what I did brother Timothy right there I made an appointment with the devil I said you think I danced you ain't seen nothing yet you just wait till Jesus Christ lets me get a spot on that lid that old Devil's underneath it you think I'm on a dance step here I'm going to shout and I'm going to Rejoice because my enemy is locked up and I'm free I'm free in the presence of God I recognize my day I recognize this message I recognize the angel I recognize the anointing I recognize the absolute I recognize the voice of the seventh angel and by the word and the presence of Jesus Christ [Applause] Lord the devil's back in his place he's under your foot now I said to you like this you're a trophy Stompers you're stomping trophies because everything the devil's tried to use over you you're stomping over him [Applause] [Music] now somebody asked me one time they said Belinda how in the world are you going to place these trophies I don't have time to read it to you but I do have time to preach it to you real quick the way I'm gonna place these trophies is the rapture is the Gathering of the trophy you can go down there then the message and brother remember says in that day he said the people sitting there he said they won't be hybrid plants he said they'll be real Christians he said they won't have to be padded and babied and given a position to be a part of the church he said the rugged Christians well Tim I love these words he used he said they got trophy scars now we got any hunters in here tonight hey deer hunters now you've yet to kill a deer mount it on your wall and take somebody in there and show it to him and not tell them the story behind it I gotta place these things in your heart before I leave you've yet to go through there and say look that's just a little deer I killed Brother Sam they start talking about how they got up two weeks before and went out to the truck and went to the trail cam and Spilled their coffee and got back inside changed her clothes hey sided their gun in check their bowl I mean they'll tell you everything how they start up the tree stand dropped their backpack had to get and you're like man alive I just wanted to see the trophy you know the brother Tim there's something about the story [Applause] there's something about the story behind the trophy brother Derrickson just walking through and saying well I killed that one there and there's a trophy there but you say I thought after that one for a long time and that one right there I accidentally almost got caught trespassing but I because the struggle is what makes it the trophy [Applause] thinking about something brother Joe one of these days God is going to transform transfer this bride from the Hall of critics to the Hall of Fame [Music] and when he transfers this bride from the Hall of critics to the Hall of Fame he's going to put you in his trophy showroom and somebody's going to want to see you so for all these years the angels have been saying to him why is it that our amens and our yes you are a Healer and our yes you're a savior and our yes you're living why do they not mean as much to you as it does when brother Tim gets down there behind that Pulpit on Sunday why can I sit here and scream at you Lord You're A Healer you're a deliverer and you accept it but when you see that crazy preacher down there preaching on Sunday morning something in your heart swells up and you just can't

minds on just the individual but lord it's not the individual it's the trophy story it's the trophy scars Lord as I said studying the other day and Spirit just come by my heart Lord I got to thinking about how that we live in a generation where the kids can be a part of a sports team or something and they may never get off the bench one time to play one one play they may never they may never dirty their uniform one time but at the end of the season they all get a trophy because it's called participation trophies so Lord they got a participation trophy just cause they showed up the man never
