going through in situations that they're in or they're those that no common men incarcerated because of the truth there are other countries that the word the message itself has been has been marked as

be in the presence of the Lord and believe in the Lord will speak to us today and minister to us to his word a man the president the other day declared the churches were essential well we already knew that the song he just told us what we knew and remember we know God is essential he's the one that's essential and we need him in our lives today may he just speak to us Amen Philippians chapter 2 and verse 1 we're going to read this today I read it last Sunday as we've preached on the name of Jesus the authority of the name of Jesus I hope that you if you wasn't here he was able to at least um be able to enter in with us but now we're going to look at the scripture again and a little slightly different direct today if there be any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the Spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfilled you my joy that should be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant which was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross wherefore God hath out our own wherefore God also hath highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father amen may God bless you you can be seated amen and it good to be in the house of the Lord today a man we just want to enter in with all of our hearts and give us a little bit of time this morning as we look into the word and we share that which is some real to our hearts and what means so much to us and let the Holy Spirit speak to you and reveal it to unum in a real and living way I just wanted to make a mention um as I was mentioning in my prayer about those that are incarcerated for this gospel there in China there's been several believers and believe in pastors and have been arrested for sharing the King James Version Bible that has been translated into Chinese and they judge that to be extremist and anti-government so they put them into prison for that for that reason for sharing the Bible the Word of God also you know that that work was done of course you know by the believers up in up in Canada but the bisca land the Saints there that supported that work many many others that supported at work to get the King James Version Bible into their language and so it's been a real blessing but at the same time it's not without sacrifice then also we've had um you know just recently well it was about three years ago maybe for that very large shipment was sent in from from Jeffersonville to to Russia contained in a lot of the tablets that they that they have and it was investigated it was a very unwise thing to do in a communist country like that but they just you know decided to be really bold and do it and so they did it and and they confiscated the whole shipment and then that began to look in it and and the the went to court because it was a prosecutor had determined that it was extremist literature and so they they they took him tried to ban it and the court rejected it so the prosecutor went ahead and and put it into an a higher court and so now now that Court has judged it as extremism and so therefore the church age book and many many other other sermons of brother branham's are not going to be allowed to be in the nation of Russia you can imagine what this does to many of the believers there as they they are as this has been you know has it has been determined extremist material so in a way if you will be improved for the believers there as they appeal that and try to go to a higher court and get that throat out again we know God can do that Amen but we also know that you know we're living in a time where the Word of God is not wanted and it's not welcome a man in truth is being refused and so you know so as we we look at it you know that today we just want to value what we have and appreciate what God has given us and the opportunities that we have to worship God as we see to fit to worship the Lord and I'll tell you what I believe it is extreme the message is is so extreme it changes lives it makes real good citizens out of people it takes those that were thieves and and those that have done you know evil in their lives and it changes them and transform them into sons and daughters of God so that is pretty extreme any men but I'll tell you we want it we want it to do the same for our lives amen the message of course that we know and we have received it does not it does not make evil people out of us it makes some of the most wonderful people in the whole wide world and the devil hates it a man but we love it and we thank God for the truth that has liberated us a man made us into sons and daughters of God now this morning I'm going to be speaking to you on let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus so as we as we look at it today I I want to just speak just for a moment of a certain direction that Paul was using here as he was talking of Jesus humbling himself to the father's wheel and we should also and he said that let nothing done through strife or vainglory that's verse three but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves so you know there is some there is certainly your egg truth to this that when we become a Christian it brings a certain humility about us where that we can esteem others better than ourselves I think that's a whole lot of problem with a lot of marriages and so on like that is that many times this is not put into practice the way it should be that we esteem one another they they are mate better than ourselves the Bible said that amounts of love is wife as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it and that so the same thing that eternal life is giving giving are living for others and the same thing that they're giving on the the wife's part to of submission and working together in harmony with each other and so it should not let anything be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves but then Paul points out that Christ though he thought it was not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation but was made in the fashion of man and while a man he humbled himself to obedience even to the death on the cross so I want you to know they again this is very extreme he humbled himself to obedience even to death on the cross so he would humble himself as a man to obedience to God to his word and let the word have such preeminence so he was even such one that when he when he came yesterday would find you know 2,000 years ago we find he did even have a place to lay his head and the birds he said all of the air they have but Nast and the foxes have got dens but he said I don't have a place to lay my head when it came to the world he would borrow a womb to be born in and they had no cradle turret to lay him in so they put him in a box of straw and when he died they nailed him to a Roman tree unto under capital punishment he had but one robe and had been made for him woven throughout without a seaman and he had the bar than a grave to be buried in so you know none of us are that bad off Jesus the Almighty God would humble himself and become a man I want to just point this out again me he would humble himself to the Father's will and as a man he continued to Humble himself through the Word of God into the Father's will he came to show what God that was anything that's high and haughty isn't God a man God is low and humble and that's what made him God something that comes down low not them that goes high and exalts himself it's always Satan that is exalting himself you know God doesn't dwell in hierarchies and things he dwells in humility and you and I'm you humble yourself and you'll be exalted you exalt yourself and you will be humbled and God knows how to do that so you have to remember you humble yourself before God and don't try to think your own thoughts but to think his thoughts so we are to are to have the mind of Christ now that's what we're speaking about on this morning is let this mind the mind of Christ being you and and humble ourselves to the will of God and it's amazing to think that we as humans now listen closely as we kind of change this now direction I want to take this today because it's amazing to think that we as humans have exalted our own thoughts and our own minds so far about God and His Word until we actually have to humble ourselves down from our high and lofty thinking to accept the higher thoughts of God are you with me now hey man so it did this is this is what we do as humans we as human beings we we we think ourselves is so great and our thinking and our is so great and and our science our education our knowledge and the supreme knowledge that we have and control over the universe and control over the elements and that we think of ourselves and our thoughts are so great until we actually have to humble ourselves down in order to receive the higher things of God now remember Satan has never been higher than God but in his own heart he says I will exalt myself above the sons of God and and sin of course is exalting your own thoughts above the Word of God remember that's where the first sin would begin in heaven where that where that Satan would exalt his own thoughts in his own wheel over the Word of God can you imagine that trying to place himself in a position higher than God he said I want to be like God I want I want to be worshipped I want to me I want to exalt myself over his sons I want a position that is not mine and I'm gonna exalt myself over God and over his word and then of course this is what he did when he comes down to the earth and and walks upon the earth we find and he he gets done in and exalts the serpent takes the serpent right next to man and puts in him a desire to exalt himself you know make himself equal or make himself higher than man himself and so he would then take and and he would begin with even with a reasoning and this reason would be to exalt her thinking her reasoning over God's Word are you with me so instead of humbling down to the word exalt over the word now look with me in Isaiah chapter 55 and verse 6 seek he the Lord while he may be found and call upon him while he is near this is a wonderful scripture isn't it a man while he can be found to call upon him while he's near this time to move a service like this today this is a time to move toward God a man let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts notice this the unrighteous has to forsake his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord he will have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon for he says Martin my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for is the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so God says these very things he says my thoughts are higher than men thoughts no matter how high now that we're thinking eye thoughts are Amon - so high - we have to Humble down to get the higher thoughts [Applause] amen amen because Satan exalts it and we have to run back down to come back down in order to receive what is actually higher you've got to Humble down to accept God's Word and what he says and his promise and man you gotta forfeit your own thoughts your own thinking your own reasoning what science says or what doctors say or what - so whatever the situation your reasoning is saying it all has got to be taken and tumbled down and accept the higher thoughts now 1st Corinthians chapter 2 verse 16 tells us aware of believers position is he says for who have known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him because nobody can tell god what to do but then he says but we have the mind of Christ now this is what a real believer is he has the same mind that Christ had he thinks what Jesus thinks and because he seeks like Jesus takes he he behaves like Jesus behaves all right now so we have the mind of Christ then we have the same attitude toward the word that Christ did they might whatever the work said we're gonna take it and man if the word said by His stripes were healed we're gonna believe we're healed if it says that we can be saved we're gonna believe we're safe I'm not whatever his words said we're gonna accept that over what our thinking is what modern theology is what the society around the self is the high exalted thinking of the day we're gonna take God's Word because God's Word is higher than any other word but you're gonna have to Humble down in order to see it in his right place because as long as you're up here exalting your own taken over the Word of God you're in the place that Satan is this is satanic thinking and in order to come down to God's thinking you've got to come down and humble down and really realize it's higher than what your reasoning what your thinking and your attitude is gonna have to come the same as Jesus attitude I have come to do the Father's will I'm not here to do my own oil and you realize that you have a will and that will has got to be surrendered to his will all right so now if we have the mind of Christ then we have the same attitude toward the word as he did whatever he said whatever the word says takes preeminence over what I thought what I think or what what anybody else says what society around me says what what the world is saying is cool what the world is saying is is what we're supposed to be like we humble down and we say God's Word is true right hey man so turn with me to Colossians chapter 3 and verse 8 and I always just want to look at some of the things of the scripture as we go along because I want to establish that the believer has the mind of Christ amen now Colossians three and eight but now put off all these anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communications out of your mouth a man although guessing vulgar words all the other thing put out a man malice yeah you know um that's ill-will anger get it all out line up to one another seeing you have put off the old man with his deeds that belongs to your first nature a man that belongs to your past that's not who you are here's who you are and we put on the new man which is renewed the watts renewed in knowledge after the image of him that created him so now you've got you've got a new man and he's got a renewed knowledge a new knowledge is above the knowledge of man it's the knowledge of God and we are we are renewed in the knowledge of after the image of him that created him now so you put on the new man a man you must be born again that's how you put on the new man there's only one way the old man's gonna die it's thinking has to die its reasoning have to die what do you think is right and wrong come on has to die because because with the world they got a whole different sort of a value system than what the Bible does the Word of God does you know you you said well it needs doesn't matter how I dress it doesn't matter what I look like it doesn't matter about my makeup it doesn't matter about my Maya my high heels it doesn't matter about what I do is it doesn't matter you are only going by what the society around you since that's okay but now we have got a different knowledge and that knowledge is a higher knowledge than what you can get at Notre Dame or what you can get at Yale or what you can get in the finest schools are the colleges of the world you haven't seen a higher College than all the degrees that you can paste everywhere and you can put it on and say I've been to school and I've got my diplomas and I've got my PhD and I've got my doctors I got all of this this knowledge is higher the doctors PhDs man anything that man's God this is a high knowledge but you see to be a Christian you've got to admit that that knowledge of God is a great knowledge then your own knowledge now this is a danger this is a danger of going to school in college and whatever is because you know it was a self-importance and demand that he knows so much that he can't receive anything of the Word of God because they got a higher knowledge Amen now but it's not a higher knowledge it's a lower knowledge much lower as high as the heavens is from the earth now so the approach to the birth you have to go to the process just like anything that lives anything that's lives again has to got to die first you cannot keep your same spirit you cannot keep your same habits you cannot keep your same thoughts you've got to die you got to die like Jesus died I mean you got to die on your own on your altar like Abel did with his llama you got to die with your i'm Christ this is where we miss it on the new birth because many of them are trying to get born again and the old man isn't dead yet but in order to be born again the old man's got to die first because they cannot coexist you cannot serve God and Mammon so you see you've got to die with your lamb you've got to die to your own tinkin to be born to his thinking man you let the mind that was in Christ being you so when you were born you were born with a mind of a human that could be developed by knowledge when you're born again you are born a son or daughter of God you are born with the mind of Christ when you're born again that is to be developed a man by receiving the knowledge of God by his word you begin to learn who God is what he can do what is power is you learned that his knowledge is higher than any other knowledge are you with me man now so he says you cannot think his thoughts and deny his words you see the Bible said he cannot deny himself so there is none of this word that he can deny a man a man he might he must accept every word of this to be the truth so in Christ comes into you are you with me if Jesus comes in your life the Jesus and you must acknowledge every bit of this word to be true whether you understand it or not whether you can reason it out or not it mean you take what God said and it goes over your own thinking your own reasoning your own beliefs the Colombians tell you your whole seven belief systems came with your first birth and you're gonna have to die to that what you think is right and wrong comes with your first birth what do you think is okay and not okay it comes with your first birth now so you cannot you cannot have the mind of Christ in you which is the Holy Ghost and deny gimme of the word you're gonna have to believe it and it's demon over your own thinking hey man now this is this is the evidence that their old man and his thinking is dead mind that he is no longer no longer exists anymore you pay him no more mind turn with me to Romans chapter 6 and verse 4 if you will look here with me now I'm just going to establish some things and then we'll get into what I want to preach about this morning but laying this foundation real quickly Romans 6 and for therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we should walk in the newness of life so we can see here what he said we are buried with him we die with him so therefore we are buried with him of course the problem comes is that we're burying too many people that are alive my mind they didn't scratch herself out of the grave under the water in grave and get up you don't go down the drive center come up a wet one that's all the change there is but you see what it requires is a death to your old man a complete dying out therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that life as Christ raised up from the dead by the glory of the Father even so we should walk in the newness of life so our new life walks in the power of the Resurrection verse 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection so if we've truly been playing a man in the likeness of his death will raise up to live a new life a different life a man knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that we should henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin and here's the thing the Bible's clear sin will no longer have dominion over you sin is a belief so unbelief will no longer have power over and out come on I believe all the things that goes with it it no longer has power over you so you have to power them to walk in faith amen you have the power then to walk in truth with the newness of life with a new mind with a new thinking renewed after the knowledge of him hey man now that's why we're baptized into his name that we might come forth in his name in his death and his resurrection that we rise again and we testifying that we have a new life that the old man is dead and we buried that first nature and man that first nature is gone and now we have the nature of him now remember the reason why we got that old nature that old sin nature is because that's what Adam accepted at the beginning when he turned down the eternal life he accepted sin nature into his life and the other one of us are born with the need to be born again we were born wrong so we had to have the right birth so he wants to cancel out the old birth so that you can have a new birth because the only way you can go to heaven is to be born again so you cannot with the first birth go to heaven now that's the problem people are trying to get to heaven today and they never been born again they're just thinking God's going to accept them the way they are and God ain't gonna accept you the way you are you must die out to see him so therefore the first nature that you were born with has to be gone it has to be dead crucified with him and then he lives in us and we don't do our own wheel anymore we don't do we do his will we don't take our own thoughts the mind the mind is what takes the mind that was in Christ Jesus isn't every believer hey man now listen I mean I'm quoting you this to you from souls in prison right now where he says the mind the mind that was in that was in Christ Jesus is in every believer this is what Paul said we have the mind of Christ so I want you to get it the baptism of the Holy Ghost the Spirit of God in you is the mind of Christ and man now he said so there's the soul that's what we're speaking of that's apart I'm thinking of now that's within us the soul the mind that is in Christ Jesus is now in your soul resident there once resided sin nature but now resides in there the mind of Christ before it was a mind of Satan and his works and his deeds you did but now you are new creation I mean old things are passed away and now your son or a daughter of God and as a son or daughter of God you can live in walk in the newness of life now we are to live our life that we live here it must be more than just for mortal existence in this life and because this is where you said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word what's this now let me delenn even let me just kind of shorten it for you man shall live by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so therefore if we're if we are not living by every word then what is it we're we're walking in depth a man this is real important that the word must have preeminence because this is what brother madam will preach about in stem Christ the mystery once that he could get preeminence in a people he was going to take him back to Eden and so it's very important that you give the Word of God preeminence in your life amen now a man's physical being we wanted to try take care of it that's why he said man some I've lived by just bread alone just my physical existence and taken care of of our human body and and what our needs are but that's not the only reason God put you here on the earth you know you know some of you are going to school but I want you to understand whatever you're going for that's not the reason you're here the reason you are here is that you might live by every word that you might live a life in this Satan's Eden an overcoming in a dominating life that dominates in dominates unbelief that lives a Christian like that's why you're here these other things are fleeting they will pass away but there's one thing that's eternal and that's God in his life hey man sometimes where we're putting our emphases on the bread alone when our emphases got to be on every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God now because you see that counts for varied a little what we're doing with our natural life but it's our soul that counts it's a inward man that did not come from the earth he came from heaven and that she turned part of the human being we have been born from above we have been born of a higher knowledge any born again believer I don't care if they've got but a third-grade education you are got a higher knowledge and a higher thinking than the great doctors and professors that are in the land today you have got a higher knowledge understanding a higher thing than all that they have they are way beneath you and I know they want to look down their nose you know how the did for my god you don't have the education I got you don't have the knowledge I got we got a higher knowledge the knowledge we have received is a higher knowledge than what the world has to offer it is so hot it is as high as the heavens are from the earth it is a higher knowledge than the anything man can cover you can look at the greatest scientists in the world and maybe he understands face and he understands rockets and he understands energy and he understands gravity and he understands and he's a mathematic and he can come up with all these equations and you say he is a very very smart intelligent man but you have received a higher intelligence [Music] hallelujah you have received a higher knowledge you've got a greater mind but being born again that what you can ever get in college hey ma'am you may be looking and they may say but I ain't stole the test and I've got the 4.0 plus and I've got everything I I'm in the what they gotta call all the great the Great's of societies that they belong to and their Honors Society but I want you to know you belong to a greater honor society than what the world could ever offer you may not be able to read or you may not even be able to write but I'll tell you you if you receive the Holy Ghost you've got a higher knowledge then all that the world has to offer now I know man because his science is education and it's an exalted knowledge but in order to receive God because they exalted to where there is no God they exalted to where it just all evolved out of nothing that's stupid that's stupidity hey man leave you operated on that man you wouldn't find a brain in him come on man because why he he is he again he's showing how senseless and I'm stupid and how naive have dumbed I don't know how I'm running out of adjectives you know because of he is exalted knowledge but all he is compared to God is he's not even a canary brain and I want you to know all your human knowledge is that way that's why we have to exalt the word to a place that it supersedes everything that we ever learned everything we ever received every we ever had and I think math and we put the word in a place of Dominion then then it's higher than every other word that there is God's Word is higher heavens and earth will pass away but not one jot or tittle of this will is that right you tell me any science it can say that hey man why my with the cupboard 19 we have had or you don't know what to believe then change their mind so many ways of a scientist the greatest the build the one stare at the head I you know they've had all kinds of ideas and criminai make corrections here and there there God never has to make corrections he never asked to take a word back he don't never change his mind what if he said in the beginning is still true today man that's why he every shield he's still a healer if he ever saved he's still a savior a man's he ever delivered he's still a deliverer you can count on this God because he's got a knowledge that is superior to any man's knowledge now this is what we don't like to hear but man must not think for himself now that's what you're being told you got to think for yourself but man must not take for himself he must let the mind that was in Christ being him we're not to take for herself we're to call everything contrary to what he says as though it's not a man no matter what our eyes are claiming what our senses are saying what our feelings feel like what we heard from the highest knowledge what we are seeing in our symptoms we have to declare God's Word over everything we see taste smell feel are here because faith says he's healed us faith says he's delivered us faith says it was done at Calvary faith says he paper by his sight I am healed and faith gives a greater sense and these measly little silly five senses they can't see anything further than the end of our nose so like a seed we have to rot away the old man if the gain of corners never planted and go through a change where it changes forms it always just be a nice polished seed it'll never bring forth life some people just want to belong to church but they never changed I'm gonna tell you some of you are still the pretty little grain of corn that showed up at church and sat on the Pew 15-20 years ago hey man you know the day that you belong to church but you never change it's just Church than just a place to socialize it's a place I'll just show up new clothes and it's not really essential you know you can show up late and take in as much of it as you want hello hey man you can drag in 30 minutes late and they get them because it doesn't really matter it's not that essential it's not that important we can take in what service we want to and and couldn't Johnson higher likelihood so over the Word of God somebody help me preach Amen because why we just feel a pretty little polished green listen listen they found that found in the tombs of other Egypt they found some grains of wheat that had been laying there for over a thousands of years they figured four or five six thousand years as they found them and they never had any manifestation of any life in them until they were planted but when they were planted in the old seed rotted away that 6,000 year old weak blossom that moved and I'm telling you unless that's you immerse yourself in Christ unless you are buried in Christ unless the old man rocks away you're just gonna be a pretty little seed that never has any light only fit for the rats to eat okay let me tell you our president declared the churches are essential but too long Christians have treated it as non-essential they skipped services they pick and choose which ones that want to tend they treat worship services not as though it's just entertainment it ain't entertainment oh man it's not about making you feel good it's welcoming his presence it's about eager to his courts with praise so he can growl in the praises of his people moving in the spirit get it you find the price about it where it produces a worship that draws God near a man sermons not to be treated as some self-help psychology no sir you know Church has got to mean more to you than that you know people who want to come to the altar and and you know get up and say well you don't kneel there just a minute or two and say well I've got the new birth get some preacher to pray for you I'm born again you got to stay until all your thoughts of your own self and your worldly things are running away from you and you're dead and you're rotten and then it's all gone from you in the new birth takes place a man dude oh my you might slobber in jabber and you might you need but I'll tell you you'll come up lately with a new condition with a new heart and a new birth something is used that's a lie a man that makes you different from what you want and you see your new birth kid come in till there's a death to the old man and people don't want to die they want to take their own dinky they hear the prophet of God preached about make up well I don't think he knew what he was talking about you know why because you're exult in your own mind and your mind probably came from the opinions of the world and not from Bible well they really didn't matter this hair business don't matter I can cut my hair if I I want to sure you can you're a sinner and sinners do whatever they want to do but those who have the mind of Christ think about it like Christ thinks about it like the Bible thinks about and so you see it's it's very evidence you ain't gonna give that just you've got the old bag now select the mind that was in Christ being you where you think God's thoughts and when you think God's thoughts that drains God's blessings and God's power to you and it'll make a mess out of you oh man it'll change your life and make you a new creature in Christ Jesus you won't be the same anymore you you me make together all together new you look at things different it'll take that old dominating female spirit out of a woman that's a modern feminine staring at a maker into a daughter of God and she'll humble herself down to the Word of God and man it'll make a man that's not true and the great big Oh God you know that's burly and mean and you know angry and rules as brute strength and it'll make him worth it he's sweet and he's mellow and he needs his his pants his wife weight with a sweet spirit that leaves his family and then points them to Christ and they can see Jesus in them a lot of kids don't want to be a Christian cuz they don't be what they see home hello I hope you're still here some of you hung up let's reconnect you you see you stay there till all your pride is going until it takes from you the desire of seeing the world it washes all the fake off of you all the make up your fake look do you have a holy look amen till the mark you want is not a new tattoo but the mark you want is a the mark of Christ upon your life everybody can see that everybody passing by can see you have been marked and you are different you're not the same old person come you don't make you crash it makes you son or daughter of God that's what it gets to your life hey man you come up a different person man that'll take that cigar those cigarettes or that bottle and clean you up so all there's no harm in that well I'll tell you what you ever get born again you'll think different about it hey man you stayed long enough and find out that you know if there isn't in harm when a new life takes hold you know you look at that whole thing differently and man let the new life take hold you RUP to those things of cigarettes the booze the tobacco and the whiskey and all the things the world but you see people don't stay long it out they you know you got to stay that to you fairly dead you know you go in the homes and you see they got a television they're watching all kinds of movies are feeding on everything in the world hey ma'am you get the new birth it'll change your attitude toward it you won't want to be feeding on everything there be hunger in you from the Word of God amen there be listening to the messages of the hour and a change of your life a reading of your Bible that it becomes sweeter to you than any other thing so while that will relax me where you get born again that'll make you nervous hello hey man it'll make you nervous watching people murdered and killed and raped and and all the bad things that are going on in the movies and things it'll make me it'll upset you it won't they won't make you relax you can you up hey mom but you don't stay overnight you gotta stay that to your tire like that then after you're dead you stay there to your rot - there's no sense of rejuvenation again no chance that that old man will ever raise up again no matter what the circumstances no matter what the trials of life he's dead and he up never rise again you stay there until God's word means more to you to your own talks until you get a hold of God and say I believe it and then there'll be something that will happen in your life a change will come upon you and your children will see it in your boss will see it in you everybody won't see it in you because you're sealed your mark you don't live is there in the old lust anymore you're dead you're buried your new creation in Christ you have a thinking man's filter and it gives you a holy man's taste filters out the world you can't it will come through God's word of his filter and man you don't live you don't look at what you see with your eyes and then the true men of God look through the eyes of faith and to make you see things different are you with me Amen faith enabled Moses to choose God's will remember although he was raised up as the son of Pharaoh's daughter he refused to that to be his identity and although we're raised up in Saint Eaton come although they you have been the product of this society remember something about a real believer he does identity I don't want to be like him I don't want them to see me like them come on I remember when I was a little boy you know a young man well Zane you was there we were in high school together and and even is a greater two older than me so we didn't really didn't see my each other much anyway when I was in school you know I the Beatles were real popular in that time and you know all the boys wear the hair with the bangs you know down I saw another young Christian I was just a young preacher boy myself but I saw this young Christian a boy you know he like come well he you know he was more of the modern kind and he took him he pull his hair just down just so much you know not not quite all the way but enough child in a fire and I looked at that and I said hmm I think I'll try that so just enough to identify boys he couldn't stand me in school come up clap me on the back Oh Tim that looks really good maybe you really fit there you know it just pull it down just a little more and you got it and I went to the bathroom right then I combed my hair because I said I don't want that identity I don't want anything that would make me accepted by the world I'm alive and I knew that was not what I wanted to be [Music] [Applause] now so you see he refused to make that his activity choosen rather is instead to suffer mistreatment with the people of God and my Moses preferred face certainty above the momentary enjoyment of sins pleasure and let me tell you a faith hansel certainty and sin has a pleasure but it only lasted for a season you ever see the Marlboro Man well it changed him up for about time because he got cancer in his lungs and the last one you know was who was suing the Marlboro cosmic company because he had cancer and he had here yet promoted you tough cowboy look you know and smoking a marble and all of that and this was a man be you know safe we'll show you the glass [Music] Wow but this tough cowboy and right marxism oh man this is the tough guy if you want to be tough you do this but I want to tell you that's not a real man a real man laughs Jesus a real man knows how to pray a real man's got back to this trouser where he kneels down and calls on this makeup a real man is a son of God that's a real man but we will not enter five with waters cool and chicken can you know what is tough and what is popular and what the world is like and a real identity is to be God that's why we're here we are to be those kind of people when they see you they say I know that boy that girl they have been with Jesus are you with me hey man and you'd rather you would rather choose the the that and suffer mistreatment with the people of God that then prefer space certainty over the momentary enjoyment of since pleasure cuz if you know it's it's enjoyable you know they mate well they tell me I never smoked but you know they they tell me you know right after you take a meal you got to have a cigarette to finish it oh and it feels so good but when you're gasping for breath and you got it in the hole in your throat you see the devil don't show you that part he shows you the glamour of it hey man so you see Moses found true wealth in separate abuse for being anointing hallelujah hey man that was his real wealth he wasn't looking at his own riches and what he what he conclude gain as being the king's son the son of Pharaoh's daughter he looked at the riches that he would receiveth for being a Titan I wonder you know I wonder today if all the favours in the world you know what they would do they would love to trade places with Moses today hey man come on hey you don't think not a Christian in this building lesser a Christian whether you make me a small Christian or a newborn Christian doesn't really matter they ain't one of you that Elvis wouldn't trade places with today are you with me a man he would forfeit his Cadillacs his weapon his fame his Psalms have all the other moods that he made and I had everything else he was all of that to sit in your place to be in this building to be able to hear this sermon to be in the presence of God to be able experience God in his life Moses eyes he would rather he looked he would look with Wonder not on the immediate what's present tense but on the ultimate what faiths great reward was Holden face a promise Moses abandon Egypt he had no favor of fear of Pharaoh's rage because he persisted in faith because he seen God who is unseen so so again you know dad there again this is Moses he look to the unseen he saw with the mind of Christ he saw what would come to Pharaoh and to his armies and they are no more but Moses is still alive he was seen about Transfiguration with Jesus Christ oh man I tell you I know he was glad on that day to say I took the mind of Christ rather than taking the mind of the world I've got his infant when God speaks it has to be perfect God cannot change we cannot all turn God's Word we have to alter our thinking to his thinking let the mind that was in Christ being you then you think like he thinks and this is what happened with Moses he took the mind of Christ he looked at what is temporary realized it would pass away but he could see that what had the eternal value you see again faith stirred Moses to perform the Rite of passive and sprinkle the lambs blood to prevent the destroyer from harming their firstborn you know I want you to get this it seems senseless it didn't make any reason it sure wasn't medicinal you know it boy you know that then the Egyptians had their back there maybe their antibiotics and they had their there thanks to three plagues and they had their medicines that we do this and you do that and as they were they have great maybe you have great knowledge cuz it is they had great knowledge for that time but Moses had a greater knowledge he could see that a laugh could take his place and died in his place and his black would be put over the dark post under of the homes and they would be safe under the bud and I'm telling you today maybe it doesn't make sense what we got maybe to the world it doesn't look like anything but I want you to know the planet Christ hallelujah is greater than all the medicinal things of the world the blood of Christ is greater than the science and the knowledge the blood of Jesus Christ opposed hardship and our sickness and the Bible is to be our ultimate what is an ultimate it's the last word it's the a man it's the end of strife it's your ultimate you may have an idea about certain things or maybe about holiness you got a certain ideas but for you you leave those idea because the word is the ultimate hey man you again you know today you can't tell her now you can't tell her that trim and her hair was wrong what what's hair got to do with it well it did this Samson make a lot of difference and then whosoever shall had one word or take one word from you got to have an ultimate somewhere you said well God won't send me to hell for cutting my hair brother Tim no he won't because he don't send people to hell help me Briggs now he not them send you to hell for cutting your hair cuz he don't send people to help a man their own unbelief and insulting their own thoughts about God's words shows that they refuse to give up their own thoughts to be born again and heaven is only for the born again [Applause] hallelujah everybody is going to heaven no only those that are falling together going to heaven the rest aren't going heaven is only for the born-again we want to make everybody you in order to see the kingdom of God you must be born again Jesus words somebody with me man so again Jesus won't send a man for hell for long hair right he won't send a woman to help her cut her hair Oprah wearing makeup or for wearing shorts or for cross-dressing but women wearing men's apparel of man whether wearing women's apparel he won't send them a handle for that you choose hell over heaven because you reject the plan of God for a new birth a new birth that would change your attitude toward God's Word a man that would give the word preeminence over y'all thinkin that you having solved in effect God's Word you see it's more II imparted what the people at work think about your school thinks about you what society thinks about you but what God thinks about you oh yeah well I know the opinions of the church world and the theologians toward holiness and even about water baptism or receiving the Holy Ghost he don't mean God don't care just as long as you say you love Jesus and Jesus said if you love me you keep my Commandments your love is shown back to God by keeping his word while I'm understanding that matter what you understand it or not what did he say what did the won't say well the illusion said this and they don't think that yeah you can go with the forty-seven thousand of them but it doesn't supersede God's Word and you can some people what's on the line and they just go right on you know because they're not gonna accept God's Word because they accept their own thinking over God's word now but if the life of Christ lives in a person they become identified with its Christ in you you're not just a church member you don't just belong just system you don't belong to just the society of a church but but it's a resurrection power it's the Holy Ghost as a token upon yet a man that just as Moses would we would say um you know you must be under the blood of the Lamb as we were as we read there just a moment ago about faith stirred him to perform the Rite of passive in this frequent of the lambs blood to prevent the destroyer from from bringing death to that home are you with me Amen the same thing today we said but you must be under the token oh that little bit of fanaticism where you know you get down and you cry and you repair and you get baptized in his name and and you come up maybe speak in another tongue or maybe you shout or your dance or maybe something happened but to whatever your changed and I'm going to tell you if she always saying that will help you to escape the death that is coming upon the world it's the only saying that I make a reality of God in your life and can make a real true Christian out of you with it you have the peace that surpasses all understanding but you see again you're not yourself anymore you're Christ you don't think your own thoughts you you don't think your thought you said ha I think I say I really don't think you don't have any thought coming now I know the modern world don't like to hear that because we're told we've got to think for ourselves and you can't if you get the mind of Christ you will think for yourself you will think just like Jesus thinks and Jesus would exalt the word over his thinking even to the death at the cross now the life that was in Christ in his in you the mind that was in Christ is in you the works it was in Christ is in you and Christ Himself is in you and your dead and your life is hidden God to Christ and your seal there by the Holy Ghost and you're not your own well I want to be my own person well you're not I said you're not well I am my own person no you're not you either belong to daughter Satan a man in every child I don't care if he was born into a message family you were born with sin nature having rule over your life and you were not your own therefore you went against everything your mom and your daddy the pastor the preaching all everything that word that you were taught you won against it come on hey man why because you're not your own st. Onge it from the start and the only way that you'll ever be different is that sin nature die and when it dies then your must have received the nature Christ into you and when you have this nature in yourself after all you're here Satan is a cruel master you say well I think again you don't have anything coming now we don't want that to hear that I tell you we're a free thinker you're not a free thinker and then you know again and a Christian he is giving up his thinking to accept the mind of Christ he and he purposed to do the will of God in fact don't do the works of God then don't believe me you see you see it must be him that it's doing the thinking you let the mind being you just the same and that's just words how are you gonna think different he's done expressed his thoughts to us but we want to do our own thinking I think we ought to do this I think this is okay I think it's all right what bit but what did the word say you see the Holy Ghost will always agree that the world is right it will never disagree with the world and to do that you've got to take the entire gospel a man with mouth we every must be identified as Full Gospel people that's a problem in the message today we don't want to be full gospel we'll take a part of the word but we don't want this part we'll take you you know the mystery part should understand in great mystery cousin exalts people's knowledge it puts them up to where that they've become arrogant people but when you're born again my knowledge has its right place and it's all the word man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God so now we are invited to be molded into his image that we might reflect his presence we'll share with you a quote here from identification and the works that I do so you do also the light that I live so you so shall you we're invited by God to take him as an example and let our character be molded like this what if they did we when we let his character being us then we have become sons by having the mind of Christ mind which is Hill's character so if you have to find the Christ you have the character of Christ and the character Christ always wants to do the Father's will amen amen that we will let his character being us and we become sons by having the mind of Christ which is his character your mind makes your character does somebody get that your mind makes your character the way you think as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so your mind makes your character and if you have been born again that that mind of Christ in you will make your character it'll be the character of Christ a man let the mind whole set of Christ this mind that was in Christ being you let that mind of Christ being you it molds the character of the Son of God and his character was that he did everything to please God hello he stayed with the work he did everything that please go that's what he wanted as far we stay with God's word with find/replace and then we know where we're at we stayed with his word and to think of it we're invited to save her own character he is a man that we're going to find out what we've done we save our character to his own by his own spirit that we are the sons of God just what I've expressed by having his mind in us to shape our character to here's his mind let the mind that was in Christ being you if that mind is in you then see then he only did that which faced God he knew who he was and that's the thing do you know who you are if you know you're a son of God a man did you do that which pleases God you extreme that world even above your necessary food and then it's the most important thing for you in your life what the word said you're gonna do it a man now the word modes God's character to us and anything that tries to mix with that character breaks the mold you can't mix Creed with the word you can't mix the world with the word you can't serve God and Mammon that's the world a man you can't be one or the other if you love the world of the things the world the love of God's not even idiot you see you can't mix it you can't mix all in water it won't mix you can turn it up and down do you only won't mix and your character will not mix with the world if your men aren't been loaded and they inform of God by letting the mind that was in Christ being you hey man that's the control tower so now you're not controlled by the world you're controlled by what's in the heart any controls your attitude and you have the same attitude towards sin as Jesus had hallelujah hey man did that attitude in lives out in your life it shows itself to the world that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and it changes your character it makes you a new person in Christ a man now he has delivered you out of the authority of darkness let me just bring it down Sam now has no more dominion over a man he has recreated your spirit and now he's ready to renew your mind so you can understand your privileges and rights in Christ it belongs to you you have a right to it hallelu so now you take the word over your feelings of your thoughts over your reasoning over what science says over what the PhD the ideal whoever they are the doctors say it doesn't really matter you take God's Word and it has preeminence in your life it means more than any other thing and you just say take this whole world but give me Jesus hey what's a musician's to come we're going to take this another step forward in our next service I've established it now you have the mind of Christ you have the Holy Ghost in you and the Holy Ghost brings your flesh in obedience to the Word of God amen now then I tell you if you see your life is separate from the word and you're not doing what the word says then you know he doesn't have preeminence and I want you just to begin to look at it and say Lord changed me to fit that image don't let me remain the same a man we just bow your heads for a moment take this whole world just give me Jesus [Music] I just want to be normal brother Tim I just want to fit in I'm gonna be identified but that out there [Music] you can't be identified with that and be a Christian you must take the Word of God let it change your life [Music] deceive his character receive his life receive his mind I want you to look at yourself today and just examine yourself does your thinking match his thinking are you ready to forfeit your own thoughts and receive him are you looking at things a little differently this morning did you realize you can't be the same person that you was you must be changed in his presence I'm just ready Lord to make a full surrender of my life you just have the whole world just give me Jesus so I don't will ever turn back these sin and unbelief behind me and I'm changed in your presence I want my attitude to reflect your attitude I want you to become the essential thing in my life I want you to have preeminence within me maybe there'd be somebody the Lord just kind of tricks your heart today and you say I'm really not in step with him but I want that in my life I want to be changed in his presence I want to be molded in his character I want his word to have preeminence I want to make a full surrender of everything that I am I realize that's my problem I've never really fully surrendered my own will but I want to Lord I want to I got it here draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you don't you draw nigh to him this morning don't you just reach out to him right now maybe you just begin right there wherever you are just a hand lifted toward him and said lord I I just want your will in my life I want a full surrendered life I want to say I want him I'm gonna be able to say that he has preeminence in me that i esteem his word above everything that i live by every word that proceeds out the mouth of God and I really want to be changed in his presence surrendered life God sees you God sees you take away that which the Lord is dealing with you now just take it to him right now just taste it say Lord while I'm here in your presence I want to be changed and I'm willing to be changed I realized what the path of seeing will take me I don't realize what brother Tim has said today you used to love the world you gave your only begotten Son you didn't come to condemn the world that through but through you you might have life and life abundantly and he's asking you today to surrender that just surrender yourself yield yourself to him let him change you to your attitudes like he is your spirit is like his to where you're surrendered and the surrendered life you can say I've come to do the wheel your will Oh God I've come to surrender my thinking my ways to a higher way I'm just looking right now when I'm saying Lord I realize now my way isn't so high but your word is something and I'm humbling myself to that word right now I'm coming to do the we love him to Sydney and finish this work Father those in the bride will do only his will nothing can persuade them to do otherwise I'm praying in the name of Jesus today you'll speak the hearts and lives nor did stay reached out to you father may you speak to them or today maybe some just need to make a surrender completely totally and say Lord I want to do your will of God mold me and make me change them don't let me walk out of here the same person that maybe I'll be in your image in your likeness surrender so that the more that I surrender the more you take control I pray in Jesus name heal your people Lord and we're going to this next phase and we just see long your word must be higher than all that we have the mind of Christ to do your will we'll do it there's a people and a walk and dust saith the Lord I don't believe you Lord they're gonna walk in faith they're gonna see the power of God but lord it must be done through cleanse vessels what's surrendered life father so many are reaching out for power and don't realize the power begins with the simple things of life bringing their self surrendered to the Word of God in obedience to you I pray in Jesus name do it Lord do that work in Jesus name thank you Lord amen amen as we sing this you don't have to social distance yourself from God you need prayer we pray with you whatever your need is today just reach out to God let the holy spirit move in your life maybe you need to make a real surrender maybe need to just make a real
