tonight and just help us to speak the Word of Life to your people Lord that they may gain strength Lord to face the enemy of the hour we ask it For Your Glory in Jesus name [Music] amen amen let's turn to Mark chap 11 if you would in your Bibles Mark 11:22 and Jesus answered and saith unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say un this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast into the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive ain't that amazing when you stand praying forgive if you have altought against any that your father which also is in heaven May forgive you your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses amen we let you be seated this evening just have a thought kind of a part two of Last last Wednesday we spoke about resentment uh I want to speak on faith based on forgiveness amen faith based on forgiveness actually this comes from a quote in perfect Faith where brother Bram says his very statement he says faith is based on forgiveness he said when we said that this morning trying to get the church into the place that where we could really see Apostolic times moving Among Us amen So it's b based on forgiveness so we can get the church to the place where we can really see Apostolic times moving among us and that's what we all hunger for amen it is just laying right at the door we see it but we want to see more of it amen we see healings but we want to see more healings we see salvation but we want to see more salvation we've seen prodal come home but we want to see more prodal come home amen we've seen it but we want to see more of it we want it we want such a flow that it'll be a help to us and also flow out to others amen so I was just reading the scripture as Jesus speaks and and brother brother Tim's been preaching on uh moving the mountain but just reading that scripture and reading a little further down of of how he actually tied it to forgiveness and and is you know we want power to speak to mountains we absolutely H want that we desire that and we have that in the Church of the Living God amen that mountains can be moved in our lives but if we allow things to stay in our hearts and our lives then mountains cannot move because if you have a Al in your heart or you have something there amen doubt would try to arise feelings of all kinds of things trying to keep Faith amen dormant in your life amen we can read it here in Matthew chapter 8 and verse1 15 he says moreover if your brother shall trespass against thee go and tell him his fault before thee and him alone and if he shall hear thee thou has gained a Brethren and we know how he speaks about it you if that don't happen then get a witness and go go speak to him if I don't go then take it before the church but then he brings it right down in verse 18 He said verily I say unto you whatsoever you shall bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever you loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven so we can again see that faith is based on forgiveness it's scripture amen and he said again I say unto you that if two of you shall agree on Earth as touching anything that they shall ask it shall be done of them of My Father which is in heaven for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them amen not gathered together with their hurts or their pains or their feelings against one another but gathered together in his name amen that my grace and Glory may be revealed to you amen then came Peter you know Peter he's had to say something he said and then came Peter to him saying Lord how off shall my brother sin against me and I forgive him till seven times that that sounds pretty good that's one for every day of the week that's that's pretty awesome you know I I got it covered there and Jesus looks at him and said Jesus said I say not unto thee until seven times but until 70 times seven wow Peter no doubt kind of rocked on his heels a little bit now wait a minute hey you know it's eye for an eye tooth for a Toth and you're telling me I'm supposed to forgive him 70 time 7 in other words enough forgiveness Amen to have enough forgiveness till it's enough forgiveness to have amen that where no matter what comes against you amen no matter what happens that you can let those things go and let God work in your life because that's the ultimate thing am me no wonder Satan wants to keep us so bound down with our unbelief because we we get bound down with hurts and pains and and alts and things that we've carried for years and God can't even use us like he wants to use us God wants to use us more than we ever could even think of God wants to do the miraculous Among Us he wants to heal Among Us he wants to deliver he wants to set free but if we allow those things no wonder Satan tries to keep us divided no wonder Satan tries to keep us all one one after another and this hurt over here and that bad business deal there and this situation over there why cuz he knows if he can keep the church in the attitude of alts in the attitude of unforgiveness then they can never be in the attitude of faith and we want faith in our hearts to believe for the impossible amen he says not until seven times but 70 times seven therefore is the Kingdom of Heaven liken unto a certain King I may mention this but I want to bring it out which would take account of his servants and when he begin to reckon he was brought unto him which owed 10,000 talents now it's around it's around three or four million bucks a lot of money for as much as he had not paid the his Lord commanded him to be sold his wife his children and all that he had and a pavement be made and the servant there fell down and worshiped him saying Lord have patience with me and I will pay thee all then the lord of the Ser that servant was moved with compassion and loosed him and forgave him the debt ain't that a wonderful thing right there amen we can find ourselves in that scripture amen we were all in a place we had a debt we could not pay we could not pay our sin debt we could not pay the things that we had but the Lord had compassion upon us I'm glad to be a people that the Lord has compassion upon and he saw us in our sin and he saw us in our unbelief and he wiped it all off Hallelujah but the same servant went out the same servant and found one of his fellow servants so they're both servants come on now amen they're both servants which owed him a 100 P which is about 17 bucks maybe 24 bucks today with inflation $24 round it off to a good 25 bucks so we got several million dollars and $25 amen so it it's amazing that Jesus uses this type like this to show how great your sin Deb is how great and impossible that you can't pay it if you sold every lamb if you sold every donkey if you sold everything you could never pay it and but yet God rich in Mercy paid it all and then we'll take something so little and hold it over somebody's head all right we ow owed him a 100 Pence and he laid hands on him ain't just hanging it over his head he's laying hands on him and took him by the throat he just walked out and got all this forgiveness and he walks right down the road and here's this oh I remember you owe me $25 you got it on no I don't have it well you better have it right now cuz I'm going to shake you upside down till I Shake It Out of You old Bud all right and besold him pay me th that thou owest and his fellow servant fellow servant fell down at his feet and besought him saying have patient with me and I will pay thee all now he has a perfect opportunity right here he has an opportunity to do just what's been done to him but no he goes exactly the opposite saying he would not but went and cast him into prison till he should pay the debt so when his fellow servants saw what was done they were very sorry came and told the Lord that was done and then the Lord after he called him said unto him oh thy Wicked servant I forgave thee all that debt because thou desirest me should us not thou also have compassion on thy fellow servant even as I have pity on thee and the Lord was wroth and delivered him to the tormentors till he should pay all that was due unto him so likewise shall my heavenly father do also unto you if you have in your hearts from your hearts forgive not everyone his brother their trespasses wow so you know so why why is he why is he dealing with this so harshly or trying to show you how harshly it is because he knows if you fail to forgive someone you actually become a prisoner to the Past you actually become a prisoner to the Past unforgiveness it keeps the pain alive it it keeps uh it never lets the wound heal keeps pulling the scab off of again then you go through life and you're always reminding yourself of what's been done to you and you begin to accumulate bad feelings instead of accumulating Faith you begin to accumulate unforgiveness which which goes into bitterness and all kinds of other things unforgiveness puts you in a prison of the past and robs you of the joy of the present right people many times are ruining their present because of the Past come on now they allowed the things that have come up in their childhood and they allowed all that bitterness and hate towards their daddy or whatever and it ruins the present what they could have with their own children come on somebody all right well you're getting in the Pastoral do wonderful I'm assistant pastor here amen amen so but when you forgive it opens the door to the prison and it lets you out right I want you to understand amen you are the one that's in the prison or the one out of the prison that's right but when you forgive it opens the door and forgiveness sets you free from the past but if you continue to allow the offense and never forgive then you allow that person to continue offending you the rest of your life for unforgiveness accumulates it accumulates bitterness and resentment and the LA longer the offense is not forgiven the more you accumulate and the more it begins to shape you presently unforgiveness accumulates bitterness bitterness accumulates anger anger accumulates Revenge amen forgiveness though also accumulates amen uh forgiveness accumulates amen just as the other also it washes it washes bitterness away and anger away and revenge away and it accumulates love joy peace gentleness goodness and God unforgiveness though gives the devil an open door and you must close that door to and forgive to forgive is to turn the key open the sail and let the prisoner out you amen because you know you keep that all and you got that thing so buried down deep in there and it's affecting everything in your life meanwhile the other person is going on doing their own thing moved on and they ain't even thought about it no more well how dare should I forgive them you forgive them so you can be set free that's right amen listen I want to I want to break this in here for just a moment again forgiveness is not actually just letting somebody off of they if they' done you wrong amen they're going to have to give account for it sooner or later they going to have to give an account for what they done am me how they treated people all of that they going to have to give an account for but what forgiveness does is set you free that's right so you can be free to accumulate love and joy and happiness and peace and faith in God to forgive is to write and large letters across the debt nothing owed yeah well I just need them to tell me I'm sorry they're sorry no you just need to forgive Let It Go Amen to forgive is to pound the gravel in a courtroom and say not guilty to forgive is to bundle up all the garbage and dispose of it and leaving the house clean and fresh [Music] again Hallelujah to forgive is to relax the strangle hold the strangle hold on a wrestling opponent and give him his life to forgive is the sand blast a wall of graffiti leaving it looking like new again forgiveness is so important it's right at the center of your spiritual well-being amen you know what a blessing is what anybody know what a blessing is oh if I can receive $25,000 that'd be a blessing yes sir it would be well if I could just get get ahead what a blessing that' be if somebody just give me this I'd you want you know the prophet as answered to that he said do you know what a blessing is do something for somebody else wow that's a real blessing if you have a neighbor somebody that's done you Injustice remember this for me don't ever turn him down take him into God in prayer and see what a different attitude you will have if you're sincere in your prayer you'll stand shoulder to shoulder with him though he's done you wrong in justice but you'll take that man to God and stand there in the presence of father one time and say father my neighbor has done me wrong but I get watch when you go to telling is wrong it'll not only help him but but it'll help you oh I love telling what people done to me wrong well do you love telling it to the father this is who he says you're allowed to go tell it to not on the phone or gossiping and carrying on and causing all these hard feelings and stuff what it's a root of bitterness and it begins to grow out and the more you tell it the more the roots get out but if you'll tell it to your father then he can take a word and chop that thing off out of your life amen see what watch where you go telling is wrong it'll not only help him but it'll help you and you'll see that he's been through Temptations and things just as you have it'll change your attitude towards that brother and it'll help him also you're always are doing good when you're praying for one another come on somebody you're always doing good when you're praying for one another but if the devil another quote if the devil can keep us separated and he's got us shooting at one another so he's got an open Target anytime he wants to shoot so but what really what's the use in him shooting we're shooting one another he can just sit back and relax but if I found Grace in your sight through God you take my word for this well I I don't know about you but a prophet's words means a little bit more to me than anybody else's words as far as humanly speaking amen if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing how many wants to be a blessing and get a blessing all right when a man has done you wrong and I mean done you wrong you know he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that Hallelujah [Laughter] anyhow help us lord well you just said you conv mention yeah to the father hello or you can go to that brother as the scripture said but not to the church come on somebody all that does is just spread bitterness and you know what that all that is is a one-sided tale one-sided story amen that's why Jesus wanted to get both of you together CU there's two sides to every story oh I know I stepped off in it right then but there's two sides to every story he's done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before God and don't take it in a way of just a selfish way of say well I'm just supposed to do this I guess stand shoulder to shoulder stand in the presence of God no you pray to the father a way a prayer should be made in the presence of God god father here's my brother yes he deserves punishment because he's done me evil I don't see why he did it but then you just be quiet for a little bit and let God go to talking to you and you'll see maybe what that man's been through the devil's Twisted him up somewhere caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the Throne of God you'll be feeling sorry for that man wow You'll Be sympathizing with that brother and when you get back down to Earth again you'll go over that brother shake his hand cuz you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of God and condemn anybody I don't believe it no sir even if he is a rank sinner what about a brother that's made a mistake though I say he's wrong sometimes it's accus of being wrong and not wrong but if he's wrong if we'll take him to the throne of God and stand there shoulder to- shoulder with our brother knowing he's IM mortal and maybe his destination rest upon our attitude towards him my I his destination rest upon our attitude towards him when we come back from the Throne of God we'll realize that we're everyone guilty we're everyone guilty we all need help one from the other and that's the best way to do is pray I this quote here is is amazing to me said we must be reverent and respect each other and love each other and show respect to each other I believe you say why are you preaching this you know something I'm preaching this cuz God told me to preach this and I know people that's exactly right we people we got issues as you heard Sunday about the perfect Church don't go there cuz you won't it won't be perfect no more amen is I believe it was a few nights ago somewhere else it was there was a crippled woman a crippled woman she had a real need a woman it was in Jamaica and she was sitting there but she gave her place respect to a woman that had heart trouble she gave her place in line and because she did that the Holy Spirit comes right back around and healed her love and show respect one to the other if you want God to hear your prayer and send you an angel to your home that's a blessing I'd like to have amen send an angel to your home live right do right treat everybody right and be right before God and God will grant that to [Music] you amen that's treating everybody right at work whether you're the employee or the employer that's treating people with respect and love and realize and listen they're standing before me a purchased son or daughter of God or somebody that needs God and my attitude towards them might have an everlasting effect on them towards Christ he said you don't know this's another quote I love how they just line up you don't know what's beaten beneath that little old skin there the Holy Ghost might be your Tabernacle there so you got to watch yourself don't do that we must be brothers no matter if he's in the wrong still treat him nice Hallelujah be nice to him if you haven't got that Spirit then there's something wrong Hallelujah anyhow if you Jesus was nice to those who were ugly to him you must be Christians full of love ready to help any race I know that people want to make the prophet some racist but listen to listen because of what he said on marriage and and and things about inter Mar but listen what he said you must be nice to any race color Creed anywhere anytime we must be that way that's a Christian amen amen that's the way Christ would have us act and to be Christians is to be Christlike CU see so another quote somebody is watching your life they're watching how you talk to other people well I'm their boss I can talk to them how I want to no they're watching or I'm an employee I they're watching other people were watching let everybody know let your dealings be fair and square good and don't take nothing that doesn't belong to you don't say nothing but what's the truth and you can always tell the truth every time God will honor the truth always do what's right treat everybody right if they don't treat you right treat him right anyhow Jesus treated us right when we didn't treat him right that's right come on somebody what has he done for you he's forgiven us of our debts and our sins and made us Sons and Daughters of God how come we can't treat somebody else the same way so true John 13:34 says a new commandment I give unto you oh well I thought we had the 10 well a new commandment I give to you that you love one another as I have loved you that you also love one another by this shall all men know that you are my disciples if you have love one for the other John 15:12 says this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you greater love has no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends and ye are my friends I'm glad he's friend enough to me to tell me what I need to hear here if you if you do whatsoever I command you you have not chosen me but I have chosen you he chose you when he knew you was in debt he chose you when he knew you couldn't pay your way out of debt he chose you when you was the darkest blackest covered up with sin sinner that could ever be but God rich in Mercy reached across your life and said Pay in for thank you have not chosen me but I've have chosen you and ordained you that you could go and forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit shall remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name that he may give it to you these things I command you that you love one another Romans 13:8 says oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law for this Thou shalt not commit adul ulter Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness covet not covet or are there any other commandment is briefly comprehended and saying this namely that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law and that knowing the time and now is that now is high time to wake out of sleep and now is our Salvation nearer than we believe the night is far spent the day is at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness what's the works of darkness he just wrote it right out amen not forgiving one another the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us walk honestly as the day not in rioting and drunkenness or chamber or walting is not a Strife for him but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ and make not pro Provisions for the flesh to fulfill the lust thereof 1 Thessalonians 4:9 says but as touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you for you yourselves are taught of God Amen not a man of God to love one another 1 Peter 1 and verse 22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth of the spirit and the unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with pure heart fervently uhoh it ain't just a half-hearted love well I got to love him I guess cuz he goes to church with me me that's not what the word says an unfeigned love amen heart that's fervently outpouring of love cuse being born again not of corruptible seed but Incorruptible by the word of God which alive liveth and abideth forever 1 John 3:11 so for this is the message that you heard from the beginning that we should love one another not as Cain who was the Wicked one who slew his brother were why what what what slew a SL what happened because of resentment cuz he resented what God did in his heart in his offering but not in his and here he said I brought my best brother I'm giving everything I got but that's not all that God required God required blood but when God come down and and visit him he said if you'll do as your brother Abel did you'll also be accepted can you see the mercy of almighty God to look right straight at serpent seed and say if you'll do just like this you'll also be accepted so if you feel that you might be serpent seed there's still Mercy for you there's still Grace for you that's right there's still a god who's calling out to you if you'll do as these have done you shall also be accepted marble not my brethren if the world hates you we know that we know that we have passed from death into life because we love the Brethren Oh I thought it's because we had Miracles no it's because we have love the greatest of all these is love amen he said pass from Death to life because we love the Brethren he that loveth not his brother abideth in death whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer wow and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him hereby perceive we the love of God because he's laid down his life for us we ought to also lay down our lives for the brethren for whoo hath the words world's goods and see the brother have a neede and shth up his bowels of compassion with himself how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but also in deed and Truth beloved if God so loved us we ought to also love one another no man has seen God at any time if we love one another God dwells in us and his love is perfected in us hallelujah second John 1 says the the Elder unto the elect lady and her children whom I love in the truth and not only I but also all they that have known the truth for the truth whose sake what dwelleth in US shall be with us forever Grace be unto you mercy and peace that God from God the Father for the Lord Jesus Christ the son of the father in truth and love I Rejoice greatly that I found my children walking in truth and received amen a commandment from the father now beseech thee lady not as though I wrote a new commandment unto thee but that which we had from the beginning that we love one another so I mean it's in the scripture am me love brother br like this he said love one another above everything Christ the mystery you want to hold Christ The Mystery of God reveal love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say you're all one great big sweet group Sweet group now but remember my warning Satan won't let that stay that way he'll shoot everything he's got he may bring somebody in make him a Target he might bring a critic or unbeliever sit him down cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness things then he'll shoot that guy some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it hello somebody don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you say right loving sweet and kind one another pray for that man that he will be saved too or woman or whatever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another wow and stay with your pastor he's a Shepherd gives him give him respects he'll lead you through and calls he's ordained of God to do so the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together the one that the devil is using for an enemy will either come in or get out he'll either get out or come in and be one of you that's all don't ever Clan among one another and talk or make yourself clannish We Are One now but just stop right here for a moment I mean it doesn't mean you can't have close friends there are people that you get along with better than others there's other people that you feel a closer bond with with than others there are people that you like to fellowship with because you have a connection there been God's maybe done something there or whatever and there there's a connection there it's not he's not talking about that he's talking about let's love everybody you know cuz you can't say the you know like he brings it right on down and say the left hand can't say the right hand I'm mad at you I'm going to cut you off because you're not you're not who I he's my left hand I want him to stay there even the little tip of my finger I wanted to stay right there every bit of my body right there God wants us a body Believers to stay right exactly with one another right at with one another he says see God if God is in your heart he said you let me stop let me back up he said now you got tapes on that you got tapes on what we believe you got tapes on the discipline of the church how we behave oursel in the Church of God how we come together and sit together in Heavenly places don't stay home if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open you under it gets in here in the fellowship with your brothers if you don't don't feel that way amen then I tell you it's time you got to praying cuz we're in the last days where the Bible exhorted us the much more as we see that day approaching to love one another with Christian love and divine love to assemble ourselves in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this will all men know you are my disciples that you have love one for the other and if the brother you think he's a little wrong or sister Lord don't say just say Lord don't let me ever have a root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acid of malice and jealousy and hatred that'll just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it'll run you from the him from the Tabernacle here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor do everything don't let that happen you wax that much closer together move right on up closer to one another love one another talk nice about one another say nice things about one another and then God will bless you brother brandom actually experienced this very personally when he went into that restaurant and there was this woman sitting over there with this cop and music playing he said he was standing there criticizing her and looking at her like how in the world oh grandma what's she doing here when that cop what's he probably out on his wife and what what what are they doing he's like Lord how can you why why don't you just wipe all this off just wipe it off get rid of it God said come over here for a minute pulls him over into a corner and he begins to see a vision of the sins coming from the earth and going up and striking striking him and he said he would have wiped it all off but there was a blood ban around it and he said I ask is this the sins of the world he he said no these are your sins ouch that pinches because we can see all the sin out there come on we can see all the sin out there and all the stuff that's around and all the stuff that's happening around us the the the the Leo DEA how it's become and and the lukewarmness and we can see all the hatred against God and the homos sexuality as it was in the days of Sodom and gomorra we see all of that but what about us well I can see this person's fault sure you can't I can see that person's fault but what about yours listen we don't come to church to expose everybody else's fault we come to church to see how I need to get right with God how I need to grow closer to God how I need to come and lay aside everything that's so easily beset me and press toward the mark of the High Calling amen but it changed his attitude from unforgiveness cuz what he had was unforgiveness he he's like Lord why you even putting up with this strike it off and when he realized what forgiveness was he said Lord please forgive me Lord let me have a heart for these kind of people and it changed everything Faith fell in amen and Faith came to a point where he could go over there and he you know what he did he actually said I want to talk to you just a moment I want to ask for your forgiveness come on somebody I want to ask that you forgive me because I was thinking things I shouldn't be thinking about you and he begins to un unload his heart and the spirit of God fell in and Faith arose from forgiveness so that woman could give her heart to God this is what we want Amen in the house of God we want forgiveness to take place so fath Faith Can rise healings can happen our prodical can come home beautiful we have those things in our lives God testing us he said when you get this spirit in you then the burdens of Life become light you don't even notice them the more the yolks line with the feathers it becomes so easy and then people may pile things on you they pile a lot of stuff on me they say a lot of bad things about me he said if you got this Spirit it'll be like Samson in the gates of Gaza you'll just pick them up and move them up the hill and put him right there at the foot of the cross and say Lord forgive my brother cuz he don't know what he does that's the same spirit Christ had I mean he just got whooped and beat and bloodied and spit on and Crown the thorns and what was his word last words out of his mouth father forgive them and they had already said let his blood be upon us father forgive them for they know not what they do you'll pack them right back to the straight to Calvary and there at Mount Calvary you'll lay them at the feet of Jesus and pray for your enemies who not with a grudge Lord if you'd bust them open right now direct quote just bust them right open but with something from your heart say dear God that man is a man like I am you see what's lacking in the church friends we what we need is to start it all over so it comes forgiveness is a a letting go it's letting go and let God have his way God might be using that very thing that that brother wronged you about to work something out in his life but Satan wants to turn it and make you angry about it and make you mad about it and get the church all stewed up about it listen it's time we start it all over say father you forgive me let me forgive others amen as he said in this prayer amen father Thou Are Who Art Thou in heaven Hallowed be thy name and he says as as you forgive us let us forgive others forgive Let It Go some have carried burdens for years and it's crippled them in their Spirit not only the spirit it's also crippled them in their body amen science I could have brought it science talks about they talk about how that bitterness and resentment and anger and for unforgiveness actually actually bruises cells in your body and it causes all kind of issues so you are the one that's in the prison he said the only thing we have to do he said when you're placed in the body of Christ to Sons and Daughters you don't have to Knuck down to the devil knuckle down is what he say you don't have to knuckle down to the devil we have a law and that law is the Holy Spirit the only thing you have to do is to know how to let go and let God Amen let go and let God but you keep fighting it and it won't never work but if you'll let go and let God that's all there is to it he said the fish said wait I I'll catch my breath and it be good I I'll breathe up but I'll breathe up a little oxygen in me and I'll see if I can go down no he doesn't do that he'll burst open bird say I'll see how fast I can run down here maybe I'll take off no he won't do that he'll fall down there's a law that controls him and he said it's the same way with us if we it isn't what how we fight and Pull and hurry oh if I don't do this if this happens and I got this problem it's not that it's to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God beautiful you just let go and let God then he takes you to your healing he takes you to your baptism of the spirit he takes you anything that's promised he will take it take you to it if you let go and let God have his way but let but the way you he said but the way you do you let Satan just get away with it all the doubt and everything begins to come in ad had accumulate accumulate late we got this big old baggage we carrying for years it's weighing us down and weighing us down we're so crippled up in our spirit that we can't even enjoy the present you know fathers many time ruin relationships with their son because of what happened in the past instead of breaking Cycles we're called to be cycle Breakers right ain't it something that we can preach a message of forgiveness in an hour of unforgiveness there's more hate in this world there's more bitterness in this world there's more malice in this world there's more unforgiveness in this world he man just go out and have a little bump in the run or some little bump against somebody and see what happens people get angry and mad used to be I didn't hurt nothing have a nice day and Satan's building it such a way that he's trying to make it to where you can't even hardly be nice to anybody no more more what you mean brother Tim well just the other day I I I actually stopped by Brother Tims picked up a trailer and empty trailer was taking it out to the house and and I come over this hill and there's this young boy on a motorcycle standing and he just kind of waved at me I just looked at wonder if he's wonder if he's got problems need some help I D well I can't turn around here and I'm driving I said well I know where spot to turn around but you know by the time I got up there think man this guy might mug me hey you know tell them what this guy do got my wife in here I I but I was like no I don't believe that and I just cast that stuff aside and I turned around went back down and I said young man you need some help he said yes sir he said I just bought this motorcycle and he's about five I don't know three or four miles from the the U fire station there on on germant toown and he said I I I I I live up by that fire station he said I bought this motorcycle and somebody put the wrong gas in it and I was trying to work on it and I traded it and just a young boy trying to do something and he said uh you you wouldn't mind giving me a ride would you I said no I'd knocked that I had you it's your lucky day I got a trailer we pulled the trailer up he said well do you happen to have some straps I said it's your lucky day two times we laughed we put straps on that and dropped him off but Satan has fed this world with so much hate and fear and worry used to that wasn't nothing you do that at any time just see somebody pick them up you won't do it no more why CU it's a world of unforgiveness it's a world of hate and bitterness and hatred and people mad want to kill somebody because of something that happened to them lost their minds God don't let that thing sneak in our Spirits into our churches where're we're willing to kill somebody I'm not literally talking about taking a gun and God help us taking a gun bringing it to the Church of God and shooting somebody but I'm talking about using that bitterness and that fear the bullets that Satan gave you and shooting it out and it catches somebody else and it catches somebody else and it kills people around us what we need to do is start over let the musicians come by if you would mind bow your heads for a moment coming into this Christmas season it's kind of contemplated today you know why would you preach two services like this coming into Christmas why why would you speak things like this [Music] Christmas as we believe is not just not about gifts in a tree or nothing like that but his brother Brandon would say put Christ back in Christmas and to remember what he'd done how he came down and became lowly became a footwash flunky the king of Heaven would kneel down and wash feet dirty feet but more than that he came down and he took dirt grime of the devil that devil had piled upon your life and by the spilling of that blood that blood can wash over you and wash every bit of that Grime away [Music] I don't [Music] know get a lot of gifts get a lot of gifts in a few days maybe looking forward to something special the greatest gift that you
