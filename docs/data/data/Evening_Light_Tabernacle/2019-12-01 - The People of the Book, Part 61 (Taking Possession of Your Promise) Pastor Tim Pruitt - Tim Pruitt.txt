overcoming power amen what grace is given can we just bow our heads for a moment as we ask the Lord's blessings today Lord we love you we thank you we glorify your name because you are worthy and that there is no one like you Lord the Old Testament would say of all the gods of all the earth you are God and we know Lord there's really no other God there's no competition you're the only one Lord you're the creator of all you're the giver of every good precious gift you're the God of mercy and the God of grace you're the God who positions us in our places and ordains our steps and puts us where we are we could not do this on their own Lord we could only do it as you ordain us to do Lord and we believe that we're ordained for this hour and for this time Lord that we've come here for such a time as death to take our stand in this evil age and know we're beset on every side though there's disappointments along the road there is nothing that can stop this invincible army but we have been called for a purpose to finish the race and we will not let hindrance hinder us the will stand firm on the Word of God and on this truth I'm three Lord for your children today that have gathered in your name that you would bless them that bright around the world Lord that's your people Lord God you know them some have reached out to me from other nations this week some what needs in their lives Lord seem like there's so many needs demon oppressed spirits have an inbound Oh God people in such need Lord you know understand you understand the needs of your people Lord you hear hear the famous heart cry even those that are possessed with legions today Lord that little cry this maybe you can't even hear it as a man that would be under their breath but you hear it Lord and you hear them say Jesus help me Lord I pray God you'll know you'll undertake for your people Lord as I said he earned from other countries around the world Lord as they've written to me this week expressing the joy of hearing the Word of God preached in power Lord may he bless your people Oh God and give them a hope and I know that they have a hope and a future Lord that you have not left us alone you got it all in control you never left us and you won't forsake us but you're right here to the end time now father as we look into the word today just make our hearts ready to receive it's in Jesus name a man god bless you man can I get you to turn with me in the Bible to John chapter 15 and verse one man we appreciate each one of you that are here this morning pray God's blessings upon you man I certainly appreciate the musicians and they're given to the Lord and men will think by the same pattern for playing the organ for us this morning a madness as we have ones that are out on the holiday is good that God sends others to help along I help us along the journey amen so we appreciate the Lord for that and we want to welcome their family today that is here visitin from Georgia and may the Lord just be with them as they followed the leadership of the Lord and find that guidance for their lives John chapter 15 verse 1 we want to read from I am The True Vine my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth NOT fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purges it that it may bring forth more fruits now you are clean to the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except you abide in me I am the vine you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you herein is my father glorified that you bear much fruit so that you shall be my disciples Amen may God bless the reading of his word you can be seated amen how wonderful is God's truth a man we just see so many things that lies within the Word of God I wanted to just share with you that we just had a reprinting of the three titles that we've done for outreach which is one on the Godhead and baptism in Jesus name and also the five comings of Elijah speaking about the prophecies concerning Elijah in this day and also on the original sin if you don't understand what the original sin was then you you cannot make the connection of all the scriptures through the Bible and so we make them and I just wanted to say for you overseas they're available in a PDF that you can print them out and share them there they're not true at all replace the message they're simply for outreach and for you at home folks it's a good thing to to share with others amen and and of course it's a it's it's what I wrote it for it was outreach tools and I believe it'll be a blessing to the Bride of Christ so we just had those done and so we have a new new stock of them available for those that would be interested and also this morning you know because we're here at a special time and and I trust you had a wonderful Thanksgiving amen and gave thanks unto the Lord for his blessings upon us as you gathered with family and men god bless you brother Orlando sister Regina god bless you for being here today everybody just glad you here man if your visitor in our myths we're happy that you're here they're not visitors they're home folks amen so it's nice to see them it's like getting a good drink of water you know when you've been real thirsty so been real thirsty to see your brother and sister God bless you for being here amen but I trust you've had a wonderful Thanksgiving and a man and we were blessed as we gathered with our family and then had friends and extended family and just enjoyed a day of togetherness and Thanksgiving and to our Lord for his good I trust you did the same and as yes that God would bless you you know in a great way in your family I you know I thought about it you know there's been many many Thanksgivings I can remember as a boy going to brother branham's meetings in Shreveport when he was there at live tabernacle for the Thanksgiving meetings in 63 and then again in 65 and and those were special days and God was telling us things you know for example that there was a bride that was being United with Christ and he would speak that message on the invincible union and then of course works his faith expressed and trying to do God a service and and then the the other and on the wings of us no I dove and those mighty messages that were preached as God was imparting some things to us as the the Prophet was bringing the final messages that he would preach here upon the earth and so you know it's a it's a time of remembrance and I think our nation started this tradition back in George Washington's day where that they you know signed into a in order to for the nation to stop and remember God's blessings upon us and the provisions that he made and given us a new country and and as I reflected upon data I shared some thoughts with our deacons here and minister friends also that I have and I just want to kind of share them with you this morning as I preface some of the things that I'm going to speak on because I think it also reflects the the future that we have as the Bride of Christ and I and I just said your brother says one of the many who trace their heritage back to the pilgrims fathers and so that's identified with him there I want to express my it's given to our great God and Savior for bringing us to this lamb because in this day God sent a message to us here we know it came here in America I think it was a sovereign thing of God he could have chosen you know a little bitty country somewhere without the means to spread it around the world but he chose it right here in the West at least at the setting of the Sun as the message reaches its climax said before it goes back to the east and so God sent a message to us which is brought freedom to many thousands around the world and we have been saved from the slave belt of sin and the tyranny of false religions that oppressed us and today as we pause to give thanks I'm thankful for you my fellow comrades who fight bravely in this battle for freedom you bless me with your passion for truth we have conquered much and for that I'm thankful but yet there's more today I want to thank you for your labors in the Lord and for a church that has been established but surely we have not possessed at all are we not like Israel who has conquered much and has one of the finest military forces in the world yet within sight but just out of our grasp lies the Temple Mount in Hebron where the tombs of Abraham and Sarah lay and both there of these places even today remain in the hands of hostile strangers and the same is true for us a resurrection and a rapture still lays before us it is this ground were patriarchs of the faith were laid as a seed and they still await our arrival for without us they cannot be made perfect it must be conquered it must be our possession surely it is now that sons of God will be manifested and shall rise to the occasion for the final battle from mortal to immortality so brothers and sisters while we pause to give thanks for a restored word for an unsealed book for the Gospel of st. Paul let us continue the book of Acts going from glory to glory and from victory to victory until every hill and valley of this great land the prayer of this promised word is free from enemies and we step from everything mortal into immortality but when this battle is over it is then we were where the crime I feel that we have so much more to accomplish and I'm totally dissatisfied for where we are at this time surely someone must break the cycle surely God wants to do more than in past ages in past ages Luther broke from the land of bondage into the glorious freedom of the just shall live by faith it was a glorious revelation many broke free with him and shouted and glorified God for this newfound freedom from the tyranny of Rome these broke out into little groups and homes and shammies and eventually with new buildings dedicated to the preaching of that revelation new signs were put over the doors of other were put over many other doors identifying himself with Luther's revelation and soon they settled down in Lutheran churches content with the portion of truth that was revealed and gradually they became as dead as the Catholics with a little different philosophy the same repeated with the Methodists and later the Azusa movement and we have now accomplished what the Lutheran's and Methodists and de souza movement have done we have our own buildings that with names that identify us with a message some of these are nice and buildings and the denominations were left but sadly far too more far too many have a name that they are living but they're dead and while I'm thankful for a place where the word can be fully preached I am far from satisfied surely God wants more than new buildings where different philosophy is preached my prayer is God don't let that be our plight please don't let us be a repeat of the cycle of revival and death so all were to the prize before us there must be another book of Acts written and novel just one of his failures and wars over doctrines and persecutions but a book of Acts continued where and where the Apostle and not a place where the Apostle phunkfist aaalac fathers aimed at and relaxed we must not this must not be just a repeat of the book of Acts but a continuation of the same outpouring of the same Holy Spirit that wrote a book of Acts no don't dismiss don't mistake this for utterances of discouragement but rather I am encouraged that there are some who will break this cycle of revival and death and return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ yes I believe he will find faith when he returns Sharon from the Ephesian Church age he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches how tragic it is that this first age did not listen to the spirit it's but instead listen to man but thank God in the last days there will be a group rise up the true bride of this last day and she will listen to the spirit and in that day of gross darkness the light will return by the pure word and we will return to the power of Pentecost to welcome back the Lord Jesus Christ what a promise that is today it's a promise that I hold dear as we are getting ready for the service today I'm going to be speaking to you taking possession of your promised as we have read from numbers 33 and 53 and prior services I'll bring it to your attention again and ye shall dispossessed then inhabitants of the land and dwell Darrien for I have given you the land to possess it and of course we know that this land brother branham said is not the Millennium because he says I'm the Millennium there won't be any wars to have to possess it but he said it's the land of the Holy Ghost and he said just like Israel was given a land when they left Egypt go to this promised land they found out it was already inhabited there had been other nations that had dwelt there before and since Abraham's time and taken possession of it and so they would have to actually go and overthrow and dispossessed a land that was already occupied and and in doing so there would be the hammerites and the Hittites and the highlights and Jebusites and all of these and they were instructed to not make a treaty with them but to totally dispossessed them and to cast them out and to take their possession of course this discouraged the heart of Israel because they just wanted a land that was just handed over to them they wanted it to be a land that was empty and and nobody was there and the and they could just go in and take it but they had to soon realize that they would have to fight for every square inch and they would have to dispossessed the enemy that was there and in doing so it would be it would come with great difficulties it would come with great tests of faith it would come at the time where the enemy would whisper to them but you know from the walls of Jericho you look like a grasshopper in their sight and you know it would be a time word that they would um they would be severely tested to the point and then and then they would get even satisfied with the little portion that to God and it would finally be wrote in the book of Judges and neither did not till I inherit it all and dispossessed all their enemies but the the amorite still remained in their land and neither did and neither did and neither did and it would it would list all of these that that here they come and they got a portion but they didn't get it all and I don't know how you feel this morning but I I am NOT interested in just a partial promise a man but I want to see a people coming to their full inheritance and take complete possession of their promised land and when we see the Land of Israel and her restoration back to her ancient homeland and we can justified today a miracle after miracle after miracle during their wars for independence of wars in the Yom Kippur War or or whatever it was where were that they were where they were going to be over round by the enemy but siege a hope of God come down in a miraculous way and give them victories that that was astonishing to the world that it could even happen when they were far outnumbered where they were where they were outgunned outnumbered and everything else but that had God on their side they had prophecy on their side and I want to say to you we have prophecy on our side we have a we have a God on their side a man all of heaven stands behind the possession of this promised land and the Word of God has been given to a people in this last day excuse me but now but as I said they even fall under the promise of God even the word that said in Joel I will restore saith the Lord that was that was given Israel as a people as a nation but is also given the spiritual Israel we mostly preach it of what it belongs to us and our restoration but you can also see the same God that said I will restore for this bride has also said it for Israel a man I will restore saith the Lord and against all odds and man against every opposition against me and outnumbered a man yet the Word of God was far then prophecy was far them God was on their side he was there and ever battled and I want you to know as we sing the song he's got it all under control he's daring every back a manager there never chest peach there never trial a man and he will dispossessed the enemy but it's gonna use you to do it and this is what Israel didn't realize it would be God that would dispossessed the enemy but he was gonna use Israel to do it and it would be my might and it would not be my max power but it would be by God's Spirit and this is how he would dispossessed the enemy a man and I just want to say today when I realized hey yeah how much we have but yet how much more we need to take and then then I saved it Weiss if we hear item there's more of God's promises to be possessed I can hear brother madam say about his church he said I want you all fully in through the Holy Ghost I want you to fully into this land don't stay behind he said you know you you come out you crossed and some of you have been justified by faith and you believed on the Lord Jesus Christ but you belong across the river a man in some of you have had sanctification and the works of sanctification he can point back to the pilgrim holiness in the Nazarene and whatever he said but but he said I'm saying that there's somebody gotta cross over and I'm saying the same thing this morning that must be a people that cross over into the full promise time and Jericho being sealed up and the seals being opened and the walls coming down it just means that the whole land is open it don't mean less it means more man it doesn't mean we stop it Jericho where the seals were open it means that because it's that's open and the key now to the rest of the land is given to you because when you realize who you're with the title deed in your hand with the word and brother branham would say but to you who believe oh god do you who know to you who's got something in you Collin do the deed I just wonder is there anybody today got something calling to the Deeb he learned of all the deep in you has been satisfied to stay where you are for me and my house [Applause] for me there's something more than what he sees there's a land beyond the river somewhere there's still that be calling to the deep and he says I cannot be satisfied with theology I cannot be satisfied with a good church I cannot be satisfied with a good compare campaign I cannot be satisfied with a little healing service there's something beyond that that's calling I believe I'm talking to people who are called called to the finish line now you know it's great that we have the word is wonderful to understand doctor and we often hear preach the word to word the word and certainly we must have it and I believe we have received it but I want to say but what good is it in book form or what good is it in just a sermon form what value isn't having the theology perfect if it don't live a man even brother Branham spoke against putting too much of the stress on the mechanics which he called the word and nothing on the dynamics which he said the spirit and that that pretty much describes the failure of thousands of churches today 1st Thessalonians 1 and verse 5 I'm just going to share a few scriptures with you about how the word originally came he says for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in power and in the Holy Ghost and in much assurance as you know what matter of man we were among you for your sake so here he would hear he would speak of these very things it didn't come to you in word only but also in power and in demonstration he would say in first Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power and in mark 16:20 and they went forth and preached everywhere the Lord working with them confirming the word with signs following a man Hebrews 2 and 4 God also bearing them witness both with signs and wonders and with their divers miracles and gifts of the Holy Ghost according to his own will god bearing them witness a man would say in Romans 15 and 19 for he says through mighty signs and wonders by the power of the Spirit I have fully preached the gospel of Christ and the gospel of Christ is not fully preached unless it's with mighty signs and wonders a man the word wasn't preached as a dead letter but also empower in the Holy Ghost and much assurance a man in acts 14 in verse 38 they gave testimony unto the word of His grace and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands it was God given testimony verse verse 4 of 1st Corinthians 2 and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration and of power that your fates are not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God verse 11 of chapter 19 of Acts and God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them and evil spirits went out of them so now we know then how the word comes and what follows the word amen now we don't follow signs we follow the word and then those the signs follow the word for the Bible said the signs shall follow them that believe amen so if it's the word it Muslim we can talk about it all we want to we can dissect it all we want to we can and we can break it down and use our Greek words and and bring out through some policy mouth shooter but if it only what good is it a man is gonna live it's gonna live in your life it's gonna live in my life my mother's gonna live in the church it's gonna live with power hey man a power to live and overcome in life a power to stand true in them our trials and temptation power to heal our sick a man to save the loss to feel with the Holy Ghost a power not his word only now if it's the word that we're preaching and signs must follow the word the disciples what we're not told well Jesus had signs in his ministry so you're not required to know that's not what Jesus told them he told them his last words to them he said these signs are going to follow them that believe the same signs that I had you're going to have the works that I do you're going to do them all so these were the words of Jesus his last words that he would give to the church signs must follow them that believe by man and so signs must not just follow the word when Jesus preached it though signs must follow the word when we preach it man signs follow self follow believers and Jesus said that is the identity of the church the activity of the believers signs will follow them I am out now brother branham wood it was seven perfect faith and we'll just share this quote with you here he said now the identification of a scripture scripture Christian these words and Jesus these signs shall follow them that believe now how can you call yourself a believer of people and deny those words how can you call yourself a believer and deny any of this work see you can't do it you're not a believer therefore signs can't follow because you just accept what you want to believe and let the rest of it you want don't believe it but you've got to take the whole thing and believe it and when you truly believe not make believe but really believe then these signs shall follow them that be well how could you compare a Christian today with him Christians of long ago how them disciples walked in the power of the Spirit move by the Holy Ghost do it just a prisoner as I preached on the other night a prisoner to the word and will of God he couldn't even move and don't God moved him wouldn't you like to see a church rise like that it's going to it's going back it's got to come that's right it's on this road now I believe that we went down the road now we're closer now than when we first believed a man at Christ's of mystery brother Brennan said if a man says he's born again and tries to take these promises of God of Christ in this last day to some other age making him Christ yesterday or not but not today then that man or that person has been in a delusion by Satan and if that man says he believes that and it don't manifest itself through Jesus said in mark 16 these signs shall follow them that believe a man into all the world and ever age I mean casting out Devils speaking with with tongues and all these great manifestations of gifts that would follow that they shall not they maybe they ought to but they will and heavens and earth will pass away but his word won't now you see Jesus what's the word but it wasn't agreed he went just a dumb he wouldn't just an ordinance of the church he was a Living Word a man and his bride will be the same she will be the Living Word of God or the Word of God alive now as the word bride the bride are the word must be in action remember the message is not a new philosophy it's a people that are Jesus Christ in action but amend my people that do the work of Christ now God has done great things in this day hey man you know you see and when we talked about it the seals weren't removed in the book though to make you a stuffed shirt with more knowledge the book was not opened to replace denominational Creed's with message Creed's but rather to open the title of inheritance so that the people would know their boundaries amen and the definitions of this promised land so we would know what is ours and the opening of the seals would expose the Antichrist who had taken away the holy spirit who had taken away the doctrines of the church and we've bought conquering and to conquer and they would undo what the Antichrist had done did you hear me a man and it would restore back not just the truth but the power of that truth a man so it wasn't given to replace replace the the the word are the philosophies of man rather it was it was given to us to to reveal what is ours what belongs to us and the removal of the seals and revealing other symbols would give us an abstract to title now we have a deed and I want to say this morning we have a deed a title that has been searched and every claim against it removed a man and it gives us a right to the full indwelling of the Holy Ghost that the full power of the blood might be made known to us the blood the power of the blood the cleansing power of the blood has so has so removed every sin stain every guilt stain all for the Church of Jesus Christ so that we can have the true baptism where we can have know the Godhead where we can know what the Apostles preached and we would come back to the original apostolic doctrine that the church is left down to the age and I want to say Oh claims that is against us has been struck off a man everything but Luther Wesley the Pentecostal anything the Catholicism all of them have done a man every mark of unbelief has been put in the guidebooks off of you and today is clear it is yours whether your daddy did your grandparents it is your don't you get everything I get you have been struck off [Applause] hallelujah doesn't matter your mama your mama might have been a prostitute you may not even know who your daddy is you may not know who your granddaddy is you may know you may have every kind of claim in whatever but I'm telling you [Applause] it revealed just the power of the blood it was able to go back generations and man were they or they messed up and correct all the error every claim that demo had against you did you hear what I said whether Luther did it Wesley Denny Pentecost did it with a Catholic get him whether this Creed did it that Creed is open your first birth well you have been washed you have been cleaned even your old sin or under the planet Jesus understand justified [Applause] because you have faith in the atonement you got faith in the blood you know what the black net for you wasa it made us clean black the way sin if walked away darkness into the light and the light said there's no shame on you there's no shame on you you are the bride of Jesus Christ do 12 blameless declare blameless [Applause] - what we [Applause] oh if you only realize where the blood positions you as inheritance of in this land it's all yours hallelujah oh isn't God good to us let's just take a moment to worship Me [Applause] Oh Oh to be in position at his place [Applause] [Music] [Applause] we have a deed and has been searched and every claim against you removed and it gives us the right to the full and dwelling of the holy ghost that the full power of the blood might be made known to us I under the Old Testament an illegitimate child couldn't come in or in its descendants for what was 18 generations that because that blood was limited but this blood is unlimited that's because that blood didn't have enough power the blood of bulls and goats could never take a place singing [Applause] creature with his back all the way back to the Apostolic fathers to Jesus Christ himself and say I was bored of him and I'm not just covered by the blood as if a paint covered over my past but this was no paint this was a bleach that annihilated my past and put it back on the head of Satan himself and as wonderful as Tydeus the giving of the title does not make us a possessor of the land it only tells us what is legally ours the land will only be given to the conquer a mountain and we're in the greatest battle ever fought and there is still much of this Promised Land to be possessed brother Branham said an uncertain sound there's only one certain sound that's the gospel prepare for battle what battle the coming of the Lord prepare yourself now against evil with evil is by setting the people on Abraham everything is going wrong and home life is going wrong UN is failing the nations are breaking and atomic bombs around and home splitting up and motherhood it's going low and the morals among the people and distrust of my one in all denominations fussing in student what do you wanted

amen because you're unstoppable you're an invincible army a man we are not summoned retreat and we're not going back but we're possess it out brother branham would say I believe the greatest battle has ever fought is now ready to go into action and I believe God has been selected his soldiers look around at one another and say and say to one another why are you here a man is because God's been selecting his soldiers he's been selected soldiers and I believe he's dressing him I believe he's been training them but I want to say to you boot camp is over this is what we've been trained for this is what we've been a quick this is why he gave us a weapon for getting ready to start oh he could be but he end up that sermon with one of the greatest charges that a general could say to his soldiers and from this day henceforth don't never put that sword in the sheath anymore pull it out let's go come they went forth conquering and to conquer all right I give my that first homework Christian soldier do you hear the message all our Christian soldiers he sees the bride a raid and marching to what the tune of onward it's never backwards it's not retreat [Applause] that's not it [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] this is our the great power of charge is it hallelujah soldiers with armors gleaming colors streaming faith and doubt is setting yourself an array in this tabernacle this morning but down on one side and faith on the other soldiers stand at your post of duty hallelujah our captain the morning star lead zone he never goes back he don't know the word retreat he don't have to retreat and the greatest battle of the Fox is going on right now in here yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt between Liberty and bondage the family zone sign your sphere soldiers poly septum army and the armored God is getting his soldiers ready aim at God anoints his army I just want to tell you the word as always Oh always overcome the enemy and break the yoke because of the anointing hallelujah you say brother Jim what kind of anointing are we under and I saw I didn't see a we came to I didn't see a powerless angel I didn't see a need so they can golf against cancer or sickness drugs or alcohol or demon possession I didn't mean to like that I saw another mighty angel and I'm preaching to people today that are under that anointing of a mighty angel and they're not anointed to failure Darrin no need to victory cause in every age hey man God had victory no matter what age it was come on I'm an old brother there's been a lot of dark hours there's been a lot of discouraging moments when Adam and Eve would walk out of the garden you know failure and fell as failures and and Whitin and then depressed and and slaves now the sin through whatever and they would come back with her children back to the gate of Eden and they would worship God and offer a sacrifice longing to get back it was during that time in that moment that Abel got a revelation from God a man he was handed a sword [Music] [Applause] [Applause] to a darkened world to give a hope to hopeless people to give a faith to faithless people recovery team and that Redeemer would break the head of Slavic serpent and bruise his head bring Redemption Oh hallelujah I know it's true cuz I'm standing on the backside of this prophecy and I'm saying he was wounded for my transgressions he was bruised for my pudding and the chastisement of my peace was upon him and by His stripes I'm healed hallelujah hallelujah what a promise word ma'am the Bible would say every one of them did this through faith Hebrews eleven would loo and list them as the heroes of faith and he said they all did it by faith and God sends a prophet in this day to make sure your heart was turned back to that faith to the faith to the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and then to the faith of the Apostle Paul to the faith of Peter could I save you to the faith of Jesus a man that he returns a people back to faith again because every age has had to take the sword of faith and defeat the enemy with and the Word of God will defeat the enemy anywhere any time in any place hey man and so a sword was given into the hand of Enoch somebody with me it was a sword it was a faith sword it was a revelation there was a revelation given him I want you understand even walk with God 300 years how many remember that in the Bible he won't with God 300 years he lived 365 years so 65 years he had a past that he didn't want with God but it's past didn't keep him from a rapture [Applause] hallelujah don't that give you hope it won't keep you from your walk my he will not make you stop along the journey in hello now your past has no control over you anymore no control it can't stop it can't turn you around it can't depress you let's walk with God and every time the devil comes you just take another step another step and another step you don't quit hallelujah and in its revelation was I'm not gonna quit until I possess hallelujah Enix was I think this adventure was really good but I want another adventure it's revelation did not make him satisfied with where he was he just made him say I want some more that Jesus I want another step Jesus taught me just a little closer Lord it didn't stop him man he just kept going that's what real revelation would do in a heart heylia's cause you to keep on going it won't stop you people can't stop see what people say about you kid stop him hey man I would but other people's failures can't stop you when others leave the message and say it ain't for me hey man they don't stop me it won't stop you either we just think another step we just go a little deeper we just clap another higher hallelujah one day innit by his sword fought through all the devil's of Hell until he got so close to heaven he was closer there than what he was to earth so he just took another step and changed bodies I'm ready to take another step a man I believe there's going to be a bride I believe mean it was prophesied the Bible said his prophecy was on the coming of the Lord that he said he said that that Enoch prophesied under the Lord's coming with ten thousands of his Saints hallelujah I believe there's going to be tens of thousand that were raised from the dead are the seven ages Amen the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his Saints four people hey man now we may be venturing out a little bit but it is said that Enoch built a pyramid he's the one that built it they can't figure out today how how they were built but they said to Enoch built a pyramid and in his pyramid he built it without a capstone hey man that's right he built it without a gap son because he knew that the Godstone hadn't come but in the future generation there would come a completion of the church and Christ would unite with his body and take his to take a rapture in its name for pyramid was the place of sin but the Egyptians turned them into tombs hello did anybody hear that or that just kind of dropped the Egyptians turned it into twos I meant God didn't give us this place are you with me amen to become another to another Baptist tumor Methodist tumor or message Tim come on this world is not a place for a tomb this word is a place you see it was all done by faith I was hearing brother Branham preached a sermon back in the fifties the other day wonderful message and he was talking about Noah how that Noah had a word from God he was given a sort of faith and that word was given him and he said I didn't understand why in the world that God would tell him to do what he did to go and build an ark and he said this art was made out of out of something that was called gopher wood and his real porous and it is soaks up it'll just soak up the waters and soak up the liquids it was porous and would so cups and you never get an ark to vote like that and he said I wondered about it and then he said I realized that it represented poorest humanity that you were made with the place to feel and God wasn't through just a building out of gopher wood but he instructed them go get go get a I a cedar tree or pine tree or another tree and then an evergreen a man representing eternal life and cut that tree down and get the SAP out of it and take the life of that tree and put it in that porous wood with you even without and once it became filled with that pitch anyway there was nothing no storm no waters could get through are you with me I mad nothing good no torpedo no no no freaking hit against a nothin nothing could destroy nothing could a hole in it it was now as hard as steel he said that's what God did man he cut down his own eternal life tree the son of God and poured his life in the poorest humanity to give you the seal of the Holy Ghost and it's a seal on the inside and the seal on the outside the devil can't get to you he wants to [Applause] trial no tests no problem that you go through can break through that seal that evergreen lights its eternal life by faith he did it I went to that a replica they say of that Ark and all their ideas of how it could be and what the did and all the reasons trying to prove it and they had some pretty good reasoning that reasoning to all the animals you see wasn't large animals material animals they were all baby animals and so they can all fit in smaller cages and this and you know they had all of this and you know then they had a ideas of waste disposal and all of this don't explain to me I've been a farmer I've been a farmer and I can uh you know I know I I know the the the muck that is left behind just with a few animals and how much work it takes to keep that cleaned up the only brother James and then we know all about that a man that was a daily chore we had to do to keep the thing cleaned up can you imagine you know one or two of every kind of species people couldn't do it if they'd stayed up day and night yeah you know to all their figuring and everything else you have to realize there was a supernatural element somewhere that this was more than what the reason that a man can figure out the reason the man would say it wouldn't float the reason a man could say you know all of their arguments against it because that's reasoning but you see Noah didn't reason all of that he just did what God said and the supernatural God closes the door of the ark a man it took them 40 days and nights through the dirty about the termal to seize them safely it will dry ground I didn't God do it out the same way he did feeding three million Jews to the wilderness and getting rock water out of a rock and bread out of heaven but man mister reason it out but no it didn't reason he just believed what God said when are we gonna learn that reasoning will get us nowhere you're just gonna have to put your faith in the world I [Applause] can't imagine I could imagine there was a lot of dishearten two days I can imagine when some would look through their website and say hey that ain't the Holy Ghost oh god don't do that anymore throw another tomato there all that person there they don't have the holy go that couldn't have been the Holy Ghost you're just an unbeliever I know what the Holy Ghost is I've tasted it I've experienced it and I know it and you can't reason me out of it I imagined it was many that started out in time to help and quit brother Brandon would say he would say that was make believers stood around the ark say well the old man could have been right and there's always those kind but you see he was going to possess his promise because it was his inheritance and reasoning wasn't going to stop him and discouragement wasn't going to stop him and he wasn't going to be satisfied come on we were just so with you with just having an ark and but no the whole word had to be fulfilled are you with me Amen all down to the agents there's been there's been men who's had to put their faith in action you see it doesn't matter how great your sword is and how it can cut and our serpent is if it remains in the scabbard it doesn't matter I'll share how sharp the sword is if you don't if you don't have the strength to use it and the phase is what holds the sword it's what presses the sword to the heart of the enemy and it depends on how strong your faith is as to how big a hole you can cut through the underneath hey man I'll tell you what brother we ought to be people of great faith oh man after seeing all that God has done in our generation to cause us to believe a man even after the miracles that he's done among us who calls us to believe we ought to be a people a great faith but really where I phase ought to be resting is not on those testimonies but upon this world of God a member told people can get sick and die remember this word never fails it's always the truth man it was true in Prior generations it'll be through and I'm generation it worked for fathers it'll work for us and God let us know it was Eve compromising on the Word of God taking reason and against the Word of God because of the fall somebody help me preach them man it was because the Word was laid aside for reason and when you go to reasoning that's when you go to get them in trouble hey man you go to reasoning that's where your faith starts dropping because you're starting to just believe God's Word and it's turning from faith to unbelief this is why the Bible said to cast down reasoning cast down imaginations you know you've got imaginations I got imaginations but you have to cast them down and then you you know my your imaginations lie how many had imaginations this week that never came to pass so your your imagination is on the bitch'll liar your reasoning will turn out to be faulty I mind there's all kinds of things your imagination your memory your memory ain't even good I mean you think you remember what happened back there and you don't even remember somebody else coming by though if did you forgot this part you left that out yeah you know why your memory is even faulty I'm every everything about your memory your imagination your conscience your reflections and your reasoning are all faulty there is only one thing that is sure and stedfast and that's a Word of God [Applause] do you ever get up to do it because this word will not be turning to him Boyd but it will accomplish what he said it to do [Applause] so if God said I paid for your healing my healings paid for he said I wanted to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want to get it I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost cause God's on my side all I have to do is agree with him hey man but you see faith is no good unless it's put into action and faith becomes atrophied and weak when is not used the Bible said that you know that our senses must be exercised to discern both good and evil so again it takes an exercising of that faith but you know it's like a guy training there you know they were lifting that weight and straining against it doesn't make him weaker that's wild that you're going through is not gonna make you weaker the trial in God knows it's gonna make you stronger understand because you went through the trial Christ the Son of the Living God hallelujah you see God's not afraid of the trial he's not afraid of the test that you go through he's not afraid at the discouragement his Satan blows your way ha he knows you're human but he knows God life flows through you that when the human only can go so far the god life takes over a man when your human faith gives out and you can't believe anymore that something takes over on the inside of you that makes you believe when you could not believe hallelujah it's an old post it's a time post that when when you want to give it up you don't give up you don't quit you keep going forward and you realize there's another battle coming greater is He that is in me that's in the world can do all things through Christ who empowers me that baptism of the Holy Ghost inside of me hallelujah Lord to God what a wonderful word but it was all through faith but faith is no good unless it's put into action you see you're not here to get awards and be put in a museum you're here for a battle pass men past ages and pass things are all in the humor in the Museum of memories of ages past these men wrought righteousness these men overcame these men the world was not worthy of and Paul would put them there in his Great Hall of Fame and show them as the great triumphs over the enemy and he would show what faith did in previous generations to let you know that your faith is the same faith but been made perfect because we are crucified with Christ yet good knew and yet we live not yet not i but the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave his life for me hallelujah wahoo can't lose with Christ faith in them that's what brother Branham when he was shown as he comes through the seven seals and he's given a sword in his hand and he was told this is the King's sword I want you to know that's what this message is it's the King's sword I'm not and it's not there to be put in the scabbard is not there so that we can act or go around and act smart and think we got something theologians ain't got it isn't there you know so that we can't add our own wisdom and knowledge and our understanding is give to fight the devil with the principle work of the church is the cast Satan out a man well win the enemy when the enemy came in and here they were encamped against Israel not they didn't belong there and they didn't belong in this world they were they had been God that land had been given to them listen it goes to show you something not only have you got a conquer you gotta fight to keep it hello somebody man the enemy is gonna come and try to keep that from you a man and do everything they kind of think he can to stop you that's what Shamgar found himself he was seed of Abraham he had title to the land God had given him that land he had the Word of God that's the title but he was living below his privileges and instead of being a brave man he was a coward out here a man and and and not facing the enemy and year after year it goes that way until his his his people if I could say it his churches starving and the children are pinched face and hungry and the devil is just running over them with cancers with disease with afflictions that sound familiar this is Sam God man and yet they had been given a word this is your lamb and he had been given a commission cast him out remember year after year after year he's putting up with it he would go and he would work and he would sow his seed only for the devil to come around and take away the increase and instead of the church increase in the church it's saying is falling away are you with me but you see it didn't stop there I mean one day there was an awakening hallelujah what everybody in Israel didn't awake what man awoke one man when they got angry that's the devil come on somebody one day one man got angry at the devil got mad that the Word of God that was given wasn't being fulfilled their privileges man he got angry cuz of cichlids he got angry cause it was no atmosphere the Holy Ghost for children to be born Creed he got angry about it and that day he didn't know what to take he just found the first thing he saw and that was a not school hallelujah an ox goad is is to go to church along the way and make him keep a-movin but it's time we quit using it on the church and use it on the devil [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] he would say it like was Samson brother branham would say destroy your enemy before he destroys you you don't look like a 65 boy could ever could ever do anything he's a little weakling got seven locks on his head showing there's been seven powers of God through seven Church ages and that's what empowers this is the word and he let the devil talk them in Delilah to talk him into going to sleep you never lay your head on that woman's lap she'll take away your power hey man she cut off his power hey man hey man you know he had that many victories he had taken many things that we could talk about this morning he could be without listen it didn't matter what it was in the hand of faith it's gonna talk huh so he's surrounded by a thousand Philistines and he doesn't have a weapon and he just finds one scripture that's all you need man yeah I mean yeah we got a whole arsenal full but you only shoot one area at a time a man to pick up an arrow pick up a word [Applause] it was a job boon of an ass man come on church hallelujah a man's a man he could look there babe he can look back there and he said you know if God could use a donkey one time to talk to a prophet God can use a donkey again and he grabbed at that jaw bone hallelujah was a new job bone the Bible said a new table bone of an ass man and he started using that thing and he sleep one for this team and he slayed another and he slayed another and he's laid another and it's laid another and he began to remember like that in my day he piled wheelchairs up and heaps he sent the pine could see that that's good here the could walk and canes and crutches and cut [Laughter] [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] there's a new crop growing there's new hair going on [Applause] got a generation of people [Applause] [Applause] please defeated the enemy damn home and people to beat it now [Applause] [Applause] unless you take your sword you can't possess it without taking the promise the promise is to you to your children to them that are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call the right a man so God in every age has had somebody that I believe him he's not gonna be left without a witness in this day he's not gonna get down the end and we'll all be just old cold dark they hold it seems he's guy that's gonna be a people of faith who can put faith into action who can believe God believe the testimony his word believe his word and you shall be established hallelujah we can look over here and we can we can also see and I was there some need some years some years ago now time gets away from me but I've been preaching on this 61 weeks 61 sermons trying to tell you about our land and I was in the Land of Israel and stood there and looked at the very place for David and Goliath fought their battle where Goliath could come running down out of a high heel you know with his massive weight his big shield his great spear his mighty sword he could come running down there and you know he was he by himself was a formidable army or adversary a mound he he by himself he comes out and makes his boast every day and we had a bunch of faithless people even brother Brandon would say yeah that he saw it in his generation he said he said I life has been going about in the land in preachers saying the days of miracles are past and there's no such thing as divine healing do you realize what this man had to go up against Oh generation of unbelief oh man you think he was lauded by the newspapers and by the preachers he wasn't he was rejected oh man they were ridiculed him they made fun of him but there his name in the paper they there are all kinds of things but he said the enemy Goliath has been going up the land up and down the country saying the days of miracles is past he says now I'm going out as a David with a little slingshot does somebody ever hear this of what faith hey man no oh David did you got five stones amen amen he says some say that he got five stones because he got one for Goliath and rest for his brothers Amen but he you know he he only he got in there brother Brandon said he would select them he selected those stones and he typed it out to the name of Jesus Jes yes right man so you reached out now why he listened he didn't get but to Jake before the devil was there on the ground [Applause] I'm talking about people you think you've got a quote the devil every scripture in the Bible just take one the Word of God will defeat the devil anywhere any place any time just take one word of course we live by every word but I've just one more to defeat him hallelujah so David would take and sling that stone let it go Giants fell a man we've seen that happen in our generation a man but after David there was other men the men of David that went out and found the rest of glass brothers you see any good enough to concent of profit and killed Goliath and then we got to get them all down every enemy we cannot be satisfied leaving one enemy in our promised land we must take it off but you see it is my friends that we do it and it's my faith and the Word of God that's how we possess it now all down to the ages we can look we can see rather if you want the greatest weapon there ever was and that's that tomb of Jesus because there he defeated death hell and the grave and I want you to know as his children today all your enemies is defeated cancer is defeated a man's sickness of all kinds is defeated generational curses is defeated is it anybody still with me doctrines of devils the Bible calls him doctrines of devils and seducing spirits but they're all defeated and at Calvary he defeated both sin I want you to know there's not a sin problem that you're dealing with this morning that he didn't defeat everyone I'm undefeated do you realize the devil don't have a legal right on you he does not have a claim on you you don't have a right to you he has not a right to your body he has not a right to your spirit he is not a right to your soul but you got a right and that's a casts him out and it won't happen until you get out of your lethargic ways and put your faith into action and say I defy that devil [Applause] because I'm going forth in the power of the Resurrection because Satan is defeated and I'm dealing with a defeated enemy sleep brother Tim he's a roaring lion yeah but like pilgrim on his way up or yeah pilgrim on his way up to journey as he as he goes up the journey and up the hill here's a here's a line that comes and opposes him and of course coward runs back men an impatient he goes to scattering and all these others of this company that was with him go so leaving him not talking about John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress a man then Christian no-go zone a man he's a little afraid to do it because you know but he wants to get to that celestial city and he realized God's been with me through all these other time i builded the dungeon of despair and however came that is fair you have to the devil's tried to lock you in the prison of discouragement of depression hey man remember Christian God kill got put in there let me just stop for a minute he got put in there because because you know he he wanted to take a shortcut and so he goes to the to the the the the small of despond it gets down in this valley you know and he's out of the will of God man have you ever been out of the will of God well you probably didn't travel very far if you hadn't and then all of us have been out of the will of God man we got in this permissive wheel instead of his perfect wheel but I Got News for You God ain't gonna leave you there hallelujah this God said you're gonna go all the way you might have gotten my permissibly oh but I'll work it around I get you back on the path again back to my perfect wheel again because you're unstoppable you're unsinkable he gets down in the slaw to spawn and what happens to him he gets there and gets caught by the giant of despair and while he's there he's locked into prison amen and every day the enemy comes won't feed him he just comes and beats him every day you know how it is when you're in despair the enemy comes every day and starts beating you and beat you and beating you you should have done this you said I listen here you shouldn't went this way you know you're not too good of a Christian you're hearing this hearing locked up here in this prison and here he gets day after days desperate and he's Franny shakes the bars he tries to locks he's got to figure out some way you know what he did when you walk in again I'll slip out only to be knocked back down again and finally one day he laid back down in his cell and his hand falls on something he was given when he started out on the journey and he reaches down there and he says it's a key it's the key of promise hallelujah and he says I wonder if it'll fit this lock and all of a sudden faith comes into them to start using a promise and he puts that promise in the door of that prison in the promise of God's Word [Applause] [Applause] perfect day but about 7,000 I'm layin right here take any of them the devil can't stop you he opened I can turned it and slipped out of that prison amen and escaped out of that dungeon on his journey and now he meets a line you see one time one time do you think you're
