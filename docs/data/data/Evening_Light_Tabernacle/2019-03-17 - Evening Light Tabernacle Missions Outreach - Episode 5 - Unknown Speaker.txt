========================================

hello everybody we're the ministry team at even in like tabernacle in Minden Louisiana a Bible believing Church and today we're here to proclaim once again that Jesus Christ is real he's the same yesterday today and forever a Living God they made one present for his people and we're happy that you joined us today for today's discussion and last week we ended on how do we receive the Holy Ghost and we went to the total prescription that Peter laid down one that cannot be tampered with it is the absolute prescription for the new birth and that is repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost and I think a viewer had a question and today we want to discuss that as we go into the true church and who she is this is the question that that was sent here it says if I have repented and been baptized does that mean I've also already received the Holy Ghost and so there is a question among people do they receive the Holy Ghost when they believe so in other words just by simple faith and making a profession of faith that is the Holy Ghost is that the common thought today it is but there's a there's a problem with that according to the scriptures because in acts 19 Paul passing through the upper coast of Ephesus finding certain disciples said have you received the Holy Ghost since you have believed yes and then he also says and after you believed you were sealed with that Holy Spirit of promise so you know it comes subsequent to believing not upon believing when you believe and you realize that Jesus Christ is the savior and you repent of your sins turning from them then you are a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Ghost that comes after believing in Christ so that begs a question for the people if they've repented are supposedly repented and been baptized and yet their life still doesn't manifest the Holy Ghost where is the issue well there's only one place it can be because if they were baptized correctly if they were about taps correctly in the name of Jesus Christ the only other step is repentance so there there had to be air somewhere in their repentance whereas it wasn't a a true repentance from the heart maybe they were sorry but there is a difference between being sorry and repenting Nathan even the Bible would say that Judas was sorry yes yeah there's an example of that in the scriptures in Acts chapter 8 Simon the sorcerer marveled at the miracles that was following Philip the Bible said that he was baptized but you find that Peter rebuked him and told him his heart was not right with them and there was an issue there because he thought that you could by the Holy Spirit and in that case he had not received it at that point because his heart was not right with God but if we genuinely repent and are baptized in Jesus Christ's name and are believing unto the promise of the Holy Spirit then the promise is sure we shall receive it God is obligated to amen amen so we were in our discussion on our last time about how that it wasn't so from the beginning and so that Jesus took us to the beginning yet as we have been talking there 41,000 different denominations and yet no man organize the Holy Ghost amen and yet there's hundreds of organized churches organized religion hundreds of different views and and ideas hundreds of churches seem like one on every corner and all claim to be right and this does not resemble the early church but what actually denomination does instead of making one body it causes division and causes great damage to the body of Christ because it it forms a set of doctrines and rules and regulations and then people become that by membership instead of my birth wave and Jesus said I am the vine and you are the branches so it's one vine but multiple branches and so if the church is a part of that one bond they should be putting forth the same branch that we've been speaking of in the book of Acts which is a true church bearing the same fruit bearing the same fruit well we find today's we got multiple branches or multiple vines and multiple branches yeah preserves offshoots every denomination well I think it's you know kind of parallel to lights an orange tree you can have a citrus tree and let's say it's original rootstock is orange and so it originally puts forth oranges that but then men come along and they graft on it other citrus varieties like lemon or grapefruit or or lime or some other varieties and now you have an orange tree that is not producing the oranges alone is producing all different kinds of varieties of citrus fruit and but if the tree the arms tree ever puts forth another branch it will write another book of Acts behind it it'll have the same fruits that the root had and I think this is it you know Jesus prayed a prayer and he said it prayed that we all might be one he said even father as I and the other one and so you know how was Jesus and the father one the the father that sent him came in here right and when we are truly one with God it's when Jesus comes into our life the Spirit of Jesus comes in us to do the same works that he does and and live the same type of life that he did and and that's where the new birth is so important if I'm if I'm birth of the same spirit that brother Craig's birth does then we'll both do the same works if we have the same fruit tree life like you spoke of in us if I put forth oranges and he puts forth grapefruits we don't have the same life within us which is when man began to substitute things like Creed's and church joining and just believing and things like that and substituted that for the new birth they did away with the commonality that Jesus was praying for that we would all be one we can't all be one if you go to a certain church that believes you just have to believe this doctrine but you go to a church that believes you just have to believe that doctrine automatically you've been separated you're not one and the commonality is they took away the genuine new birth that would make y'all have the same life and put forth the same fruits well you know they're trying to do that with a forced unity today you know with ecumenism and you know everybody lay down your differences and your different ideas or whatever and and you know everybody just you know love one another and must be the church to jesus said but really to be the church that jesus said we would have to come back to Bible teaching to Bible life to the life of Christ again and so it wouldn't be a forced unity like the Tower of Babel but it would be rather Christ in you the hope of glory living out of your life producing the same fruits that the life of Jesus did so the first the FIR Church when Jesus commanded or commissioned the church he said heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils and in the first church fulfilled that commission to the letter the very shadow of Peter healed the sick that was the emphasis that was the message of the church was to call them out of sin to to open the prison doors to heal the sick to proclaim the blood of Jesus Christ the good news how vastly different the message is today if the same life that was in Christ who healed the sick and raise the dead and cleanse the lepers was now in the church and they produced the same thing in the first church if we're the true church then we must produce what the first church produced then so we can judge by the pattern what is true and what is false so you know if he is the same then he would have the same attitude toward the sick the same attitude toward the loss the same attitude toward mercy and grace the same attitude toward his word man that that he had been because it would be the same Jesus his same attitude towards sin that's right same attitude towards sin absolutely so the denominations if Jesus his won't and his desire his prayer was that we'd be one and we see denominations that comes in and builds walls you know there's walls to keep their people to believe a certain thing we have to say denominations not of Christ as a man that's right yeah the very first thing that Pentecost achieved was it tore down the middle walls that separated and integrated it created a brotherhood his buddy and they had all things in common and they were one mind and one Accord the gospel that's right that's right build their own Kingdom when you find kingdom building and once again what you find is Babylon because it's a bunch of different voices causing confusion yeah and that's what you see and so we've changed the gospel today to prosperity or you know to feel good religion just easy believe ISM you know but when the Holy Spirit comes you really don't have to beg people to pray or beg them to worship God you don't are to do what's right they're just so in love with Jesus and I think that's the whole thing it's when the love of God the Holy Ghost comes in a person's life it produces a love for God a love for his work a love to go to church absolutely just love to go to church I love to worship God and nobody it's not a forceful religious act that's right exactly absolutely I think the scripture is very clear back to what we were talking about there about a unity and how denomination doesn't create that unity that unity can only come by the Holy Spirit and it says in the scriptures in 1st Corinthians 1 in 10 it says now I beseech you brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment and this is not possible under a system of man right only the Holy Ghost could it can't be legislated only the Holy Ghost that's absolutely and it wasn't the mind of Paul or the mind of Peter that's the same mind was the same Jesus it was a kingdom Beldon of some personality cult it was absolutely the mind of Christ came in to them and they were of the same mind this is why the Bible said in acts 1:14 and they continued all with one Accord in prayer and supplication now I just ask the question how did y'all get a bunch of juice together in one Accord yeah I mean a hundred and twenty people and you have a hundred and twenty different opinions but they had one thing in mind right one thing in mind and that was in Luke 24:49 behold I send the promise of my father upon you may but tell you in the city of Jerusalem until you're in dude with powerful and I think if that becomes the cry of the church gel in DUIs with that powerful huh because he said that's one innate you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and so that's what really makes the true oneness and makes us one is when you receive the spirit obviously the spirit then we're one mine and and you know even though we still may have difference a little difference opinions and then our own individual personalities yet we all have one standard and that's the Word of God and it has the preeminence and each one of our lives and even when we have a different idea we have to say humble down to the Word of God this is what the word says and it begins to manifest itself out when we all have the same goal just like on the after the day of Pentecost they didn't go forward and sit down and discuss and say well what program can we implement to begin to get people to come in they went forth in power and demonstration because they were in one mind and one Accord to lift up the kingdom of God and to tear Satan's Kingdom down and that became their passion that became their focus and the works followed just as the word promised that it would j-man well that's that's what is so mysterious when when people view even our church and what God is doing among us and they see young people sitting on the front row they're not mandated they're not told to do that but there they are entered into worship and I don't mean one or two I mean you know 30 40 50 young people sitting there worshiping God little from from 11 12 15 18 25 year old people as well as adults and they're people that are on fire for God and worshiping God with all of their heart and dis amazes people but but because somehow they have lost the attraction right and they think entertainment some program so what program are you doing it well I just tell you what we're doing I'll let the world know our secret we're giving them all pills yeah and the pill were given is the gospel yes wouldn't get the gospel of Jesus Christ and the life of the blood in them yes oh it makes them love them love his word yeah we've had people ask us well we see your youth group that's so what what do you do to keep them and how we know young people don't even hardly come to our church anymore and and if they do is because mom or dad drug what are you doing special and what it is is like you said you're preaching the word and they're seeing it in power in demonstration is not just word and so it is it it still has its attraction yes because they see it's a Living God that there is a real God a real power and it's changed their lives modern thinking is that the young people won't respond to these ancient teachings and the Bible and the old traditional ways that the people just won't respond but that wasn't so with the first church the first church he said I write unto you father's because you have known him that is from the beginning I write unto you young men because you have overcome the wicked one I write unto you little children because you have known the father I have written unto you father's because you have known him that is from the beginning I've written unto you young men because you are strong and the Word of God abideth in you and you have overcome the wicked one amen so if that was in the first church we're sure seeing that today to love for the word I think the whole key of that is you know is that you're known you're known you're none of the fireman you you know God all of these things and I think that is the attraction it's coming to know the Living God in the power of his resurrection instead of you're trying to entertain these kids get them filled with the pain man amen because you know it's not to us just an ancient truth that God it's lifting him up out of history and bringing him in a present day showing that Jesus Christ is the same there's the word power there when it speaks so you shall receive power that word power is Dunamis yeah I love the definition says the power residing in a thing by virtue of its nature so the power that's residing in us by the virtue of the nature which is a nature of Christ well in the word Dunamis is where we get the word dynamite exactly this explosive wherever they go you know they're shaking the world example let's say they've been with Jesus Oh hallelujah that's what we want we could never receive the Holy Spirit without the word pattern because because the Bible said he gave the Holy Ghost to them that obey him right and that is God's provided pathway to receiving life it's his provided approach is his word yeah so it as we sum up this session today you know and acts 2:22 it would say ye men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth a man approved which means authenticated approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs which God did by him in the midst of you so if that was what the head would be wouldn't the body be the same Amen so of people that a church that is approved of God authenticated they moved of God by miracles by wonders and signs which God does in the midst of us alone as Jesus Christ is shown to the world to be the same yesterday today forever that God who still heals deliverance a made man amen and he not only saves but he keeps that's right as we see you're sealed unto the day of redemption yea into their bodies and James right amen thank you for joining the
