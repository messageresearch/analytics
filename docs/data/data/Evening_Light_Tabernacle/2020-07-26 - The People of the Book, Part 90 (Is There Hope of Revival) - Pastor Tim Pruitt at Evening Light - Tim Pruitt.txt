karen with us i want to thank you for the wonderful welcome you gave her home the other day i know there were many of you that missed out on that would have loved to have been there and god god knows your heart and i know your heart too amen but god bless you so so appreciated that and it meant a lot to us i guess he has probably watched that 20 30 times since she's been home so of the 10 000 k's she's put her on her own in there that people that have watched that and and uh rejoice with us and people around the world are right in there and rejoicing with us and expressing that that faith has been put in their heart because of things like this that god is answering prayer and moving on the behalf of his children so it's never in vain amen we're never going to waste a sickness it's an opportunity for god to heal [Applause] amen we're going to see god come on the scene on the behalf of his children amen praise god we thank god for this opportunity to come and worship him today and be in the presence of the lord i want to welcome the herrings today god bless you they have just informed one of the deacons they have moved here close by and we'll be attending church here we want to welcome them raise your hands up so everybody can see you back there god bless you thank you for being here today amen each one of you that are here we got another guest brother glenn westerfield that is here and uh this is tequila over there from alabama and uh different ones that are here if you're a visitor here and i miss you well jesus didn't he saw you amen just wave your flag high and god to see you amen god bless you mom joel chapter 2 and verse 23 we want to read together this morning be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will come down for you the rain to form a rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floors shall be full of wheat and the fats shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the canker worm and the caterpillar and the palma worm my great army which i sent among you and you shall eat and plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the lord your god that it dealt wondrously with you and this is wonderful here my people will never be ashamed and you shall know that i'm in the midst of israel how many spiritual israel this morning there's a natural one that god deals with but there's also spiritual israel and ye and that i am the lord your god and none else and my people shall never be ashamed and he repeats that again giving you a double confirmation he's not going to leave you holding the bag he never going to let you down you can trust him amen and come to pass afterwards that i will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions upon their servants also upon the servants upon the handmaids in those days will i pour out my spirit and i will show wonders in the heavens and in the earth's blood fire and fire and pillars of smoke the sun shall be turned into darkness the moon and the blood before the great and terrible day of the lord come and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call on the name of the lord shall be delivered for in mount zion and jerusalem shall be delivered as the lord has said and the remnant whom the lord shall call god bless you you can be seated i am going to speak today on a little subject and to be quite honest with you i'm you know going to take my time into this and probably have to do another part to this so this will be part one of this at least um we will try that if the lord will will inspire us that way but um i want to speak today on is there hope of revival is there hope of revival i read in 1963 in this report it's in the fall of the year way after the seals have been preached and brother branham talks about the church is ready she's sealed in ready to come there will be a great outpouring of the spirit yes sir to grab that church and take her into the skies exactly because we see the church the word the bride in christ his ministry is in his bride which is body the supernatural bodies the spiritual body of his on the earth his spirit is living his life right out until him and the church becomes one in the wedding see they become one and again you know brother branham also speaks of this and what shall we do with jesus called christ this is in phoenix a 64 sermon he says listen we say about satan's big machine up there ready to move that's right to crush down but remember god's little flock that believes the word its mechanics is ready too it's ready for the dynamics to set it a fire with the holy ghost if you're not little flock it's your father's good will to give you the kingdom the holy ghost will strike a little church that's come out from the world women that wears long hair nazarite to prove they separated themself um themselves from the world again in the is your life where the gospel he talks about how that the the table was ready for the for the wedding and the invitation was given and he made three different calls and and he said that there was still room to spare because there were so many that made excuses and he says there's still room and he says i believe that maybe within the next few months or something a year or whatever it is god's going to send another shaking across the country for somebody out there somewhere that's a predestinated seed that the light has to fall on somewhere somewhere in the world the nation itself is gone now as we explained to you last sunday that that we have been given a promise to be taken back to the original pentecost this was the job of the elijah prophet he was to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers so as he said um bring us back to pentecost not hollywood showmanship but a wholehearted turn to god is what we need once more lord once more and so it's another pentecost and again we emphasize not another azusa street but another book of acts not another book of corinthians now the bride of course at the beginning is the bride at the end as brother branham saw her in the vision and he said she's alpha and omega and of course um this restoration is promised that god will take this church right back to the pentecost of the beginning now this is different from azusa street the azusa street revival now has over 500 million that's a half a billion followers and brother branham predicted the shape that she would be in as it moved or toward the charismatic movement and listen to what he has to say in the laodicean churches he said then there's all this talk about the glossolalia that is speaking in tongues it is supposed to be the evidence of the baptism of the holy ghost and people are thinking that we are in the midst of a great revival and he says the revival is over america had her last chance in 1957 and now the tongues are the sign of god's impending disaster even as they were when they appeared upon the wall at belshazzar this feast don't you know there are many going to say in the coming the last day and said lord lord have we not done many wonderful works in thy name even the cast out devils and he'll say to to them depart from me that we that work iniquity i never knew you so now again as he as he said this phenomena that that we see in the outbreak of speaking in tongues and he identified that not as a sign of life but the sign of the end the end of a of god dealing with a denominational system and and if you notice here that it is um it is a sign not of life but a sign of death that god is bringing about an end just as he said the the handwriting on the wall was a sign that god was fixing to bring judgment and and so a judgment he has done because he has he has judged the the horror and her daughters and he's called out a people for his namesake that is a judgment now jesus said these are workers of iniquity you get a man can come up and pray for the sick get oil and blood appearing in the congregation prophecy coming forth all manner of the supernatural and people gather around him and swear he is the lord even though he's actually making a money racket of religion and living in sin how many have seen that that identifies the charismatic movement the only answer that they have is an absolutely unbiblical one well to get results they must be of god how terrible how actually poor this age is in the spirit of god and the poor poverty stricken ones don't even know it but i want you to know in contrast to that there is a bride that is standing on her feet amen as a mighty invincible army we've all heard the prophets say it and we're reminded we remind you very often that satan knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works that she will be an invincible army she gets a revelation of the two spirits that's working in the framework of the church and remember get that revelation and hold on to it amen and god's by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit then satan will be powerless before her now so as i said we're not looking for another divine healing movement as brother branham said it was never god's will to do that he said god wanted divine healing in every church amen now so again um but he he said about the divine healing movement it's dead and it will never resurrect now he cautioned us he said now your pentecostals you want to believe that there's going to come a time that you'll get this power and you'll go forth and empty out all the hospitals and so forth he said i want you to know that's a lie it was never done and it never will be done amen he said jesus went and found one man at the pool but that's how he prayed for him raised him up and he left the rest of them laying there right so we want to have the right expectations for revival amen now now sometimes we want to just stop a moment and remember what that divine healing movement and that revival was like brother branham describes this after coming back to beaumont texas after 20 years before being there and he was there with raymond ritchie and f.f bosworth and other brothers and he says i still believe the same gospel i hadn't changed a bit um it's just the same thing but you see the revival was going on then and where there's no revival you just can't get things done and he said the ministry is more far more advanced because god was discerning the thoughts and intense the heart amen showing the sign of the messiah and and he says but um the revival is not on he said just your presence to walk in with the people what people would get up out of cots and stretchers and walk around you just lay hands upon them and my that just sent them whirling i've seen lines where four or five hundred people come through the lines deaf dumb blind cross side not one of them would fail but what was healed every one of them but try today see there's no fire in rome when the fires went out of the temple at vista the the people went home now there's no revival to back it up see that's just it and after a while if the world stands they will start living in the glare again now glare is a reflection or a mirage or are just a memory of the past and brother branham said this is the problem people live in a glare and and a reflection of something that was but no longer is so again he said they will start living in a glare now listen we as message believers must be careful that we ourselves don't live in the in a glare of the past god's in a mighty revival he sent a prophet of god amen but we cannot live in that day we're living in another day is that right amen sure i mean the message still goes on the prophet still is effective i'm not saying that i'm saying that we we are now in a in another time we're at the very end just before the trumpet sounds amen and he said after a while if the world stands he'll start living in the glare again that's the way it always done passed over and missed them that generation is to be judged for what passed over them they failed to see it jesus christ is alive this afternoon he's walking around here with us now he's ever present wherever two or three are symbol in my name i'm in their midst believe that won't you but you see when there's no atmosphere and when there's no faith and when there's no believing when there's not a believing atmosphere you cannot you cannot tap in to christ being in our midst again calling jesus on the scenes and denim spring he went over into louisiana and he reminisced on being there and he says he said now we've just witnessed one of the greatest revivals i believe the world's ever seen in the last 10 15 years a revival not just like the days of billy sunday or the welsh revival or the wesleyan revival or moody revival or billy sunday revival it's been a worldwide sweeping affair around the world great healing service great revival fires is burnt on practically every hill that's in the world right now way over in the lands of africa down in china japan this gospel is being preached and people are being healed right this very minute around and around the world it's been one of the greatest revival because i believe it's one of the last revivals that this world will see a world world sweeping revival amen but he said now i he said but in the last few years it's quietened down and you don't notice the enthusiasm in the people that used to be i remember having the privilege by the holy spirit to spearhead that revival that started when the angel of the lord appeared on the river and said that many years ago and to see it happen and see ministers hearts of fire everywhere revivals broke out why you could just simply walk in the building people get right up off their cops and stretchers and walk away healed you didn't even have to say a word just be in there that's all it taken i remember one night in vandalia illinois i walked in the meeting had no longer been in a meeting more than over five minutes and there wasn't a feeble person around the place anywhere wheelchairs pushed out piled up blind was seeing death and dumb speaking and simply yet the spirit of the lord was present and he just healed the whole group of them now that's when you can do something when the revival is going but let the revival fire die down then you can hardly the people are still christians but they're not revived into that spirit that great atmosphere that does something it's like just in a forge in the blacksmith shop you got the red hot iron before you go to get the iron hot before you go to pounding on the anvil if you don't you'll never straighten it out and that's what it takes to have a revival is everyone under the heat of this holy spirit that's brought down the powers of god and a revival moving then there's prayer meetings going day and night and every minute everywhere while the people won't even leave the grounds now again you know this described very well the things that was happening the great revival the buildings packed out the the many that was under expectation the thousands that were healed and delivered but i want to ask you something did the divine healing move bring the promised rapture hey man don't hang up on me i asked a serious question did it produce did it bring the promised rapture no you know what it did it built and made bigger denominations amen now so you see brother branham even said i sent three quarters of a million of my children to the assembly of god and others went to oneness and full gospel people who were who were in his divine healing movements and saw god real and they just went and joined the church and paul a prisoner brother branham explains this as he looks back over it and sees the effect of a divine healing movement now i'm trying to get something to you because our goal is not just to have another divine healing movement our goal is not to be all of us be little william branham's out here and all of us with the gift of god and all of us doing miracles and signs and wonders which is what the charismatic say is going to happen they'll point back to william branham and said we're all going to be that and it's the wrong expectation i want to focus on something for a moment i want you to realize that our next our next great move of god is where we're at right now produces a rapture and that's our goal our goal is not a bigger church our goal is not attracting as i said last sunday bugs to the light bulb our goal is to to to get ready for the coming of the lord jesus and to see that he's real and a living god among us and as he's god he's a healer he's a deliverer he's a need supplier and us to have that enthusiasm and that expectancy that we should have for the coming of the lord and prepare ourselves for his coming and paul a prisoner brother branham types himself with moses he said moses he took him out in the desert kept him there 40 years and stripped him of all his theology and ambition and i think sometimes that kind of types us we come down to the times where we've had a stripping time or what a time he could look back and see his failure and tonight we ought to do the same thing when we see our ambition look at the healing campaign and see if the lord did something a few years ago to start restoring healing to the sick and so forth and everybody every organization is because it didn't come to their organization they had to get them a healer and what have we done just look at it a moment we've done the same thing that moses did we went out and tried so hard to manufacture some kind of miracle i smelt a disease i've got a blood in my hand when manufactured miracle and what have we got some of the men in such hard strings that broke up and became regular drunkards and neurotics and got their mind and they switched all the way back the order from the pentecostal objective back to making organizations again building a kingdom now and what do you have it's true some of their main main ones died of drunk a.a allen guided drunk oh yeah he had miracles man just wrote us the other day and said i was there when um you know leroy jenkins who later became a healing evangelist of his own you know again that that was um that was questionable in his life but he had stitches on his arms and he watched there as um a allen prayed for him and the stitches popped and the and the the whole arm was healed and completely healed up a miracle right before him all but he died of drunk what good does it do to have divine healing and not have a life [Applause] you know the first thing we want to see captain to make sure we've got a life [Applause] amen because there's going to be many coming that day and saying did not do miracles didn't i cast out devils didn't i do all of these things in thy name and he said you're workers of iniquity you did things and knowing better than to do them you kept right on living the way you were living and he said what have we done we slew about one egyptian that's right we tried and we strained we paid we labored we go all night in prayer meetings till we had no voice trying to manufacture something sweep up something all these type of thing and find it a total failure we need a going back to the desert she says yes sir camp meetings and struggles why not just give up that's what you ought to do just go go back and give up the we've done the same thing that moses did it doesn't do any good after 40 years he found himself a prisoner to the word of god and i hope after all this time we've become a people that's a prisoner to the word we're chained to that word we're not going to deviate one bit come on but we're going to stay focused on the word of god the message of the hour again he continues this when the great blessing come out the manifestations of these great things that god told us about how we must be born again how we receive the holy ghost the baptism in the name of jesus and all of these things you see the people instead of state of that word and harness to it what they do they start their own denominational theory which had already failed and tried to manufacture something that looked like the truth and what we got tonight but a nation full of organized people who deny the scriptures of god who would call the life of the holy spirit say that it's a mental telepathy who would refuse to refuse such to come in their church and they wouldn't permit you to mention one word of serpency although it's all through the bible eternal security although it's all through the bible and the things the holy spirit has revealed and proved to be the word and i may challenge after challenge to come and prove me wrong what are they got same thing that luther had the rest of them slew an egyptian what was it maybe he made some man stop stealing well that's pretty good make a good citizen out of a guy where he quit stealing quits going to jail for it that's pretty nice isn't it amen or maybe make a man live true to his wife probably after he found his third one and finally decided well i better settle down we're talking about denominational christians but what you make out of him a church member come and join our group again we don't want church members we want people to be filled with the holy ghost [Applause] is that right amen we want the power of the almighty god that comes and changes lives not build a kingdom there again and pray in a prisoner paul a prisoner he says that stinking dead man was the only thing he'll point his finger to of his success of 40 years of training you know you remember you know here he here he tried and tried and trained and was told he was a deliverer and everything and he tried to deliver israel on his own and he killed an egyptian he didn't deliver israel he didn't produce an exodus a rapture come on and all he did was had a stinking dead egyptian one egyptian and this is what he said 40 years of training a stinking egyptian laying there rotten and dead and that's the way it is tonight the only thing we can point to to this revival that is crossed over is a stinking bunch of church members that knows no more about god than a hot and talk would know about an egyptian night right they would tell them about the word of god and they said i don't believe that i don't care what they say i don't believe it see it's an awful thing to have to point back to for all the strains and struggles and everything we got maybe we could point to a big school which that's what roberts did build to school that's what gordon lindsay did built to school amen this is what they were all they all did they went to went and built seminaries so they could teach divine healing and so they could teach the baptism of the holy ghost and teach these things and he says it's dead we can point to an organization but it's dead it's thinking it's just like the first thing that we pulled out of like a hog going back to his swallow adopt his vomit when we return back one dead egyptian so he looks back over the divine healing movement and he says that's what it produced now again come on we don't want just what that produced we want to see a rapture we want to see people's lives changed now living right talking right come on treating their neighbor right being a real christian sons and daughters of god on fire for god amen so again what would another divine healing meet and produce or revival produce same thing what about america will she ever have another revival what we hear them praying all over the nation god's in america revival that the people oh you know will will humble themselves and and call on the lord and whatever humble themselves and pray out here from heaven and heal their land we hear them over and over and over and over a revival in america we had jerry falwell for years that was proclaiming we had a moral majority it's not there i say it again it's not there [Applause] what we've got is a bunch of hoodlums and people don't believe in god anymore and a godless society come on and even our churches being led by by a homosexual agenda the methodist church the leadership has now become a lgbt movement amen we're a godless nation and we have turned from a lamb to a dragon america is a beast that devours and you can see the hatred that is building up in her there's a radical element in this country and i don't want to mean to get into politics but i'm going to deal with some of this a little bit you just bear with me for a bit amen because a lot of people have the wrong expectations say god bless america god's not going to bless america america's damned america is cursed america is going to hell she will burn with fire the bible says so come on now amen you find your revelation 13. hey man she is a godless country i know a lot of people have hope in this last trump it ain't the last trump it's just a somebody blowing their nose come on there's no hope in any of this you have one hope and that's to leave from here one hope that's the coming of the lord jesus we are on the verge of the tribulation you see the spirits of insanity that has been loosed as they give their mind to the beast [Applause] this is not conspiracy theories this is the word of god revelation 13 15 and he had power to give life to the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and causes many that would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he calls all both small and great and rich and poor and free and bond to receive a mark in their hand or in their forehead and that no man might have a right might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name amen so there is a beast that rose up that was rome there was one to come that was out of the sea there was one raised up out of the land that was america a place where that there were no people the other is sea which is multitudes nations people that was wrong then you have america america is the main player in this last age and she's a beast and then she starts out with freedom of religion she ends at speaking like the dragon amen now you can be patriotic as you want to you can show your american flags you can pledge allegiance you do whatever you want to i can't pledge allegiance to that thing she slaughters the unborn amen come on by the millions her laws are injustice amen we're rotten to the core in both sides of politics there is no hope no matter if you vote your your vote is contaminated and you know it and i still vote but i still know that it ain't gonna count because somebody's gonna go and drag up something that ain't that that ain't even that ain't even right it can't be trusted she's a beast i'm just telling you this because some of you want to get on the bandwagon you want to get on the bandwagon you want to oh oh god bless america you want to get on the bandwagon of of something that is going on the black lives movement it's a social injustice we'll get on the bandwagon now listen the image to the beast rises out of the land of america let me define it it is an ecumenical spirit that says we are all one and social justice for all and you and you will accept the homosexual their agenda or they will force you out of business come on now they will force you out of business it is a spirit of lawlessness [Music] [Applause] the bible tells you so that in the last day that the man of sin a spirit of lawlessness will rule it's a spirit of rebellion and it's there and it's anointing men and women and boys and girls of youth who are all screaming out for their rights because it's laodicea and laodicea means people's rights and everybody wants their rights and bless all my black friends bless your hearts martin luther king's rose up and he he he paraded throughout the country there asking for for justice and he won a lot of good things but guess who's now riding on the back of the civil rights movement is lgbt perversion wanting their civil rights the feminist movement is writing on their back the athifa is writing on their back every kind of antichrist every kind of ugly spirit every spirit of rebellion is writing on the back [Applause] you will accept the homosexuals in their agenda or they will force you out of business you'll bake their cake for their wedding or you will pay the price amen they will mar you on social media that will put you out of business they'll make you lose your job you cannot buy or sell [Applause] without their permission and without their blessing we're coming right down to the marketing of the beast they're not the marking of the beast i'm just saying it is the spirit of the antichrist is alive and well and it's working in america and in the world [Music] and if you think it's just a black lives movement it's not it is more than that it actually goes to why what do you think of england goes over there and they will start pulling down statues and riot in their streets because it is a one world thing trying to bring the world under one world order and disrupt the democracies and capitalism and whatever and turn it over into socialism and marxism [Applause] cancel culture refers to the popular practice of withdrawing support over cancelling public figures and companies after they've done said or after they have done or said something considered objectionable or offensible you know kent's cancer culture is generally discussed as being performed on sodium social media in the form of group shaming and if you don't accept sin you are ashamed you don't accept their agenda you are ashamed brother branham speaking of this on the mark of the beast he said don't you believe they'll tattoo a number in your head or tattoo something in your hand don't you look for that it'll be a boycott amen no man could buy or sell unless he belongs to confederation of churches that's true that'll come like a union unionizing the thing bringing it down unionized religion you see it's an economical spirit [Music] [Applause] mark my word he said it ain't far off and you'll see it she's right around the corner and we're here [Applause] why am i preaching this so that you can become an activist no so you can get ready to leave here because the next revival the thing that god is doing is pouring out his spirit for a rapture [Applause] the saturn church age brother branham says lord help us to be ready to stand now the time is closing in we see the two horned beasts rise up by the earth not out of thickness and multitudes of people with horns like a lamb but it's fake like the dragon we believe that hour is close at hand now father when when these churches is confederating themselves together making an image to the beast it'll be a terrible on that group lord that won't join them the very boycott will come but in that out you promised to take your church [Applause] amen take a look at what's happening in that hour you promised to take your church hallelujah before one drop of water fell noah was in the ark before one the fires could strike sodom love was gone amen father we believe before the atomic powers ever blow this earth to pieces the church will be gone i'm so glad lord and we know that bombs are hanging in the hangars tonight yeah they're in korea they're in russia they're in china and they're working on them in in iran and everywhere else and we can look to the word heaven and we can see the son of man rising from his throne how many can look toward heaven if you look toward heaven listen this is what he said look up when you see these things can the best look up your redemption is going now and when we see look toward heavens and we see the son of man rising from the throne to start toward the earth for the rapture of his church and know that his precious feet won't touch the sinful earth at his time for his rebecca rode the camel and jumped off the camel right between the house of abraham out in the field she met the bride oh god the church will meet our bridegroom in the air for we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder them that are asleep the trumpet of god shall sound and the dead in christ shall rise first and we should be caught up together to meet with them and we eat the lord in the field in the air and be forever with him [Music] what a promise to look at now brother branham talks about the the consequences the consequences of missing the revival and is your life is worthy he talks about russell if they had accepted the pentecostal blessing 75 years ago that must have been in 1800s when the holy ghost fell in russia there wouldn't be communists today now god was come among them they had great revivals into siberia and what they do they rejected it and today that country is gone and the churches can't have church only under permission and they're doomed under judgment and even right now they have outlawed many of the messages of william branham but it's too late [Music] it's already got in there was a time where men risked their lives brother had biscuit among them you know would risk their lives go into the communist country smuggling books men would take them and hide them in their head lamps and whatever their cars and little secret pockets and get books over there and there and then god opened the doors and it flooded the country guess what happened israel the jews got out of there back to their homeland and now the doors are shedding again amen the same thing with china god sent john lay over into china burdened up on his heart little man who knew nothing about it and they had never done that kind of work but had a burden and began to take bibles there began to share the gospel begin to prove begin to to tell what god had done in our generation now they're all over all over china they've arrested some of them and put them in jail they're in jail today but you can't stop the word it's still going on let me tell the chinese government it's too late the message already got through hallelujah amen here we're at one of the last strongholds there of satan over in japan and here we've seen god move in a miraculous way citizen preachers today again of the congregation and showing there the people meeting together and hungry hearts some of them coming out of the upc and other religious organizations and embracing the message of the hour amen they wanted a japanese group but it's international because you see it's a bride out of the out of every kindred tongue and nation is not just japan this is not an american thing or japanese thing hey man it's a bride out of every nation [Music] thing and it's too late we're just now finishing up the all of the principal sermons in 1965 this little church sending out a man's translating the messages into the japanese language and it's too late for the devil to stop it [Music] let me tell him that he didn't have enough he didn't have enough for japan he didn't have enough for china he didn't have enough for russia and he ain't got enough for you right here today he cannot hold back your revival he cannot keep the spirit of god away from you he cannot keep the anointing from coming down he doesn't have enough he couldn't keep this sister carrying the basketball he couldn't keep her sick in the hospital because he didn't have enough hallelujah he can't keep brother wrong down he's preaching this morning because the devil don't have enough hallelujah god bless you you can have your seats praise the lord it's still to come now 50 years ago he said the holy ghost fell in england after that king george jeffries ff bosworth charles price smith wigglesworth those great warriors of faith 50 years ago and offered england the holy ghost revival now this 1963 and 50 years ago would have been 1913. but what did they do they laughed at them they put them in jail they called them crazy they thought they lost their mind the churches refused the people to come to hear them they healed the sick cast out devils done great work and because that england as a nation rejected the gospel her sins is known throughout the world and there's hardly more of an apostate nation in all the world including rome and france than england she's a mother of apostasy right where finney and many of the great men preached in the hey market and charles g finney and wesley and on down she turned it down and then he talked about the scandal that had just come out there and showing the the their great men weakened to the sex of women and disgraceful things because she rejected the truth then it comes to america america 15 years ago when the great divine healing or great healing revival continued on from pentecost broke out in the nations there was revivals on the capitol in washington dc i've been by there right there right down the street from the from the capitol itself there in uh in the auditorium you remember it timothy the the auditorium right there where deep collar to the deep still there and and um and and he said there was revivals on the capitol uh washington dc that presidents vice presidents great people governors great things like like that taking place men were healed like congressmen up been a crippled for 66 years and they could not turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before them but they turned it down and that's the reason this nation stays she's doomed there's no hope for it she's crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's elected in what she has here to control the nation and she's rotten to the core her politics is rotten her morals of this nation is lower than anything i can think of her religious system is rotten her than the morals she becomes in doing this she has now joined herself all these churches in the nation to the federation of churches and has taken the mark of the beast what a thing christ why christ gave them the opportunity come to my feast the feasts of pentecost which means 50. when the holy spirit poured out on russia they were called to pentecost feasts of pentecost spiritual feasts they turned it down england the holy ghost poured out upon them they turned it down america holy ghost was poured out upon them they turned it down and when god sends the holy ghost and knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometimes he's going to turn it down for the last time amen you can sit in the church and listen to the gospel and agree with the gospel but you're not going to be a privileged person anymore you might do as much to say i know it's right i never put a can but never put a finger on it to help yourself you just listen to it because you say i believe it's right and you're just sympathizing with it i could say i believe there's 10 that's 10 dollars but that don't mean i got it i could say that's good cold water but refuse to drink it you know what i mean and this is eternal life and refuse to do it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy amen then you won't have the privilege to come and receive it and we're right there close in fact of the matter is you may not even have the privilege to wait that long you could cross it today amen i remember the day when i was in europe laying there at night and woken up waking up by a voice that was speaking to me and saying that denise was having her last call i remember what happened i remembered that i was the messenger i remember going to her and telling her that and i also remember the lord coming and saving her and she's lived a different life ever since [Music] because our god is rich in mercy [Music] sometimes he'll let you come right down to the line to snatch you right away from it don't give up on your loved ones yet but let me let me give a warning now those who do not become a part of this last day bride revival will go through the tribulation the super sign brother branham says he refers back he said what i said about five years ago this this um with this year the united states will accept the gospel or they'll never do it they've declined since that time there will never be a bigger revival in america no more like that if you believe me i'll be a prophet you believe you remember that's the word the lord just watch and see if it isn't dying and it kills me inside of me to know that men and women that i love better all my life that i give my life and what we need today is rooting out we may not we may root out too late now the hour maybe be passed we may never have another revival i know you're looking for it in the scripture but i don't see it in the scripture i look for a rapture for just a handful of people that's right just a handful of people they'll never be missed in the world and when they go you'll never know it's going it'll come like a thief in the night brother branham talks about this in the in again and i'm just going to share one more quote and we'll go on trying to do god of service america they say god bless america it's a nation it's a christian country it's a million miles from being a christian country i don't even pray for it how can i pray for it and it won't repent under the mighty powers that god demonstrated before denying and closing the doors to it and walking away i committed to god and she's going further away and now she's going to sink and we're here in the very sinking of america and i want you to stop a minute and forgive me for going down this path just a minute but again you know sometimes we see our young people they they get caught up in things and you know in movements and things and because it sounds good sounds like the end thing to do but i want you to look at the black lives movement which is nothing but a sodom movement you say well they're for social justice they are not they are a marxist group that wants to tear down america and his christian values they are against christianity they are an lgbt movement now i'm just gonna read it from their own website this is not this is not from hearsay this is what i copied right off of the black lives movement website of what they stand for we see ourselves as a part of the global black family we are aware of the different ways we are impacted or privileged as black people who exist in different parts of the world see it's a world wide thing we are guided by the fact that all lives all black lives matter regardless of actual or perceived sexual identity gender identity gender expression economic status ability disability religious beliefs disbeliefs immigration status or location we make space for transgender brothers and sisters to participate and lead we are self-reflective and do the work um to require to dismantle cisgender privilege and uplift black trans folk especially black trans women who continue to be disappoint personally impacted by trans antagonistic violence we build a space that affirms black women and is free from sexism misogyny and environments in which men are centered we practice empathy we engage comrades in the intent to learn about and connect with their context we make spaces make our spaces family friendly and enable parents to fully participate with their children we dismantle the patriot articles practice that requires mothers to work double shifts so they can leather in private even though they participate in public justice work we disrupt the western prescribed nuclear family you know what that is one male a man and a woman we disrupt the western prescribed nuclear family which consists of a man and a woman requirement by supporting each other is extended family and villages that collectively care for one another especially our children to the degrees that mothers parents and children are comfortable we we foster a queer affirming network when we gather we do so with the intention of freeing ourselves from the tight grip of heteronorma normative thinking or rather the belief that all in the world are heterosexual unless he or she or they disclose otherwise so what are you are seeing across america is sodomites oh no they're not they're not just black people they're white people too of all kinds gathered down there rioting in the streets tearing down defacing monuments erasing history [Applause] amen saying you know you know there's sodomites banging at the door of lot and they're banging on the door of christians in america and they're out to destroy the american life of christianity and it will and there we are an endangered species as christians and they are doing it as they did in the days of lot who made you to be a judge over us you have no right to judge us you can't call sin sin wrong rum if you do you will pay the penalty and they're demanding oh my if you read the book of genesis what happened there at sodom they demanded to have sex to pervert to desecrate angels and now even jesus christ to pervert him i got something to say about that because many many will reject jesus because he was a white man that's a lie jesus was not a white man neither was he a black man jesus was the god-man [Applause] he was the only begotten mean he is one of a kind there is none other like him and everyone that is born of jesus is neither black nor white or hispanic or native american but they too are god men and women born of the holy spirit washed by the blood and they have one vision and one faith and that is to be a part of the pride and leave from here thinking man's filter brother branham said o united states united states oh he says you're blindly old to see how god would have given you a revival but now your time has come it's too late now how you laughed and made fun of the people that god sent you but now your time has come o united states united states how that god would have hovered you as a hymn desert brood but you would not now this voice is going from coast to coast from north to south and from east to west how god would have ever over hovered you but you would not now your time is come nations are breaking the world's fallen apart 1500 mile chunk of it 300 or 400 miles wide will sink and maybe 40 miles down the great falls out you under one of these days waves shoot plum to the strait of kentucky when it does it'll shake the world so hard that everything on top of it will shake down don't forget there's a great earthquake at the resurrection oh hide me in the rock of angels god let me let me breathe upon me lord spirit of the living god breathe on me let me take god's filter and live under that lord let me breathe the fresh air of the holy ghost of my lungs and my soul every day that i'll sin not against you oh lord breathe on me holy spirit breathe on me we're a nation under judgment but hallelujah we're going to escape he'll snatch us out just in time it's an eagle anointing now brother branham told us very clearly that what is happening in the in our time he said the pentecostals had the wrong expectations and there's many in the message today are that you know said around the borders of the message they're still pentecostal in their thinking of what a revival is going to be what the next great move of god now i'm not going to be able to get into all today but i am going to deal on what the pentecostals are looking for in the message shalom he says there's gross darkness there's among the churches things today that fail to see the light that's shining there seems to be such a heavy press we take some of the notice evangelists today to constantly screaming for revival and working right against it see not understanding without understanding so if you don't have the right understanding of what the revival is going to be then you'll be working against it [Music] because your expectations are wrong now in spiritual amnesia brother branham told us he said now this is the last sign remember thus saith the lord did you ever hear me say that but it was true you're seeing your last sign now remember that last sign it covers the coming of the son of man the revealing of the son of man and and then of course the manifestation in sarah and abraham because they were the ones to bring on the promised son and he said you've seen your last sign pentecost don't get mixed up with what he promised israel after the rapture that ain't you you're done then now is your day now is your sign now is your time don't reject it don't do it you better come now you believe me to be god's servant you need a revival you're dying you're taking spiritual amnesia you're dying don't do that revive that what you got and bring it up again quickly before jesus comes so again brother branham was telling us that don't get mixed up with what he promised israel so we're going to deal with some of this and so some of this is going to be some real teaching get your pen some paper out and get ready to to to take some um real important notes on that now recognizing your day in his message he said the atmosphere of the people at that time in the circles of pentecostal rounds he said there's no revival and people are complaining and ministers are crying and he said i was reading one of their outstanding papers where um you know there where they were um in the herald of his coming and they said well hardly print anything unless it's fast pray fast pray um sound a trumpet i said how many gifts reads it you know you see you see it all the time fast pray fast praise all you hear fast pray we're going to have a great break-in of the day there's going to be something going to happen and and there is a great thing going to happen and all you pray pray pray we're not too late yet and why did they do that why do they do that they want a great awakening and they're crying to believe and there will be an awakening they're good people what is it what is it done they have not recognized the awakening of the bride and but by being christians they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what has been done but that's what's making them feel that way and they know there's some something that may happen and they're looking for way off in the future to come and it's already happened right by you so god was doing a work calling out a bride for his namesake but because you know they were trying to you know make something happen manufacture a miracle you know get the gifts to working get get get uh tongues in the church the glossolalia began they fostered the charismatic movement which turned into a worldly bunch come on who won't be subject to the word of god it's the truth and they they run out on their their gifts and their spiritual uh they they think and and and they have certain elements of healing and deliverance and and certain kinds of things that you know gifts that happen and prophecies and so on but look at their lives married divorced remarried fornications in their man and their ministries and their preachers are double married their deacons are double married all kinds of things that are going on in the leadership of the church and it just becomes a big ballyhoo of emotions and it turns out to be and you know the working of the demonic spirits as they poof and people fall out and and and you know then they go into their laughing you know and everybody going into hysterical life and you ought to see it it'll make you sick in your stomach kenneth hagin it turned out there one of the leaders in this whole thing the teachers and they were crying for revival but that's what it produced now he said now he says he said recognize the date that we're living in the sign of the time see where everything is at israel where the church where the immoral where the bride is standing what's left the next thing is the taking up of the bride every church is looking for a great thing the pentecost say glory to god they'll come a day they're going to do this they're going to do that they're professors they do believe like one time campuses is it right isn't it right that one man should die not the whole nation perish and he was i priests and that's the reason he said that he prophesied not knowing what he was saying but he did he realized the truth of it that he was sacrificing the very god he claimed to be the high priest of so today so it is today they're looking yonder somewhere for a great time to come why go to the businessman's convention they say glory to god them preachers just get this disturb the crowd saying there's coming a great revival the hand of the lord is going to be upon the earth and all the people are going forth running and they don't realize that's under the trumpets for israel why do you do that because they're christian professors and they don't realize neither did campuses realize what he was doing and they don't realize they're rejecting the very message that was sent to them now there again they'll accept brother branham's miracles as genuine but they won't accept his message amen they'll crucify that now again in the 70th weeks brother branham said most are pentecostal brethren they'll disagree with this they're looking for a great powerful something to happen and my brethren if you listen real close and listen you'll find that that great powerful something has done past jesus is ready to return now we're talking about what's going to happen with the gentile he said the church leaves on the third chapter of revelation amen for the next chapter in chapter 4 is the call come up hither right and he says then we deal with the the jew then we deal with the jews until the coming again of the bride and in the 19th chapter and so on and on and he then he says not pentecostal brethren he said do you know where the 144 000 appeared do you know where all the great miracles of revelation appeared over in the jewish age not ours there's nothing recorded in it just the church getting ready and going out sure with the power of god we can work do work miracles and exploits we know that but the real thing was over here to the jews i mean the real working power miracle working they're going to shut the heavens they'll keep it from raining they'll control nature they'll bring down plagues amen this is this is this is something are you listening to me this is something for israel that's going to happen over there and and again he says he says that remember as soon as the church age the church goes then the jews take hold come in first thing next in the order is not a mighty national revival amongst the gentiles the next thing in order is the coming of the kingdom of god the coming of christ so i want your expectations to be right we're not going to have another national revival and we're not going to have another world revival the next thing is the coming of jesus christ but there will be revival at that coming there will be a people on fire for god there will not be a laodicea and there will be the mighty works of god performed in her midst question answers in 1962 brother branham talks about that the tribulation period the church raptures and goes up at the fourth chapter of revelation never comes again until the 19th chapter when it comes with jesus that's right that's in the tribulation period not nothing to do with the church at all so what's he saying the bride is raptured in the fourth chapter and from revelation 4 to revelation 19 is when when god is dealing with israel on earth but if there's a scene in there that applies to the bride it will happen over here in revelation 3 before the rapture under the seventh church age message are you with me now i i wonder i want you to say in this because brother branham did not spiritualize revelation he did not spiritualize that this is most message preachers do and they're an era i just say it brothers you missed it you don't spiritualize where the prophet spoke of it as literal amen so they spiritualize the rapture until they trivialize and minimize the literal physical return and the median in the air and here's where the bride physically goes up in the rapture i want to show it to you it's at the end of the church ages well you just show me um adriana just pulled it down revelation 3 and and give me the last three or four verses just flash them out for us this is a laodicean church age just flash them on the screen the last three of them i stand at the door and knock again next one to him that overcometh will i grant to sit with me in my throne and then is there another one and he that hath an ear to hear you see what's now revelation 4 1 the next verse laodicea ends as she ends this happens after this after the seven church ages when they complete behold a door was opened in heaven an entrance was made in heaven and the first voice i heard was a trumpet talking to me which said come up hither and john being a man he represents and symbol the entire bride by being caught up into the heavens at the end of the seventh church age and we are in the seventh church age and under the seventh angel's message until the rapture of the church and when the brightest caught up leo to see a ends until that laodicea is still going on the laodicean messenger is still the messenger and his message is still in effect and we are the overcomers of the laodicean age all right so now again again the voice the trumpet says come up hither now this is the trumpet of first thessalonians 4 16. are you with me amen this revelation revelation 4 1 tells us what the trumpet is saying it's not just making a sound it's saying something a trumpet sounds and it says retreat a trumpet sounds and it says go forward a trumpet sounds and it gives the clues to what is going on this trumpet when it sounds has come up hither leave the earth and go into the rapture first thessalonians 4 16 says and for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of archangel with the trumpet god and the dead and christ shall rise first that's revelation 4 1. until that happens revelation 4 1 has not happened again again first corinthians 5 15 15 52 first corinthians 15 52 let's look at this one and i just want to make this clear all the scriptures are on things back up one verse if you will behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed next verse in a moment in the twinkling of an eye where at the last trump and the last trump is revelation 4 1 and it says leave the earth and go into glory and john types the entire bride by being lifted up into the heavens into the eternals and that's what happens at the end of the two changes and brother branham never spiritualizes this men do preachers do but brother brahman doesn't when will they be changed at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed when the last trump you talk about the divine healing movement oh hallelujah amen we've never seen a divine healing movement like this the oil will be turned young again gray hair will come back the right color missile limbs will be restored the will walk and the blind will see we are on the brink of the greatest divine healing movement ever and it won't be 15 years and it will not it will not build up a denomination or some man's kingdom it'll take a bride and a rapture [Applause] hallelujah how would you like to come across some prayer the the platform you know for for prayer to have your gray hair turn back the right color huh that would be a healing wouldn't it a miracle healer well i'll tell you hey man there won't be no bald heads there hallelujah amen there won't be a hey there ain't going to be no old people there people people ridicule me for having a youth camp well brother there ain't going to be no old folks there's going to be one glorious youth camp we're all going to be young and immortal again never to die never to sucker sorrow pain sickness the greatest divine healing movement ever is right on the birds we're right on the edge of it any moment somebody could tap you on the shoulder it could be your mother your brother someone that's done going on and say it's on hallelujah and gabriel's instruction to daniel now in the fourth chapter john was caught up immediately after the church john going up he saw the complete church age there's where i'd like to stop for a second to say that people are looking for something great tremendous powerful something to happen the gentile age are certainly wrong the church age and all that happened during the gentile reign is recorded in revelation 1 to 3 inclusive then the church was raptured and taken up in the rest under this 19th chapter is what happens to the jewish race after the church has gone up and it's a time of great tribulation nothing to happen among the gentiles only the slaughter and so forth we get to but the church itself is gone on the last verse of the third chapter of revelation when the late ocean church age ends oh my goodness amen this bright age is the overcomers of the laodicean age now brother branham and i want you to write this down brother branham teaches it this way all through the revelation series in the breach paragraph 23 in the first seal paragraph 18 the fifth seal paragraph 87 and 218 question answers on the seals 337 and in the in the seventh seal he's still saying this i'm going to read this one now remember after the fourth chapter of revelation the church is gone after the four horse riders went out church is gone everything that happened to church happened up to the fourth chapter of the book of revelation he's still saying this in the seventh seal feasts of the trumpets where he separates what belongs to the jews and what belongs to us amen paragraph 37 he says the same future home through the invisible union he's still referencing the summons on high come up hither brother bradham taught it this way from before the seals during the seals and after the seals the bride is raptured in the laodicean age and as she does the laodicean age closes so you say but what about the seals brother tim there there after chapter 4. aren't you coming in the mess there yeah you know i i get your point but remember anything that though that happens to the bride must happen in the 7th church ages in chapters one through three so if the seals are open come on they happen back over here for the gentiles in revelation 3 under the seventh angel's message chapters 4 through 19 shows different scenes you go through different scenes he takes you from one scene to another to another to another to another it's a series of visions and it shows you on the seventh seal book in the book open and the seven trumpets the ceiling of the hundred and forty four thousand the mighty angel revelation ten the two witnesses the war in heaven the cast casting down of satan the going up of the bride the lamb with the 144 thousand the seven vials the great the call to come out of her my people the judgment of the great until the new jerusalem is ushered in you see if it's for the gentiles and if it happens on earth it must happen in the last church age in revelation chapter 3. under the seventh angel's message you see this rules out all of these wannabe newcomers one want to be prophets who i tell and when another one shows up just take a number and get in line wait your turn to be told nah you ain't got it now again if it happens for the jews it must i and i'm talking about 144 000 here it must happen after chapter 4 which is the going away of the bride amen if it's an event for the bride in revelation 4 to 19 that it must happen in the church ages in revelation one two three because that's the only time that god deals with the bride the church from revelation chapter one through three is god dealing with his bride to the ages and he also addresses the false church revelation four one is the rapture would you would you like to go with me through this for a moment just kind of flip your bible revelation 4 1 is the rapture the remainder of chapter 4 shows the throne and the one who sits upon it chapter 5 is the scene of redemption spanning from adam's loss of the book to the coming of the redeemer to finally all creation worships god at the conclusion of revelation 5. all creation worships god so it's a process so when we look at the book of redemption and the opening of it it starts with adam losing it and the plight of man all down to the ages jesus coming as redeemer while the what god holds it in his hand the lamb steps forth to take the book and he loses the seals he reveals the mystery he opens the book and it brings it back to the people are you with me so revelation chapter 5 is the scene of redemption revelation chapter 6 is a showing of the symbols of the book which are revealed in the seventh angel's message in the last church age again again the opening of the seals exposes the working of satan the mystery of iniquity showing the working of the antichrist as the four horse riders the fifth seal shows the fate of the jews who died for the testimony during the times of the gentiles from and they they're from the rejection of christ to them finally accepting their messiah in the sixth seal with 145 4 000 being filled with the same holy ghost the gentile bride received the the sixth seal shows the tribulation and those that are saved this happens after revelation 4. and and again the multitude without number which is the jewish i mean the gentile remnant the church not the bride and the 144 thousand and the judgment upon the earth in the great tribulation the seventh seal covers the rapture of the bride to her coming back with christ in the great battle of armageddon so it goes all the way from the breaking of the silence under the seventh angel's message and the revealing of the seven thunders to give us faith for a rapture it raptures that bride it continues on ending up all things until it brings christ back again with the bride so the seventh seal is a process that goes all the way from the prophet's message to bringing christ back again in revelation 19. that's all the seventh seal it spans that whole thing now again revelation chapter 7 is the ceiling of the 144 thousand revelation chapter 8 is the trumpets that gathered israel back to their promised land and they will be revealed to the jews as the thunders were revealed to us by our prophet and as he brought us out of world religion traditions he will the the um the the great the the great um two witnesses will bring the jews out of their traditions as brother branham said of sacrificing geese and chickens which they didn't do but it's just as well might have been amen because the blood does not atone somebody help me amen coming back to the real atonement point them back to the real atonement our seventh angel does the same for us and brings us back to the real atonement all right which is jesus christ all right so again our atonement's not in the church it's not in rome it's not a denomination our atonement's in jesus all right so now again revelation chapter 8 is the trumpets that gather them back to their promised land question answer 64. i believe you're seeing the last thing that happened to the church before the rapture that's exactly i believe it the rain is over just remember just read the first three chapters of revelation and you'll see what's promised to the church that's what's promised church right there the church ages you notice the other day when we started them trump's holy spirit said that don't belong here and he said now ladder rain 144 000 jews no that is that's when moses and elijah that's where the miracles take place the things the peoples that uh that been looking for the pentecostals for miracles that's where that will take place unto them see that's moses and elijah they will smite the earth with curses as they will they'll close the heavens that it don't reign in the days of the prophecy and god will stand and fight for them as he did and he'll bring them out with a mighty hand just like he did in egypt out of the isms of the world and he'll do that we are just to wait on the coming of the lord amen this is our revival the rapture is our revival and it will crescendo in our body change in the greatest divine healing movement that's ever been but it won't last long and it won't be a preacher laying hands on you what's that sudden change when he sweeps over you and you're changed in the moment in the twinkle of an eye and in just a few minutes you're traveling like a thought and then we all get together and meet one another and embrace one another what a day of rejoicing that will be and then we'll get ready for the great appearing of our lord jesus in the air the world won't seem but we will because we'll see him with a different set of eyes looking in dimensions that men have never looked in before in mass like that easter seal brother branham said can't you see spirit-filled people something's fixing to happen don't look for some great big universal something sweeping nothing but the coming of the lord jesus remember just remember the words in the promise of the lord all right chapter 9 concerning the chapter is illusion of the evil spirits somewhere out there a year the river euphrates others come that come out of hell with torment upon the earth a spirit of insanity that begins to move upon the earth are you with me we're already seeing pre-tribulation plagues and that insanity coming in now is that right amen chapter 10 is a scene showing the coming of christ the mighty angel with the open book that was once closed somebody said help me now and handed that book to the bride of jesus christ and her eating it and prophesying again and that happens in the last church age now you can spiritualize this coming because it's not a physical return it's not a 900 foot tall jesus with one great big foot on the land and the other on the sea these are symbolic of him holding the powers of hell down where the the beast rises oh hallelujah glory to god rises out of the sea that's wrong rise it out of the earth that's america and he holds her down oh don't you know what you're doing you are those feet those pillars of fire and you're here on the earth holding down those powers and when this bride is lifted up and her feet lifts off the earth and the holy ghost lifts up off the earth those pillars of fire all hell breaks loose because then those powers can come into full fruition this is not the physical coming it's showing symbolically the anointing that is coming down did you know you are anointed by a mighty angel hallelujah christ himself finishing the mystery amen revealing it to revelation 10 7 the prophet of the last age somebody help me preach amen then the continuation of that same ministry and the bride as she eats the book for she must prophesy the same message again to ever kindred and tongue and nation and we've been doing it glory to god we're part of it prophesy now revelation chapter 11 is the same anointing if you notice it begins with and it is the same anointing that was upon the pride comes there upon the two witnesses in their ministry and the crucifixion and and their rapture that takes place under them somebody with me now because now that when the bride leaves the holy spirit moves right over and anoints the two witnesses and and they begin their ministry all right now let's just stop a minute because i know there are those that are listening to me they think brother branham is going to be one of the witnesses maybe the elijah that's going to go to to uh to israel and brother branham got ready to go if you remember how many has ever seen the the video film of the 20th century prophet and you see two men brother cop and and them coming there to um interview brother branham now this was a big ordeal they were spending thousands of dollars flying into jeffersonville meeting brother branham in his home setting all this up interviewing him and get it getting ready for an israel campaign brother branham gets ready to go he gets to cairo louis petrus had said you know if you go there brother branham now he was a big pentecostal leader in europe he had sent over a million bibles into israel new testaments figure out that cost that rented facilities they got all of it together brother branham's in cairo he gets that far and he said you know they're they're they're all helped up about this they have sent us video all over the place they've collected money from everywhere they're going to have a campaign we're going to turn israel back to god they'll see the sign of that prophet he'll discern the thoughts of the heart just like they did in abraham and they've always believed their prophets and brother adam you'll come and you'll show this sign and and there will be millions of them jews turn to god and what an opportunity he got over there and he got into to um there they were telling him brother argent brother branham it's just gonna alarm israel and bring them out and show them the sign of the prophet they'll believe it and he said i'm ready lord i'm ready he's ready to fulfill that bring israel back to god and the holy spirit stopped him in cairo he said i jumped on a plane now this is no little thing this is in the 50s and it's no little thing to jump on a plane and go across the seas you literally hop from little airports to airports and so on like that and finally get there this is no little thing and he's in cairo that's egypt he's about to make the next jump probably into tel aviv he said he was in cairo and he said the holy spirit said this is not your place i'm reading you i'm reading it to you from the the very sermon recognizing your day in this message this is not your place god made it known it was not his place to be the prophet to israel this is not your time so you get ahead of yourself i thought oh my i've come way over here i'm going to go and something said stop right here don't you go that way turn on to india don't go that way go to india but don't you go here and i thought why and i walked out the hangar and i said lord jesus what does this mean and he made known to me no gentile these prophets are the one it has to be according to scripture moses and elijah has to come and besides the bride hasn't been taken out of the way yet and then prophets will return and they will do the sign of the prophet that's the scripture there it is all fulfilled perfectly israel as a nation will be born in one day so you for you return ministry people the elijah to the jews is not brother branham he was denied the opportunity to preach the trumpets even because they were not his message [Applause] this is for the jews it's not your message you're not allowed to preach them come on and let me just say out here to the never never land out there if you're listening if you think one that you're one of the two witnesses then number one you don't have the holy ghost yet number two you are identifying yourself as not the bride but the jewish remnant so you're not bribed number three your message is a tribulation message and it'll never rapture the church number four you have to you have to be an israeli and not a gentile and you better get over israel because god can't bless you and fill you with the holy ghost until you get in your promised land you can't be blessed out of your promised land number five and don't be thinking the name of jesus is not effective and you got to say yeshua because brother branham clearly identified that thought as a cult and number six and don't think you're going to reveal the thunders because they've already been revealed and you can't reveal something that's already been revealed it's not a mystery no more we know what the thunders are they were once sealed up but now they're revealed they were once a sealed voice but now god has spoke out now we know what the thunders are they were the mysteries of the seven seals amen once they were symbols but now they're not symbols anymore we didn't have the voice and besides that's the seventh angel's job and he didn't need some profit some apostle to come along and bring clarity because that brought only confusion and division all right let's go on chapter 12. is the war between michael and lucifer and the casting out of satan and the going up of the bride so again if the bride is raptured it happens right over here in the last church age at the end of it so satan gets cast down when as the bride goes up chapter 13 is a scene that shows the beast of rome the beast that rises up out of america and the image to the bc a communicable spirit with its cancelled culture so that no one can by herself without complying complying to their demands revelation 14 through 15 deals with 144 000 during the tribulation revelation 16 is the vials poured out by the seven angels which by the way are not angels they are men punch your neighbor and wake them up surely teaching don't bore you good thing i want you to look at this real close i want you to look at this revelation 16 is the vials poured out by the seven angels they are stored up judgments that could not be poured out in the church ages that are reserved to be poured out on the beast in the last age now god hears so those those little martyrs back there that says god you're witnessing all of this you remember god said well i can't wipe out the beast now but i'll store this up because i'm going to bring judgment on those that persecuted you because i don't forget vengeance is mine i will repay saith god amen and you know and why do i say there are men because the last angel the one who held the seventh vial when he when it when john saw him and he was revealing things to him and showing him all kinds of things he was re he was taking him through the judgment of the and all this and the in the new city and this and that and he fell down to worship him and he said don't do it i'm a prophet i'm one of your fellow servants is that right so they're men and when the bride is having the marriage supper the tribulation has happened on the earth and part of our victory celebrations in heaven will be us gathering over the banister and watching an angel pour out a vial and we'll shout and dance and glorify god as it's poured out upon the earth in the tribulation period while we're at the marriage supper of the lamb hallelujah amen it will be forgive me for saying this but it'll be some of the entertainment provided at the marriage supper so i don't buy that brother tim huh go with me to revelation 19 verse one let's just watch it and after these things i heard a great voice of much people in heaven say of hallelujah salvation and glory and honor and power into our god for true and righteous serious judgment for he had judged the great which did corrupt the earth with with his fornication and avenge the blood of his servant and again they said hallelujah is that rejoicing or not amen and her smoke rules forever and ever and the and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped god that sat on the throne saying amen hallelujah and the voice came out of the throne said praise our god all you his servants and you that fear him both small and great and i heard as it was a voice of a great multitude lord of god i'm in that multitude you are part of that multitude you were prophesied to be there amen as the voice of many waters is a voice of mighty thunder and saying hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed with fine linen clean and white for fine linen is the righteousness of the saints and he ends up saying these are the true saiyans of god blessed are they that are called to the marriage supper now then so in revelation 16 and 17 the vials are poured out the sort of judgments and they happen during the time that we are at the marriage supper the lamb they don't happen in the church age they happen after the rapture revelation 17 shows the great horror and identifies her and her daughters revelation 18 is the call that says come out of her my people which again is the seventh angel's message that happens over in the seventh church age revelation 19 shows the marriage supper of the lamb the and the mad the and um and and the marriage supper of the lamb and the marriage of the lamb amen you say well i i thought the bride was already married well spiritually that's true you can type it both ways but there's going to be a ceremony in heaven hallelujah amen a great marriage supper oh we'll feast with the king we'll dine as his guest how blessed these pilgrims are behold in his hallowed face oh i want to see him and just look on his face dare to sing forever of his saving grace hallelujah amen then it shows the return of christ revelation 19 at armageddon it hasn't happened yet you can't spiritualize this it hasn't happened yet it's going to happen and we're going to be a part of it the great battle of armageddon somebody said brother tim are you going to be at the battle of armageddon i said i wouldn't miss it for the world revelation 20 is the binding of satan for a thousand years and the millennial reign revelation the concluding of revelation 20 is a great white throne judgment the final judgment revelation 21 is the coming down of the holy city revelation 21 2 says and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband it's the description of the city and the earth leaving time to go back into eternity our hope of revival is the coming of jesus christ are you ready for that coming there's some more i want to speak about because i don't care how dead you are we are in the hour of

christ bringing her to the glorious resurrection blessed be the name of the lord amen will you lift your hands and just worship god let the musicians come as we do hallelujah hallelujah his plan spans
