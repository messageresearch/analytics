And I'm feeling like I'm needing it right now. Oh, the Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He leads me by still waters till my fears are gone. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. Oh, I know you are with me. My father, my friend, your goodness and mercy will follow me all of my days. I know how you're still wers. I'm [Applause] [Music] safe. Lord, I believe you can set me at ease. Turn this broken piece in me to stand quiet. I know there's power in your word.
