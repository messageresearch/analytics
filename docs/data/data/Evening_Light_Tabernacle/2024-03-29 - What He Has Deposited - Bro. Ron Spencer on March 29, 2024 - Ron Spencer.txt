you have to do is just invite him and he'll come in every service and speak to your heart in different ways and honored to speak this with brother Danny and we've been friends so long and not going to tell you how long but we've been friends a long time and and uh he's been a real buddy to me and brother Andrew and he's just a star among us and we're just so thrilled what God has done and we've watched him and throughout the years and thrilled to see what God is doing and I just believe that God has something for us in every service if you'll just Reach Out he'll touch your life and maybe you have a need on your heart you just like to say Lord would you just pass by my way this morning and touch us today Heavenly Father we love you with everything that's within us and we give oursel to

leaders of this church especially brother Tim and brother Timothy Lord I just just pray that you would just pour out great rewards for them minister to us today and Father we can study and pray but it takes you to come on the scene to help us today Lord you saw our hands as they went up we have many needs and I ask you that you would just come and speak to our hearts father Lord in a moment you can change our lives and Lord if you would just sweep by may we be sensitive and aware that you're here for us today and we thank you for these things in Jesus Christ's name amen do you love him amen amen amen so thank you for everything and your love and your cares and your prayers for us over these four years and we're still fighting and still pressing on we just went through a major Miracle take place in our lives and three different doctors had told that we had had cancer in our eyes and and uh for those those that don't know we are we're fighting stage four cancer cancer in our brain and then cancer in our lungs and lymph nodes take take chemo every day but God's been good to us and and U brother Tim and brother Donnie came after we had had the diagnosis of of cancer in her eyes and we were continuing to get calls and preparing us to lose an eyeball and then lose uh go on radiation and chemotherapy for our eyes and and uh we went again and they took 40 minutes to tell me they would take one of the eyeballs the one was that was the worst and then then to begin to do the chemotherapy to be honest with you it was crushing to me because already fighting what we fight I just felt like I couldn't I just couldn't take another front and so we needed a miracle and when they came brother Tim and brother Donnie came and especially when they prayed for me I felt a sensation in my eyes and and and uh I just felt something and and so then when we went the first 40 minutes of the doctor's appointment with sister Connie with us and and they told us of what they were going to have to do and then when I saw the the head doctor he looked at me and he said you've got lesions in your eyes but you have no cancer in your eyes and so we thank the Lord we thank the Lord for that isn't he wonderful he cares about every need that you have and I believe that he'll come by this way and amen I think I I think I when I hear stories of Marcus and Sharon where you guys at you guys drove there you are you drove 32 hours to be here and and straight and just stopping at at fuel stations and sleeping one driving one sleeping and and thank you guys for coming and so many from so far away and sister Elise where you at sister Elise where are you at there she is here on her 40th birthday and so we just are so thankful that we can share that give her a good hand amen if you will turn with me to Psalms chapter 46 and verse one I'd like to speak to you this morning on what God has deposited amen amen boy I enjoy it last night I I reached over to brother Andrew last night and I said boy Danny's doing a good job of preaching my sermon amen Psalms 46 and verse one I love this God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried in the midst of the sea though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled though the mountain shake and the swelling thereof Salah there is a river in streams whereof shall make glad and the City of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved God shall help her and there and that right early the Heathen rage and the kingdoms were moved and he uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord is of host is with us I love that part the Lord of host is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge sayah come before the works of the Lord and what desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease I love that unto the ends of the Earth he breakthe bow and cutteth the spear in suer and he burneth a chariot in fire be still and know that I am God and I will be exalted among the Heathen and I will be exalted in the Earth the lord of the host is with us the god of Jacob is our refuge if you will turn with me to Psalms chapter 23 and verse one it's a very familiar portion of of scripture Psalms 23 and verse one I would like for you to read this with me this morning if you will the Lord is my shepherd and I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures and he leadth me beside of the Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake and yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death death I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies and thou anointest my head with oil and my cup runneth over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever amen you can be seated sitting beside of you is a thought of God and you also a thought of God you were in thought for him but now you're sitting here in physical reality you're an expression of God's Vision you are important to God as much as God said let there be a son and moon and stars God had you on your on his mind now he held you until this day you could not have been born in any other day God held you to believe this message of the hour and to stand as a light and an overcomer in this dispensation now he did not just create you and maybe you think well brother Ron I don't know if I've ever seen him a miracle when you look in the mirror when you look in the mirror you are a miracle God designed you the way that you are maybe many times you'd like to change some things about you but God designed you he wanted you so tall he wanted your eye color a certain way he wanted your hair to flow a certain way he wanted your personality he wanted your you to be designed after what he was thinking since the fall of Man God has watched over your natural seed not only your spiritual reality but he watched over your natural seed and he watched over it through Wars and pestilence and many different deaths and types of deaths and hatred and Malice and all different kinds of things and God had this one to marry that one and this one to marry that one you know what a challenge that is you listen to the eagle last night that girl Eagle I think it's kind of unfair and they just keep picking up sticks and you keep diving there's going to be some guys in some mud holes here this week and you know how it is if she would just smile at me or you know I think she's the one and you know you fall in love and then all of a sudden she don't want nothing to do with you and you just know you just know and after a while she smiles that has happened all the way in history and then you say you're not a miracle on and I'm sure I'm on the right track there's some of you sitting here you're just hoping that she smiles but in the Lamb's Book of Life he took your picture when you were at your best and many of you are very near that picture right now and death hasn't started to set in yet and you're just in the liberty of life but God didn't just bring you here to see if he could do it God has a purpose in your being here oh brother Ron but I can't wait till the Rapture but you got work to do between now and the Rapture there's some overcoming that you've got to do to prove to Satan that you're here to destroy the works of the devil now God didn't just watch over your seed all the way down through here to bring you to this point to be wishy-washy to be a compromising group of people but you are warriors looking sitting in this room is the most powerful people that there are on the earth when this world is falling apart in Sodom and it's falling apart and people are going every which away they don't have a compass you been sent a message that the seed that is on the inside of you God has confidence in that seed that he deposited not a preacher not your mama not your daddy but God watched over that seat and he's got confidence in the life that he placed on the inside of you you will not fail as much as you think oh brother Ron if I can hold on I don't know if I can make it another day God's not determining this about your flesh or your feelings or your attitudes he's got confidence in the Eternal [Applause] seed that comes to life some of you will get your start here some of you will get your start here maybe as brother Danny was saying and brother Tim was saying last night you may not even want it to come but God designed Gathering you and pulling you to a certain spot because somewhere you're going to start running right somewhere you're going to start don't let the devil block your visitation this week get moving let's get after this thing let's finish the work that God gave us to do now brother Tim brother Danny brother Timothy the ministers are setting all over this building they can't do it for you they can't do your work for you we will cheerlead we will lead you we will try to inspire you we will try to motivate you we will point you to the word to who you are but you've got to catch it for yourself your eyes have got of come open now the reason Satan fights you so much is because you're carrying an atmosphere around you that maybe you're not even aware but there's a light that's with you and Satan being in that real is privy to see that light in all of this darkness and he knows that if you ever get Who You Are if you ever get who you are then you will become Satan's worst nightmare you may be the only one in your school you may be the only one in your company you may be the only one in your family but you are not alone now let's just let's just think about this brother random said it is not the size of the dog that's in the fight it is the size of the fight that's in the dark don't look in the mirror to sit look at that you look in the word brother B quotes this he said must I be carried home to heaven on a flowery bed of East While others fought to win the prize and sail through bloody Seas I must fight now now notice you don't just leave it there increase my courage Lord you got to know where your source of strength is it's not on Facebook when the enemy shall come in like a flood how many's ever felt like you've been in a flood where it looked like the devil was going to overwhelm you but when the enemy shall come in like a flood God don't just leave it there the spirit of the Lord shall lift up a standard God loves a fight want you tell your neighbor God loves a fight Revelation chapter 3 and verse 21 can we put that up there Revelations chapter 3 and verse 21 brother Ron I read of Moses I read of Noah I read now I want to I want to read about myself I'm going to read it first and then we're going to read it together to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me and my throne even as I also overcame come and sit down with my father in his throne now I want us to read it together and I want you to place your name all right and I'm going to put my name here so I want you to put your name here amen to Ron Spencer come on we got to have some participation here you know your name you know your name you don't need a prophet to tell you what your name is now let's just practice look over at your neighbor and tell them your name I know your name you're my grandson so let's just practice me and you to Titus Spencer to Titus Spencer so to Titus Spencer he's I don't go to school with you I'm your granddad and I'm your pastor but I don't go to school with you but God is depending on the seed that's in you to overcome in your school to shine a light they will never probably ever read the message may never see the pictures on the wall may never know the name William brandom but they will see that Jesus and the Jesus in you will cause them to be thirsty and they 10 years from now will remember I knew a guy in school that regardless of all the darkness and the bullying and all the nonsense that was going on and all of Sodom and gamorra and all the politics I knew a [Applause] God and if there's a seed on the inside of them your life Your Atmosphere Your Atmosphere will bring them back in the compass are you with me that's how important our work is to do you may not influence them today you may not see it but maybe years from now they'll look back I saw the life of Jesus on the inside regardless of the circumstances regardless of what was going I saw Jesus two r Spencer that overcometh which means you're going to wrestle with it you're going to fight with it but you're going to win will I grant to sit with me and my throne even as I also overcame and have sat down with my father it doesn't say you're going to fail God has already saw you overcome so quit thinking am I going to make it we're not Catholics here we're not beating oursel keep getting up get the negative attitude out of our Lives keep getting up I ask God to fill you so full with the Holy Ghost tell the devil don't know what to do with you psalms 27 and verse one the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear let's put the devil on notice I don't fear you the Lord is the strength brother Ron I just don't know where I'm going to get the strength from I feel like my Energy's run out I don't know if I can make it another day G going back to the well the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat my flesh they stumbled and fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing that I have desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall set me upon a rock and now shall my head be lifted up above mine enemies round about me therefore will I offer in his Tabernacles sacrifices of Joy I will sing that's everybody here I will sing Hallelujah I will sing praises unto the Lord you are built to overcome you're pre-planned to overcome the vision of God don't break in the middle get you here and then decide well I'm just going to throw them away you have been told that you're the final voice to the final Edge you have been told that you're the final Runners you have been told that God's DNA lives on the inside of you so what a powerful people that you are it does not matter what your critics say why don't you say it with me it does not matter what my critics say how many of you in this building have a Critic how many of you in here there's awake what what a powerful people you are I want that to soak in what a powerful people you are the scripture says in Philippians chapter 4 and verse 13 I can do all things I can do all things through Christ with strengthening me Acts chapter three it was a display of the power that was on the inside of them he didn't point though they didn't Point them back to a historical God but the disciples said such as I have give I Thee in the name of Jesus Christ so let me ask you what is in your hands what is in your hands what have you been given to use pull your sword pull your sword it looks good on your side pull your sword we are Fighters we've been taught that from our birth last night and here's where we go last night as brother Danny started to talk about an eagles remember this you're not born a buzzard you're not born a crow you were born an eagle and listen to be born you had to chop your way that's what some of you are going to do this week you were born in a shell yeah that shell protected you but when it came the proper time when you would have strength to live in this world you have to chop your way Peck with your beak on that EDG shell from the inside you can't have help to get you out somebody help me brother Ryan you got to have the determination you got to have the determination I'm going to fight my way I'm going to break out of this shell I'm going to use every bit of my energy I'm going to chop and I'm going to chop and I'm going to chop I'm going to break out of this shell and in the strength that it took to break out of that shell it will give you the strength to [Applause] live there was a time in my life to which I had been on life support and I'd been there for about a month and it was on that day that they were going to take the life support system and the and it out of my mouth and the hoses that were helping me to breathe I never forget there was a nurse that was standing standing beside of me and she was about right here and she was screaming in my ear run fight to live Ron fight to live because that machine was doing the work for me and I'm afraid a lot of people have machines doing the work for [Applause] them and it causes your body because they put you on that so you will relax and you will heal but there comes a time that you need to live on your own it's good to have a good mom and dadd and a good pastor but I want to scream in your ear fight to live fight fight fight you got to fight

prophet of God you got to go to church you got to say Amen that's for me you got to pull on the word of God you got to pull you got to pull you got to pull fight to live brother Ron I seem to be so intimidated I seem to be so intimidated by everything around me I got a story for you there was a mouse and a cat and this little mouse was running all over the house and this cat was stomping and breathing and it seemed like that every breath was breathing down his neck and he just knew at any minute his neck was going to be snapped and he was going to be bit he ran under the couch and he ran across the floor and he ran over the tables and there was an open wine bottle and he ran right into that wine bottle and you know GLE GLE G he had had fear that has eat him up but once he got a full of the wine of the Holy Ghost [Applause] once he got full of the Holy Ghost he climbed his way out of the bottle and he responded where's that [Applause] cat I'm going to admit something to you here when I was a little boy we would go across to my unconverted grandmother and there would be after school there would be a program called Gunsmoke I'm not going to ask how many knows that but but there's a guy called Matt Dylan he was a sheriff of that Renegade town and you know they would have the play and they would do all the acting it would be different characters it was one of the longest running westerns that ever was and you know he came came out and he had this gun on his hip you know he had a little limp and had a big old hat you know and they would build the story for about 45 46 minutes and have a theme to it always have a bad guy in it bad guy was always mean looking had a snarly look to him you know he had a reputation he' done some bad stuff in Matt Dylan's Town come on on and you know he's going to have to face the Reckoning oh yeah but they would build it so that that villain looked meaner than Matt Dylan for 46 minutes they built it and they built it up and and then one in one minute they would begin to have a showdown oh yeah and you know they made it to search a way to where that you sitting on the end of your seat and the music starts to take another level now you know if you've watched enough of them you knew what was going to happen but they would build it in such a way to where that when that music Started pumping and you know what you know they would show the shadows and they would show all these different kind of things and and they would begin to go and you were sitting on your seat it's today the day Matt Dylan dies you were nervous you're sitting there watching who's going to be the quicker gun then about minute 55 the guns come out of the Hoster I was a cowboy when I was a little boy I rode a horse I shot a lot of people I had six shooters on both sides but at 5' five and 110 pounds I didn't Lord but you sit there as an audience attender going I wonder who wins but really you knew now maybe you're in you've been since you were born you've came up and you're in your 46 minute you're in your 46 minutes and it's now time for a showdown it's time a showdown it's time for you to step out in the street it's time for you to step

every Pew across this building every chair every one of your winners every one of you I don't care where you came from what family you came from I don't care what your background is God has deposited something on the inside of you that the devil is absolutely terrified and it has become his nightmare if you realize who you [Applause] are you will have to fight for every inch you will have to fight in this meeting the doubt the doubts and the fears and the frustrations and the emotion situations you're going to have to fight you're going to have to fight peer pressure you're going to have to fight the darkness that has been around you you're going to have to fight the failures that you've lived with for years but if you can ever get what God wants for you you're not that man anymore maybe you was a porn addict was maybe you was doing recreational drugs was maybe you was a sleeper on your Pew was maybe you was blind to who you really was was brother Ron But Blind bardus he was blind was the leopard was a leopard was Legion was full of the Devils was Mary Magdalene was call your name was that was your history just go ahead and smile right now and say the chapter page has turned brother Ron I gave my heart to the Lord last year two years ago or three years ago that chapter now has turned these two boys that drove 32 hours they're friends of ours they've had difficult lives life hasn't been exactly a just a flowery bed of these but it sure wasn't the devil that caused them to get in their car and come through snowy storms cars slide in every different direction there was something at this camp and they came with expectation am I right they came with expectation that I'm going to be stronger when I leave here brother Ron you're not preaching nothing to me new listen you fought last week to get here and you'll fight to go home but you can be stronger come on General Robert E Lee maybe's familiar to especially in the South but he made a scream one day and he said I'm too weak to retreat so we will just charge you may be too weak to even Retreat so I got some advice for you judge I have to tell you I could live this by experience there are days that I'm too sick to walk to a pull pit but I refuse to let that devil there are I'm too sick to get out of bed but I refuse to let that devil I could have quit and laid home and had all kind of different excuses but I refuse to retreat so if I can fight with stage four cancer if I can fight with stage four cancer help me fight [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] messing on what do I have to do I want to tell you your origin ye are of God little children and have overcame them because greater is he that is in you hallah than he that is in the world Hallelujah brother Ron I don't have strength not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God hallelu and he saith unto me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will I rather glory in the infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me Isaiah 40 and verse 29 he giveth power to the faint and to them that have no might he increases strength even the youth shall faint and be weary and the young men shall elderly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount upon wings as an eagle they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint Give the Lord a great big hand right there Romans chapter 8 and 28 these are some of my favorite scriptures and we know that all things work together to the good to them that love God that's right to them who are they called according to his purpose God knows what he deposited on the inside of you he did not do it by random he knowed what he put on the inside of you if you can get the revelation of what's laying on the inside of you that seed has power within itself to produce what God's word call for it to do for whom he did for no turn to your neighbor now he's talking about you now you're a Qui Bunch he's talking about you now how many of you have ever been in a group picture 40 people in that picture when they showed you the picture who did you look at well you're a bunch of Bain people 40 people and you looked at yourself you didn't look at your best friend my hair wasn't right can we retake that picture I didn't smile I had an eye closed can we retake the picture so now we look at the work we're not looking at Noah Moses Jeremiah Moses is not sitting here Jeremiah is not sitting here brother brandom is not sitting here your favorite preacher may not be sitting here it's your turn it's your turn remember some of you now at a point and the teacher ask you what do you want to be when you grow up I want to be an overcomer now more over whom he did predestinate them he also called who did that God did and God don't lose whom he called he then he also Justified so if you properly ask forgiveness and the old man dies it's gone it's gone habits you've had things you've thought about words that you've said attitudes that you've had and you say God forgive me I don't want to be that man no longer and you properly ask forgiveness of those things and then God washes you and justifies you it's as though you never did it in the first place some of you were rotten dirty stinking Rascals but you see we didn't put forth a a history report to see if it was okay if you come and the devil for sure didn't want you to be in here but God got you here Pastor Jesus has people in his congregation one was naked on a boat cursing and the devil had to laugh picking him picking him he'll be my lead disciple you picking him and some of your parents has got filth records that they don't tell you nothing about but God picked them God picked them because God could see the potential that laid on the inside of it and God's a cheater he already knows he's not dampling he's not what if he know what he put on the inside of you and the devil goes you'll never be nothing you're right for the devil will never be nothing for him I do not intend on advancing Satan's kingdom I intend on destroying it I love this scripture verse 31 what shall we then say to these things if God be for us I like my odds here I like my odds here if God be for us who can be against us listen I live this this I live this doctors think I'm going to die but they're thrilled I'm living because they think it's the medicine's working it doesn't matter what their report says it doesn't matter how big the cancer is it doesn't matter how much your darkness that you're in if God come on help me preach if God be for me if my parents aren't for me if my pastor's not for me and he's going to give up if God is on my side if God is on my side David could say it my brothers have turned against me the King has turned against me but if God's with me I'm going to pick up five Stones I'm not worried about my epith I'm not worried of what they'll put on my my stone I'm going to tell you Goliath is coming down in this meeting tell Goliath you're coming down every one of you have a different influence from hell that tries to stop you every one of you I know what you're going through brother Ron I know what you you really don't know I don't know what you're going through the person beside of you really don't know what you're going through it's in the privacy of your own home it's in the privacy of your own mind but greater is he that is in you when you're all alone and all the pressure is against you when all the odds and Satanist swore I'm going to destroy you you're not going to make it you won't make it two weeks you won't make it 6 months if God is for me God is for me who can be against me let's just make a declaration we are not wimps we are warriors and we are armed for the battle and God just didn't give us armor to see how we would wear it we're here to win we have recognized that we're in a battle we know we've got a fight I'm going to raise the banner High we are going to [Applause] win now God has had a strategy he empties human vessels he empties human vessels wish you had one he empties human vessels make sure they're empty don't tell the jity and he empties them completely out of all of the sin all the habits all the nonsense all the stuff now it looks like the same vessel it looks like the same vessel it looks like the same vessel but a new king is living on the inside thank you I can preach a little while long now so the devil used to fight you when the old stuff was in there oh he could have a party cuz you would listening to his music you was reading his junk because the old man was living in there now it looks like the same vessel but once the new man the new king lives in the heart and he comes back to pick on you War has arrived not going to be but just a couple more minutes how many's ever heard of a guy named Muhammad Ali fly like a butterfly sting like a beig there's none greater than Muhammad Ali for those that have been under a rock for a few years he was a fighter he was a champion F come on now and he had a he had a man that was his manager called Angelo D and Ang Angelo dunde was his head guy in his corner now you know mamad Ali he fought a bunch of guys that were they he just overwhelmed them but once in a while he would fight a demon oh I'm sorry he would fight a demon that would give him a real match well put him in the ropes and knock him around and take a breath out of him hit his jaw and break his jaw brother Andrew when he would go over and sat down in the corner Angelo dunde would remind him of who he is and when people would ask Angelo Dundee what was the secret what did you tell him that he would come back and win the championship again he said all I did was reminding him of who he was because he already knew how to fight he had trained for the moment he knew what to do how to throw the left and how to throw the jab and how to come around with the roundhouse how to keep his head out of the way how to take the blow into his belly but he needed to be reminded you are the champion Muhammad nobody else can come in here and do it for you I can't do it for you I'm preaching to you I can't do it for you when you go back out there be the champion brother Ron that is so silly well I got a good story for you Abraham Lincoln had lost 11 different public collections we going to be here a while 11 different public elections he did not look like he was going to win the presidential election all OD was against him a little girl 14 years old wrote him a letter and said grow a beard and look like a man I can't grow one because I'm an Apache did that change Abraham Lincoln no did that change his waistline no did it change his height no but somewhere he got confidence in a 14year old little girl how many's 14 here 14 14 14 14 14 so who'll give me 15 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 14 there you are 14 everybody hold your hands up at one time 14 okay look over at your neighbor how old are you 13 how old are you 16 15 you're 14 tell your 13 year old neighbor you can do this tell that guy you can do this brother Ron that's silly if a girl could write the president of the United States and tell him grow a beard brother brandom did not come to say if there's going to be a bride if you were going to overcome you're the final voice to one of the voices he called you the final voice to the final age he called you an invincible Army that's what he called you cuz God put it in his words God told in the corner of your life tell them you are an invincible Army you're going to have to fight for everything you'll never be Tim BR you'll never be Ron Spencer you'll never be Andrew Glover get it in

sorry brother Danny here we are fly in a storm they're built to flut brother Ron I'm in a storm yeah you're supposed to be God didn't call you to be in a picnic he's got you on the scene at the right time he didn't go manyy Mo well I wonder if he'll work I wonder if he'll work he know he saved you to the end he's not guessing sure a lot of people quit but they wouldn't called that's right don't you get your eyes on failures don't give get your eyes on failures and let me just say this to you we land this punch just because you get knocked down tell your neighbor just because you get knocked down don't stay there get up get up get upall break the chains step out of your prison doors walk out take off the dead clothes I'm [Music] free I'm not a winner because what I can do that's right I'm

Dexter this is yours is it okay if I drink yours you can stand how many as you've ever had a nightmare how many of you have ever had a nightmare and you think it can't get no worse than this because in a dream you actually travel somewhere brother the brown said that in a dream you it becomes so living it's emotional you see things you feel things things you sweat you wet the bed you'll remember that statement more you'll remember the last 55 minutes when you wake up you're thred oh yeah it's over Hallelujah did you catch that last part on brother Matt aren't you thrilled that it's over it seems like you've been two hours and was reality it was only a couple seconds but you went places you felt things you you sweated not going there again you throwed the covers off of the bed you was mad at your wife when you got up it was emotional it takes you a couple of hours to get over it but thank God you were woke up now want you just think Satan's in a nightmare since Calvary yeah he doesn't even have the keys to his own house he's no longer the ruler of death and he's tried for 2,000 years to wake up now in this nightmare you have come along now he loves Darkness but you're light now in the the light you shine upon the Cockroaches of the devil and you expose him that's why people maybe many times don't like you but they don't really know you said I'm going to have a child and the devil said oh you'll never do [Music] that and what a nightmare it is for the devil to watch you you don't quit because there's something on the inside of you that just keeps [Music] going aren't you [Music] thrilled aren't you thrilled to be the devil's worst nightmare God built the devil he built it to be his Archen enemy to always believe that he was going to win knowing he wouldn't and God built you to be lights that would never go out that in every dream and every day and every second there you are and you thought before you walked in this service that you was nobody but you are a beacon of light you're a beacon of light and you are our Archen enemies [Music] worst nightmare and if we can say it right he can't wake up Hallelujah don't you love him this morning maybe you're

they're going to kill some enemy are you with me how many caught that the rocks and the criticism is not for my brother and my sister it's not to make fun of nobody it's not to put pressure on
