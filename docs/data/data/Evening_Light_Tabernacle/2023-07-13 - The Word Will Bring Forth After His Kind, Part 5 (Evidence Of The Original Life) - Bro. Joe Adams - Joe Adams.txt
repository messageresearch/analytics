over that seed he brought in a connection with this and then that one Lord to to bring it to this place that it set today Father [Music] and so father we're so thankful that you've been faithful faithful to your promise faithful to your word faithful to your children and we just invite you to come tonight God that you would be the guest speaker you would take these notes lower these stalks tonight that I have set aside and studied and Lord and you would just begin to project him but Lord not only protect him but may they hit their intended purpose their intended Mark tonight may you just give life to the word father now you're anoint our hearts that we can receive our ears to discern Lord the right spirit in which the word is coming forth and father I pray that you will just anoint my lips to bring forth your word Not My Thoughts not my Humanity not Lord our mistakes and our failures Lord and our complexes or any of those things Lord that we as humans deal with but God will stand by on this sacred desk tonight to project Christ to display Christ to give evidence to the life that you have projected in this hour Lord Lord you have a purpose father we want to declare that purpose tonight to your children we ask that you just have your way now Lord in Jesus name amen if you have your Bibles tonight [Music] we're going to look here in Genesis 1 and verse 26. I'd like to speak to you again tonight on the word we'll bring forth after his kind this will be part five of that series but I also want to give it a subtitle tonight evidence of the original life so just trusted you come expecting tonight we just bring our greetings to you we look here and the Bible tells us and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created heed them God bless you you can have your seats tonight so we know from our previous studies that God had a purpose in the very beginning and that purpose was to have a family that purpose was to have a people that would be after his own kind or his own specie people after God's likeness and God was and God is determined to reproduce himself down through every age into the finality which is Us in this hour and we find her in Psalms 1 and verse 1 we're just going to pick up a few scripture readings this evening the Bible says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in the his law doeth he meditate day and night notice where this man is going to be planted the Bible says and he shall be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water many rivers but one water one source so we find that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leave also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper let's look also in Isaiah 43 and verse 5. if you can take some of the highs out and put me some bass in this would be great the Bible says fear not for I am with thee I will bring thy seed that word seed there is Offspring descendants children I will bring thy seed from the East and I will gather thee from the West I will say to the north give up and to the South keep not back bring my sons from afar and my daughters from the ends of the Earth even everyone that is called that word called there is chosen and notice we've read from our previous studies that we were chosen in him and he's telling us everyone that is chosen by my name for I have created him for my glory and I have formed him yea I have made him so we want to look again now we're looking tonight evidence of the original life and this word evidence means confirmation it means verification affirmation documentation declaration manifestation authentication and vindication so we're going to look at that as far as being applied to the original life in Isaiah 43 and verse 21 it says this people have I formed for myself and they shall show forth my praise so this now the people that God chose the people that God created the people that that God has determined they're going to bring forth notice they're not going to bring forth their own effort they're not going to bring forth of their own thinking but they're going to bring forth of my will of my word of my my likeness and everything that God has designed God has declared that he's going to bring forth his life his manifestation through his sonship and he's going to bring it all the way down through seven Church ages and we're going to be the final voice to the final age he's going to have the culmination and we are the culmination and what is God looking for he's looking for evidence of that original life evidence that was in the first seed that he planted and we notice in the end time that same life that was projected there in that seed is the same life that has to manifest in the end time in this seed see he's saying they're going to manifest his attributes and his desires through their lives they're going to bring praise to his name think about it all your failures all your mistakes through your life you're going to bring God praise when you overcome that test when you overcome that trial when you overcome that complex you're not bringing a victory to yourself though you are but yet you're bringing praise to the name of the Lord the one who's called you the one who's chosen you the one who put his own life inside of you what is that it's evidence that you have the Life of Christ [Applause] so let me just go on record to say tonight you're not an accident you're not a mistake God has watched over your seed he has put this one with this one two unlikely sources but brought them together and watched over that seed through Civil Wars through world wars through all kind of accidents and trouble and fire and God is watched over that sea to bring it right down to even like Tabernacle this evening God has watched over that sea you're not a mistake that you're here it's not a must take that that you're a believer of this message it's not a mistake that you're standing in this hour for this present truth you're not a mistake you're the predestinated seeds of God and wonder we're here to do in this hour is a show forth evidence of the original life so God has called you by name he's brought some of us from some of the most craziest places and I'm not talking about different states I'm talking about different places in life some of you are at the bottom of the bottom of the bottom and yet God has established you because he planted a seed inside of that vessel remember the prophet of God said it's not the person that comes predestinated it's the seed so we find so this message is more than just God's sin and the prophet it's more than us just following a bunch of ideas of a man come on church but no this message is to call it's God calling for the evidence God is calling for life to come out of that seed and to begin to manifest who he is that yet I will have a son I will have daughters of God they will be in my likeness they will be in my very image they will manifest the very life that I have so I will say tonight is a predestinated moment I would say it's not by accident that you are here you may just think well I'm just visiting an evening like Tabernacle no you're not visiting just visiting even like Tabernacle God is bringing everything together watching over those seeds and notice what he said in Isaiah 43 and verse 6 he says I will say to the north give up otherwise you can't retain you can't keep my children back you can't keep those seeds dormant any longer they're going to bring forth evidence of their original life Satan you have to take your hands off of God's promise he's going to say to the South keep not back let me tell you the time of Sons and Daughters of God are staying in the wings is over it's time for Sons to come forth It's time for daughters to comfort it's time for the elect to manifest Christ we can't just sit back in a closet and just say whatever we'll be will be it's time that we display the same signs the same wonders the same power the same Authority the same life and God is calling for it Satan take your hands off of my children it's time for them to come forth and bring forth of the same life see Satan Can't Hold Back God seed though he's tried so he's kept some of us in sin so he's kept you covered up and maybe failures and mistakes but when the season comes it's going to be like a tree that's been planted a tree that's been planted by the rivers of water and they're going to do what bring forth his fruit in his season so it's not our fruit it's not our Humanity it's not our or anything that we have to do with it but it's God's fruit and the prophet of God will take from this thought right here from Psalms 1 and verse 1 to verse 3 and he will preach the restoration of the Bride tree you realize that he had never made mention of the Bride tree up until 19 and and 1962 when he preached a restoration of the proprietary but he continued to reference this tree because this tree laid in this tree laid valuable valuable valuable valuable resources and he preached this tree all the way up until 1965 when he preached a Rapture message he was again referencing this broad tree and Satan has done everything that he can to cut this tree down to whack this tree down to keep this tree from produced but I'm here to tell you God has already sent a word out Church he's already sent a promise out you can't keep them back I already told you say take your hands off of those Sons and Daughters will come forth notice he was saying the restoration laboratory he shall bring forth his fruit in his season now watch each his he says the personal pronoun there it's his fruit God's fruit in the season that the prophet is bringing it now brother Timothy preached the message a while back on the season of the bringer so just hang tight because that's where we're headed see God's fruit In God's Time by The Prophet season he shall bring forth his fruit in his season if there isn't to his or he says bring forth his God's fruit see in the season that the messenger is ordained to come he will bring forth those now remember that the messenger that brings the fruit of God will bring it in God's season in the season of the bringer and some of you so stressed out about your love was so so worried about your prodigals but yet God is saying I will bring forth my fruit in my season in the season of the bringer you can't make them a son you can't make them serve God but in the season of the bringer he can't and I'm here to tell you I'm declaring to you tonight we are in the season we are in the season of healing when not even cancer can stand before the believer's prayer we're in the season of Deliverance we're in the season of tongues and interpretation wisdom and discernment we're in the season of the supernatural we are in the season of the bringer church and what is he bringing he's bringing sons of God Daughters of God he's bringing forth the original life [Applause] so we're we're not living in a day when the seed was planted but we're living in a day when the seed is to bring forth his fruit not your own human desires your human efforts but you're to bring forth his fruit what is his fruit these signs shall follow them that believe same signs same wonders same promise same God same power same Authority same manifestation if it was good enough for him shouldn't it be good enough for us if we're made in his likeness Made In His Image and he's wanting us to manifest that and declare that life we should not be ashamed of it people don't want you to talk about the Miracles that God has done shame on us God wants you to bring forth God wants you to make that declaration the evidence is a declaration it's a manifestation it's the Vindication that the life is still here and I'm here to tell the devil there's life on planet Earth come on their sons and daughters of God that has been born again of the spirit and the seed has been quickened and the life is coming forward and they're producing the same size the same wonders the same word with the same results oh come on Church get behind it tonight this is God's promise to you you've got every reason to rejoice and by who God's made you what God's called you to be I know we go through troubles in life but this ain't a time of trouble this is the season of the bringer so we're the Barefoot fruit notice this ain't apples and oranges put the bread for bring forth fruit and the word fruit here is offspring that's what God is looking for he's looking for one thing offspring he's looking for his own so he's bringing forth his sons and his daughters in his season and God sent us a message and God sent it in the season of a prophet what was that message sent for to Quicken the seed it was it was sent to turn the hearts of the other children back to the faith of the fathers that's the purpose of the Prophet that's the purpose of Malachi 4 excuse me and we look here in Revelations 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel we look here in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared unto his service the prophets it's probably a lot worse than I'm not going to struggle tonight so we find here in the days of the voice of the seventh angel the mystery of God should be finished the mystery of what of life then we find also that that uh that we find it is Christ in you is the hope of glory and we look here it's the season are the days of The Voice or the season of The Voice we're living in that day where the voice is already spoke sons and daughters are already becoming the manifestation and we look in Ephesians 1 and verse 3 the Bible would tell us blessed is the god and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ according to the good pleasure of his will in whom we have Redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sin according to the riches of his grace wherein he is abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence having made known unto us and that phrase or having made no means to give to understand so he's given to you to understand the mystery of his will or the hidden purpose of his desire and it's according to his good pleasure or his choice that he has purposed or that he has set forth to bring so here we find God has made known to us not everybody gets this revelation not every seed that lay in the Earth is going to be quick and only the predestinated or to be quickened but the Bible tells us blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly and brother Brandon will use this and he would preach the restoration of the Bride tree and we find that something is in this tree that we must speak about there's something in this tree why would God be so determined to restore this tree see this tree was to bring forth fruit yeah it was to bring forth fruit in God's season and we find here listen what the prophet of God says in the restoration of the broad tree could you please take out some of the highs because I'm still very tingy up here therefore it was predestinated fruit in the root of this tree predestinated fruit in the root of this tree and this tree could not wither because it was holding predestinated fruit that's the tree that Joel spoke about see it cannot die the worms eat it down but it could not die in its root it had predestinated truth it's God's word this tree otherwise Satan has tried to destroy this tree from the very beginning he's done everything he can to keep this broad tree from coming forth he doesn't want her to come to her full potential he doesn't want her to reach her full maturity he doesn't want her to recognize her full power and authority that lays in her he doesn't want this broad tree to bring forth Pride fruit oh but God has already spoken I will restore what does he restoring the same life that was in the root of that tree is going to manifest in Sons and Daughters of God today that's why this broad tree couldn't be destroyed that's why we're here today believing God sent a prophet and what a glorious message is because the original life that was been trying to be attacked through seven Church ages well the devil is trying to get it but God's been more determined to to bring forth sons and daughters in this hour [Music] notice he sent four destroying insects the locusts ate the fellowship man we can't even have Fellowship in the message anymore canker worms ain't to cover in the bark or the religion the caterpillar sucked the life out of it go to some Churches they're not an ounce of life in them sing a couple of songs invite you up a couple more invite you out there's no life and the problem what's the problem do eats the fruit but God said I will restore and we find that in the seventh Church age something begins to happen restoration begins to take place and we find that now these predestinated Seas have been quickened by predestinated messes because it's the prophet season and they begin to bring forth evidence of the original life not their own life not William branham's life not a prophet's life but they're bringing forth evidence of the original life and we look here he said this tree though it's been persecuted it's been made fun of since the very beginning of the Garden of Eden Eden it cannot die it's predestinated it's been clubbed it's been beat and everything done to it and what happened it cannot die he will not die he can't because he's holding in him the predestinated word of God that's what's laying within you that's the importance of this bride tree it has to come forth it see it's his fruit in his own season the predestinated season and Joe said I will restore saith the Lord for the predestination of God lays in the roots of the tree see God could have started with another tree but he didn't he use the same tree and he got down to the root got down to the stump but he didn't start over no He restored from that stump the very same life that was in the beginning is the very same life that's now in manifestation in Sons and Daughters of God the brother man will tell us now in the restoration of the Bright Tree he says now he set an order on the day of Pentecost the tree so on the day of Pentecost you find what Davis how they responded how they acted was the evidence of the original life okay I don't know about you but when I read about Pentecost and I hear about how they acted when they came out they come out stumbling they come out staggering they come out speaking in unknown languages and tongues and different things like that and they thought they were drunk that was the evidence of the original life and yet brother bams would tell us now he said the predestinated was established right there those predestinated Seas was established on the day of Pentecost and it bloomed out on the day of Pentecost and he says what is it doing it's bringing four Sons and Daughters of God the same word through the same Authority through the same power through the same manifestation the things that he did we are to do also so what kind of fruit are we to bring just like he says in John 14 12. he that believeth on me and the works that I do shall you do also Play Hands on the sick we shouldn't be fearful of laying hands on the sick I think our pastor did an excellent job speaking about that on Sunday but don't be afraid you should expect God to do the miraculous before you stretch your hand out you say oh God I believe this is the word and I'm a Son of God and I got the authority through the scriptures to lay my hands on my brother lay my hands on my sister in the same life that you that that projected from you when you walk the shores of Galilee is the very same life that's here in this building tonight and it'll produce the same results with the same Faith every time Church [Music] notice I'm so glad brother bam says now I'm so glad that I believe that God planted a holy ghost seed on the day of Pentecost that hybrided into a denomination but after a while it's going back to its original again back to the real Holy Ghost back to the gospel message back to Acts 2 again back to the former where Back to Where it All Began so why because there's fruit in the root there's life in the stump God's not going to throw the stump away because there's life there what am I telling you you were in the stump you were in the stump the life was in the tree and those Satan's tried everything he can to destroy your life to destroy your seed and destroy your grandparents and great grandparents God still watched over that because he says I'm going to restore I'm going to restore the predestinated fruit and they're going to come up in the last age and they're going to manifest they're going to bring forth evidence of my life of that original life so he would tell us now the Holy Spirit transforms the seed word into its likeness it's like a pear tree it brings forth a pair in an apple tree it brings forth an apple and he said and the word will bring forth Sons and Daughters of God that's what it's supposed to do so if you claim to be a son and daughter of God and yet you don't believe the word that the days of Miracles has passed or you believe that the days is a miracle in the past and it was only for brother Branham but then you don't believe the word of God something is missing the life is missing so we find here in Romans 8 and verse 29 I think I spoke on this just briefly before in the last service from the emphatic dog lot he said because because whom he foreknew he before marked out copies of the likeness of his son to himself otherwise this word copper is a duplicate it's a reproduction it's a reprint it's a replica the thing that is made to be similar or identical to another so we are a replica a similarity we are identical to God how many of you feel like that every day you get up man I feel identical to God today praise God who I'm going to overcome no that's why you got to come back to the word and look at what the word says about it this is what the word tells you you who you are because Satan is trying to destroy that predestinated seed he doesn't want the fruit to come forth from that seed and we find here in the Bible that it would tell us and you that were sometimes alienated alienated and enemies in your mind by Wicked Works yet now hath he reconciled First Corinthians 6 and verse 9 know you not that the unrighteousness shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves what mankind Northeast nor Covetous nor drunkers no rivalers no extortion or shall inherit the kingdom of God and the Bible says in such were some of you but that was the first birth but thank God God doesn't leave us in the first birth condition but God said but you are washed come on you know where we're going with this you were a wash you are Sanctified you are justified in the name of the Lord by the spirit of God God knew that there was another life laying on the inside of it and though Satan tried to cover it up with adultery and idolatry and all this other stuff to keep you from Reaching Your Potential but you are watching that word watch this you are loose today church you've been loosed by the power of God sons of God come forth in the name of Jesus same can't hold over you any longer you've got a promise I will restore I will bring forth fruit in my season and it's the season of the bringer it's to see the first Sons and Daughters of God to manifest his life and it's a perfect blood that's loosed us therefore it's the perfect Lucy but you find Satan he couldn't dig up those Seas the prophet would tell us but he he sprayed them and he deformed the seed and he said he sprayed him with unbelief and doubt and science filled this place where the cavity is and he went into the seed and Satan filled that cavity with knowledge and Science and civilization and it's deformed a whole entire creation of God and see Satan tried to spray Jesus he tried to spray him but he fell see he he had a repellent on him you want to know what that repellent was it was a repellent of predestination see they couldn't take him they couldn't make him a Pharisee or a sad to see they couldn't make him belong to some organization he was God's predestinated spoken word see Satan couldn't throw his unbelief on him he had a repellent on him and brother will say God spray us with the repellent is my spring my prayer well I say God's praying me today with so much going on in our society so many people walking away so much unbelief and doubt that surrounding this message God's pray me with that repellent of predestination Lord let me be filled with the Holy Ghost the keeping power to keep me from giving in to the lives of the enemy he said they tried to get him to do everything one night he was laying on the back of the ship seen him asleep and he said I'll destroy him but he couldn't he tried to tempt him into doing something wrong but he couldn't see he tried to spray him with the repellent but he had a repellent of predestination see they can't be deceived no the word said that he would be here amen there ain't no devil going to bother him nor any other Son of God did you hear that no devil going to bother him nor any other Son of God why because you have been sprayed with a repellent of predestination Satan can't get to that life because God's got a promise over I will bring forth oh Hallelujah that's why you can't be deceived because the elect can't beat himself because it's not your life it's his life that's why you don't belong to a denomination that's why you haven't walked away from this message when so many have it's because you're the spoken word seed with the repellent of the Holy Ghost that's who you are so when you wake up in the morning just let the devil Know Who You Are I am been sprayed Satan with the repellent of predestination I got the Holy Ghost on the inside of me you may make my life a living hell but you can't get down to the Sea you can't get down to the bottom of it because right there it's already been quicker it's already been made alive say you can't do nothing but make my life happy but I want you to know you can't get the life on the inside and I'm here to declare I'm going to produce evidence that it ain't me but it's him if it was my desires I'd be gone but it ain't my desires I'm not walking by my own efforts I'm walking by faith so many people have been sprayed with Satan's reasons his lies is unbelief his doubts people that used to sit Among Us people used to be in some of the meetings where you said 10. they claim but they're free that they're no longer in bondage I still haven't figured that one out they're no longer in bonnet's first thing that happens the wife cuts her hair starts putting on makeup wearing pants drinking they Venture completely out toward they don't even not only do they not believe God's in a prophet and they believe the message is wrong they believe the Bible is wrong and they end up in complete apostasy atheists or agnostics and they claim that they're following the Bible and Bible teachings yet they're breaking every scripture to fit their own selfish desires and the reason being is because they have not received the repellent a predestination the repellent of the Holy Ghost they have not become inoculated with the power of God to overcome Satan poisonous spray of unbelief and doubt but we have but you young people have that's why we can act the way we Act don't get shallowed out that's fine we can act the way we are we're going to go down that road here in just a minute see brother Bama would tell us now don't stumble at this word predestination he goes if you are a Christian now genuine predestinated seed you was in God before you always was in God the germ of life which is an attribute of God which was a thought he says if how many of you are here tonight so in order for you to be here you had to be in the loins of your father and your great-grandfather and great great great great and we can keep on going down you had to be somewhere before you came here right the only thing you were needing was a bedding ground to bring forth that life and so we find the prophet of God say if you wasn't in your father then you wouldn't be here and if you wasn't in God if you believe the message of the Bible and the present messes of the day it's a Vindication of it the reason you are sitting here is because you were predestinated to sit here come on somebody I say glory to God the reason that I'm here tonight and I haven't give up and I'm still pressing the battle it's because I'm predestinated to be here I'm predestinated to push to battle I predestinated to stand when so many have given up and walked away oh that's who I am I'm a predestinated son and daughter of God projecting the evidence of the original life notice you're predestinated he goes you wouldn't have been here otherwise you'd been out on the street maybe drunks some of you may be out there running around with some man's wife or some wife's husband and you know so forth but you are predestinated to be here you can't help it you have a father he is God and you are his seed oh praise the Lord Church man look over your genealogy look over your family tree that family tree is pretty ugly got a lot of sin in that tree got a lot of mishaps in that tree but if you look over in his tree you look over in that original tree you look over there and you say oh fat every fat tree ever puts forth another branch oh when it puts forth it ain't gonna be denominational it ain't gonna be drunk it ain't gonna be a druggie it ain't gonna be a prostitute it's going to be like that original and it's going to protect the original life and it's going to bring forth the original Fruit and it's going to lay hands on the sick and they gonna recover it's going to believe in prayer lives and altar calls and young people coming to God I'm here to tell you we're in a day Church of the branch praying forth more fruit notice what he says predestinated as he was makes the word seed flesh and All Sons and Daughters of God are predestinated man I'm looking at a bunch of predestinated sons of God though you woke up you didn't feel predestinated oh you woke up and all you saw was heartache and shame and difficulty but oh you're predestinated oh Hallelujah notice God foresaw and predestinated a world of sons and daughters he predestinated him to be there but we find that disbelieving God's word caused High breeding but God has put it right back again that you don't have to hybrid anymore you can come right back to the original word and be a Son of God just like you were supposed to be at the beginning oh Hallelujah you think about family strains and I've mentioned this before family Stranger Family attributes and there's attributes in our kids that are yours like my daughter Rebecca you know I was going there he doesn't look like me she's beautiful I'm not she's blonde-headed I'm not she can sing I can't but I'll tell you what she can do she can bring forth the same fire and passion that I can because it's an attribute though she didn't want it she didn't ask for it it was bread in her and if that can be in the natural what about our heavenly father the same attributes of Love of joy and peace of gentleness and all that and you know what it's okay to have a little bit of fire too because God can direct that same fire and that same passion and that same temper he can Channel it so you can be a Satan Destroyer don't worry about oh I'm so high temperate oh what am I going to do with this I'm never gonna make it no you just give that temper to God and let God make out of what he will God can take that temper and Destroy Satan's kingdom and set you as a testimony to show you that that life surrendered to God can bring forth praise to his name because why it's not your life it's his life that he's wanting to protect he says in John 15 and verse 4 I say he this is in red letter in my Bible so it's he about in me and I and you as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide and divine no more can you accept you abide in me I am the vine and you are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing and the message perseverance he said I've seen the other day a tree with nine different citrus fruits they had a pomegranate they had a great fruit of lemon and orange but the original tree wasn't orange and he said Mr shared he said well how is this being that it's an orange tree he said you just split the tree and you graft it in there right he says well then if it brings forth will it bring forth an orange he said no it'll bring forth after his count or after it's kind he says there you are brother when I tell you when churches are grafted into Christ such as they try supposed to be just slid in there by name calling themselves the Churches of Christ and when they do what do they bring to nominational fruits but if the branch ever brings forth another limb it'll be like the first one was and then another message the anointing ones at the end time he says you can graft it in there you see every grapefruit lemon tangelo Tangerine whatever the citrus fruits they are every one of them can live in that tree but they're bearing false witness of the tree living by the tree they're living and thriving on the genuine life of the tree but they're bringing or they're they're manifesting a false witness of the tree because it ain't the original life that's living out from them so denominational fruits denominational seeds can cannot bring forth spoken word offspring denominational seeds will bring forth denominational children that have produced denominational fruit they will bring forth hybrid children who can't breed themselves back to the word oh they can see it God was a Healer yesterday but that's not who he is today see they have a form of godliness but they deny the power of God they will bring forth notice now this denominational fruit they're going to bring forth great teachers who will rely on their education and their human intellect and their human abilities and what have they done they substituted classes for the Holy Ghost experience we have churches now even in the message that's having classes that teach our young boys how to overcome pornography we don't need a class come on church we don't need a class on how to overcome pornography what we need to do is preach the power of the Holy Ghost back in the church get behind the pulprit preach God alive not dead not a god of yesterday but a God all right now with same signs same ones the same keeping power I'm here's a testimony right here that God can give you the overcoming power young men and young women to overcome pornography and lust devils and drink it or any other thing we can't just go around and substitute the power of God for some class we don't need a class we got the original life it's put the original life back behind the pulpit and let him preach if they can't handle the word they ain't of the word before we find notice they have intellectual jobs they preach or they teach psychology now you got to cope with your issues they'll have prayer lines you just got to go figure it out you got kids out of trouble they give you a Dr Dobson tape figure it out listen to him he'll help you with your kids Dr Dawson never entered my house he never stepped foot in my house I ain't giving Dr Dawson credit for my kids nor shall you give Dr Dobson or any Dave Rams or anybody else credit for something that God's already done for you [Applause] oh but what we've done we've taken great great intellectual Giants and they begin to explain the supernatural way they explain to you why we don't need tongues why we don't need why God doesn't heal like he used to the days of Miracles has passed wrong it was only for brother Branham or you can receive the Holy Ghost without a sensation you can receive the Holy Ghost without sensation I guarantee you know what you may not know when you got it but if you ever get it you're gonna you're gonna know that you got it how many of you mothers are are have been or your mother hey how about that you done brought forth the child right you may have not known the exact date that you got pregnant but in nine months there was no deny that you were bringing forth life and what am I telling you the same way with the Holy Ghost you may have not known what service you may have not known what a day you may have known known whatever but eventually you begin to realize that there was something on the inside of it because you begin to respond to the word you begin to move by the word and the word begins to move inside of you and the word begins to come out Hallelujah a word begins to protect itself that there's a life on the inside no longer am I walking by myself but I'm walking with Christ and he's walking with me and he's projecting forth his life they want to explain why you can be healed just in your seat I believe that you can be healed just in your seat there's no sense of having a prayer line that's just a Jewish tradition well your Prophet did it and if it was good enough for a prophet it's good enough for me because I'm staying with the prophet message I had a brother tell me I'll preached some meetings a while back had a brother tell me I had an altar called young people all over the altar for hours they kept coming and they kept moving the church said we have never had an altar call like that in this entire time we've been in church and I had a predominant Pastor come up to me at the end of it he said the miracle of it is is that they acknowledged that they just acknowledged by lifting up their hand we have made the word of God just so watered down that we can just not show forth we could just do it in our and not believe we can do it in our seat but I also believe you've got to respond to it and if there's a real life on the inside of you you're not worried about your neighbor you're not worried about who's looking at you you're not worried you're just worried about one thing I got to get there I got to get in his presence I got to get this seed on the inside quickened by the power of the Holy Ghost but you find great intellectual jobs they begin to explain the word away from you he goes when you explain away the supernatural out of the Bible you're explaining away the very God that you worship he's a supernatural God so denominational Seas bring forth to nominational branches which produce denominational fruit and they rely on Traditions Creeds their interpretation are their churches interpretation of the word their psychology and they can never breed themselves back to the original life see but God didn't plant denominational seeds God planted spoken word see and that's why you're here tonight because you're not some denominational see you're not some Baptist walking in even like Tabernacle trying to project your Baptist ideas or your Pentecostal ideas or your Episcopalian ideas or whatever ideas your own Humanity ideas no but you're here to project The Life of Christ because you are of that Original Seed program says now he said the nominational cities of the churches had been planted the Pentecostal seeds have been planted into the Pentecost organizations by great men like Oral Roberts and Tommy Hicks and Tommy arms and great men and I believe that the word of God has been planted unadulterated away from any of those organizations God has planted a word and the man that's been planted or the tree he's going to be a man is going to be planted like a tree that's been planted by the rivers of water you don't plant a tree when it's full grown you plant it when it's in seed form but you got to put it in the right atmosphere you got to put it where the waters are flowing over it oh when you do he's going to bring forth his fruit in his season it's going to manifest can we look at that just for a little bit as we start trying to wind this down notice he would tell us now and it wasn't so from the beginning he goes you hear people say I'm Presbyterian and I'm Methodist and I'm Baptist and I'm this and I'm that and you got it around our ranks I'm seven Thunders and I'm Perugia and I'm two Soul no soul three Soul however many Souls I'm look I got one man lucky you you got all three of them well you find we got all this I'm this I'm that I'm all this he says that's the way that he says now in the beginning that's the way God said in his church up on the day of Pentecost that's the way it is to Forever remain if you cross anything else up in it in the denominations and all these other things and sprinkling and all the forms and things in your hybrid it you may get a better look in church but it ain't got no life oh it may be a beautiful Church it may be packing 500 people they may be preaching the message of the hour using a very saying quotes but the church is dead and the people are dead because why because there is no life being preached in the church but if you have met God on the backside of that desert and you know that you know that you know that you know that you know that you met him you didn't meet a denominational idea he didn't meet a man's idea but you met him and that seed on the inside of you become quickened you can't help but to bring forth the evidence of his life program says that we need to breathe in the Holy Ghost religion holy ghost power where is God God is in his church God is in his word God is in his people God is in his Universe he's everywhere but we can't hybrid him into something because he won't cross up with nothing he's God and God alone you can't breed him into five or six different things four or five different gods he's God and God alone and he won't hybrid it he's God and God said let me or let us make man in our image and he sends the spirit to do what to Quicken the word to life so he sends the spirit and he says in a spoken word is the Original Seed the seed plant must have seed water before it can grow it must have water to fall before the seed that's been planted can grow so don't be afraid of the spirit father that's not so much for you guys here but that's for those on the stream don't be afraid of the seed falling it's just seed water that's been sent to Quicken the seed plants see the spirit is sent to bring those predestinated Seas to life if you're going to be afraid of anything be afraid when there is no spirit be afraid where there is no anointing be afraid where there is no life be afraid where they don't believe in the Supernatural and then they got cold formal and then different toward the message of the hour though yet they're under the auspice we believe God sent a prophet but we've gotten so revelated we've got the reveal word now that we don't need all that nonsense the nominations were hatch denominations but the word will bring forth the word their word will bring forth the word we find in Joel 2 as we start wrapping up he says be glad all you children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former Reign moderately and he will cause a come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month this word former Reign is the teaching reign and brother Bob says the nominational teaching Reign has gone forth a million more and 44 Baptist so-and-so members and Oral Roberts and them brothers with the Pentecostal move economic great Pentecostal move and they moved up into the millions and the seed has went forth and the word he said for the for the minority of the little group but he says the menorah Reign or the teaching rain the teaching rain went forth Billy Graham has struck the world of Pentecostals has struck the world and the word has struck the world notice all these seeds have been planted at the same time the teaching Reign has gone forth and we've had a great teaching Ministry on the brother Branham it's absolutely placed us where we needed to be it's put you in position you as a Son of God but what he said now now she is waiting for the latter rain and what is that he says that's when she produces her fruits see then the kind of seed that you planted in your field will be the same kind of crop that you'll reap if the denominations want more members that's what they're going to get Pentecostal want more Pentecostals that's what they're going to get but the word is going to produce Sons and Daughters of God and that's coming too so we're living in the day Church of the latter rain that's why some of you act the way you act you can't help it when the latter rain falls on that seed and you begin to act beside yourself doing things you didn't think you would do listen we're living in the day of a lot of rain we're living in a day of the outpouring of quickening power or the seed that had been laid dormant for so many ages has now come to rapturing Faith under a rapturing message and it's quickened that seed and Satan can't keep that bright tree down any longer why because she's manifesting the very Life of Christ see it's gonna Bloom out in the evening time oh my and I'll say this for those that are on the stream and those that may get the archive if brother Branham did not fulfill Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelations 10 7 then where's the man at you tell me where is he at you walked away from a Vindicated message and you said that oh he's a false prophet but you tell me if he didn't fulfill Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation is 10 then where is the one that has to fulfill these scriptures because our hearts have to be turned back the son of man has to be revealed and the Mystery of God has to be made known oh Church don't let them scare you anymore they just not see but the reason why you can believe it the reason why you do believe it is because your heart has been turned back and because the son of man has been revealed to you and the Mystery of Life of your life has been made manifest and you're what are you doing you're producing you're manifesting you're the Vindication that his life is once again on Earth today and is projecting forth and Sons and Daughters of God see this was umbrella Brandon's messes but it was God's message to the elect it was God's voice to Quicken a seed but so many had put their attention on a man and they missed a voice they put their attention on a man and they missed a supernatural power they missed the latter rain they missed the quickening of the seed and today we don't need prayer lines today we don't eat Arthur calls today we don't need all that nonsense speaking in tongues blabbering notice now he says our Traditions our church Creeds will never satisfy our heart that's being called by God you cannot make him say the Apostles Creed or be sprinkled or something like that and be satisfied with it when the hunger of God is in his soul he will go back to Pentecost to the beginning to find the real holy ghost that sets his heart aflame so no Pentecostal so listen let me go back real quick every church that rises up out of the vine will be a Pentecostal Church and people don't want it they don't want that I mean every church that rises out of that Pentecostal Vine is going to be a Pentecostal church and now you say you don't want it you don't want the supernatural you don't want the size you don't want the same thing they had there what are you doing you're rejecting the life you're saying you don't want to but yet when he established his church when he set forth that broad tree he did it on the day of Pentecost because what was he doing he was placing his life in his body and that life is going to manifest down through every age so we find here the very if every church that rises out of that vine will be a Pentecostal church with the same signs notice what he says the same Wonders that the first Vine produce or the first Branch produced it'll be like Pentecost every church that rises out of the vine will be a Pentecostal Church yeah that's your prophet deal with it when you deny the power of God you're denying this word you deny signs and wonders you're denying the word you're been you're denying the life of God so let's just look let's look just real quick I'm gonna pass over some things because I want to just drive it home right here we find here the vine is always energizes the branch and the branch Bears the fruit if the vine cannot bear fruit is depending on the branches and the branch cannot bear fruit until it's energized by the vibe and if a Christian Church is divine or the branch that's in Christ they'll do the works of Christ and bear The Life of Christ but there are fruits you shall know them that's why you scream that's why you respond to the word that's why you say amen that's why some of you catch the anointing and you run around or some of you dance you get excited you get emotional you tear and you cry it's because a life in the vine is being projected through your life but notice they don't want that can I give you some description of the modern Church this is what brother Brown says in the invisible Union of the bride of Christ let me a true picture of the modern church today neither does the modern Church want any of these here screaming shouting tongue speaking Acts 2 38 youngers around her she don't want any of them whooping I like that whoop there it is she don't want that whooping carrying on screaming shouting oh hollering amen hallelujah such a child would immediately put her out of her denomination they had one like that in one of our churches they had Thor out right quick notice the evidence this was the modern Church didn't want this evidence in their church so if they didn't want this what is it it must be the evidence of the original life what is original life producing signs and wonders screaming whooping and hollering amen glory to God they believe in laying on hands they believe in healing the same they believe in the power of the Supernatural and yet the moderate Church don't want it they don't want that original life notice he says now the modern church is pregnated with something because she's bringing forth members all the time but she don't want none of them screaming hollering blabbering Acts 2 38 miserable creatures that she thinks they are it was certainly embarrass her well there's a lot of embarrassed pastors today a lot embarrassed churches around this message they don't want what we got let me just it ain't what we got it's what the word is they don't want it let me just say and don't ever Harden your heart and get so critical that you don't want this he says it was certainly embarrassing it would ruin her and her educated ethical scientific Society Church that she belonged to there they would throw her out at the next Council she can't have it she don't want to be pregnant with the word because that's the only kind that the word can bring forth oh did you hear what he said the only kind that the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh that's why you screamed that's why you shout that's why you dance that's why you respond to her because you are the word that's been made flesh in this hour oh but now that's so-called bride pregnant with all kind of tummy right disgrace and what is she doing oh she's bringing forth members all the time but she ain't bringing forth the word see born of the spirit of God it has to bring forth the spirit of God in it no intellectual Church John Creek going bobbed hair pain and Faith there's no such a thing as that in all of it you don't find that in the word of God you find notice what you find in the word of God in the original life you find an old-fashioned Sanctified holy ghost-filled child born of the spirit of God screaming oh did y'all hear that screaming hollering shouting praising God he didn't say nothing about being cold dead formal snoring in church falling asleep can't stay awake he said no what you find in that old old-fashioned church is old-fashioned Holy Ghost Field child born of the spirit of God screaming when they hear the word that's good hollering when they were hear the word that's good shouting when they hear the good word praising God because he's there and he's projecting their life he said she don't want it no indeedy what does she do then she brings all forth a pair of painted face short wearing Jezebel Society illegitimate cancer they called it oh he goes I think that's what it is look like a cat going on there but the word can only bring forth the word he says her sons are born out of her they rely on education school and some Bible schools so-called some great College that's supposed to be a long time ago hatching them out some sort of income Baker Style denominational Seekers religious came like just illegitimate to the word as Cain was just as illegitimate God never did recognize denomination he's always been against it his word is against it but if Christ is in the church musicians can come if Christ is in the church it will bear a christ-like spirit christ-like works christ-like faith if it's properly connected a good healthy Vine not cut off hanging down withering away but real good healthy Branch connected into the vine will bring forth the fruits of the spirit The Works that I do shall you do also see the true church the True Church of Jesus Christ the bride is like in a pure gold her righteousness is his righteousness her attributes are his own glorious attributes her identity is found in him what he is she is to reflect what he has she is to manifest there is no fault in her she is all glorious within and without from the beginning to the ending she is the work of her Lord and all his works are perfect in fact in her is summed up and manifested the Eternal wisdom and purpose of God in God's Eternal purpose was to bring forth a family to make Man In His Image and you are that word you are the fruit that is being made manifest today and the prophet of God will say there is no fault in you and if he doesn't find fault and you don't worry about all these naysayers don't worry about all these other ones finding fault in your jumping your joy and your Victory and everything of that and try to keep you suppressed and keep down and beat down notice what he says as I close and brother Timothy would come let me just get there brother Graham says in Christ the mystery God revealed we are his victory you and all your failures all your complexes all your mishaps all your mistakes you are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for this purpose and we are the proof of his victory what do you mean the proof of his victory because it's his life that's now manifesting through you you young people the world's enticing you with everything it can throwing everything on the websites and billboards and everything else everything to gratify this flesh but your proof of his victory you're proof that this word Works your proof that the life that was deposited on the day of Pentecost is the very same life that's on display tonight the same power same word he says notice he died for that purpose and we are the proof of his victory when we see him coming down living among the church that's his victory shows that they couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep us that's right we're bound right we're already potentially a raise because we raised from the dead unbelief in the word from denominational creatures to the Eternal Word of an eternal God which is him himself working through US manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever he said then the word moves on down into the body from the head what is it the same word nothing can be added to it or taken from it so the same word moves from the head as a date as a day comes to close down into the body down into the body vindicating that they are what he is you are to project [Music] same word same power same life same signs flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life she is him and brother Brown will say the biggest problem that I find with the church today is they fail to recognize who they are I told you I was going to keep preaching you until you realize who you are you are the Vindication of his life you're the victory his sole purpose for going to Calvary and going down the hill and raising again was so that you could be here today so that you could be the evidence of his life would you buy your heads just for a minute as we bring this to a close maybe you've been struggling with questions maybe you've been struggling with who you are and maybe there's been a desire on the inside for something more I want you to know I want you to know tonight there's more for you there's a life that goes beyond Mama's life daddy's life preacher's life pastor's life there's a life your home may be destroyed right now Satan may have come in and try to divide the family and divide the home and bring in all kind of persecution but I want you to know he can't touch the life he can't touch the life that's in that seed had been beat down has been clubbed has been persecuted the leaves have been ate off of it life has been stripped out of it the fruit has been eat off of it but there's a word I will restore because there's predestinated fruit in the root and I'm looking at predestinated Sons and Daughters of God tonight if you've got a knee just slip your hand up say God I got a need I want to be exactly what this word is called me to be I want to be the very manifestation I want to be the evidence of that original life that you can take someone maybe from a broken home maybe who have been adopted and it seems like I was you know wasn't loved and wasn't cared for but God you have washed over that seed and put it in the right home in the right family to come in contact with this word if that's you till I just lift your hand before God and say God I need a touch from you today God sees your hands God sees your hand but more importantly God sees your heart father you see every hand that was lifted tonight Lord every heart every need behind the heart the hand that was lifted father we just believe that your word is the same Lord we don't have to look at you as a god of History that Lord you did something yesterday but yet you're not able to do it today Lord you did many mighty Miracles two thousand years ago Lord when you were in your human form and you walked on those Shores Lord and you heal blinded eyes and you raised from the dead and God you healed the cripples and you Lord you deliver the lepers you've done so many marvelous and mighty works and yet Lord 60 years ago there was a mighty move of God I went through our country and around the world through a prophet Ministry and Lord and you replicated the very same things that you've done in your own Ministry Lord you repeated it in the ministry of a prophet but God you didn't intend for those things to die with the prophet but God you intended to produce more Sons more Daughters of God that would take you at your word and have that same life living on the inside so when we come face to face with a demon and we have the authority through your word Lord to cast it out Lord that when we come and we lay hands on the sick we have the authority through your word father because we've seen it perform we see how the life responded before and we know how to act today and I just asked today God every hand that was lifted that you administered to the need he will speak to their Heart Lord he'll move on those that are here locally those on the archive father to strength may just have your way Lord in every heart and every life maybe they not be ashamed of the moving of the spirit when the rain begins to fall we have every reason to Rejoice however that is Lord whether it be tears of joy that stream off our faces whether it be emotion that maybe overtakes us God and we get excited and jump however whenever whoever God our desire is to let the Life of Christ be made manifest so we just Commit This service to you now Lord in Jesus name [Music] call me to be I'll say [Music] Lord I agree my desires [Music] that's why yes [Music] Lord I agree my desire [Music] s is to be what you call me to be that's what I'll be [Music] I will be what you call me [Music] this is that's what I'll be one more time I will be once you once you call me [Music] my desire
