mother-in-law she's been diagnosed with cancer and expect her to pass away soon and asking for prayer for her salvation I also have a co-worker I've worked with for many many years that was just recently diagnosed with cancer told her that we would be praying for her her name is Lou and there's many other needs I'm sure tonight I want to continue to remember brother Tim as he's away brother Timothy's preaching in Arkansas this evening remember the Ron sister Erica brother Kenneth I mean if you have a need I don't believe he's here tonight to answer it [Music] amen sister Jessica and I went about this this evening to see brother Kenneth we had a good visit with him you know he is in great spirits but he's very very very weak and he very he has barely any voice so he's very quiet and you have to really get close to listen to him but we got to visit with him for a little bit and just reminisce and um you know brother Kenneth has been a testimony to this church you know how a man can go and go astray but yet God can bring him back to the fold and when God brought him back God brought him back it wasn't halfway but he brought him all the way back and he he church was his life it was his priority it was his focus it was everything that pleased him and I just told him I said brother Kenneth you have been a testimony for all these years how a man can go astray but yet because that seed is there God brings him back I said you've never missed a service unwillingly but even when you're in a hospital room you get out on a Tuesday you're there on a Wednesday and you know you're you're missed we miss you and when we was leaving I said brother Kenneth is there anything that you would like me to tell the church on your behalf today he said you tell them I love them and because you tell them I miss him that's a soldier Church a pillar in our church and yet we don't know what God's will is we know God's will is to heal but if that's on the other side he'd show me a picture he said brother Joe he said you see that picture right there he was about 20 years old he was a good looking man he goes I'm going back to that I said you're exactly right I said but if God is if God wants you to stay around a little bit longer we want that as well but if not that's what you're going to church that's the testimony for all of us this life is just you know it's a lot of heartache and a lot of Trials but we look Beyond this vessel we look Beyond this life look beyond your strains and the difficulties we got a new body and brother Kenneth if if gotcha Terry if he doesn't if it's time for him to go home what a testimony he's been to our church what a testimony so we just want to remember him and he just asked me to say that on his behalf tonight and I know if he could be here he's probably streaming he would be right there I said when you get ready we got a little spot reserved for you back there in the back so if God should Terry and give you strength and uh extend your days you know you got a place here at even like Tabernacle and I believe that goes for all of us this is home this is church to those that have been gone for a few Services welcome home Elijah good to have you home good to see you tonight and we got sister Danette here on a Wednesday night so good to see her church when you go around and you realize it we're a blessed Church to have what we got the body that we have tonight don't take it for granted every one of you are special not only to the ministry not only to the church but you're special to each other just recognize look at the qualities the great qualities that we each possess so different so unique but yet we're one so I just want to just encourage you tonight to look Beyond maybe some things that have happened in the past and some things that may have rubbed you the wrong way and let's just put our shoulders to the wheel and look to the prize to the mark of the high call and say Lord that's where I'm headed all this other stuff it's just futile it's just things are trying to get me off course but Lord my I got my eyes set on the prize so let's just pray tonight father we just feel your spirit even here right now Lord what a great opportunity that we have to approach your people come to recognize what a special people we are not because we have made ourselves anything Lord you called Abraham not because he was better than anyone else but because he was chosen and Lord I believe that this church here and those that are on the stream tonight those had to be getting the archive many weeks from now father I believe that we share something so special with the elect of God called chosen for this purpose for this age for this time and father my prayer tonight would be that you would bind us closer together than we've ever been before may we just let the bygones be bygones Lord let's put those things in the past may we press to the mark of the High Calling May we see the goal that's ahead of us Lord a new body a heaven a rain Lord just to live with you through the eternities Lord so I pray tonight father for a church you see how the Devils try to come in and kind of cause some division here but Lord I'm asking that you unify us closer than we've ever been before father God may we just wrap our arms around one another and said you know what the things that we have faced are not worth it let's move forward let's be an encouragement to one another as the Bible says encourage one another as you see that day approaching so Lord may we do our part tonight and Lord we want to pray for the needs that were mentioned those who are recently diagnosed with cancer God made your loving hand just reach down to them right now God made the healing power in the healing virtues that you so wrought in Christ may they just be extended to them in their needs Lord brother Ron says to Erica father it's touched them restore strength to their bodies Lord those weakened vessels God undergoing chemo and Lord just the difficulties of fighting cancer God may you get the total victory Lord we pray for brother Kenneth tonight that you'd restore strength to Him Father Lord his spirits are high his vessel is weak and we pray that his vessel will match his Spirit father but Lord we also know but if it's your turn your time to take him on to the other side for his graduation God may he not be in pain and may he not linger but father may he go with his arms wide open father this is what he's given his last 20 something years of his life for is for that moment that he'll meet you but God we just commit him to you we commit the Middleton family to you Lord we pray that your arm will go out to the family the sons and the daughters Lord of that family that are wavered in astray right now May the loving God come down I may may they witness to the life of their father and their grandfather a real Christian a real believer and may they begin to hunger for what he possessed so we just Commit This Time to you tonight I ask that you will use brother Aaron Lord does he have set aside time and study Lord may you anoint your servant to break the bread of life bless his service now Lord we ask in Jesus name amen amen [Music] so enjoy that thank you brother Joe brother's gonna take up the offering [Music] let the glory of the Lord rise among us let the glory of the Lord rise among us [Music] pray [Music]

him that's our one purpose for Gathering is to praise him that's what we're here for amen but before we get into the word let's just pray our gracious Heavenly Father Lord we come before you tonight Lord humbly Lord knowing what you've laid on my heart and seeing Lord it laid here before me in different forms Lord I pray that you'll just bring it together and deliver your thought to the people Lord or may it not be me help me to to relax and move out of the way and just speak it the way you dropped it into my heart father and Lord may it all be delivered Lord in love and and kindness Lord the way you showed me Lord as you dealt with me on it Lord because at the end of the day we we need one another lord I can't Rapture without every other person whose names on that Lamb's Book of Life I need them ready they need me ready and Lord we need you so I'm asking you to come and take this service now take control speak father anoint my lips anoint this word Lord and in Jesus name we pray amen amen if you have your Bibles you'll turn with me to the book of Acts the second chapter we're going to read verses one through four have a whole lot of scriptures and quotes and so uh quickly threw together a PowerPoint this afternoon just so you'd have some visuals something to go along with me when you have a lot of reading to do it's nice to give people something to look at and as I was uh I was mowing out here on Monday and the Lord dropped this thought into my heart it just came to me while I was there on the lawnmower and I he began to deal with me personally about some of my own attitudes and my own thoughts and reminded me once again why we do what we do why do we come together why do we have church why why was the message sent in this day what was it sent to restore us and and are we just another religion or are we just a group of people or are we striving towards a goal are we still looking at the promise are we still remembering who we are called to be and he began to deal with me and and just gave me so many different scriptures and quotes and things and I just wanted to bring it to you tonight and pray that he'll help me acts 2-1 we're going to speak tonight on The Power of One mind The Power of One mind it says and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as of a fire and it's set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen pray that the Lord will add his Blessing to the word as you have your seats this evening and we're going to try this tonight to be maybe kind of how it is with the youth Bible study and I'm gonna try to control this we'll see how this goes but verse 1 here says that they were all in one Accord and in other places it says similar things it'll say they're in one mind and one Accord uh many places just like here it just speaks of them being in one Accord and sometimes one mind one Accord things like that are are interpreted almost interchangeably that they mean the same thing but as we look through this tonight being in one Accord refers to a Unity of purpose it's a Unity of purpose in other words we all have the same purpose that's what it's saying here when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were in unity of purpose their mind was all on the same thing and they have the same goals and and what happens is when we focus on the same things and we have the same goals it brings about a Unity whenever we can keep our eyes on the same goal and it unifies a people and and goals bring about unity and as we look at this we often in this church Preach about another book of Acts and we talk about a repeat of the book of Acts and the prophet would tell us that if that vine ever puts forth another Branch it would write another book of Acts behind it and we've been teaching the church ages to to the youth and dealing with that first age and that early church and brother Branham tells us that that first church was the pattern he says there is no other pattern and he's very clear about this he says thus what the church was at Pentecost is the standard that is the pattern there is no other pattern no matter what the scholars say God has not changed that pattern what God did at Pentecost he has to keep on doing until the church ages close amen do you believe that tonight amen well be careful what you say because in order to believe that it's got to be more than just a quote because you've got to be ready for a lot of things to come your way if you're ready to say you believe that amen you got to be ready for for so if we're going to match that if that's what we're going to be we got a lot to live up to there's also a lot of things that we're going to have to be okay with if we say we believe that quote amen it's got to be more than a quote because you can't believe that quote and preach against the gifts you can't believe that quote and say we shouldn't have tongues in the church you can't believe that quote and preach against the experience of a new birth you can't believe that quote and preach against prayer lines because the church first church age had prayer lines amen I love how he says it here I'd never seen this quote before he says and we find that in the book of Acts the second chapter we find the kind of church that was decided on I love that God decided on this is the kind of church I'm going to have he says what type of church what would the church be this my favorite part well we're not all going to react the same okay how would be the reaction of the church when it received Christ how are we supposed to act when the Holy Ghost falls in the church he says in Acts chapter 2 it was decided on how you're supposed to act when the Holy Ghost comes in the church so if you want to know how we're supposed to act go read Acts chapter 2. he says I love that and I am earnestly contending for that church that was once established on the day of Pentecost do we believe that amen I do so so as we go into this I would like to encourage each and every one of you to go read the book of Acts look I'm sure you have before but go read it again go as I read through it I was it just it blows your mind all the amazing things that took place in such a short period of time you know if the early church is what we're supposed to look like then I think we ought to know what was going on in the early church I think we ought to become familiar if we're looking to write another chapter of the book of Acts we ought to know what the book says so I encourage you once again to go back and read that and as you read it and study it you're going to find a Common Thread you're going to find that anytime they have a great outpouring or a shaking of the Holy Ghost when there are Mighty moves and when there are Miracles when God is able to show his power in the church you will find Unity amongst the brethren every time that that is a theme there acts acts 1. we're gonna go through a lot of scriptures so just bear with me acts 1 12-14 it says then return they unto Jerusalem from the mount call Olive which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath Day's Journey and when they were come in they went up into an upper room where a boat both Peter and James and John and Andrew and Philip Thomas Bartholomew Matthew James the son about Fierce and Simon zealots and Judas the brother of James these all continued with one Accord in prayer and supplication with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus with his brethren chapter 2 verse 46 and they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily as should be saved they're adding to the church daily and they're within one Accord there's not a bunch of bickering going on amongst the people to make other people go I don't know I don't want whatever is they have I don't want whatever they got but they notice these people are in one Accord in chapter four it tells us that that Peter and John are before the council and they're threatened and they're told to never teach or preach in the name of Jesus and they come back to prayer with the other as acts 4 verse 23 and being let go they went to their own company and reported all that the chief priests and Elders had said unto them and when they had heard that they lifted up their voice to God with one Accord and and said Lord Thou Art God which has made Heaven and Earth the sea and all that in them is remember what is one Accord Unity of purpose striving for the same thing and it goes on to tell us in verse 31 after they had prayed in one Accord what happens and when they had prayed the place was shaken where they were assembled together and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and they spake the word of God with boldness and the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and one Soul neither said any of them that ought of things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and great grace was upon them every time in one Accord every time in singleness of heart every time with one purpose chapter 5 verse 12 it says and by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought amongst the people and they were all with one Accord every time signs and wonders one Accord one mind and one Accord the Holy Ghost Falls one mind and one Accord Miracles are done every single time and then after this it says they're in one mind in one Accord then it goes on to tell all that is being done this is just two verses later and the Believers were the more added to the Lord multitudes both men and women and so much that they brought forth the sick into the streets and laid them on beds and couches that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them there came also multitude out of the city's roundabout unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed every one doesn't this sound like the kind of church we want to be at evening like Tabernacle come on sick folks come on those Vex with the spirit come on those in trouble they will be healed and delivered everyone that's the pattern that's what we're supposed to be but there's another part to the pattern they were in one Accord they have the same mind and the same goals here in the first few chapters of Acts it's a theme same goals same mind one Accord all striving for the same purpose and with that comes the results with that comes the Holy Ghost with that comes the Miracles they all have the same goal what was the same goal or should I say who was the same goal who was it Jesus what was their cry what was their goal Jesus we must have more of Jesus we got to have Jesus we got to show Jesus to the people we've got to give Jesus to the people Jesus has to be told everywhere people need to know about Jesus and it was burning in their heart and it burned in this one and this one and this one and this one and this one and this one and this one it burned in them it was the goal Jesus we've got to give the people Jesus and how could they give the people Jesus because they had Jesus on the inside to give it wasn't just a sermon it wasn't just a new doctrine they had the Jesus of Galilee now walking amongst 120 spreading the gospel everywhere what was the goal it was Jesus give the people Jesus that same life that had walked in one person on the shores of Galilee was now walking around in them and they weren't just witnessing although that's good they weren't just preaching although that's good they weren't just teaching although that's good they weren't just helping the poor although that's good they were demonstrating the life they were demonstrating the power of the Holy Ghost and they were getting people to the Holy Ghost time after time you'll read and they received the Holy Ghost I took these right out of Acts they were filled with the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost fell on them the Holy Ghost came on them they laid hands on them giving them the Holy Ghost when Paul goes then he finds believers he doesn't say oh great I found Believers the first thing he says is have you received the Holy Ghost they weren't content with just having Believers but they were getting them to the New Birth they were getting them to the Holy Ghost listen I don't think we have to be ashamed that evening like Tabernacle that we preach the Holy Ghost because it's the pattern it's all in the scripture we don't have to be ashamed that we preach receiving the new birth amen we don't have to be ashamed that we preach Miracles we don't have to be ashamed that we preach tongues we don't have to be ashamed that we preach signs and we preach wonders we don't have to be ashamed because we're just lining up to the pattern of the scripture I would be ashamed if we didn't I'd be ashamed if we didn't preach it but today I say it's the same he's the same God he's a living God it's the same life the same power it's the same New Birth and we gotta get people to it Hallelujah acts as the pattern and if you're not pattering after God's pattern then what pattern are you after let's look at it there's a lot of these let's look at the pattern while we don't have to be ashamed to preach the new birth shame to the Holy Ghost shamed of tongues shamed of Miracles Acts 2 and 4 and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues pattern as the spirit gave them utterance Acts 3 and 6 then Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None but such as I have I give thee in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk well I'm shocked he didn't break into expounding the seals and and then the godhead and do you understand that the mystery of the godhead I have a new doctrine to give you I have a book to hand you no he gave him life he demonstrated the same life five and six there came also a multitude out of the Cities round about unto Jerusalem bringing sick folks and them which were vexed with unclean spirits and they were healed everyone acts 6 and 8 and Stephen Full of faith and power did great wonders and miracles amongst the people pattern well I don't think we need super men and super preachers and these testifying of the book of Acts testified about everything they did the books of the book of Acts bragged about it I don't have a problem bragging on my God I don't have a problem telling what my gods do and that my God still saves my God still heals my God still delivers my God still fills with the spirit my God still sets free from lukewarmness my God's Gonna Change my body my God's Gonna Take Me In A Rapture my God is a warrior God my God overcomes every devil in hell I don't have a problem bragged about my God tell the world who he is show the world who he is Acts 8. six through seven and the people with one Accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake hearing and seeing the Miracles which he did for unclean spirits crying with loud voices came out of many that were possessed with them and many taken with palsies that were lame were healed pattern brother Branham says that the true church will always try to emulate try to be like that first church acts 15 and 12 then all the multitude kept silent and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul declaring What miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them and when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Ghost came on them and they spake with tongues and prophesied well we're not supposed to prophesy pattern I know this is very fourth gradish but the scripture makes it pretty simple the scripture lays it out I I purposely went scripture after scripture and quote after quote so you can't leave going that's the opinion of even even like Tabernacle that's the opinion of brother Aaron that's the opinion of brother Joe or brother Timothy or brother Tim this is the scripture acts 28 9 and it came to pass that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and of a bloody flux to whom Paul entered in and prayed and laid his hands on him and healed him so when this was done others also which had diseases in the island came and were healed well I believe y'all Focus too much on the gifts and the Supernatural and it's the pattern we can't preach it enough if anything we don't say it enough We Don't Preach it enough we don't see it enough this is the pattern we should come every service believe and there's going to be healing there's going to be salvation there's going to be Deliverance devils are going to be cast out prison bars are going to come open it has to it has to because it has to repeat again if we come in the same way they came in one mind and one Accord it's the pattern the pattern is to fulfill John 14 12. that was their goal they were focused what was their goal to manifest Jesus it was their goal to fulfill John 14 12. we look at it and go well somebody's going to do it no they woke up every day going come on we got people to heal we got Devils to go cast out there's people on Wednesday night going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost I can't wait to get there I'm ready listen there's too many of us that Wednesday night service interrupts our schedule and when it's something that interrupts our schedule then we don't come with expectation we come begrudgingly we gotta go to church tonight come on no sir I'm ready to go to church I'm excited to go to church I'm fired up for what God's gonna do because I read what he does in the true church I read how he operates in the True Vine and I believe that's me and I'm here to say pour it out Lord pour it out Lord that's who we are [Applause] their goal was to be full of the spirit listen the book of Acts was not satisfied with one time the book of Acts was not satisfied with being able to say well I was in the upper room imagine that there's a lot of it satisfied with saying 20 years ago I know I received the Holy Ghost good I mean I ain't mad at you I hope you have that testimony but I hope you're not satisfied I hope they're still a hunger and I hope there listen we already read it in Acts 4. the very people who received the Holy Ghost in Acts 2 gathered together again two chapters later not 20 years later two chapters later and they've gotten one mind and one Accord again and the building was shook again and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost again I say shake the building tonight Lord shake the building tonight shake this building shake my soul shake my heart I need another fresh outpouring get my mind back on the goal get my mind back on the purpose it's Jesus it's a Rapture it's going home getting me focused again Lord Jesus yes these are the same folks that just received the Holy Ghost and they're saying we got to get together and get the Holy Ghost they weren't satisfied they had to have more we can't be satisfied but when let's constantly be seeking more keeping our hearts and Minds centered on that one goal what's our goal more of Jesus we must match that pattern they woke up every morning on John 14 12. and they did it and then we're looking back at the pattern going we must match the pattern we must match the pattern listen if you don't want to match the pattern I'm not going to argue with you I'm just telling you the people that Rapture are going to match the pattern if you want to rapture match the pattern he already cut it out it's following directions it's simple this is what I'm coming for well I don't want to do this ain't for debate this is what I'm coming for Hey Brother Branham said in chapter two he decided what his church would be like he decided it's not up for us to argue with you we got to match the pattern I say let him move again tonight in this church Lord pour out another dose and even like Tabernacle shake this place again Jesus in our life Jesus in our services Jesus in our homes we must have him brother Branham says some of you trying to test an experience or trust it that they had 10 years ago he said that's all right but what about today you need one today is the day sure a feeling the disciples about three or four days after they received the Holy Ghost went back and got in one Accord and began to pray again with one Accord until the Holy Ghost shook the building where they were sitting amen what we need these early Christians they were human just like you and me with differences just like you and me but they were so focused on the goal they were so focused too focused on the goal to let those things derail them or bother them because their eyes were on the go and when you study acts you can find disagreements and you can find arguments it's called Humanity it's there listen most of us all we need to have a good argument is just another person in the room now multiply that but I don't know how many is here tonight 175 200 I don't know we've got some good arguments with one or two some good disagreements with one or two multiply that by everything around us multiply the book of Acts with all those people around us but the book of Acts isn't about that it's about the acts of the Holy Spirit not the acts of men and the takeaway from it should not be to justify our disagreements because well you see disagreements in the book of Acts 2 so obviously we're gonna that's not what it's there for to justify those things but what we should see is how people who are completely surrendered to God and have the same goal can lay aside their differences and allow God to move how he wants to move church if we can ever get in one mind if we could ever get in one mind I I thought about it the other day I was I wonder how close we've ever come percentage-wise I wonder what the closest we ever came to where every single person in the building did not have any other thought other than Jesus even tonight how many of us since I've been preaching have had thoughts other than Jesus me thoughts come but do you allow it to derail you and begin to dwell and begin to go down that path you see what I'm saying I wonder how close we've ever come to one mind and one in court to where we got our mind on the goal and when you get your mind on the goal then the differences and and the arguing and the things that we don't see eye to eye on begin to get pushed aside because I don't have time to look at our differences if I'm looking at what we're agreeing on if I'm looking at the Gold then those things are pushed aside and our differences don't have time to become our Focus you can always tell when when somebody has lost focus on the goal when when their focus isn't directly on Jesus or directly on a Rapture because negativity begins to dominate their conversations and their attitudes and it's just a focused thing it's not that that person's loss it's just their focus is off and you can't have a conversation with them without them telling you about what's wrong with this person or what's wrong with the church and what's wrong with this and what's wrong with that and who's wrong and what's wrong where's your focus what are you looking at what are you dwelling on but this early church who was our pattern was able to lay that aside the reality is in a in a group this size let's talk real for a minute I've talked about this with the young people we can talk about as adults if the young people can handle it you can in a group this size or even in a group much smaller than this guess what we are not all going to be best friends truth we're not and guess what I don't say that in a bad way that's okay that's okay that's life we're not all going to be best friends but all of us being best friends isn't the goal that's not what we come to evening like Tabernacle fours to all be best friends now we should all be able to get along in brotherly love there's a big difference but we're not all going to be best friends that's not our goal we are all wonderful people but my goal is not to win your approval my goal is not to make you happy neither should your goal be to win my approval or make me happy our goal should be I want to see Jesus I need more of Jesus I gather together because the scripture tells me to gather together and when I do it it shows me what I'm supposed to expect there's a pattern and so I'm gathering together to obey the word and I'm getting in one mind and one Accord so God can move the way God wants to move amongst his people that's the goal that's why we're here that's what we're doing move Lord Jesus Save Tonight Lord Jesus heal tonight Lord Jesus do your works tonight Lord Jesus that's why we're here I've got to have more of Jesus I've got to have I want to see people saved I want to see people born again I want people to be helped I want God to be able to move like he did in that first church and in order for that to happen we have to be in one mind and one Accord this is two quotes here the first one he says 1954 expectation when we get in one Accord then then God comes down see he says on the day of Pentecost what made the Holy Spirit Come this is very cut and dry what made the Holy Spirit Come they was in one Accord that's what made the Holy Spirit Come but Aaron I want to see move in every service I want to break out in this earth what you looking at tonight what's your goal tonight what did you come here focused on he says and now that's way we ought to be now and then the Holy Spirit can come on us it's so simple and yet because we're humans it's so difficult we went to work today there's a lot on our mind we got pressure there's a lot on our mind we've been sick there's a lot on our mind we're trying to raise kids there's a lot on our mind there's a cute baby three rows in front of me there's a lot on my mind or a bad baby either one there's a lot on our mind and so it's hard to push through the humanity we're not talking about sinful things talking about getting our mind locked in getting our spirit locked in getting our souls in one mind and one Accord so we don't have to agree on every decision we're never going to it's hard to get your family to agree on where to go out to eat or if you're in my family it's hard to cook something that everybody will eat imagine trying to feed the sheep and find something that everybody's going to eat come on you can cook steak at home and there's gonna be somebody that goes I don't eat it well me neither but that's what's on the table that's what Mama served and I can't help what the Lord laid on my heart tonight but I'm telling you that's what's on the table and we got to make a decision Lord am I going to eat it am I going to take it and recognize that maybe I've been one that's hindered I only say all this because the Lord was saying this to me on the lawnmower have you been one that's hindered have you had attitude problems have you had attitudes about people's attitudes oh no that's no joke that hit me right in the face have you been upset about other people's attitudes he said you're hindering I think I just made it to her no one's innocent but we want the Holy Spirit to come down on us and the more we're in one mind this is back to the percentage thing the greater percentage we get in one mind and one Accord the greater he can pour himself out the more he can reveal himself listen are you talking about us running around the building no the holy spirit moves in many ways there's lots of times where nobody gets out in the aisle and I don't mean the Holy Spirit didn't move in Mighty ways in people's heart I'm not looking people get it confused okay the Run and Jump and shouting dancing that I love is not the moving of the spirit it's our response to the moving of the spirit but we don't always respond that way so that's not even what I'm talking about I'm talking about him dealing with hearts I'm talking about him saving Souls talking about him Healing The Sick and delivering the bound and all the works of the Holy Spirit and if that so manifests itself in gifts and tongues and shouting and dance so be it but I want to make it clear I'm just talking about him doing the work that he wants to do tonight don't hinder what he wants to do tonight or Sunday or the following or even Tuesday in your home because our attitudes can affect a lot more than a church service it's okay if we don't agree as a matter of fact you don't even have to like me you don't have to like the Deacons am I wrong bro Joe yeah but you gotta love them bless their hearts there is there's a difference that's not our goal but what you find with mature Christians is that their likes and dislikes and their disagreements are easily laid aside for the cause of Christ and it's a maturity thing we don't bicker and throw Tantrums as if we're still in elementary school you may get just as mad as you did when you were in Middle School just as mad as you did when you were young but now you know how to go that's not what this is all about and you push it aside and you progress why why do I have to do that I wanted it so that he can have his way it's about him you have to be willing to overlook my faults and I have to be willing to overlook your faults you have to be willing to overlook my failures and I have to be willing to overlook your failures and together we have to be willing to let go of hurts and perceive slights and move past our differences for the goal and that's what they were able to do I'm going to mature church is willing to just do that push those things aside and what you're going to find is as we get closer and closer to the end in that Original Seed begins to manifest more and more and it becomes more and more apparent that the vine is sprouting out another Branch then Satan's going to come in and attack the very thing that allows God's work to be done Unity that's where he's going to attack one mind and one Accord that's what he's going to attack listen this isn't the time to be double-minded this isn't the time to be a Suede and pulled back and forth from one opinion to another it's not the time to chase after this thought or the or to be caught up in this debate or caught up in this argument it's time that we come together in one mind and one Accord with our goal on the Rapture our goal on seeing the Lost return our goal on the prodigal's coming back our goal on the sick being healed whatever you have need of tonight the depression being lifted off of this brother or this sister Joy being returned to that family marriage is being restored that's what we got to be focused on not the little silly things that Satan uses to come in and drive us apart at the end of the day we must remember we are Brothers and Sisters in Christ his blood that was shed for me is the same blood that was shed for you and it atones for me and covers my failures it'll atone for you and cover your failures as well brother Brown says and as the days grow closer and closer and the narrowing of the path we want to get closer together my we must be just one one body we must move together forgetting one another's sins and our differences and just dig in closer and closer and closer as we see that day approaching forgetting one another's sins and moving closer and closer you know I got to thinking about this and forgetting sins and hurts and trespasses and I got to thinking about humanity and and betrayals and and how hard it is for us as humans to move past things all of us it's sometimes you're like why is that still bothering me why is that it's hard to move past things and I was looking there at Peter and this is just me if you don't see it this way that's okay it's just something that was striking my heart the spokesman of Pentecost people would call him even there in Acts 1 but before the Holy Ghost Falls he stands up in the midst of the disciples and everybody else says gather there and he begins to instruct them and he's given instruction on what they all must do and I tried to place myself there as if maybe I was one of the disciples and how hard it would have been for me it's about me in my nature to sit there and go why are you talking sit down like somebody else who didn't deny Jesus stand up like for real like where'd you even come from didn't you leave and now you're going to stand up and tell us how to act why are you running this operation who put you in charge I I've been like no now somebody Boo this man I'm just these are the thoughts that's kind of like how what would my attitude be like just being honest because you know some of them had to feel bitter they had to be mad at him think look how they felt about he was always so Brash and so tough talking though all men should be offended because of thee yet I will never be offended though all men and he's throwing other people under the bus to make himself look good though all I meant brother Joe may but not high these others disciples they might deny you but Lord I would never I am Peter I might as cut a dude's ear off I would never do this think about how Brash he was in the eye he probably wrote people the wrong way all the time to be honest with you and he turned out to be the biggest coward who denied Jesus and thus denied his relationship with the rest of the disciples because the accuser comes up and some of them say you're you know Jesus you're one of them and he said one of them says surely you are one of them nope I don't go to that church let's bring it down home I don't go to that church I don't believe the message next Sunday I'm in the pulpit pretty solid analogy if you ask me I don't even know Jesus or any of those people a few days later y'all sit down and listen I'm gonna instruct y'all on what we need to do I have been pretty bitter towards that fella I would have had a real attitude oh now you want to run stuff the one who denied the one who cursed listen the angel had to tell them go your way tell his disciples and Peter that he goeth before you into Galilee I mean think about it they already wasn't even counting him as a disciple you can look at that how you want but I looked at it like the angel knew they ain't gonna tell Peter bang on tell him y'all go tell the disciples and Peter yeah you know you know what you was thinking you tell Peter how easy would it have been in that upper room for them to still be mad still be hurt still be upset and yet they had to let all of that go they had to forgive and even though they had reason to be upset even though somebody really did offend them even though they didn't like who was in charge they made a decision of a mature Christian this is not going to be our Focus that is not going to become between us we're not going to look at that instead I'm going to focus on what he said to us when we left their focus was he said if we came here we would be in do with power from on high his their focus was he said going to all the world and spread the gospel he said that the works that I do shall you do also he said you'll take up serpents and it shall not by any means harm you he said you'll cast out devils and that was their focus and I say tonight what's our Focus he said we would take up serpents and it wouldn't harm us he said we'd be just like the first church he said it would put forth another Branch just like that one that's my focus Lord pour it out tonight that's what I'm looking at you said there'd be a Rapture you said there'd be a body change oh I'm hurt I'm offended but I'm not looking at that I'm looking at the word the words that we can make it the words that we can have the Holy Ghost the words that we could be delivered the word said we would be a church without spot or wrinkle that's what we're looking at they began to focus on that and their mind was on that and they talked about that and they prayed about that oh come on somebody what are we talking about when we get together what's our attitude they talked about the promises they focused on the Promises they prayed about the promises and all of a sudden there came a sound from heaven like a Russian Mighty Wind may it break forth in this building tonight May our minds get on the go may it get focused again and may it begin to come over every heart and pillars of fire break out here and here and here and you get a refill it and I get a refilling and you get a refund and you get a refill it because we get back we need Jesus I need more Jesus I'm here to worship Jesus I serve God because he called me and he loved me and he died for me not because of something my brother did or didn't do what is our focus in this day what is our Focus what would it take to get the power of God to shake this building tonight to shake our hearts again to bring us back into Focus and let him move freely in an atmosphere where our thoughts is on him I broke this up into two it's the same quote though these next two it says you go to a congregation this one says well now at night time even in this little handful of people you sit here and feel one coming here and here and here and here just everywhere people one in thinking this one thinking that while I know they're why I know what they're thinking about sure I do God reveals it and one of them saying well Dr so and so said it was mental telepathy this one says well he's a spiritualist and this one says it's a devil and this one says I think those people are just emotional well I think that was out of order well I think he's preaching at me and this preacher sees it different than him and I think and I think and he says that's the reason the Holy Spirit can't move you see it's got to be one Accord got to be one Accord and then God's blessings and power will pour upon his people until we can get that we're fighting air truly wow until we can get that so brother Aaron are we all going out to eat on Tuesday no we're not that's not what we're talking about when we come to the house of God they all done oh that'll lay all that aside every hurt everyone as a matter of fact it ain't gonna be when you come to the house of God it's just time to lay some things aside it's time to lay things down it's time to lay hurts down and move on Beyond those things we have to be United around a common gold striving for the same things look we can all be striving really really really hard but if we're striving in different directions it ain't doing nobody any good and if we begin striving in different directions with different goals then suddenly our difference has become magnified things that really doesn't matter as long as you're focused but when you become unfocused suddenly those things become the focus but if we want God to move we all have to be willing to sacrifice what we want and how we want it and how we feel and lay that down and say God I just want you to move what is the purpose of this service just so God can move just so God can deliver just so God can do the things he wants to do what was it that Nehemiah said there in Nehemiah four and six says so we built the wall and all the wall was joined together until the half thereof why for the people had a mind to work in other words they all got the same goal they all got behind what they were doing they all began to look at it they all got in the same mind how did it get accomplished why did the wall get finished because they began to focus on one goal and they were all content with the part that Nehemiah told him to play and it didn't matter who built this much wall and who built that wall well my Wall's a lowly part and your Wall's at the main gate and well you're using this kind of tool and I have a different kind of more now they had one mind finished the wall finish the wall well brother Aaron did you hear about this and you hear they said that I'm not worried about that what I know is that laodicea is all around us and we need to finish this wall we need to finish this work we got to get busy with our mind on the goal that it's Rapture time that it's going home time and that there's people out there that we got to get in oh what what part can I do what can I do for the kingdom of God what can I fix you go back and study they all worked on their portion of the wall quit trying to fix your buddy's portion quit trying to fix my portion it's like I've been saying a lot lately how about you worry about you and I need to fix me this ain't putting off I need to fix me there's things that I got to take care of there's things that I've got to get in order in order for us all to be focused on the goal what's the goal we're to be pressing towards the mark of the high calling pressing towards a body change getting our eyes back on him and off of our brother's faults we got to allow the word to break every hindering spirit in our life we all have different spirits that attack each one of us sure we do maybe some people's is more glaring than others I don't make it any worse than somebody else's we all have hindering spirits that come and try to attack we got to allow the the word to break those hindering Spirits off our life and quit talking that that backsliders language of negativity focused on on people's failures and shortcomings quit folks listen this word is a positive word it's not a negative word it's a positive word and God's people are a positive people there are positive people who focus on what we can do and how we can overcome and how we're going to improve Satan's the one that comes and points out the accuser of the brethren every last little thing I say tonight God help me find the positives and the strengths of every person and let me look at them through that lens what is their positive what is their strength help me to find the positives in every situation help us to look at things through the right filter refocus us tonight refocus tonight on our purpose of why we're even here let's get in one mind and one Accord so the Holy Ghost can fall and as the early church recognized the power of one mind I'm gonna have to go quickly now as we're running out of time but as they began to recognize the power of one mind you begin to see throughout the New Testament it begins to be preached Romans 12 15 through 17 Rejoice with them that do rejoice and weep with them that weep be of the same mind one toward another mind not high things but condescend to Men of low estate be not wise in your own conceits recompense to man recompense to no man evil for evil provide things honest in the sight of all men Romans 15 5-7 now the god of patience and consolation grants you to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus that you may with one mind and when one mouth glorify God even the father of our Lord Jesus Christ wherefore receive you one another as Christ also received unto us the glory of God what you find here in this scripture is like-minded here means to mind the same thing like mind is to mind the same thing in other words all occasions of difference removed and all quarrels laid aside notice it says according to Jesus Christ there at the end of verse five According To Jesus Christ what this means is is that he's to be the center of our like-mindedness because we can be like-minded in error I can be really really wrong and convince you to agree with me now we're both wrong even though we're in one Accord so what it's saying here is is your like-mindedness must Center on Jesus in other words because you get a bunch of people together in one Accord and one mind or a group of people who agree together that doesn't mean it's the truth you can be like-minded in error you find that in Genesis I believe it's in Genesis 11 when they're building the Tower of Babel prophet of God says he says now they built a tower which I doubt that the modern science could build today with all their machinery and things because they were United together they had one Mind One Soul one purpose one motive one objective that's built a hot Tower so high that if God ever took a notion to destroy them again they'd run them right up into the heavens with him and there'd be no way that they could keep him from doing it or he could keep them from doing it as they thought and we find out then that they organized themselves together and we find them again completely out of the will of God so they're in one mind one purpose one motive One Soul one objective and out of the will of God so you have to make sure that you're like-mindedness is centered on Jesus because brother Branham would tell us in relation to the Builders of Bible and them being united that Satan patterns off the things of God and so he will cause people to be United but United under a lie United under a falsehood or United under a purpose that will hinder the move of God so the scripture instructs us make sure that you're like-minded in Jesus second Corinthians 13 11 finally Brethren farewell be perfect be of good Comfort be of one mind live in peace and the love of God and peace shall be with you Philippians 1 27 only let your conversation be as it becometh the gospel of Christ that whether I come and see you or else be absent I may hear of your Affairs that you stand fast in one spirit with one mind striving together for the faith of the Gospel in one mind striving together not striving against one another but striving against the common enemy one Spirit one mind and as I hope we've seen the scripture is very clear that there may be different ideas there may be different opinions different diversities of judgment disagreements on how things should be handled and yet through all this if we have the character of Christ then we will have a Oneness of heart and the ability to move beyond all of those things for the cause of Christ first Peter 3 8 finally be ye all of One mind don't know why that happened there we go oops still doing it it's going crazy having compassion one other love is Brethren be pitiful be courteous we're about to wrap these scriptures up bear with me another moment if there be therefore any consolation in Christ if any comfort of love if any Fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill you my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind you think they didn't learn how important this was there in the book of Acts over and over and over and over and over let nothing be done with Strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mine Let each esteem other better than themselves this literally says you're to think that every other person is better than you it's hard for some people esteem others better than yourselves y'all are better than me it's hard to do it's hard to think that way why all these commands because they were dealing with the exact same stuff we deal with Humanity opinions upset hurt feelings scars bitterness the devil trying to tear people apart the devil knows the power of one mind he knows what happens when God's people get in one mind and one Accord he learned real quick there in the book of Acts he learned that he couldn't stand before people of God who were in one mind and one Accord he don't want us in one mind today he don't want us in one mind in this service he don't want us in one mind tomorrow and he tries to keep us split up and firing at each other brother Branham said if he can keep us quarreling he said brother Satan don't even have to fight oh but if we can get in one mind in one Accord I think we've seen what will happen we'll get the devil on the run tonight you've got a problem you got a sickness you've been bound down you've got some complex hindering you in one mind in one Accord you can walk out completely different completely delivered completely healed completely set free bitterness out of your heart how do you know I read the pattern I know what happens when God's people get in one mind and one Accord the power of God can sweep in this place and set every one of us free brother Brown says if I could get you in one mind and one Accord there wouldn't be a feeble person in the building in the next five minutes it would be instantaneous one minute bound the next moment free one minute sick the next moment healed one minute lost the next minute saved I say pour it out Lord Jesus I want it tonight Lord my mind is on you I want nothing but you I'm laying aside my thoughts my feelings my worries my doubts my unbelieves I say Lord shake the building tonight pour it out tonight Lord that's the desire of my heart not just tonight but every night every service Hallelujah listen he's going to bring backbiting he's going to bring division he's going to bring strife but if we can just push that aside and get together The Power of One mind his mind his will his desires we've been talking about the power of one mind look not every man on his own things that's a bunch of different Minds but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus there it is what are we supposed to be looking for brother here what's he want done what's his will how does he want to move what's his opinion about it what does the word say about it that's the mind we're talking about if we could all get in one mind where we're looking for his will and he is our goal in that mind walls fall down in that mind Spirits are cast out in that mind there is forgiveness and that mind the Holy Ghost Falls amen if we can get out of this mine and quit operating with our carnal Minds quit operating under family Cycles quit operating under what we think and operate in the character of the new birth operating the character of the new Birds where our filter is his mind come to church with what kind of mind brother Joe with a mind to worship come to church with a mind to receive come to church with a mind focus on the word yes yes you're gonna have to push past Humanity yes we're going to struggle with it no doubt but it's worth it look what happened every single time they were able to push past and get in one mind and one Accord you think for a minute all 120 people in the upper room love or like one another that may be the last time they all ever hung out they were told to be there and they was just doing what the word told them to do and they got in one mind and one Accord that didn't matter they went to the upper room with one purpose one mind brother and you said that a lot yeah that's what we're preaching about one Accord it is a serious thing one mind one purpose one Accord can we just show up one time like that if we could just do it one time if we could somehow Lord don't let me be the one that's not but let us show up like that one time and let's shake hell that's exactly it would Shake hell I think the heavens would open up and even if it wasn't Rapture Day we might just go ahead and go if we could all just get in one mind and this building one time I don't care who's leading singing tonight I don't care who's on the instruments tonight I don't care who's preaching tonight I don't care if it's hot in church I don't care if it's cold in church I don't care if the speakers work I don't care if every microphone squeals and the drums are off beating the piano's out of key I showed up to worship God I'm here to praise God I'm here for one purpose I'm not here for a concert I'm not here for a special sermon or some beautiful lecture I'm not here to see what people's wearing I'm here cause I need Jesus I need more Jesus born out tonight Jesus that's why I'm here I don't care about any of the other stuff love it one purpose nope you know what we need to have all of our services in August out there in that field we ain't gonna mow it we ain't gonna put up a tent we ain't gonna have microphones just so we can realize how spoiled how blessed we really are get our mind right and recognize how silly our gripes are you know and we're about to close but can you imagine some of our conversations in heaven you meet a new brother and you're excited to me tell me your testimony tell me tell me all about it he says well I was a martyr we ran from place to place desperately just longing one time to have the opportunity to gather together and have a service so we hidden caves and and then Dungeons and hideouts and they finally found us my children were taken from me and sent to the Coliseum they said I could save my children's life if I was just willing to recant the doctrine of the new birth and the godhead and I wanted to so bad but my children encouraged me said don't do it Daddy Stand Strong don't do it let me die for the faith so I lost my children and then I was broken on the Wheel they took and broke every one of my fingers and they tore my teeth out then they shattered my shin bones with clubs my intestines were torn out and set on fire while I was still alive then my hands and feet were tied with four separate ropes to four separate horses and they stretched every muscle and every tendon and every bone in my body until they snapped and all the while they did it I sang hymns and praised God I sang hymns as a matter of fact I found out when I got here that there were others that that that were so moved by the way I worshiped in my discomfort and in my torture that they gave their lives to God and they're here because of the testimony as I witnessed to the very ones breaking my bones and I told them about the love of God then I was quartered parts of my body were hung on The City Gate in the bridges as a warning to my brothers and sisters this is what happens to those that are willing to Worship in spirit and in truth of course it didn't hinder them at all it just made them get stronger and stronger and They carried on together and the more hardships that came our way the stronger we got and the closer we became and the more determined we got to stay in one mind and one Accord and our service has got greater and greater and greater tell me tell me your testimony were you a martyr yeah in a sense yeah in a sense I many times during our services oh wait wait I bet the authorities busted in and stole your children and arrested you and carried you off and beat you no but I did have to bring a sweater because the thermostat was too low oh okay there was another time too I didn't know who was preaching and so I came and had I known I would have stayed home and streamed a different Ministry from another church that was brutal and many times brother I endured song Choices that were not on my list of favorites and I'm sure judging by the attitudes of my brothers and sisters that they agreed with me that day we was in one mind and one Accord song service stunk it's not really that funny if you think about what we have to gripe about listen to this yeah I I yeah they uh sometimes if you sit in one place in the church the sound was dead and if you set somewhere else it was loud how about that your kids went to the Coliseum okay once I got to church late and the deacons they found me a seat it was towards the front you cannot imagine the Walk of Shame I had to go through as I walked up there and then it's hard for me to even say the minister offended me what's your story going to be what is going to be our reason for not being in one mind in one Accord can you imagine how we Stack Up to those that have gone on before us you say brother Aaron this is the most evil age it's ever been I don't argue that but it's the easiest age that's ever been to come together and worship freely there's never been another age that had church as easy as we have it with the blessings that we have with the light that we have and I don't even mean this light I mean the restored word of the hour worshiping openly and freely and a nice place there's nobody fixing to kick in the door and arrest all of us what will our excuse be I say Lord help me help me to come with one mind and one Accord help me to lay aside all these things help help us to raise up out of that carnality and operate from around that that allowed the book of Acts to be written what was it that allowed the book of Acts to be written one mind and one Accord says we have to get out of this dimension he says what we need is a holy ghost atmosphere that's right an atmosphere where the power of gods are moving one Accord one place gathered together under that atmosphere of expecting God to move down and do signs and wonders amen let's move ourselves up into that bracket Step Up in faith move out of these three dimensions up into the next one get out of our mind Church lay aside our faults I've got so many of them sometimes I feel like I got more faults than I do redeeming qualities he says how the devil talks to me maybe he's nicer to y'all I got tons of them I pray you'll look past them I pray you'll have Grace for me as I have Grace for you I pray that we'll love each other through the blood of Jesus and that when we come together recognizing that not only is my soul at stake but the souls of my brothers and sisters and how dare I be one that would hinder the move of God by not being in one mind in one Accord the musicians can come I have a quote I want to read as we close because I believe that if we get in one mind in one Accord he'll shake this place service after service I believe he'll shake this place today I believe he'll shake this place Sunday I believe he'll shake it next Wednesday if we'll just begin to lay more of ourselves down lay down more of our thoughts and accept more of his thoughts say Lord don't let me hinder I'm looking for another chapter in the book of Acts I'm looking for that and I'm looking for more of God I'm looking for more of the gifts and I'm looking for more of the Miracles I'm looking for more of the Holy Ghost I'm looking for more Deliverance and we're not focusing too much on that matter of fact he says just listen a minute how can we have the mind of Christ that was in him and then deny the things he commissioned us to do how can we place miracles in the past when the very Christ himself was God and God in you in the presence of God there's always miracles he said you call me Lord why call you me Lord and do not the things that I've commanded you to do I laid it out for you it's all laid out for us we just got to come in one mind and one Accord these things aren't optional Miracles are not optional The Works that I do shall you do also are not optional we got to get in the power of one mind his mind and this is what will happen when we get in that these quotes are all from India trip report 1954. says in every word in the Bible is God's thought lying in seed form that received into the human being and spoke by the same thought that materialized the Bible brings the same brings the thing to pass see what I mean how powerful could the church be the Bible said let this mind that was in Christ be in you as a man thinketh in his heart so is he now your thoughts if they become expression now if that same spirit that said let there be light and there was light said let there be trees and there was trees if that same mind that was in Christ be in you how much could it say let there be no cancer and it would be gone let the blonde eyes be open and it would be so see it's your very thought Jesus said verily you said that was Jesus but wait a minute he said have faith in God for verily verily I say unto you if you say unto this mountain be moved plucked up and cast into the sea and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you say will come to pass you'll have whatever things they'll say us is that right you shall have it not me you shall have it what power has been given to the church but if it becomes a real revelation of God these are all in order I just had to break it up that you see it before it happened and express it in word form that word takes a hold and becomes material a thought expressed oh my how God could see it your heart and your mind is so filled with God's spirit until your thoughts become his thoughts amen there you are when you're mine and you're leading and your guiding becomes a direct place or a direct inspiration of the Holy Spirit that's moving your mortal being oh my what kind of people should we be if the very Holy Spirit has you so embodied and empowered that you don't use your own thoughts it's what I've been talking about that's what I've been trying to get to when we come here let's lay our thoughts aside when we come in here let's lay them down why are we here what are we doing what is our purpose you don't use your own thoughts you don't use your own mind you don't use your own opinions but the Holy Spirit has you so built until your thoughts and your being is God's spirit expressing itself through you what kind of a church would even like Tabernacle be maybe it didn't end exactly the way I thought it would that's okay I just want to ask you are you coming in one mind are you coming in one Accord or as church becomes something else to you really right now in your heart why are you here why do we gather why do we follow the message what is it we believe I'm believing for a rapture I'm believing for greater and more and more because I read through the book of Acts I recognize there's still some places we don't match up there's still some places where the pattern ain't exactly lining up I'm saying I'm going to match it I'm gonna match it I'ma do whatever it takes I'm gonna lay down whatever opinions whatever thoughts whatever ideas Lord if it's me hindering this service Lord help me show me move me get my attitude right because I'm looking for a Rapture and what I know is the same thing that brought down the Holy Spirit brother Branham said he came because of one mind and one Accord is the same thing that's going to bring him back to get a bride if it brought him down then it'll bring him back now so what is our goal Lord Jesus come back Lord Jesus save my children Lord Jesus fill me again Lord Jesus give me a refill and that's why I'm here that's what I'm longing for that's what I'm after that's my goal I'm in one heart with my brothers I don't see everything the same but we're in one heart one one mind one Accord Lord we're here to worship you we're here to praise you we're here to give you Lord the praise you deserve so you can feel me once again Lord so you can pour it out once again drop this bitterness out Lord I don't want it I want the joy of my salvation restored Lord I want that Joy once again I want freedom in the house of God I want freedom from these things that bind me and hold me get my vision by tonight Lord I need Jesus I need Jesus I need Jesus and if we come with that one thing that one thing he'll shake these walls he'll shake your souls he'll shake your home what kind of church would evening like Tabernacle be Heavenly Father Lord you dealt with me Lord in my heart and I just expressed my Lord how you dealt with me about my own attitude Lord I pray that Lord it was given in Grace because Lord that's all Lord if I'm anything if I ever make it or be because your grace and your mercy Lord help me to lay aside any bitterness any hurt any hardship anything that I might feel like I have a right to be upset about I gotta push that aside so that's not what this is about this is about Jesus this is about abroad making it out of here we got to finish the work there's a work that we've been called to do even as Jesus fulfilled all of the scriptures in the Old Testament he left scriptures in the new for his bride to fulfill there's work to be done there's a pattern to line up to and the key to that pattern is one heart one mind one according father give us the grace and the strength we need to move past our own Humanity Lord and to walk Lord in the mind of Jesus Christ where we don't operate by our opinions and our thoughts and our ideas but we're so yielded to you Lord we can recognize your leadership and yield Our Lives to it [Music] Lord I pray you'll just come now Lord as there's a solemn sweet Spirit In This Place father Lord began to deal with every heart Lord you know I had no thought in this direction until you came you know it [Music]

heart tonight Lord make that same cry we surrender this Lord this congregation we surrender our will we surrender everything that we are Lord may you be the leader of evening light Tabernacle may we
