them to minister things that will will bring Clarity and understanding to where our position is in the hour amen and we're this morning we're we're I'm going to ask you to pardon me while I read again from Zechariah 4 and verse 1 and because these are modern events and things happen in the day that are made clear by this prophecy so we're going to be looking into that today and looking into the word and seeing um our day our hour and what the holy spirit is doing today and Zechariah 4:1 and the angel that talked with me came again and wake me as a man that is wakened out of his sleep and said unto me what seest thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick all of gold and a bowl upon the top of it and the Seven lamps thereof and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are up on the top thereof and two olive trees by it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other upon the left side thereof and so I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord and then the angel that talked with me answered and said knowest thou not what these be and I said no my Lord and then he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubabel saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit sayeth the Lord of host who art thou oh great Mountain before zerubabel Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen God bless you you can be seated today we're going to be speaking on the coming Capstone as you see in zachariah's Prophecy where he said that um that he shall bring forth the headstones with shoutings cry in Grace Grace unto it and of course um Grace upon Grace bringing uh again the Sha the the great Capstone now this message today will will be a moment of reflection um upon the past and meditating upon the future and asking ourselves um where are we in time and what is the present state of the church and so this will be kind of be a New Year's message this morning as I I really in some ways kind of um step aside from my my next part on this um this series on the mountain movers and bring this in as I speak on the coming Capstone this morning but being this is a new year service kind of honing in on some thoughts that has to do with where we are in time and a little bit of reflection upon um that uh and and of course you know as um we've just had some wonderful meetings with our brother Murphy Wong and and uh just was a glorious time hearing the word and we were refreshed by it and blessed by it and I know you were um as I heard back from many of you that were so blessed by his ministry and uh you know we um had um of course the New Year service and then I took him out to um to Lakeside there for a few days of RNR and and uh just spend a little personal time together and of course then as the first light of the morning dawned in 2025 my thoughts were 2025 think of it you you know as I went back in my mind and was reflecting I thought about 50 years ago on a Tuesday night and I'll tell you a little bit about it it was February the 18th 1975 and it's forever blazoned on my on my memory um it was a a night where we at that time had four Services a week we had a Sunday morning and Sunday night and then Tuesday night where we would play a a tape and Wednesday uh then Thursday night where we would have a a midweek service and um so you know we it was our routine there to meet together on that Tuesday night and and um that day I had I in preparation for church you know we were just out on a big farm and it was mostly well it was just family basically that met together with us and um you know so I I wasn't expecting anybody but just the the the family which would be about 12 or 13 of us at the time that would meet in the old um white frame Church there on White Oak Road and and uh you know we we had been meeting now for about 3 years in that building and and um we're you just plowing along and and um just doing the best we could with what God gave us and um you know we had no no facilities there running water we had electricity you know I've told you many times six light bulbs from the ceiling and and um and then one plug in and the whole thing so you know it was um that was all the convenience we had and we would heat with old Barrel um uh stoves that we had made out of 55 gallon drums and and turned on the side and built legs on my father and my brothers did and Welding it together and and putting pipes out the window and heating the best we could the old the old building that was uninsulated and rough floors that you could see through and uh sometimes uh just where there were holes in it and so on like that no no modern conveniences you know uh there was a song that was even written during that time and um we had visitors like um the Young family came and from um brother Roy Phillips church at that time what became brother Donnie Ran's church and um they visited us and and S sang for us and while they were singing um there and looking around at the old building that was rustic and um everything very primitive um you know we they looked around and seeing the broken window panes and that we would try had a patch up because the windows the old frames were so rotted that they would not no longer hold the paines good and they would wind would come and blow them out so we must have had some some of them that had been broken or out that day when they visited because they sister geralene y would write a song and said you know in an old country church with broken window of pains and then she would tell again you know how that the you know they've got him back in the manger once again it said just a I saw as the Saints would praise the Lord back in something like a cattle stall and and you know she make the song and write it it was a beautiful song but they got him back in the manger once again this old church World they didn't want him they didn't then and you know so she said as the tears fell down my feet upon on my face I saw it all I saw my Lord once again in a cattle stall you know we were we were there we had um uh been pushed out of the the churches that we were in and we had to find a place where the word of God would be preached and where it would be welcomed and received and and on that particular night I I would like I said preparing for church I reached in and got a long sleeve Shir shirt it was cool at the time and grabbed it and um as I put it on quickly for church I noticed it was too big for me my dad and I had one the same color and they it got hung in my closet and so I just grabbed it and put it on and so it's down below my shoulders and sleeves too long and bulky around and and um you know I uh I said oh you know I'm in a hurry we'll just go to church and and as we were starting the service as we customarily did sit and and prayed and waited on the Lord and and and prayerfully waited here comes a couple walking in the door uh with three children and that would be brother LoveIt and Sister Louise butts and what would become my wife Karen and Denette my sister-in-law and brother Tim buts um I think he's he's here this morning and um you know they would all come into the church for the first time and I I would look over my older brother who also would Minister with me at that time and he's 9 years older and I say hey you know you got anything to preach tonight and he said no he said I don't said we were we were going to play a tape and I I have nothing to say and I said well I said you get up and lead some songs and I said I'll preach so I just you know open my bible and um went to Revelation chapter uh to and and the message to the Overcomers and I just took from my Bible and preached that you know just as he in that few moments I just gathered my thoughts together and and then I jumped up and I preached on the the message to the Overcomers and and I took each one of them down to the ages and the time and at the end I asked brother buts if he would standing and um give a testimony and and he said yes I I am I'm really happy to be here I've been looking for a church like this that we could go to who believe this message and he said I I have come for that reason and I've heard the word of the Lord tonight and um you know we we're just going to come and be with you well the following Sunday I think it was or the one the following Sunday brother Jerome buts and his young family would come and you know that that event would change my life and their lives forever and we would be permanently intertwined together this year sister Karen and I would have celebrated 50 years of marriage sorry um and as as I just reflected on where time has gone I thought back you know of yeah 55 years ago now um February the 1st on on February the 1st 55 years ago where I first started out in full-time Ministry I would preach my very first sermon we have people that are here that were there at that time brother Jim Morgan and back over here brother Daryl Baxter they were there in the service when I preached my first sermon and you know I I thought about it you know through and reflected back over the many years and Miles that we have come and now 55 years of ministry here I stand today you know um this year looking and and expecting and preaching the coming of the Lord Jesus just as I did then and I believe that we're closer now than when we first believed and uh you know I I mean from my earliest Ministry my earliest min memory rather I I I'd always known I was called to preach it was just something that it was never an angel come hit me with a sword or I Heard a Voice or whatever it was just something that was in me from a young child in my earliest memory I cannot remember a time not knowing that I was called to preach the gospel when I was turned 11 I asked for a Bible with my name on in a suit for my birthday and I was was already making preparation but while still 15 I preached my first sermon and I preached it from First Corinthians 10 where God LED Israel calling them from Egypt and it says it like this in First Corinthians 10:1 moreover Brethren I would not that you should be ignorant how that our fathers were under the cloud and all passed through the sea and were all baptized un Moses in the cloud and in the sea and all did eat the same spiritual meat and all did drink that same spiritual drink for they drank of that spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ but many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent we should not lust after evil things as they also so lusted and so as we as I ministered from that subject at the old blocker Chapel there in serupa Louisiana you know I I I thought about where that I started and and where that I've come and what I began with and even even the text that I preached at that time of you know these were an example the men who drank from that rock who Aid of that mana and yet many of them God was not well pleased with them and they were overthrown in the wilderness and you know for as it goes on to say that they would rise up to eat and then they rose up to play and and so you know I as I I thought of that you know where that we have come and and it had always my been my desire we don't play Church you know but we put everything that we have into it if God is worth serving he's worth giving all of our heart everything we are and this past weeks I've spent time with ministers like our brother Craig Bo and our brother Murphy Wong and they were both asking me where are we recognizing it's a time of trouble a deceiving age where perilous times are here and and where are are we and what is next now when I and I'm speaking today about things and it will anger many I know you know it'll bring vinant com condemnation from some but this message movement is dying and will completely go down into death even if it's never drawn up on papers this movement will adopt the at least the spirit of denomination and and we're we're in a cycle where that as a movement we're going down into death and and and as brother Brandon would say it isn't the people in there that I'm striking at but it's that dominating spirit that makes the people think we are the people and this is what divides us into sects into Cults and aligns us with uh doctrinal divisions and of course um there are many that are are are are um living off of their past reputations I I would think of of that in in 55 years ago of um even our our United States government and and the concern of that time was that we were so deep in debt and even brother Brandon would bring it out and and tell and and of course the national debt in 1975 was 5 billion dollar now we're 36 trillion and you know as as we look you know we people are that's exactly what is going on in the economy the world economy today we are living off of our past reputation and and of course the church is doing the same thing you know the church not the bride but the church is living off a past reput reputation uh under the ministry of of the lion time or we're the church or we're the mother church and you know we we're the first one that got started and and it's living off a past repetition the methodists living off of their reputation Baptist living off their reputation the Pentecostal living off of their glory to God one day one time back there a long time ago the Saints would dance in the spirit and they did this they did that oh they were marvelous wonderful moves of God and and it's now something past and you know um but we because we've all got big now and you know and and and of course in these 55 years we have established churches and we have nice buildings and we're growing in number but many times the power of the spirit is not there and the power of the spirit is the life the life of every true move of God you know it must be there but we see it is Lifting and the movement is experiencing the same death that every other movement before has experienced it is a cycle of Revival and death it has always been you know even even I I was um reading a little bit because brother Craig had asked me about the outpouring of the spirit in Russia I've not been able to find that he said well I'll tell you I can show you the historical events it was or demon sharan wrote of the outpouring of the spirit in Russia and how it moved from there into Armenia and um it's a it's a wonderful read if you ever want to read it where that he he speaks on the happiest people on Earth and of course that is people who find their place and position and where God wants them to move and do and so he wrote a book called the happiest people on Earth and he told about the outpouring of the spirit and how that um that from Russia that would come men and women every year that were they acted strange they were speaking in other tongues they were dancing in the spirit they had prophecies and miraculous that was taking place and and um you know it would take a little while to convince those Armenians who were Presbyterian of the of the of the the truth of of Pentecost and and the outpouring of the spirit and and they they would certainly um uh it would take some time it would take actually miraculous things that would happen one of the brothers would um one of the shakarian brothers and Uncle tmus would have a prophecy and and um you know uh because they were longing for the spirit of God and he had experienced this with these Russian Believers and and deus's father was a staunch um Armenian would not accept it at all and was not convinced and so you know the spirit of God moved upon him and he and he and he stood stood up and prophesied on this day this very next year you will Embrace a son son well they had had a bunch of daughters but never a son and so you will Embrace a son on this day this is thus sayeth the Lord and it happened exactly the way it was that it said said you know it was actually a disgrace among their culture for a man not to have a son and and here would be the first son that would be born in in that family and um and so it it would be deus's this would be that was uh sorry that was deus's father that was prophesied so it' be his grandfather that was resisting and then you know but he was still unconvinced and and so the next year or so he also um uh was going to receive them so he thought they would be a host to all of these people that were coming in from Russia and and would provide for them and and so he went out to pick out a a calf um out of his herd and and there was none finer none finer in the herd that would feed everybody that was needed and could be slaughtered except for one but it had a blemish of a blind eye and he said I he he he said I know not to offer unto God that which is blind and and that has a blemish but I tell you what it's the best that I have and I I want to I want to take it and I'll hide this I will hide this from from everybody went so he slaughtered the the the calf and and the the large steer he he slaughtered it and hid its hid its head under a pile of hay and where that it could not be found and and he prepared it and had it all there and the people arrived and they had their their prayer and and they were customary before they did anything that they would they would pray until the spirit moved and when the spirit moved for then then they would all um move into the spirit and and then would they bless the food and then they would eat and as they were praying the spirit of God Came Upon one of them the the the leader there moved upon him and he said just a minute there is unrighteousness in the camp and he he walked right straight over to the barn uncovered the the the the Bull's Head and showed the blemish there and he said see you have offered that which is blemished before God and and doing so M the Elder sharan fell down and and and and surrendered his heart completely to God and had the same experience like they had and so this would be the beginning and in that time there was a young man that would raise up he was like 11 years old and he would have a prophecy and this prophecy would come to him in the form of a vision he was not able to read or right but he saw in a vision these funny letters and so he would take and he would write and copy each one of them down painfully as and and looking into the vision and writing it down upon on paper not knowing what it meant and he went and showed it to others what he had seen in this vision and it was in perfect Russian and it was that that there was coming a a time where there that that there would be great persecution upon the Armenian country and before this was happened they were to move from Armenia and go all the way to the east coast of a far country and then when they would across the sea and when they arrived at that that place they would travel all the way from the East to the west and they would settle there on the west coast and and so it would you know that this was amazing that they had received this prophecy in such a way that a young boy of course some would discount it and and and not not think anything about it but here when some 50 years later when the Holy Spirit again appeared and said it's time now to leave and so all those families sold their houses their lands that had been generational homes for years and years and years and years and they been in their in their lands uh and their family names and they sold their plows and their cattle and everything Livestock in barrel and they moved and they moved all the way from from Armenia while they were mocked and made fun of by others and ridiculed and everything else for following this Vision because the spirit of God had said now it is time you know it was given now some 50 years ago is now time it is now time to make that move and they made that move and just within just within years of that just in a short time the Turks the Muslim Turks would come and they would do a genocide in the in the country of Armenia and they would wipe out every Christian family and rape and pillage and take over lands and property and and take the women make them wives of the Muslims and children and SL them and make them into into Muslims and everything else and totally a complete genocide in fact in during Biden's time he um actually recognized for the first time that in turkey that there was a um a genocide and they called it a genocide in the country of Armenia that was swallowed up by the chch and you know this is history where they killed millions of people and they were slaughtered and they and so but they moved to the West Coast and and of course you that you might know it was also written and sealed that that there will come another time where that there would be another persecution and they again would would face similar things and of course we know there's a tribulation that is that is set for those that are left behind but anyway they happen to be there right at the same time as a churches that were uh were experiencing prophecies and workings of the Holy Spirit and and um speaking in tongues and all that and one day some of them walked by the the um the Zeo of mission and they heard strange things going on and went in there and they found that the Holy Spirit had now fallen on others than the Armenians and so they you know in in a sense would join in with the Pentecostal isua Revival so you know again um but however by the 1940s when Deus was coming along he he found that everything had so denominated had come to a place that there was a coldness that had come to the church and the Armenians was only they were concerned about their little four and no more and it was UN Armenian to even go out and preach to others and try to get them in because they remained a separate people and and um you know to themselves and but you know as uh as um as he wrote In the book and I just want to share this phrase be this this little paragraph is why I have background this and he said for the fact was as as he tried to as he tried to have meetings as he tried to have you know where that he could Tred to get other people filled with the spirit and and people to to he would actually found the Full Gospel businessmen and as you know which would be an oasis for brother Brandon's meetings and a a place that the word could be preached and and so on like that when he would be pushed out of the churches and the inner Circles of Pentecost the Full Gospel businessmen would still receive him because they recognized him as a prophet because they already believed in prophets it had a prophet that and their Prophet was um was was one who had saw this Vision in in Russian and told them to move and and all of these things and so they believed in prophets and they saw the prophetic Ministry of brother brandom and they embraced it and they received it even though they did not receive his message but but but they they had got so tied down in the way that they did things until now it would it had become Creeds which is statements of faith and they're based on truths but where men become and make them dogmas where they're dogmatic about it and rigid and and unbendable and and to the point that it puts uh the Holy Spirit In Chains as it was as you know brother Bram told us in the Feast of the trumpets he said that the Holy Spirit has been bound by these denominational Rivers for 2,000 years and and he says you know when and it and he said but it's now being loosed by the end time message but you you see you see the cycle continues where chains again get put back up on the spirit of God and and he gets hindered and kept back and not able to work among the people and do what he once did and so deamus was saying there he said for the fact was that the wind of Pentecost which had blown out of Russia into Armenia nearly a century before had dwindled by now into a denomination as rigid as any other it was always this way all through history each fresh outpouring of the spirit soon became in human hands a new Orthodoxy and the great Revival on isza street for example here in this very city of Los Angeles which started out in Freedom and joy and a breaking down of barriers had solidified by the 1940s into a number of self-contained churches who could who couldn't communicate even with each other let alone the world as a whole and so you see by by that time by even the 1940s when which is scarcely what um 35 years from the outpouring in 1906 you know um again it is had become by then so rigid so so bound down with Traditions with with with Creeds with things that were taken from truths that was meant to bring freedom that was meant to bring Liberty and turned it around and make it into bondage you know this is what happened with Israel they were given a Sabbath where they could take off and rest but they made it where till that was to be the very thing they would use to crucify Jesus Christ because they had made it in such a tight ritual and a rule until there was no room for the spirit and even even God himself who had made the Sabbath and he said May the the Sabbath the Sabbath was made to give a rest and here I am the lord of the Harvest and the lord of the Sabbath and here they want to condemn me because we dare to even pick something to eat on the Sabbath day and and and again are to loose a daughter of Israel who were bound was bound and and and was and was there uh crippled and and he said you you would you on the Sabbath day you would loosen ox and go get him water on the Sabbath day you would get one out of the ditch well how much more this daughter of Abraham for me to release her from the bondage of this Affliction but you see by then they had taken it and made it into rules and regulations and laws until even the lord of the Sabbath was condemned by his own words and I wonder now this year we have been we have done 60 years since the seventh angel finished sounding his message what have we done in these past 60 years and remember I'm reflecting well at first we didn't have very much of the message a set of tape sermons cost as much as two new pickup trucks there were no churches there were none just a few one one Jeffersonville one over in in Phoenix area at Mesa and another at Tucson that was about it a few here maybe one up in New York or somewhere else there were no churches our own church here would wouldn't be we wouldn't even start it to 72 and in a building out of a coming out of a home but there were no churches during that time ministry we all uh they were very much like Jesus disciples before his death burial and resurrection and and they were all arguing arguing on who was going to be the greatest they were all all saying you know getting angry and fighting over position and joying for position you know maneuvering aggressively for a place of preeminence and and the mother of James and John coming in and saying you know hey Grant my sons give me give give me this grant I want this was Grant my son one of them to sit on your right and the other on the left in your kingdom and and Jesus Jesus would say that's not even for me to give you know and and he said if you you want to be if you want to be great become humble you know bow down worship um surrender be a servant you you're going at this all backwards and all wrong as I said the ministry joing for position maneuvering aggressively for a place of preeminence one to be the Joshua it would be men rise that would be the Joshua needed to place the mystery truth and as the Apostle then set it all in order and the other was to be as a would rise up and he's an Aaron as Aaron was to Moses and as the teacher would bring new understanding to its truths and and be able to say it you know in an educated manner where that Moses had an impediment of speech you can read between the lines and each one would be each one would be the one to perfect the bride and and now the bride was for one of them to impregnate with their own IDE ideology and beliefs and then arises others who who um you know in reaction to that who just go to tape only and do away with the ministry all together proclaiming that brother bradam said Rapture in faith lays on the tapes and so therefore we don't even need the ministry and preachers to preach and I want you to say let me go on record there's not one quote as a student of this message I say there's not one quote that says rapturing faith lays on the tapes it doesn't say that it you know I'll read it to you he said in the message absolute and I remember when he swept down there in that big light standing Yonder at the bottom of the river 1933 in June when he said as John the Baptist was sent forth and forun the first coming of Christ I send you with a message to the world to forerun the second coming of Christ and a world around the world she's feminine speaking of his ministry she's went when Revival fires has been built for 15 years near on nearly every Mountain Divine Healing Across the Nation and power and restoration and I believe she speaking of his ministry is ready to strike that final CL climax Yonder to bring forth a faith that Rapture the church into glory and she his ministry is laying in the messages were really in the end time and I just submit indeed he had been laying in one message after another after another building up to that final climax where the seven thunders of Revelation 10 would reveal the symbols of the seal to bring forth the faith the original Faith the words are restored to what Paul preached so he would take and build upon his statue of a perfect man spoken word his Original Seed wisdom versus Faith he was just laying in even messages like the church ages Daniel 70 weeks and placing all of them he was laying in the messages getting them you know building getting people ready for the final climax which would be of his ministry which would be the third pull which would be the opening of those Seven Seals and the revealing of the Min the mysteries of God and of course that would produce a faith turn us back to the original Pentecostal faith that Paul preached but it's taken today well Raptor and fat lays on the tape so you're not going to get it from hearing a preacher so don't listen to any preacher just play a tape you see that's a Creed that is a dogma of man and it's done to hinder and to thwart and to choke the Holy Spirit now how do we get in all of this well if you go with me to Jude chapter 1 I'll read from the fifth verse I will therefore put you in remembrance this is going to remind you 1 Corinthians 10 though you once knew this how the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterward destroyed them that believed it not and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he had reserved in Everlasting chains under Darkness unto the Judgment of the great day now remember this has always been what Satan has done all the way from the beginning we're not even talking about in Eden we're talking about prior to Eden in the heavens we know what Lucifer did he exalted himself above God in all that is called God he did not keep his first estate as a protector of the word is a covering cherub he was not happy where he was but he wanted worship himself so he exalted himself and and so these are angels that kept not their first estate and I just want you to know this is the definition and identification of Fallen Angels men who will not stay in their position who want to exalt themselves over the word of God and even over Vindicated Messengers that they've got to be the one to bring Clarity and understanding to it and they've got to be the one who who sets it in order and they've got to be one who who can say it uh when he couldn't say it it is Angels who kept not their first estate and they when they do that they are Fallen Angels remember brother bradam and Christ of mystery picks us up and he said notice in the last days and that's where we are Lucifer is doing the same thing can you see it the devil doing the same thing building up a hybrid church I want you to watch this it'll be a theme throughout this sermon hybrid Church a hybrid by hybrid members hybrid by knowledge instead of the word here's the way they're going to be hybrid knowledge instead of the word now watch this by intellectual men instead of Born Again men building an intellectual Kingdom that will outshine Christ's little bitty flock what did that see fallen angels the Bible said it was Fallen Angels who listened to Lucifer instead of Christ who they once belonged to is that right now listen close Fallen Angels what kind of angels Luther Wesley Catholic Pentecostals and Y well I say even message amen message who kept not there first to State and and like the Angels did and has fell into organization like Lucifer's main hold at NAA and what have they done they've organized a great eom unical Association of minister to make an image to the Beast as the Bible said and building a Christian economy that'll close the doors of this church and others like it see Lucifer at his work he said what they do they sold out the reason of wisdom and education like Eve did what's now like Eve did Fallen Angels did wesle a man of God but what followed him Fallen Angels got into it what was it first what was Angels first created beings of God but fell for Lucifer's wisdom fell for Lu Lucifer's wisdom and you see what they become fallen angels and organizations from Men of God who went out to establish truths in the Earth but before that truth could go on and proclamate and get on to the real revelation of God Fallen Angels come in it and took it over and made denominations out of it and that's the reason the revelation of the Sevenfold mystery the seven mystery seal mystery had to be unfolded now you see it what they left off what Luther would have went would have had what L if Luther would have went on it would have been here if Wesley would have been on if Pentecost would have went on what what would they have done but now the only thing can happen there has to be a message at the end time when nothing else can follow it and now the ecumenical world has set up such a regime that there is no can be no denomination nothing else follow it and you're either in it or you're not you're not in it and the fruit is at the top of the tree and the light is shining on it and on that predestinated fruit and she's ripening into a Christlike fruit bringing forth the same melness and sweetness and the same spirit that he had in him oh my think of that here we are in in time you know when I think where we make traditions we we make uh we make Creeds you know you just come up and say I believe Malachi 4 I believe the message well you got the Holy Ghost in and still living dirty sinful lives you know just just make a claim and say you got it and by Faith by faith say say you got it let me tell you it was never by faith nothing it was an experience it wasn't a make believe it wasn't a guess work God came in their lives and they were radically changed that's what you're looking for in your life amen is a radical change where you're a new creature in Christ he said in world falling apart preached it right here in sort he said our educational system our denominational system has took the place of the Holy Spirit leading in the church and I want you to think of that our great fine training of ministers and things has taken the place of all night prayer meetings and the oldtime way we used to get to God and now instead of having preachers we got lectures men who knows the word just as well they can sit there and put it together together in such a way it's astounding how they can do it they know the mechanics but that ain't the Dynamics we want the Dynamics I don't care about the mechanics I want to know the Dynamics what does it do I don't know how that car runs out there runs out there it's got pistons and cylinders I don't know how much pressure it is used the only thing I know is that Dynamics put her out there and drive it and that's what we know God made a promise I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh your sons and daughters shall prophesy how's he going to do it I can't tell you I just want to know the Dynamics of God's system that's the main thing today we've studied the mechanics until that's all mechanical and and what is good in an automobile without something in it to drive it what good is lights are the fixture if there's no current to go in it see we all got mechanics we got schools and Educators that can train man till he can stand in the Pulpit with such manners till he's an eloquent person that still don't bring the power of God where is the power of God that used to be in the church where is that Pentecostal blessing that used to flow through the churches that's the reason our world is falling apart because we got away from the real principle of God and educated men in the systems and things and that's what God is in condition we are today and I believe that's why our world is falling apart you say brother Tim but we don't have seminaries like that we made churches seminaries we've trained them we trained them to understand this concept and that concept and whatever and then you have men who have have never been never been in the presence of God up in the Pulpit trying to preach the word of God can you imagine that men who go out without the Holy Ghost without his anointing intellectually put together sermons let me tell you what happens there them were dead sermons and dead sermons kill false prophets bring forth false births and it's a false birth just to make a confession of faith and say I got the Holy Ghost that's a false birth but you see even in the first age there become a departing for the truth I think of it you know as the book what that was given on the day of Pentecost the word that was revealed it was the word coming down it was spirit and truth and Paul even years later would say listen I'm showing you Mysteries I'm showing you the the doctrine the truths of it but I want you to know this word this gospel did not come in word only but it came in power and much Assurance it wasn't just a intellectual gospel it was a lifechanging a power driven a gospel that changed lives radically Chang them and put a faith in them that faith that we now sa was once deliver to the Saints and that's what we must contend for today but he would say as it rocked along and as I said Paul had it he was ready for Rapture they were the grain to be taken in the Garner and all they lacked was us could not close up Redemption and finish it because we're missing we hadn't been manifested on the earth so instead of coming back Jesus Bec a mediator and begins to intercede and he's soon sending back the Holy Spirit now to dwell in the church to work in it until every predestinated seed can be found and when the last one comes in the Rapture will go that's when mercy will be over that's when he that is filthy will be filthy still and he that is righteous will be righteous still and he that is Holy be holy still but don't close the door till that last one comes in because I'll tell you to try to close the doors to go against God because he said when I open no man can shut it and no when I shut it no man can open it one day he'll shut it the last one will be in like the door that sealed Noah in the ark and there won't be another by this first AG we're not even we're not even yet out of the first Ag and they go into this cycle of Decay and death Revelation 2:4 says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee I have somewhat against thee because thou H has left thy first love oh church if there's anything get that love back in your life get that passion to please God that fervency to serve him with all your heart that cry for the reaching of the spirit that that that way were that you were led by the Holy Ghost where you can be sensitive to the spirit of God and and all and he can pour out his spirit so that old men dream dreams and young men see visions and All My Sons and Daughters I will pour out my spirit and they'll prophesy so to understand this you must realize he was not speaking to the original Saints of Ephesus alone that it was to that entire age he was talking about and it would be all the generations in that span Now history keeps repeating itself in in the generations of Israel we see Revival in one generation only do you see the fire is fading in the next and the third generation Embers may be glowing slightly but in the fourth there may be no vestage whatever of that original flame and just think about it David David a man after God's Own Heart David a king in his likeness a David of whom he would say the Messiah would be a son of David and would sit on his throne and now the Next Generation you see the fire Fades and then the next and you see Solomon bringing in other gods and the religion becoming contaminated and hybrid and and and altars to other gods in in in the very city of Jerusalem itself and and all and in the third generation Embers only slightly in the fourth there may not be no vestage whatever of that original flame and then God will light the fire again and you will have revivals and men will rise up you know like Hezekiah or Godly Uzziah or Josiah or men like that and there'll be a reval and and and he light the fire again but this the same process is repeated and it's simply the manifestation of the truth that God has no grandchildren salvation cannot be passed by natural birth it isn't in the word if there is any message that we need to get across to our young people you're born in sin shaping in inequity you don't have a right to nothing because you were born in the in the in this church amen you have no right to anything you're but you're blessed to be able to have an opportunity Amen to be filled with the spirit yourself where that you won't be a grandchild of the message but you'll be a child of God yourself but you see you start out with truly Born Again Believers and Next Generation comes along and they're no more just plain Christians but now they take on a denominational name and are now Baptist methodists and that's exactly what they are too because they're not Christians you see they're living a name they have a name that they're living the Bible said but they're dead you see and and there are many people that want to come under that that uh that umbrella well I'm in the message I I believe the message it's a name amen and it's a claim to life but you can be dead never have an experience God yourself and you know what happens when you have it coming along like that and so many bypassing a new birth then the church becomes as described in the Book of Revelation a cage of ever unclean and hateful bird people who cheat and lie and steal and do crooked business deals and and and adultery and fornication and pornography and and every kind of lust spirit and everything else all claiming to be in the same cage with the others and they become a cage full of unclean and hateful Birds oh brother Tim you're too Melancholy for me this morning I'm reflecting for a moment I'm looking at the soberness as we see we see people dying Generations dying we see churches dying we see families dying you see these folks are coming now together by the will of Man by being physically Born Into the message Community they're born by the will of man they're just raised up that way they just accept it as truth it's a it's a a tradition passed on to them by their parents there's no Zeal to know the word for themselves no Zeal to know his truth they you know they're just satisfied with a denominational lifestyle what do you mean by that what is a denominational life just come to church pay your dues be a good person you know belong to something we belong to the Society of the church brother you're not this church ain't going in the Rapture it's going to be left behind but there's a bride that's going to be taken out of here and I say Lord don't let me fail I want to be in that bride I don't want to just be a member of a church and a lukewarm member and cold and former and with void of the power of God I want God in my life working in my life the power of God and salvation that's what I want oh yeah I'm not saying that there's that some right with God not for a minute there are many there are many raised up on a on a message Pew that come and and they too get that glorious New Birth but oh we must be careful that they original Fire doesn't burn down it doesn't matter even if we're oldtimers we got to make sure the log of the word of God is kept on our fires and we build up high amen that it be a flaming fire within our hearts amen that there's enough steam that is created by the fire within us it blows out the whistle and it drives down to healing and miracles and signs and wonders until it takes us into a r but you know how it is the fervent desire to please God that passion to know his word the cry for reaching out in the spirit it begins to fade and pretty soon the church instead a bit on fire with the fire of God becomes cooled off and a bit formal amen it's a little bit formal and the moment the moment that fire is even seen the moment there's even enough to blow it out the Whistle the moment it even happens it Dan somebody danc in the spirit somebody goes to call the fire department put the thing out we don't want no such nonsense as that around here we we don't want no fire in the in the engine you know that's Wildfire let me tell you it's fire it was lit by the fire of God and it's controlled by the Holy Spirit and it'll drive down the healing and the Miracles and the signs and wonders but that's what was happening in the Ephesian age they were getting a bit formal that abandonment to God was dying out and first thing you know people are not too careful about what God thought of them second generation like Israel and they demand the King now we don't call them Kings we make them Apostles we make them teachers we make them the Joshua next or this other one next you know the the the Aaron now you know whatever else all kinds of names we give them but it's a king so they can be like all the rest of the Nations you know again you know when the church starts thinking more of conforming to the world instead of conforming to God it didn't long you see them stop doing things they used to do and start doing things they wouldn't do initially and and first thing you know uh the spirit of worldliness comes in and they change their manner of dress and attitudes and behavior and they get relaxed and that's what Ephesus means is relaxed and drifting and let me quote from the prophet the cycle of Revival and death has never failed and he said all you have to do is look back to isusa Street just this last move and you can see that you know they they were they prayed all night they went to church they took on street corners they wern't ashamed of the manifestations of the spirit they left their own dead churches they worshiped in home and store buildings but they had reality it wasn't long until they got enough money to be able find new churches they put on a choir and a choir in s singing to God for themselves they put on gowns on the choir they organiz a movement ran it by man and soon they begin to read books it wasn't fit to read and they let down the bars and the goats come in and took it over and the cow of Joy was gone the freedom of the spirit was gone but oh they kept on with the form but all the fire had died down and the Blackness of Ashes is all about this left now God isn't against us having buildings places of worship God isn't even against a a group of you singing a song which we call a choir God's not against that but what he's against is when we lose the spirit when the spirit is no longer in our worship when the freedom of God is no longer in our praise you know the the Apostle John he was Apostle of love and he said this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments his word and so he knew what love was about so he said one little deviation from God from God's word was a step away from Christ and people say they they love God they go to church they will even shout and rejoice and sing and even a great emotional time but when it's all over watch and see if they're in that word walking in it living in it if they go through all the other and don't walk in that word they can say they love God but their lives tell a different story and he told me he said something was happening they were doing so suddenly you couldn't see it they hadn't made a move so big that you could that you could see it out there and the open it was under cover and they were bringing it by the way of reasoning and human understanding and it'll take over unless you refuse it go back to Pentecost before it's too late and he said but usually people as usual people don't heed God's warning and you know and and I'm going to tell you I'm going to tell you going back to Pentecost is not an option for many of them they ain't going to go there they ain't going they ain't going there they they're going to go as far away from there as they possibly can and I'm not even talking about isusa street I'm talking about Acts 2 Church being filled with the spirit power in fact this movement will fulfill the scripture listen to me carefully this movement will fulfill the scripture of having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof you will see it more and more you'll see the spirit of God move less and less you will see it in chains and put out and rejected I can show you and show you in the Bible is true Leo DEA shows that he's outside his own church knocking trying to get in amen and and I you know as I can share with you the the many quotes and I if I had the time and it looks like I'm I'm just going so slowly at this this morning so methodically trying to lay this down that I won't get to it but he said but he said Christ is on outside the door with Pentecost trying to get back in and we're not talking about isusa Street we're talking about the original word the original Power in the book of Acts church but they don't want it they forgot their origin the origin of the first age was Pentecost they had fallen from it he said theyve forgotten the glory The Wonder of it it was time to go back when he says remember remember go back and mind and the reality back to where it says for me to live as Christ back to Purity when Anis and the Safar and an i of fire were dealt with back to the gate called beautiful what a reproach it is to drift from God so what is the way back it's the way of repentance amen it's a it's a way of recognizing we we have went off in the wrong direction turn around and come back amen and you see that it would in Ephesus it would it would degrade it would go down and it would start dying and and even the city would long to the city was in ruined and his glorious temples a shapeless mass and the land become a uninhabited um uh Marsh inhabited by um a water fou the and the population was gone except for a few Believers in a squal village there wasn't one Christian left the lamp was rent from his place and he said don't mean she couldn't have repent and he said don't mean we can't repent we can but it must be quickly and it must be a true heart cry to God but let me just bring it forward now that was Ephesus but what if we and I'm reflecting again we've spent the last 60 Years Learning emphasizing the truths examining the mechanics with so little of the Dynamics until until as by by and large the message Community is out of balance today we're so afraid of the Dynamics until we'll dismiss it by saying well there's there's going to be a great deception in the last day with signs and wonders and and and and that will be preached to discourage signs and wonders among Believers when he said these signs shall follow them that believe but we'll point to the false and said watch out you'll be deceived by signs of Wonder but if you don't have them you are deceived how could you a Believer be a believer and not have signs and wonders among you come on Church you look at this for a moment and realize that we're we're we're quickly dis we'll quickly dismiss it because we'll pull out a Creed an established belief well the false the false brother Tim that false Vine they're going to have signs and wonders and miracles and we'll deceived by them that's right but why are you pointing to that amen why don't you point that the rain on the unjust was not even sent for them it was sent for the wheat the just and if they are rejoicing we ought to be rejoicing and if they are shouting over the anointing they get we ought to have the anointing and Shout over what we [Applause] have so what if it produces a faith in them that they can make that part of the way word work we ought to be making all of the word work and if there is worship shouting and rejoicing well that's just emotion and and it ain't in emotions let me tell you brother Brandon brought a correction because Pent the of meetings where we full of emotion and relying on emotions and denying the word but we're not word deniers we're word Believers and if there's anybody ought to have some joy and shouting and rejoicing come on it's the mo it's not a new found religion it ain't just some phenomenal you got at Youth Camp it's the oldest religion there ever was because in the mind of God he saw you shouting and rejoicing and if there's healing and miracles they're dismissed because false anointed have them see we got the word well if you really had the word you'd have Miracles if God be with you then where are the Miracles amen now you know some will get get their nose all out of joint with me preaching that and said well brother Tim you're you're making like you're the only one that's got miracles no I am not doing no such a thing you know don't take all the medicine on the Shelf if that ain't for you well then realize it's for somebody else amen but you see you you see again again we're we're right here in this time if there's prophecies or manifestation of the gifts of spirit they're quickly dismiss as Pentecostalism baby stuff immature and you'll be told real quickly gifts are on the Shelf and the prophet put him there how dare you to take them off well that's a lie of the devil and I don't care who said it it's a lie of the devil the prophet of God never preached that never taught that and if he did he was contradicting what Paul preached and he's cursed and he couldn't do that it's so Li the devil the prophet never put the gifts of the Spirit on the Shelf he did say that one glorious day when the preaching the day of preaching is over listen carefully when the day of preaching is over that there would they would be laid on the mantle and divine love would heal everybody and of course Divine Love Is Heaven brother R when he went beyond a garden of time he said this he said everything was just full of with perfect love he said this is what you preach is the Holy Ghost he said and So Divine love is heaven and and all that is there it is the Holy Ghost and when we are changed we will not need preaching anymore every preaching gift will be laid on The Mantel well brother Tim I can't wait till we get to heaven man you'll have eternity to preach no I'll hang it up amen amen I'll not do any preaching you won't need preaching for you will all know him from the least to the greatest amen amen and and so you know again knowledge will cease am the need to expound deep Mysteries will be over we will know as we are known tongues that need to be interpreted will no longer be needed prophecies will cease and prayer for the sick will no longer be offered thank God Amen but that ain't now right now we're still preaching and as long as there's preaching there's laying hands on the sick and they shall recover as long as there's preaching there are altar calls and people getting the Holy Ghost as long as there is pre preaching there is prophecy as long as there's preaching there's tongues and interpretation as long as there is preaching the Full Gospel is in effect but when we're perfected no one will need to prophesy to you the future of course when brother bandam said that in 1957 none of the gifts were laid on the manle none of them he continued to prophesy again and again almost in every service when Danny Henry would prophesy over him in pure French and it would be interpreted right Gifts of healing continued prayer lines continued and they should today because the gifts are not on the M they are always to be in the church and it do matter how impersonated they have been amen that there is as brother bam would say that here the gifts that returned to church that's Divine Healing prophecy speaking with tongues interpretation and though it's been misrepresented terrifically yet that don't take away there's a good one there's a true one of a genuine real genuine gift of speaking in tongues is always supposed to be in the church we are always to be an Apostolic order the days of the Apostles is not over days of Miracles are not passed Divine Healing is not over gifts and miracles are not finished there's still Miracles ready to happen May 2025 be a year of Miracles where we see God move in signs and wonders and healings and deliverance and people filled with the spirit yet it's the devil's job to distorted Apostle Paul he set the church in order and he taught the proper use of the gifts of the Spirit and confirmed that they were to remain in the church till Jesus came direct quote so it must be that if you will study and I'll give you a little homework go back and listen to the five definite identifications of the True Church of the Living God you'll find out what kind of church where to be you'll find this must be in the church because if the vine puts forth another Branch it will write another book of Acts behind it and of course if we're just a branch off of some denomination we'll just produce a denominational life but if we are a branch of the original tree we're going to write a book of Acts not the you say well brother Tim the acts of man no the acts of the Holy Ghost inen that's what we're talking about cuz if the vine ever brings forth another branch of itself that Branch will be exactly like the vine itself it'll be the it'll be the same kind of branch that brought forth at Pentecost it will speak in tongues prophesy have the power and signs of the resurrected Jesus Christ in it why because it's thriving on the natural resource of the V Vine itself you see it wasn't grafted in the vine it was born in the vine but instead of the pure word and they'll scream stay with the word stay with the word stay it's the word it's the word it's the word and we wind up with message Creeds statements of Doctrine that are only founded on partial truths for example let me give you an example here's a here's here's a Creed it's the Creed of most all protestantism it's in their Apostles Creed for example baptism using titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost are Creeds of denomination formed by taking one one quote of Jesus and not taking the rest of the scripture and the improper use of quotes as righteous and holy are as they are and true as they are makes Creeds and these Creeds are used to bind the Holy Spirit and this makes a hybrid gospel which has no life in it that means it's dead and dying now again you know the the rest of the scripture if you take Acts chapter 238 repent to every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ remission of sin you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost you will see their house of Cornus they baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Acts 19 I can take you through through every place in the Bible where they were baptized and they were all baptized using the name of Jesus Christ because you had to recognize God in the manifestation of his deity and he came as Jehovah the Savior Jesus Thou shalt call his name Jesus for he will save his people from their sins and quoting the Bible there is no salvation in any other name but Creeds have changed it and guess what they bind people from receiving the Holy Ghost now so brother Brandon was very careful about this he told us that the spoken word the word was the original seed that was the original but it would then become hybrid it would be become mixed and he said to mix would bring a hybrid crop a hybrid crop is a dead crop go as far as rebreeding because it can't breed itself back right it won't rebreed itself and and and so you you see um it the church right there will die because it will hybrid itself and it gets mixed and you can't do nothing with it it's dead and that's why listen each generation has its own Revival a chance of the word why because every age will rise up and they'll mix it they'll have fallen angels get in it and the next thing you know is a powerless religion next thing you know it's built on Creeds and it's hybridized and it's dead and the spirit moves it and so another generation gets a fresh Revival it's own chance of the word and that way you know brother brandham said you know um he said the Catholics will raise up behind Luther or or irenius Martin poop and those will stand for judgment for H breing the word to dogmas this group of lutherans that fought Lutheran's Revival will answer the same thing that booted group of Baptists that followed John Smith's Revival will do the same Alexander camels will do the same and the Pentecostal will do the same that original Revival when the Holy SC fell called out of people and God's trying to get it get his word to it and they organized it and sat over here and denominated and it died and but every generation has to have its Revival and God raises up a man sets him with his word starts him on with a message of that age and soon as that man is taken off the scene somebody else catches it and hybrids it this is the cycle somebody else catches it and hbes it mixes it go back exactly that's the way it started all the way back to Genesis God set forth this crop of human race and Eve hiber it so see what happened so there's judgment for Eve Now Eve was not eternally lost that but it said death in the human race and the promised Heaven of an Eden was lost and man's vision and contact with God become uh clouded and obscured so you see each generation is receiving because it's repeating right back to Adam and Eve again so God will bring a Revival and they'll start off with freshness all new and there'll be new churches and the gospel May spread and there will be that message will go out but if they don't stay pure with the word it don't take long no not hardly a generation to where it becomes hybridized and watered down and diluted and the methodists who got the experience were were of sanctification where they shouted and rejoiced and fall out under the spirit and they take water and pour it in their faces to bring them up brother Brandon said if they had let them alone they went all the way through the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they didn't and and and and yet they would they would raise up great men that that you hear of like buddy Rock and others that would Herald the message faith and would carry the gospel light at that time but another generation would rise and another generation and the next thing you know we don't want those camp meeting experiences we we that that's undignified that don't fit in our churches we no longer want that to happen where people get excited about the salvation and and overflow and whatever you can just come and make a confession of faith and we sprinkle you with a few drops of water and you're Sanctified and they're still living every kind of dirty lives until the churches are full of every kind of Sin from sodomites all the way down and you know that's the truth why every generation has Revival brother Jason this a quote you sent me but in the face of all of that there's a real bride God spring him forth each time there's been a Reformation there's been so much of the words spread forth and each generation gets his time did you ever notice there be a man of God come along that'll strike fire with God and there'll be a great Revival sweep the land and what happens immediately after they take man's ideas and denominate it and bring in Creeds and mix it there she dies and never rises again it's always been always will be every time but each generation what does it get it's opportunity at a fresh word of God each time like Luther under justification like Wesley under sanctification the Pentecostal move on the baptism of the Holy Ghost see each one gets its chance then what does men do that follows those great reformers denominate it organize it mix Creeds with it a little bit here and a little bit there a new bunch of School Scholars coming along with a bunch of psychology just the same as he was trying to find some new light to mix up with the word of God death and Away went the organization and died spiritually and that's EXA right has always been and church it repeats itself and is continually repeating itself as brother brandham said if you notice though every three years after a great meeting what takes place a denomination now actually it would be it would be the Armenians would join in with theza Street the next big one would be the Church of God uh would join in and accept Thea blessing and the next one the Assembly of God would be formed seven years after 1906 and 1913 or 14 and so s years later here you got the first organization and he says if I dear dying lamb he said this is 20 years and no denomination dear dying lamb may it never do that if I go in this generation May the people who believe this message never stand still for a denomination you will die right in your track wow I can I can hear as he said the very hour you mentioned denomination among you I don't care how sincere you are take Man For Your Leader instead of the Holy Spirit to confirm his word that's the hour you die now the genuine seed cannot because there's nothing left after the seed it's the same thing that was at the be back at the beginning it's the bride that fell into the ground to bring forth the corn of weat again so you see as as brother Bram would say as he preached the church ages he says and he talks about the nicians and he says oh and I'll show you the Messenger to this church age will hate denominations the spirit will raise up in the children it's always been the messenger would hate it but the spirit would raise up in his children ah you know I can hear some of your they ain't know denomination in this message brother Tim ain't nobody nobody would dare to sign up a piece of paper and and draw draw up a charter and do that it's not the paper it's the spirit it's like I tell people about divorce they come all worried because in order to make a man pay the child support a woman I have to sue a husband for for divorce so oh brother Tim God hates that God doesn't hate that he don't hate that paper that ain't what God hates God hates that behavior that's he he hates it when a man will abandon his wife or wife or husband and leave the word of God and destroy a home that's what God hates he hates the behavior that that that leads up to the divorce it Ain it ain't the paper it's your be it's your actions that's what God said I hate putting away amen I hate that I despise that I I want my people to be whole I want families behold I don't want children raised up without a daddy or mother I I don't want divided families but the devil gets in and pulls them apart oh W you know if you sign this paper that's what God hates no it ain't sign in the paper it was your wicked Deeds and that's the same thing it's the spirit nobody's going to draw up a paper they wouldn't dare they wouldn't dare but they got the spirit of it and brother brandham tells us in the world falling apart that God will raise up a prophet and he says and and he says let me just read it he said just exactly what Jesus said when he come to the Earth he said God sent them prophets down to the age every time that the world system would fall apart the religious system and what did you do with him God sent a prophet you put him in a tomb exactly and then after another generation you wake up realize that was a prophet and then what do you do you garnish the tomb what do you do make a tradition of his life and that's exactly what Israel has done had taken the prophet Moses and had made a tradition of his life and that's the way we do Martin Martin Luther John Wesley other men and we're always looking back and see those things and you make a tradition of their life and garnish the tombs of them and their their message was for another day and by the time you wake up that day is done live by and we're in another day and that's exactly what has happened is that you know God used a man in this generation and we garnish his tomb and we we talk about his life and his ministry and what he was and what he did and we we make a you know we we make a great man of him and a tradition out of his life and now that same vicious cycle begins as we begin to hybrid but let me just say this I want to bring this down but God has said he will restore and he'll have a church without spot a wrinkle and it will not only be the word even manifested the power for to be the true word it has to be spirit and in truth and this is where there again there where Satan gets in to make it all mechanics and no Dynamics are back all Dynamics and no mechanics but we got to get it together and I am not in all at any W you're saying forfeit the word for the Dynamics I'm saying if you got the word then let it work and that's a Capstone that I'm talking about it ain't going to be another man raising up with another message amen when you come to the top there ain't nothing to follow it and we've come through seven ages and there's not another to follow it I don't care and you know it'll go every one of them will go down into death there'll not be another man rise another Joshua another Moses another this another that you can name whatever it's finished and like it or not I didn't like it I'll just tell you I didn't like it and I still don't like it but God ended the seventh Angel's Ministry and took him home I didn't take him out of the pulpit God did and I can't put him back in the pulpit and nobody else can and playing his tapes will not put him in the Pulpit do you hear me amen you know again Traditions they will make traditions out of the message to where even the gift of ministry is denied what is that it is hybridizing what we have you you saywell brother Tim you've spent time this morning talking about Fallen Angels that's true but always remember there's going to be somebody that is going to be true there is somebody going to be faithful there is somebody going to rightly divide the word of Truth spoke with a dear friend one time whose son was a minister he said well brother he sat me down he said listen Tim want to find out about you my daughter comes to your church I said yeah we're happy to have them and he said well I want to let you know to begin with I don't believe in Preachers I said oh I said that ain't true and he looked back at me he said listen you don't know what I've been through I've had preachers lie to me thevery I've had them deceive and they're all about their self money women are popularity and he says I don't believe in Preachers and I guess I know what I believe and I said that isn't true and he looked back at me and he said well it is too true I said then you got a bigger problem than I thought because if that's true your God is a little bitty God and you ain't serving the one I'm serving he looked at me and he said oh how so I said because if your God isn't able to keep a Ministry true if you're God who put it in the church I give you Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors I I'll put I'll put them I'll put even New Testament prophets in the church I I'll have them all they will be in my church I I'm going away but I'm sending gifts back to men and if God can't keep a true one then he's a little bitty God and he ain't able to keep his word and I'm telling you if God isn't able to keep a bride without SP BTO Rico or blemish and have a people for his name's sake he's a little bitty God but my God is big enough in the most evil age in the most wicked generation to have a people standing on the earth who believe all the word who stand for the truth in the hour I said God has to have somebody and I'm telling you this morning we made Ain all lost and it ain't all gone there's a real bright somewhere there's somebody going to believe the word there's somebody going to receive the truth in this hour there's somebody who's not only going to have the mechanics and believe all the word but have the Dynamics to go with it thank God for 60 years of teaching but oh time friends it's time now for The Headstone to unite with the body and when that full power of the Holy Ghost comes upon that body it'll be a refilling of the holy ghost that we worked in a small measure as a Capstone was coming down but then amen it it'll come and sat down upon that church and even the dead in Christ for seven years seven ages will rise up and we'll all go up to meet him that's my New Year's Message Church it'll be the stone though the builders will disallow it'll be the it'll be the one where they will crucify the word amen that they will crucify the effects of the word they won't say the word is wrong they'll just crucify his effects they will say it was oh oh it was for yesterday it was for another time but it's not today but I'm going to tell you he's the same yesterday today and forever the Lord Our God who changes not and he's here today to perform his word just like he always did the last age will put Christ out oh yeah all the denominations are do it brother Tim no sir I wish it was limited to them the children of this message will do like they did 2,000 years ago when they called for his blood and crucified him not him as a person the word by killing the effects of the word oh yeah you can go back and listen to the indictment there's some homework go back and listen to the Leo to cnh there's you some homework I'm talking about his brother Brandon priesthood go back and listen to it he he will tell you exactly what will happen in this last day remember it was there it was there when he would standing there even a message of Grace where you'd see the seven rainbows and all of that and it would be it would be experience like that in Sportsman Hollow where that he would receive the revelation of the seven Church ages and and see its Messengers and write it out and he would come out from there you watch what I'm saying go back and search it yourself it would be from there he would come out and say Malachi 4 has to be fulfilled an Elijah has to come to restore the word back and under that Elijah Ministry he come out and he preached of church ages showing us where we'd got off and bringing us on a long journey to where we are in the leoan age and then he would come and he' say okay the last stage they will put Christ out said when I I saw it I laid over on my chair and wept like a baby the very one who gave his life and they crucified him and turned him away they will do the same thing and he said it'll be Jesus again with dirty feet unwanted unw unaccepted nobody to pour that will pour fragrance upon him wash the dirt that his smile smashed on his name Holy Roller you old Pentecostal whatever else wash all that dirt off of him me like our brother preached the other day become one with that anointing and that anointing that you anointed him with becomes on you his anointing comes on your life it'll be it'll be wrong Romans chap 11 you see we are living in the Fulfillment of the Gentiles when the Gentile dispensation is fulfilled that's when the seven Church ages will be over and until then we're still in the seventh age guess who else who else is going to wear the white robe who else is going to be the Overcomer who else is going to have the gold who else else is going to sit on the throne the bride in Le oia an elect lady the living in this last age let me just look for a moment Revel Romans 11 he talks about how the gospel is turned to the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles come in and he said God took and grafted On A Wild Olive Branch and he says that was you Gentiles he said you have no reason to boast it was the grace of God that put you in the vine but he said one day the fullness will come and he says the Gentiles will be cut off and the gosp the the branch will put forth another and that Branch will be again the gospel turned into the Jews now he said why were they cut off because Jesus said you make fun of me you ridicule me and he said it'll be forgiven but when the when the Holy Ghost comes to say a word against it he said you you you it will not be forgiven in this world or the world to come and he said that day at Pentecost when the Holy Spirit was poured out and they mocked it and made fun and said it's some kind of new wine and ridiculed this what God was doing he said they blasphemed the Holy Ghost and God cut him off and he said the same thing Jesus is trying to get back in the church with Pentecost not isza Street they were in Pentecost with Pentecost and they close him out and they want let him in and they re ridicule it and they make fun of it altar calls and prayer lines and worship and shouting and dancing of the spirit and they dismiss it let me tell you they're blaspheming the Holy Ghost and they will go into the tribulation for purging whether they make it there or not I don't know but that's why he cut off the Jewish and that's why he will cut off the Gentiles and we're here at a time time where the spirit will be lifting everywhere let me prophesy the spirit will lift from churches yes even message churches even more and they will just go on into formalism Creeds traditions of man I want to tell you the message movement will die amen but not the message but not the message the message is God the message is the word and the message will live on the message cannot be stumped out and pushed out amen the message cannot be deprived it cannot be rejected it will be accepted by somebody and somebody's going to be that bride who is married to the lamb and United with him and carried home and we're longing for that day let's stand to our feet this morning hallu let's worship God together as we thank you Lord I believe in you than Lord Lord I I know you're doing to work Lord don't don't let me reject you Lord don't let me don't let me reject you you're standing at my door saying come on I want to s in with with you I want to bring Pentecost I I

we're talking about the original word the original Power the original Holy Ghost restored back to Paul's gospel not a new gospel but the pure word of God and say Lord breathe on me today let me feel your spirit once again brother Brandon would preach on Revival and he said some of you some of you have left him you've gone off without him youve tried to make this journey on your own and you're in storms of your life and others he's in he's with you and you're in a storm you need to wake him in your life bring Jesus a reality to you Holy Spirit moving in your life keeping you under sweetness a bitterness brother Timothy talked about that unrepentant unforgiveness Let It Go Spirit of party spirits and divisions and sex and everything else amen oh it's natural I know even among the church family groups get together with family and close friends that associate with close friends but oh Church be embracing reach out to others don't let anybody fall through the crack amen let every every person be loved and brought in and fellowshipped break down barriers and hindrances just while I've tried do it again open up your heart welcome the Holy Spirit every service invite him say Come Into My Heart Lord change me in your presence I don't want to reject you Lord I I don't want to kill the effects even sitting in the service I don't want to kill the effects of the Holy Spirit get a little critical spirit on me because somebody's worshiping God maybe you think they're a little bit out of order well sometimes they have to get out of order to get get saved amen that little woman there at the there at the feet of Jesus was all out of order out of out of protocol so how she got in nobody knows but she got to him she didn't care what it took she was going to wash the dirt off his feet
