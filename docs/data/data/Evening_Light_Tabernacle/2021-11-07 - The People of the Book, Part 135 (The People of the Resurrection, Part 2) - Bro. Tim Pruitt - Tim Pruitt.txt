got that that message god does impossible math two fishes and five loaves it's our part it's our opportunity it's our responsibility to bring the fish in the loaves is his to multiply and i say that today because things get tough but yet it's our responsibility to provide the fish and the loaves he's going to do the miraculous he's going to do the impossible because he's still god and not only did they bring that scripture out and that thought out during the song one of the songs brother michael was saying but also brother timothy brought out so god reiterated twice within one service that

faith come into that room and in those hearts and grace to believe and receive from you we ask it in the name of jesus for your glory amen and amen amen and the church said amen we can rejoice in truth let's turn to revelation chapter 1 and we are going to we're going to read from revelation chapter 1 and i would like to read let me see the first verse there first let me see that all right go down to verse 9. i john who also am your brother and companion in tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of jesus christ was in the aisle that is called patmos for the word of god and for the testimony of jesus christ i was in the spirit on the lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying i am alpha and omega the first and the last and what they'll see us write in the book and send it to the seven churches which are in asia and to ephesus and to smyrna and pergamos and under thytara and sardis and then to philadelphia and to the last aids that we're living in laodicea and i turned to see the voice that spake with me being turned i saw seven golden candle sticks in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with the garment down to the foot and gird about with the paps with the golden girdle his head and his hairs were white like wool as white as the snow his eyes were as a flame of fire his feet is likened to fine brass as if they burned in a furnace his voice is the sound of many waters and he had in his right hand seven stars and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me these wonderful words fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore amen and i have the keys of hell and of death amen may god bless you can be seated may bless his word this morning we're going to take a part two on our last service that we spoke on the people of the resurrection because i believe that we are people that are headed back to eden yet make no mistake about it although we have received one the greatest signpost by this message that we're nearing that land we have not arrived yet oh i know there are those who have thought we're already in the millennium or this is already we're already back to eden but we're not quite there amen but the signpost points us to the city but the signpost never is the city and we we see many many signs along the way that tells us where we are in this life's journey the signs of noah as it was in those days and the signs of sodom the signs that the church is now in the same condition that the jewish church was 2 000 years ago when they were blinded and their in their blindness they crucified the lord of glory their messiah but you know the bride herself is a sign the bride is the last sign you are the last sign before the coming groom amen a bride that is prepared to meet her bridegroom i think of this as brother branham said in the identification of christ and the oli of all in all ages is god manifested in flesh now in the flesh of his bride for the bride and the husband is the self-same flesh listen these powerful words these two are one and the church is becoming the bride all the time by believing the word so that the word and the church becomes the same the word in the church making it the bride the last sign god identifying himself the word in the church so the bride as he said is the last sign with because the word he said has been made flesh in a church in a bright people remember this was the last sign a man of all of the prophets down to the ages that came and and jesus would be the last sign to the jewish dispensation which would be the word made flesh and i think of it of all the prophets and all the scriptures and all the promises and all the the many people down to the ages where many movements and church movements and bride movements but you know here we come to where the fullness of the word is being made flesh in a bride people in this last day and the end time signs all of these signs are showing us that we're about to be snatched out of here for it is the eagle age where we'll be caught up the word is harpazo in the in the greek and it means to be literally snatched away the eagle is the miracle it comes out of the heavens i tell you if you don't believe in miracles the resurrection the body change and the rapture it will be nothing shorter than miraculous and this is why brother branham would say if you can't believe get if i can't get the church to even believe for divine healing how will they ever believe for rapture for the resurrection of the dead for the great translation of the saints now where is it that he's going to take us because he's going to take us out of this world the bible speaks of a deliverance he said that we should pray always to escape the things that are coming upon the earth he tells us that it'll be in the end time it will come like a trap and he'll snap and close very quickly upon the earth and he'll catch many unawares and he says for you not to be overcome with sufficiency and drunkenness and the cares of this life and he warns you don't don't don't be bogged down with everything keep your keep your eyes heavenly keep your thoughts on what you're really here for for you're here for a purpose for a reason and there is a fulfillment of the word of god that must be fulfilled in this hour now see you again you know he's going to take us somewhere he's going to take us into heaven we will have a marriage supper of the lamb in a glorified bodies bodies that are travel like a thought that can pass through the walls that can appear and disappear unconfined by the physical but at yet the same time be physical enough to eat fish and honeycomb and be felt and touch like he was we're talking about glorified bodies we're talking about something that is not a fiction it happened in the groom the same word that spoke of the groom speaks also of the bride it is a word that is promised for the end time people the people of the resurrection but we're not staying there very long amen just three and a half years i can just imagine during that time if you just examine the bible there's seven there's seven angels in the book of revelation these seven angels are seven church age messengers or seven stars in the hand of jehovah and these same seven there they they uh they hold the the very truths of the word of god and and these very these seven one of them will be in one of them that holds one of the vials will be actually worshiped by john he will get down to worship him and he said don't you worship me i may look so much like your lord but i'm not him i'm a prophet just like you are amen so he would he would he said i'm your fellow servants one of your brothers right amen and so he would show him many things he would show him um the bride the lamb's wife he would show them the new jerusalem that is coming the new heavens and the new earth he would show him the judgment of the great he would show him how there would be a voice in the last days of in revelation 18 that says come out of her my people he was so he would sow there all of these different scenes to john but he also holds one of the vials and as we as we know of these seven angels holding with the vials i can just imagine this is just my imagination now maybe it's gonna muck but it's my imagination as we sit there at the marriage supper during that three and a half years one of them rescues herself from the table and says i've got a i've got some judgments to pour out amen i got a vial to empty going to be upon the beast and upon the false prophet for the tribulation period let me tell you friends it's not going to be a fun time for the tribulation there are going to be judgments that have been reserved kept up in vessels or vials as as pictured symbolically in the book of revelation that will be poured out during the tribulation period amen they'll be poured out from heaven and as we as we do and we see them remember when we see the great judgments there's a great sound in heaven of a rejoicing of the saints as they say as they rejoice and say hallelujah for the lord god omnipotent reigns amen and he has shown his judgments upon the earth oh it's going to be a wonderful time you don't want to miss it you don't want to be here amen you want to be there amen you know and it'll be as the seventh seal that finished up the gentile ages breaking the silence and initiating the end time events and it'll all conclude with the coming back of christ with his bride at armageddon and taking the world over for a thousand years and after that thousand years is over bringing the world to judgment at the great white throne and death and hell and satan will be thrown into the lake of fire amen and eden will come again upon the earth as the new jerusalem comes down as a bride adorned from her of her husband let me tell you this is no fiction this is not just a story this is the very plan of redemption god has not given up on the earth god has not given up on you he has not given up on having a pride without spiraling he has not given up on one of his plans he has done everything that he is all of his power to bring the past that which he had in his mind before the world begins and nothing can stop it devils can't stop it his imps can't stop it and i want to remind the devil this morning he's only temporary he's not eternal you are eternal but he is not eternal so how am i eternal brother tim that i pre-exist just how you did in the very thoughts and mind of god before the world began his thoughts as eternal it becomes word it becomes spoken it takes on flesh and it goes into his presence what a blessed people we are originally mankind lived in eden but when man sinned he died that meant he was separated from god he was then separated from eden you see he could not live in heaven because that was heaven on earth it was paradise it was eden it was wonderful it was it was everything that heaven one day will be amen maybe heaven would be a little more but it was heaven are you with me amen i know heaven will be a little more because there won't be no lucifer there there won't be no tempter anymore he has his place in the lake of fire aren't you glad to know the devil has a place death has its place it only serves for a moment in a time but one day it'll inhabit him it'll it'll take the last one of god's children into his presence it'll separate the last child from its mother and the last mother from his child it'll do its last damage one day one day it's coming to an end one day satan you're coming to an end one day sin you're coming to an end one day evil you're coming to an end but hallelujah there is no end to the child of god hallelujah for we came from god and we're going back to god we were eternal in his thoughts and we are eternal now we are not we are not at all temporary beings the baptism of the holy ghost revealed to you your eternity originally mankind lived in eden he got separated by sin driven out because sin and sinners cannot live in eden and eden was closed off to man with chairman's guarding the way back nobody can come back in but as i said god has never given up on human beings he's never given up on the earth he has never given up on his plan for humans to live here on earth and and earth will again some glorious day be in eden again the climax of history will be the creation of a new heavens and a new earth not in the sense of a creation like we think of a creation out of nothing but god will take and remake and remold and and the old will pass away and become a new creation by by the power of the word now should it be a resurrected universe inhabited by resurrected people living with the resurrected jesus hallelujah what awesome thought it is now to do this god has to have a resurrected people not just a resurrection of bleach bones and decayed bodies but a resurrected people who were quickened and made alive and and and brought forth back from death separation from god and brought back into unity with god where they in christ are one together amen not on this new earth will be people who will make up his bride who will be with him in the new jerusalem then there'll be millions of others who will be outside the city you know when we think about grace it's a lot larger than you can ever imagine a lot of times we think oh it's just grace upon the bride that's all he had in his mind no that's not all he had in his mind there are people in the lamb's book there are people in the book of life there is a bride and there is a church they're called in revelation 7 a multitude without number and they never received the holy ghost here they never drank of the the thousands of living waters here but revelation 7 said that he will wipe the tears from their eyes those who went through the great tribulation and he will he he will absolutely lead them to life to life-giving waters amen because why we can know him as the thirst quencher i think about every sinner that's all it is there are thirsty people god made you to thirst for god your man smokes because he's thirsty a man drinks because he's thirsty a man commits adultery or woman because they're thirsty amen they are thirsting for something that that sin cannot quench amen i stood with a preacher one day as i talked to him about his boy and you know he was a center boy and he said oh tim tim he said my boy is just thirsty and i looked at him i said thirsty he said yes he's so thirsty tim he's trying to quench it with everything else but he thirsts for a living god somehow we've got to get him to a living god amen because he is the only one that can satisfy the hunger in a human heart hey man but upon this earth can you think about what was revealed when the book was open you remember the lamb took the seals off the book that's why we're preaching we're the people of the book it's open it's not closed there's not six seals and one's left all the seals have been opened amen in fact it was the seventh one that opened up the rest of them it started the coming of the lord it broke the silence on the scripture it revealed the mysteries of the other seals somebody with me and it continues unfolding is it it's not a one-time event a singular event it just keeps unfolding and unfolding unfolding i turn in the end time events do you not know you're in the seventh seal do you not know you're in the coming of the lord do you not know that this is the hour where everything is coming to a climax even you are moving towards a climax it's an awesome power one thing he said it was like a roman candle one thing will open up for this and out of that we'll shoot five more out of that one it will come and there'll be another explosion and there'll be a and one event opens up another event and one event opens up another event and that event opens up another event until the whole coming is consummated with his return back to earth with the saints you see we're not in a time of just one coming in fact the first coming we usually talk about the rapture is more of a going away than it is a coming but there's another coming he's going to come back with his saints it'll be at the great battle of armageddon i want you to look up this morning get your eyes on your redeemer it's the hour where the redemption is being made known now as i said when the book was opened it revealed things you couldn't imagine who would ever thought under the fifth seal there would be jews who had been killed by all down to the ages but namely through hitler and eichmann and and stalin and all the mothers that killed those six million jews and there they were as martyrs under the uh under the under the altar as it were and they were crying out how long o lord how long and brother branham would look in there and by revelation he said these are not believers he said they are they're there for the testimony which they held they held onto the faith of abraham is that they are given white robes notice they wait till they get there to be given white rope who would ever thought there could be people there given white robes who had been blinded because they had not known their messiah and because of blindness they were in this condition and god in his grace and mercy saved them anyhow you sometimes think you know grace amen you think grace is just all about you god so loved the world she gave his only begotten name you think of that then seven a multitude we're talking about revelation seven a multitude without number you think you're the only one gonna have eternal life no you're not you think you're the only one that's going to be in the new heavens the earth no you're not amen there's going to be millions there brother bradley said there'll be people making that you never thought would make it there'll be people there that you didn't even know your testimony of your life turn them around in the best moment or perhaps their worst moment you know rather than coming around and saying it's us for and no more we ought to be a little more all-embracing and saying oh god save them i don't care i don't care if they just make it in they're not bribed but they're a multitude without number i don't care how you have to do it but somehow save on whether it's my kids whether it's my friend's mother is that stranger whether it's that sinner that's so far away from god never let me get so hard that i don't want nobody else in heaven but me oh yes there will be a bride she's entitled to the new jerusalem there will be those outside the city who will come and bring their their gifts into the city they don't live in the city but they live but they live don't give up on your loved ones yet are you with me amen don't give up on so well my my grandma my grandma brother she didn't believe the message and she did the best she knew don't give up on it just give put her in the hands of jesus amen just surrender them to god whatever you say about them one way or the other wouldn't change their destiny amen so why not just believe you can put them in the hands of a loving god who cares and understands the faults of humanity who forgives who accepts who's got more mercy than what you could ever imagine that's the kind of god i can love a god whose love is so great oh yes there definitely is a bride and she's a special set of heart people and if you're part of her by the baptism of the holy ghost which is the only way you can be bride you are a blessed person upon this earth will be people who make us bride who will be with him in the new jerusalem there'll be millions of others outside the city earth will be so enlarged that there'll be no more sea well he'll accommodate them all i just want to say you don't want to miss it amen heaven is a real place it's a place for the people of the resurrection you don't want to miss it if you you know brother branham said i i can't even describe it what it's really like he sublime wouldn't touch it i can't find a word in human language and he was he didn't have a large vocabulary but he said i can't find a word that can really describe what it's like but he said after being there i can't even be the same william branham anymore heaven is a real place now brother branham talked about this and things that are to be he said i do not think that heaven is a place my mother used to tell me about i believe the church has grown from that to think it used to be a hundred years ago or two i think old-timers used to think that everybody that died went up to heaven and had a heart and sat there on the clouds and played a harp now they knew there was a place called heaven but if that be so all the musicians have it on us in other words you better start taking some lessons now but it isn't that kind of a place it isn't playing harps at all although there are harps there and there is music there amen but he said i don't believe the bible teaches that but that was a con conception they had before the fullness of the word came into existence or the opening of the seven seals that's promised to us in this age then that we didn't understand and i believe heaven is a real place just the same as this is a real place reach over there and fill your pube by you in the wood there on the back it's real isn't it heaven is more real than that amen he said he said and we don't just sit up there for eternity and set up on the cloud we don't just strum our heart from all of uh here ever but we're going to a real place listen this where are we going to do things we're going to live we're going to work we're going to life to a real eternal life we're going to heaven a paradise and just like adam and eve worked and lived and ate and enjoyed in the garden of eden before sin came in we're right we're on our road right back there again right back the first item through sin taking us out the second item through righteousness brings us back in again justifies us and brings us back in hallelujah you think of it it's a real place a place where we live we enjoy we work just like adam and eve worked and lived and ate and enjoyed in the garden of eden that's what heaven is the present earth that we now live in is is a place actually it's an intermediate place if i could call it this world we're now living in it's a intermediate place between heaven and hell for the believer this wretched life is the closest you will ever come to hell and for the sinner this is the closest you'll ever get to heaven think about the best of this lifesaver is the only taste of heaven you'll ever have the present earth before it's renewed and the new jerusalem comes down upon it it's an in-between world it's touched by both heaven and hell we're actually in this dimension in this realm demons come in this realm and let me just talk demons don't just come they come and inhabit people amen and then to into this room angels come that's right angels have been seen in this realm amen not just now but through the bible amen but and now angels have been seen here they can they can live they can walk they can they can experience things in this dimension spirits amen there is one particular spirit that comes to live in us is called the holy spirit amen so again this present world is an in-between world that is touched by both heaven and hell earth leads directly to heaven or directly to hell this life affords us a choice between the two you say well brother tim but we were chosen before the foundation world that's true but you got to make a choice you must choose what he chose and the truth of it is being a predestinated seed you can only manifest what you are but nevertheless the best of heaven or the best of earth is a glimpse of heaven the worst of of this life is a glimpse of hell for the christian as i said the closest this is the closest you'll ever come to hell for unbelievers it's the closest you'll ever come to heaven and you cannot go on pretending this world that we know now is the only world we will live in one breath away is another world never forget you're that close say it's a ways away i can't say yes it's beyond your seat taste smell fill in here but i want you to understand it's not that far away one breath this mortal life is a temporary life so don't just go right on the life you know putting on the dog pretending this is all that it is and like you're somebody here you're nothing but dust brother branham would say it this way there are people putting on too much dog we call in the street expression what are you anyhow but six foot of dirt god have mercy on you i i don't care how you can dress and how you can act and what kind of home you live in and what kind of car you drive if you're not born of the power and spirit of the resurrected jesus christ you're lost and will go to hell just as sure as a martin will go to his box oh he's not popular today to preach about health but let me tell you yes this loving god has created a place called hell it has a beginning and it has an end now there's a fire that won't quench because he's a consuming fire and there is a destroyer a worm that won't die because he is the destroyer because the soul that sinneth it shall die there's no such thing as immortal life and hell you'll come to an end maybe a million years later but you'll come to an end it's your choice do you choose life or choose death brother branham said at the door to your heart and express about the painting where a man painted a picture in the critic the art critic looked at it and said oh you've got this picture and you're missing a handle on the door you got jesus knocking on the door and there's no handle and he was critiquing the picture and said you you left off something important here he said no sir in this door the handle is only on the inside he cannot open from the outside he cannot save you against your will he cannot heal you against your will he cannot send a revival against your will you've got to be willing to open the door and invite him in think about it how much it lays on you amen you've got to open the door to him he won't do it against your will he won't heal you you say i need healing well i'll tell you if you sit right there and your unbelief and say well it's for others not for me he can never heal you till you open that door amen and you say well the revival i'll tell you what i ain't going to act like that i'll tell you right now i'm not going to get inspired i ain't going to get drunk on the stimulation of revelation like that people talk about they got revelation and they don't have no stimulation your wine don't is a good you don't have no fears no life in it this doesn't went bad true revelation produces stimulation it causes the hallelujahs to thank you jesus the glory to god amen it causes tears to come down your face it causes hands to go up in worship come on and it translates from that into a life that you live don't talk to me about revelation and you can't show me no stimulation that's education not revelation education is dark and clear words and formulas and ideas and hypotheses revelation is quickening power you want revival you have to open amen you want healing you have to open you want salvation you have to open the door the life i'm talking about here is an eternal life it's not it's not an eternal church service don't get in your idea that we're going to go up there and heaven's going to be this boring place where we're all just shouting and glorifying god for millions and millions of years so i don't want to go to a place like that that sounds more like hell to me brother tim well it's not held to the cherubims but that's their job not yours cherubims were made to do that to say hallelujahs and glory to god that's their job that's not your job your job of course does include saying hallelujahs and glories to god thank you jesus and there's going to be plenty of that but i'm telling you again heaven's going to be more than a church service where we sing and sing and sing and absent mindly shout praises to god forever that's not heaven heaven is a place of wonderment it's a place of joy a peace of love can i tell you it has hills and valleys and mountains and rivers and the most crystal springs and crystal rivers and open fields and wooded veils peace when brother branham was in the pristine mountains of canada he told eddie biskell that heaven that he went to looked a whole lot like that with rolling hills and lofty mountains with beautiful fields like bluegrass indescribable colors more vivid than anything you've ever seen he said they had eyes but their eyesight was somehow greater than anything that we've ever had it's a land full of animals amen and wildlife where nothing will hurt or destroy all of my holy mountains for there the lion will lay down by the lamb and the wolf will be tame and the bit the bear will be will be cuddly and gentle a place where things you love here in this life you'll have some of those very things there houses lands is a city it's a country it's real because it has foundations it has streets and trees and real houses with real furniture to resemble things we enjoyed here and i'm not just talking about the millennium but in the present heaven which is the temporary holding place for the saints and where we will go to for the three and a half years temporarily it's a home brother branham when he went there hope told him but you have a home here he said no we're branhams we're vagabonds we don't own nothing he lived in a little one-room shanty that he that he rented and and had no indoor toilet or running water it was it was just a very shocked little shotgun house living in poverty him and his wife and they had a a chair that he had bought to come home from work and rest in and read his bible and study for the services and that was taken away and he looked over there and there the morris chair was things he enjoyed here there we're going to live on a resurrected earth in a resurrected universe inhabited by resurrected people living with the resurrected jesus hallelujah amen so why wouldn't we choose life why wouldn't we choose life wherever you dreamed or ever hope for greater than you can imagine and we can imagine great things he's got it in store for you why not choose life and not death and the death i'm talking about is being separated from god and spending her forever away from his presence in hell the torment of your missed opportunities will be worse than the torments of any flame you can imagine and just as heaven is a real place hell is not a fiction it's a real place i hope you never find out how real it is i hope that you find out the reality of heaven but i'm telling you it depends on the choice you make that decision of receiving a pardon from your sins that moment in his presence where you receive his life because you can't live this life there brother branham also didn't just go to heaven he also went to hell he said i believe i was in that place it's a bottomless pit even you as a sinner today if you're a sinner you're just you're still without foundations you know you you have no place to stand and you think oh i have some morals and you only find out that that'll just slip away from you and cave out from under your feet and i'm not i don't i'll never be a bad person and that slips out on your feet and you're just finally going head over heels over your head over heels over and over into an abyss and i'm not even talking about after death i'm talking about right now as a sinner that's the way you are you have no foundation there is nothing to really stabilize you you say well i'll be this and i'll be that and i have resolved and it crumbles beneath you brother branham saw billy paul like this as a sinner boy i know yeah he was drinking or smoking and doing some things at least smoking and slipping around and lying to his daddy and all of that and brother branham saw him in his condition as he was laying there having taken a shot of penicillin and was now there on the on the verge of death and he saw his boy in the condition a prophet's son you may be a deacon's daughter you may be a deacon's son you may be the preacher's daughter the granddaughter you may be this or that let me tell you without christ you're trembling down down down and sin will always take you further than what you ever wanted to go now i don't want to hear about this brother tim i just want to hear about heaven well let me tell you something just as heaven is real hell is real us there is a heaven to gain in the hell to shun you we are not here in this light playing games it's the intermediate place and only here you can make a decision there it'll be too late one breath away your decisions sealed forever too late to make a change and that was brother branham himself he could see it he said i was sinking into an endless eternity many of you heard me tell of this but i'm sinking into it and the endless eternity you find these souls in prison and i'm going to paraphrase it perhaps i won't just read the quotes but he said i was first going down through the clouds notice he's going down do you realize do you realize that it is a fallen world it's a fallen life do you realize you were born in this life with your compass set on hell and the only hope for you is to turn around not only were you there i was born in a good family i had a good mother and dad i went to church i was a good little boy but good people go to hell and i was headed there i needed a savior i was going down through the clouds into the darkness i was sinking down down down going back to billy paul billy paul in that condition brother branham saw him he said oh god don't let my boy die that way. he come out of the vision went back to prayer so i can't let's see my boy go like that lord i can't let him let him go like that and the vision comes again he sees him tumbling over and over and he's laughing he's going on his merry way you know all the time laughing and going on and and and and just partying falling over tumbling over and over and he says god have mercy don't let my boy die like that and he said about that time i saw a big hand reach out and catch his fall oh i'm so glad to know today friend that's what happened to me that's what happened to every saved person we were in that very condition falling and falling and violently falling but in that moment he reached out and he caught me i'm so glad he broke my fall put my feet on solid ground no i can't look at down my nose at anybody and say well i never did this or never that that i did enough just in my own unbelief rejecting of turning down of not accepting him when i should brother branham said i was in this condition and he tells about it going down to the clouds going down down down and i got into the reasons of the loss and there i screamed sometimes people get upset because we scream in church and we shout in church a lot of these tumbling down on their way laughing and giggling and shouting and screaming and all the other things that they're doing going that merry way they don't realize they're falling falling falling but that's what they'll do also and he says and then i screamed terror set upon me he said i was in the reasons of the lost and there was no foundation to it oh brother tim that that that's not a kid 15 years old just a young boy a man never done a lot of things yet hadn't smoked hadn't drank the only thing he said i never committed adultery couldn't say i hadn't lied i hadn't done this or hadn't done that he said i'd done plenty of things but he said i said to god i've never committed adultery god and he said it had no foundations i could never stop falling and for eternity it looked like i was gonna fall there was no stopping nowhere i think of that sometimes you know you begin with the ear that is open to all the nonsense that wants to tear down the foundations of this message and try to discredit his truth i've never seen a one of them yet that ever come of that that didn't start falling they step off of the word of truth and they they begin to fall and tumble i've seen them go down as low until they don't you know very first they they they don't believe in god's prophet and then they don't believe in his message then they don't believe in the christ that's in him and then they don't believe in the god who sent christ and then they don't believe in the bible the word of god and then they just keep falling until they don't even believe in god at all i screamed for my daddy my daddy wasn't there oh it's going to be a lonely place i screamed for my mother somebody catch me there was no mother there i was just going i screamed to god and there was no god there there was nothing there and after a while i heard the most mournful sound i ever heard and the most awful feeling and even a little listen to this prophet after being a literal burning fire would it be pleasurable to decide of what that was it was the most horrible feelings i ever had i heard a noise something like a haunted affair it was women they had the green stuff just to see their face that green stuff under their eyes so he sees these heads coming down painted faces like women today paint their eyes and you want to look like hell you'll get a chance to they were going oh and i just screamed out oh god have mercy on me have mercy upon me if you'll just let me go back i promise to be a good boy and and and and and he said he he said it looked like as i screamed out of god just let me go back he said those weary creatures were all around and i just become a new arrival well i'll tell you what you know when he went beyond the curtain of time he said i was new arrival there and they were all coming down to greet me now which one which one do you want greeting you one breath from here where do you want what is your decision what which direction you want to go what kind of people do you want to meet you're painting your face like hell artificial on the outside because there's artificial on the inside let me tell you you'll have companionship down there with other people just like you but they ain't going to commiserate with you and you tell your little sub stories to each other everyone will be so consumed and lost in your own misery there won't be no company in hell most hideous horrible ungodly feeling look like great big eyes eye big eyelashes look like like a cat right back this green stuff conquered and they were going uh what a feeling you know if we understood hell the slightest bit there would be nobody saying go to hell it's far too easy to go to hell it requires no change of course you were we were born with our autopilot set right towards hell it's nothing to take lightly hell is the greatest tragedy the greatest single tragedy in the universe god loves us enough to tell us in the bible the truth that there are true destinations not one and we must choose the right path if we're going to heaven and let me tell you all roads don't lead to heaven buddha won't take you to heaven harry krishna will take you to heaven islam can't take you to heaven amen there's only one that leads to heaven that's jesus christ for he said no one can come to the father except by me all other roads lead to hell your education leads to hell your communism leads to hell your secularism leads to hell all the book knowledge you can get of this world leads to hell amen there's only one book that leads to heaven and that's this bible and there's only one person that leads to heaven and that's jesus christ amen you must accept him and accept his pardon you can tune me out but you won't tune it out one day god and satan are not equal opposites neither is heaven and hell equal opposites god has no equal as a person heaven has no equal as a place hell is not going to be a wonderful place it's going to be agonizingly dull and closed in insignificant without company without help without god without purpose without accomplishment it won't have his own story you won't be laughing and drinking beer and sipping wine and listening to rock music there won't be no bands playing rap and rock and country and elvis won't serenade you he'll be too wrapped up in his own awful decision of selling his opportunity for popularity there won't be no one to commiserate with you to comfort you everybody will be alone in their own grief knowing they rejected life but there's good news this morning none of us have to go to hell hallelujah none of us have to go there and i want you to consider the wonder of it all god determined that he would rather go to hell on our behalf than to live in heaven without us hallelujah glory to god amen he wanted you so much not to go to hell that he paid a horrible price on the cross and with the hell in your place where you don't have to go [Applause] he left all of heaven it's thrown his beauty his tranquility his wonderment it's vivid colors his wonderful mountain it's eaten he left it all to come down the earth not only to redeem man but to redeem the earth and being that your body is the first of the earth he took on cursed earth you can get this and prove in his word and the other sermon on the future home he come and wrapped himself in cursed earth oh yes it started from a spoken word it started from a seed but then he took that life and began to wrap around it little sails taken from his mother of food and things like that when we talk about mother his incubator mary right amen and there built around there a body of dust hallelujah think about this god would take on cursed earth and he would live in a life that could die they could get sick they could grown with a headache they could bear your infirmities they could die on a cross that can be tempted by sin amen hallelujah and he took that curse earth brother branham said he took cursed earth down to the jordan river and made it obedient to the word of god and was washed in the river jordan by the prophet and yielded himself up to be filled with the spirit of god the first of the cursed earth to be redeemed so that out of there would come the elements of the water the blood and the spirit to bring for the bride the people of the resurrection who would have the same life he has there's a real people who'll be in this real heaven with the real jesus so heaven is just full of spirits brother tim and people are disembodied spirits you know brother branham once thought that but he went there and he said they could be felt in the touch but i know of one man that's there the man christ jesus who raised from the dead and became the intercessor between god the spirit god and man so that he is a man could make perpetuation for your sins there's a man there and when stephen was departing he saw him there he was really there wasn't an imagination he was there i see jesus standing at the right hand of the father i see him as the way the approach to god i see him as the only visible manifestation of the almighty where god became tangible but there are real people that be in a real heaven with jesus a bride who will be united with her groom strolling together with the other saints of the ages sharing their story how that god loved them how special he was to them sharing the memories of life together let me tell you this is how brother branham imagined heaven after he was there he tells us right after being there and and he goes to he goes to imagining and trying to explain you know i'm trying to put it out i have to be in there how it how it would be and he said in the message adoption he said after we just put on this glorified body and the great age that's to come when this glorified body this celestial body has been made a glorified body then i'll walk home and say brother neville brother humes let's go up to papa this morning he's god we know him now he's a savior he's a healer there you know there was and then he breaks off into this let me read it there never was such a thing as a creation of sin well that didn't go down good did it sin is not a creation not for sin is a perversion there's only one creator that's god sin is righteousness perverted what is adultery righteousness perverted what is lie it's the truth misrepresented certainly what is a cursed world is god's blessing turned to a curse to a curse word to god instead of a blessing you see a sin is not a creation sin is a perversion so satan could not create sin he can only pervert what god created that's exactly right and death is only a perversion of life notice he said i walk up and i say brother humes let's you and i and brother beeler some of the brethren we'll go up to papa god and say let's take a little journey hey boys you like the mountains when you were mortal you know i always like the mountain i like looking at them i never so much enjoyed climbing them or falling down them but i sure like looking at them be wonderful to be able to climb them and go up into the heights of them you boys like mountains when you were when you were mortal yeah we sure did whoa well there's a couple of million miles of them out there in this new world go ahead let's roam over them and he says he tells us that right while they're out there roaming to the mountain god is right present he said while they're yet speaking i'll hear isaiah 66. so there's no distance think of this no distance you can walk slowly and enjoy and stroll over this heaven and walk through its great gardens or you can travel like a thought and he said and you know all of us were walking there just about 500 years a little learned it's just a little journey he said or maybe a million don't make any difference i know i know it sounds crazy but it's the truth because there's no time it's eternity and as we're walking along you know who we meet out there i said well if that ain't sister georgie bruce now she's one of the spiritual ladies in brandon tabernacle while sister georgie you've been been a long time since i've seen you look but she looked just like oh she was always and maybe she's 10 million years old but just as young as she ever was she'd be scratching somebody on the back and i look and say what she to the lion how are you this morning sheena meow like a kitten and she says oh i've been down there talking to these sisters down there around them big flowers down there we've been out down here about 500 years looking around he said now i know that's crazy but it's the truth sounds crazy but it's the truth exactly that's the way god intended it well bless your heart sister georgia there's no harm can come nothing at all and in the evening time we'll go up to the mountain and say oh papa god i once was lost i once was in the muck of sin papa god and you saved me oh in the evening time amen not one great big church service but it's just all a wonderful day amen it's a day it's an unending day come on church amen but there be that time that you walk up the mountain you get so full of it seeing the wonderment of it the joys of it the beauty of it say oh papagon i was lost i was on the way to hell but you made heaven for me hallelujah amen you would rather go to hell than to live in heaven by yourself you wanted me with you greater worship than an angel an angel don't know what grace is he don't know what it means to be saved that's why the angels we sing about will bow their heads and listen because they cannot join that song because they don't know what it means to be redeemed amen they don't know what it means to have been lost and now saved he says here's what the best of this life can give you and he talks about the colgate dump being the stinkiness place i ever was at well i don't know about colgate i've never been there but i've been around an old paper meal man i don't know how the people live around it some men will get and they live up there and they make their living there and they'll walk out smells like bacon to me don't sound like any bacon i would smell like any bacon i'd want to touch but he said that old smoke just makes me sick to smell it and laying down there and that old smoke so sick to your stomach your stomach's just turning inside out like after taking castor oil you're just as sick as you can be and rats running all over you trying to eat on you that's the best of life think of it stink in this place sick in your stomach lay in there can't get up rats running all over you trying to eat you that's the best of this life those rats are diseases they are cancers coveted viruses flu tuberculosis measles whooping cough diabetes whatever they attack you they pull in your body until it can't hold life any longer you get old and you can't help yourself i'm not old but i've i've been some places where old people are no i'm not in denial i'm not old but i watch these men you know come in sometimes the same clinic that i've been in and they walk and i look at them and i look at this tall what used to be a great frame big muscles young had hair strong straight backs straight strength they could they could climb a mountain they could run laps they were strong you could lift weights and pounds and huge huge things men that was athletes and let me tell you you may be an athlete today but one day you'll be pulled down to the dust feeble you'll need someone to help you across the room because rats are eating your body that's the worst of this life but think of this then somebody reach down and turn you into an 18 year old boy a girl set you on top of a mountain in the very bloom of health and a fresh breath of air like that and a good cold drink of water well why would you ever want to go back to that old dump again new brother never never go back to that dump again let me tell you some good news before he left us he said i go to prepare a place for you hallelujah he has been preparing a place for us to come he has worked on it he has planned it he is bringing it to the world to a climax and the world you are living in right now it's coming to that climax because he's planned for it to end i go to prepare a place for you and i will come and i will receive you to myself so that where i am there you may be also. in the laodicean church book brother branham said this is the last warning and maybe it is for you today it could be your last one and that's let me say we are here in the laodicean age this is the last message there will not be god speaking to another age the last messenger has come he has gave the message from jesus christ to the age of this people in this last day he told us how they would be lukewarm and cold and and how that they would be christ's rejecters and put him on the outside and he would stand on the door knocking he told us the condition of this age and we're here but he also told us there's going to be overcomers in this thing and he said this is the last warning there will not be another the throne room has been set up the 12 foundations have been laid the streets of gold have been paid you know i heard the story of a man who went to heaven and he insisted on taking his gold with him he's got his little bag of gold and i'm not i'm not going to leave it leave it here so he takes it with him you know how the stories go he gets to the pearly gates and the angel said well what do you got well you can't break nothing here what do you got that you're bringing let me see it opens it up pavement pavement you brought pavement this is what we walk on here the treasures that we think are so great will be just pavement under our feet you'll be nothing compared to the glory there [Applause] the streets of gold have been laid i'm telling you what your prophet told you president that the heaven is ready for the gates of giant gigantic pearls are way raised and hinged i often wonder why gates of pearls why are there gates of piles brother tim well of course pearls are beautiful they're lovely but why why gates of pearls do you know how a pearl is made a pearl is made when a little helpless oyster or shellfish laying there in the sand down in this ocean and grains come across and float down a sand and he can't don't have hands to get rid of this sand so that the little oyster puts a little substance over it a little liquid over it and smooths it over and it just keeps building around and around that irritant and that irritant becomes apparel and i think of gates of pearl just think about the gates of pearl the entrance there our character got molded you stop those irritants those trials we're going to destroy you they ain't going to destroy you they make a pearl under the entrance of a character where you'll enjoy the blessings of heaven forever [Music] the gates of pearls are raised and hinged like a pyramid she stands so fair and glorious the heavenly beings who have prepared or watched breathlessly for she glistens and shines with the glory that is unearthy every facet of her beauty tells a story of amazing grace 12 foundations representing the 12 apostles and 12 patriarchs and all the other gates are all that way you know every facet of her beauty tells the story of god's great grace and redemption she is a city prepared for prepared people she awaits only for her inhabitants oh do you know where we're at the gates are hung the streets are laid i'm talking about what jesus said i'd go to prepare a place amen the heavenly beings stand prepared they've been watching oh my oh thank you jesus she's a city prepared for a prepared people she awaits only listen only thing only thing she's waiting is her inhabitants and soon they will throng her streets with joy yes it's the last call the spirit will not speak in another age the ages are over if this is the last message from jesus himself to the laodicean messenger don't turn your heart away from it because there is nothing else that can turn your heart back to faith let the musicians come i'm just going to stop right here he's got a certain designation for us a certain place he said i'll meet you in the air when he left from here 2 000 years ago he said go terry in the city of jerusalem i'm going to meet you there on the day of pentecost he came that was the coming of jesus christ in spirit form to the church to come and dwell in the church to embody her for seven ages but now we too have a special designation after receiving that place every person's got to go to their upper room you're not going to get to heaven you're not going to be a part of the bride without getting in that designated place go cherry there until you're endued with powerful money you've got to have power to live an overcoming life you can't nobody but jesus can live the christian life and you can't live it and i can't live it without him there's a designation no one designation left we will meet him i want you to meet me in the air but you can't meet me without a change you got to change these old vile bodies and they got to be changed from mortal to immortality once about your heads just for a moment i want you to think on this say well i'm a good person good person to go to hell the bible said there is none that doeth good there is none that righteous no not one don't you try to make it on your own merits oh brother tim this is not a very deep sermon this is more deeper than you think if you missed this you missed everything if he's not the lord of your life this morning if he's not a ruler over those habits over that sin in your life but with that unbelief it's time to make him ruler you can't remain in the condition you are and meet god you've got to make your call in an election sure listen i i just had a man down here been around the message for years and years been a preacher claimed to be a pastor's church attended our meetings came into the minister's luncheons living a lie i was an alcoholic i pray god delivered him he had his opportunity may he walk in that
