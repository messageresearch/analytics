Looking back at how good he's been and [music] I was just away this week and at a conference of burn survivors and uh very [music] very sad stories many times of people being burned so uh incredibly and very disfigured. And [music] there was a lady there, her name was Chi-Chi, and she's from Nigeria. She was 14 years old. She was [music] um cooking over an open fire there and she had an epileptic seizure and fell straight into the fire and um suffered [music] severe burns on her face. She had severe um disfigurement and blinded and um [music] so they had an open mic thing and they helped her onto the stage and she stood there and she [music] talked about how good God was to her how wonderful he'd been in her life and without anybody being there to give a key she stood in front of an entire group of people and said all my life you have been [music] faithful. Amen. And I think we can tell him that all my life you've been so [music] so good. No matter what [music] you've been through in your life, you can say, "Lord, I'm running for my life. I'm going to give you everything this morning." [music] Amen. Maybe you can tell him, "Lord, [singing] I love your voice. [music] You have led [singing] me through the fire in the darkest night.
