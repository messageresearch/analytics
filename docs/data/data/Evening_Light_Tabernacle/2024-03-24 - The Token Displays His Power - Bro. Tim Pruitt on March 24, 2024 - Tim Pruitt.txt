just be playing it softly just be fine and so I'll just catch the key of it here in a moment you know life comes along with changes that happens to us all and I reflected over again um this year and in even in the last few days um 56 years ago I uh moved from Boer City Louisiana that's just across the river from streetport I was born in streetport and uh they didn't have a hospital at that time in Boer so I was born in Freeport my parents lived there and um they moved to a farm of 120 Acres over in clayber Parish and it was in March of 1968 when that farm was purchased I was 13 I would turn 14 the following September and those of you that know me know that I've lived on that farm there for all of these years built a couple of homes there on that land and um some of you helped me actually with both of those homes to to uh make it where we could keep a ministers and different ones um we hosted you know great um my wife put on bridal showers and great um baby showers and uh birthdays and all kinds of things that uh we did there 1972 as a church we moved from my dad's home um and started meeting in an old abandoned church building I hadn't had service in it for 13 years it was u a big old white frame building had no heat had no air conditioner I had six light bulbs and one receptacle to plug something in and um we worked on that every way we could and and uh finally got facilities in there running water and natural gas and uh you know through the years we outgrew that and we built a new on the property there and dedicated it in [Music] 1996 in the year of 2013 realizing we was landlocked and we had to do something and I received a Divine mandate from God and you know it had to do with the healing of Brother Gary stanan where that I was in the hospital there with him a man who was dying the doctor said he was dying and God raised him up and in that moment there I received a mandate to to do something different to build another building and um to uh to start something there and so we we bought this land in 2013 40 acres we can't be landlocked here I hope and we um started building and then dedicated this in 200 17 it's a miracle we uh we were so blessed because we paid for every every bit of it with cash God provided for it he not only showed himself as Jehovah Gyra the provider but he did even more than that he he blessed us with a wonderful youth facility and you know also then the The Pavilion and the mes Park and all of that well you know um in in the year 1972 is when we moved out of my dad's home into a a church building and and uh and cuz I at 15 that started preaching and there I was 17 at that time and the church has just grown and you know went to where we had to do something different and this year this 15-year-old boy preacher turned 70 so you know I have some changes in my life as you know now next year sister Karen and I would have been married 50 years and God rescued her from a brutal s satanic attacks that he used in his attempts to destroy me and uh she's now been gone for 2 years and 7 months now before the first of the year I was praying earnestly about my life and what I what I'm to do you know I've I've always tended to be more proactive than reactive and so I was praying earnestly and about my future as I look toward older Years brother Josh Bennett came here and preached uh our New Year's meeting on the changing of the seasons and it confirmed what I was praying about and I made the decision to leave the farm and move to Menan and I want to thank my family and my church family and there have been many that have helped me go through 50 years of accumulated things to and move to mendum and still have some more things to sort out and whatever but I want to thanks to give thanks to all the help of those involved and there have been a lot of volunteer work on my house the the lay family all of you brother John Brother Joseph brother Tom Herring brother Jim Morgan there so many others I I can't name you all because I'd have to stand here and name the whole church who have have um lifted up and and help me with this and facilitate this move and I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart so I have now moved my residence officially from what we called PR bille on the farm about 20 mi north of Menan here and um I'm living here and uh you know one day I'll make an opportunity to welcome you to my home that that I have here but anyway we're going to another home and we're getting ready to to leave here and so with that this morning we just want to look to the Lord with all our hearts and um and and press on now to whatever the future lays I trust there will not be another Youth Camp I not here I trust the next Youth Camp will be in glory so may the Lord be with us as we progress as we move we're moving toward the Rapture I am I I know that the Lord is coming because we're part of that coming and I know he's preparing a PE people for his name's sake and I know we're a part of that people so with all of our hearts we press on Seasons may change times you know of our future I I I believe our future is clear I believe we have clear streams ahead I'm looking for greater times greater outpouring of the Holy Spirit greater Faith than ever I'm looking for men and women to rise to the occasion of being end time leaders in this last day and I want to thank you for being a part here with me at evening light Tabernacle let's Stand Together each step I take my savior goes before me and with his loving hand he leads the way and with each breath I whisper I adore thee oh what joy to walk with him each day each step I take I know that he will guide me to Higher Grounds he ever leads me on until the day the last step will be taken each step I take just leads me closer Home I trust in God no matter comes what may for life eternal is in his hand he holds the key that opens up the way that will lead me to the promised land each step I take I know that he will guide me to Higher Grounds he ever leads me on until someday the last step will be taken each step I I take just leads me closer Home amen God bless you turn with me to Exodus 12 and verse 21 anden I want to thank you for accompanying me on that I kind of sprung that as a surprise on that I'm not a singer but I'm you know we continue to take steps like Enoch did until we go home amen Exodus 12: 21 then Moses called for all the Elders of Israel and said unto them draw out and take you a lamb according to your families and kill the Passover and ye shall take a bunch of hisab and dip it in the blood that is in the Basin and strike the lentil and the two- side post with the blood that is in the Basin and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning for the Lord will pass through to Smite the Egyptians and when he seeth the blood upon the lentil and on the two side post the Lord will pass over the door and will not suffer the Destroyer to come into your houses to Smite you amen may God bless his word you can be seated we're going to speak today on the token displays his power as we're looking at this this morning we know it was a very serious hour in Egypt when Israel was leaving that place and going into their promised land and of course they wouldn't get there in one day it would be a journey through the Wilderness they didn't realize it would be 40 Years of Journey and of course it didn't have to be that because of Disobedience it would it would take place like that where that there would be 40 Years of wandering in the wilderness and of course on this night the there would be a separation between the Egyptians and the Israelites in so much that there would be death that would come upon the first born of of every house in the land and of course in the and the children of Israel they were given a lamb to die in their place so there was blood that would be applied that would be showing that the death angel had already passed through and he had that death had already came to that land and the Death Angel then would pass over that house because he would see death has already been there and and of course that goes in the beautiful type of Christ where he became our lamb and and of course he is the one who protect us from the death angel that is coming through and we're living in an hour where there is death in the land and if you would read the book of Revelation and you would know where we are in that book as it as it spells out the end time that you know that the fourth horse rider which is death is about to take his ride and as it as he morphed from the red and or and from the red the white the red into the black and then to the pale then he he is there poised to make his final ride and and and bring death to the whole world and we're living in a day where where it's very real the Bible said that that the Earth will burn as an oven and there is of course a civilization here who is well capable of wiping it out with their nuclear weapons and we're closer now to that Midnight Hour than we ever have been and Israel of course being under attack the way it is it shows us the signs of the time and we were told to watch Israel and you look and see what is happening there and you also know that things are similar happening here and Satan is doing everything with a spiritual Slaughter just as he did with the with Israel over there to slaughter to kill to maim to to to plunder uh every child of God and this is why that it is so important that we be under the token of the blood of Jesus Christ for he said when I see the blood I will pass over you now we have spoke about how in um the in other services about this and the last one that I spoke was on a lamb for a household and and I I just talked about the the preparations that we must be making for the Rapture and then the practical application that is more than just saying oh I'm under the token it's more than just a cliche of of words it's more than just um even saying well I've kicked out the trash you know the uh we got out the bad newspapers and the the television and the all the evil things like that and so we're now under the token but then we found that it must be applied to our lives you know to to our body our soul our spirit you know to every part of us as as the the blood would be put in three places on on each side of the door and then over that every house must come under the blood but now I want to bring it down to another step because I want you to understand that not only your house your body must be brought under the blood not only your home your household must be brought under the blood but also the blood must be applied to the church so this is very very important because we are also a house so the Bible said to every house so the church itself must have the blood applied and and brother Brandon would tell us in the message of toen and today every church every individual that isn't and cannnot display that token of the Holy Ghost is spiritually dying and will die so not only are we seeing death uh in individuals as as um as manhood is dying and Womanhood is dying and and motherhood is dying you know um the whole family structure is breaking down and and that then then we we see it there in the home where where again families are are being wrecked and ruined and marriage and given and marriage and the evil day as it was in the days of Noah but then we see that also churches are dying they are losing the very Life of Christ that the Holy Ghost isn't there and and many places that kabad is over the door the glory of the Lord has departed so it's a it's a day where there's death and dying but there also uh it's a day of also life where we receive the death of the lamb and his blood has been applied and we have received of his spirit and so the token must be also upon the church and the token is the Holy Ghost now in the Bible there he said the blood shall be a token to you but today the life of the blood which is the blood of Jesus Christ his life the holy spirit is our token it's the sign when we receive it that we have passed from death into life and that the death angel can pass again he said today the Holy Ghost is God's covenant with God's covenant people the Holy Ghost the life of the resurrected Christ has got to be displayed in the church notice now we again emphasizing the church uh uh amongst the people making him the same yesterday today and forever so you see it's got to be displayed in the church in a way that it makes him the same yesterday today and forever now that is the message amen the true message of God the true teaching of the church brother Randon would go through this and the five identifications of the Church of the Living God and he tells us John 14 which you know what that is John 14:12 which says verily verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater than these shall you do because I go to my father so he gives this teaching this was the teaching of Jesus of what the church should do amen now we you know there have been Ministries there have been Apostles there have been prophets and we have had a prophet Ministry in this age but let me tell you it's more than just them doing the works The Church Must do the works of Jesus Christ so he gives a teaching of what the church must do that is the message of the church Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever living in the church King of the church raised from the dead same yesterday today and forever performing the same Works doing the same things that Jesus did that's the message of the church so our real message is we must do what Jesus did if Jesus healed the sick we must not let the sick lay if Jesus reached out to the lost and the sinner then we must provide a place and an atmosphere where the Holy Spirit can move whatever did Jesus did we must do what he taught we T must teach his works that he did we must do you see that's the message of the church now listen and brother Brandon would say if the church isn't teaching that it's teaching some false Theology and that's what Jesus commanded them to preach that's right so this must be preached put that scripture back up Katie you know John 14:12 this must be preached this must be our messag amen so I'm in the message well this must be the message that we are represented of Christ as his bride that the works that he did we do also and not just his works but greater than these so therefore we we have been challenged by almighty God to step up a higher level this age causes if we're going to preach the true message we must not only bear his name in baptism like our brother David Peak will do in a moment but but we must we must also be identified as a church true church by doing his works now originally you know first the the early church were were known as Christians they were at first called Christians at Antioch and what they believed was called the way many of you don't realize it but they would they would say instead of saying I'm in the message they would say I'm in the way we believe in the way this was their identification and their their identity was with Christ Christian and so they this this perhaps came from Isaiah 40 and3 prepare the way of the Lord but also no doubt when Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life so the original Church would say we are in the way we are walking in the way we are teaching the way of the lord we are preparing the way of the Lord they were looking for the Rapture in their age they didn't know they would go to sleep they didn't know there would be seven Church ages they didn't know that we were coming that's right but God had more in the book that's right amen he had more names in the book than them and and so time would go on in order to manifest every name on the book but we're coming down to the end of the book and we must be in the way and we best be Christians now a little later there were men came up with doctrinal differences they began to differ from the from the original church at Pentecost they began to change the formula of water baptism where there was nowhere anywhere in the Bible that anybody was ever baptized than in the name of Jesus Christ and they would when you know when when when they they would change it over into titles which are not names but the father Son and Holy Ghost to represent a Triune God when God is one God here o Israel the Lord thy God is one Lord this is this is a one God Bible it's not a three good Bible there's no such things as three three Gods neither are there three persons in the Trinity there is one God one person of God and he was manifested in Jesus Christ and Jesus is the very God that weigh the truth and the life and there is no salvation in any other name but his name so you see a group rose up and The Trinity was formulated not in Bible Doctrine but 325 Years Later by Turan who come up with the Trinity Doctrine a word that's not even in the Bible and you see they were pagans and they had a pagan mindset of multiple deities and so they embraced paganism so therefore they called their name Universal Christians which means Catholic so you see anybody that's baptized in the titles of Father Son and Holy Ghost are baptized into the Catholic Church they're not baptized into Christ there's one way amen there's one way one Lord One Faith one baptism are you with me one God father of us all this is Bible Doctrine has been there all the way through it's what it's what they believed in the Old Testament it's what they believed in the New Testaments in the New Testament the apostles didn't come up with another deity and say oh we forgot one the Holy Ghost so we got three of them but the pagans did the UN Universal Church the universal that would be inclusive that would change the their their statutes of you know to the pagan gods and and so on that they worship the idols that they worship and would renamed them to Peter and James and John saint this and saint that and Saint somebody else and on and on and on and there was um one of one of the early leaders his name was ignatus he was the first to use the word Catholic and he was among those who brought the idea that a bishop was one of preeminence or authority over the other Ministries and this helped set a platform for the pope who would rule over all so you know they started out as all Brothers amen just one Ling family but the next thing you know we have a hierarchy of ministry and then that Ministry would Overlord over other ministers and then that Minister would then had one over over him so you had you had a pope and then you had a cardinal and then you had Bishops and then you had a priest and then you come down to the nuns and the Layman and so on like that and it's called nickan ISM because they set men over men to rule the church and the church became ruled by men instead of of the spirit of God and they took on a name that was different from Christian now they're Catholic Universal I'm going somewhere with this now due to the nickan doctrine and the the the heavy thumb of the Pope the reformers struggled against Rome and Luther was one of those and he was one of the first that broke away from the Catholic church and his movement was called by his own name now Luther actually objected to this he he did not want his movement as he would call it he want he he did not as it would be called identified with him he wanted it he wanted them to be Christians and I I want you to be realized you know sectarianism wants to force its way and make us make us call this or that or something besides Christians above Christ and take on another name so Luther said in the first place I ask that men make no reference to my name let them call themselves Christians not Lutheran what is Lutheran after all or what is Luther after all the teaching is not mine neither was I crucified for anyone St Paul PA in 1 Corinthians 3 would not allow the Christians to call themselves Pauline or petrin but Christian so how then should I a poor stinking maggot fod that I am come to have men call the children of Christ by my wretched name not so my dear friends let us abolish all party names and call ourselves Christians after him whose teaching we hold the pap deservedly have a party name because they are not content with the teaching and the name of Christ but want to be papist as well let them be papis then since the pope is their master I am neither I neither am nor want to be anyone's master I hold together with The Universal Church the one universal teaching of Christ who is our only master I dislike very much that Doctrine and I and people have to suffer to be called Lutheran and thus see God's word profaned by my name so you know it actually though would start as a label of division you are Lutheran now we're Christians well you you're following Luther no we're followers of Christ and and then it became an identification that we're Lutheran we follow Luther's message I me all you have to do is put brandom in there you see exactly what what the spirit is going on in this day you see it became as a title of derision and Scorn and that's how it began and it became a labeling of Pride and people willingly took on the name Lutheran and starting back in the sardan age from the birth out of Rome there came others you know the Bible talks about it talks very plain language it talks about a great and it talks about her daughters so the great we we know that started out and and from her would birth all the other denominations would be the Catholic church and then there would be others and they would take on the name of a certain Doctrine the Baptist became known as Baptist because they baptized by immersion and didn't believe in infant baptism good things good truths lutherans would become Lutheran because they identified that with with Luther's protest against the heavy hand of Rome where that he nailed his 90 0th what third 95th thesis to to the door and and and there he would he would declare you know the and the start of the reformation and so you see it would start though with that a tremendous growth to denominational spirit and and I'm quoting this from the church A's book that if the Corinthian attitude of I'm of Paul and I'm of cus was ever exhibited it was now there were Lutheran and hussites and Z English party and and such fragmentation of the body was deplorable they were living a name but were dead certainly they were dead they died the minute they organized the great groups organized and tied themselves to the matrimony in matrimony to the state so in other words they would get their power from political power they would get Kings and rulers and local rulers and their armies to stand behind them and be persuaded by their Doctrine and support them so it didn't become just a religious move it would be also a political move and so and so they were they tied themselves to in matrimony to the state they did it they were and they were finished here were those lutherans who criticized the Roman Church they knew the unrighteousness of political and spiritual unions yet Luther as when Peter was overbalanced by the judaizer went right ahead and made the state instead of God the defender of the faith so you know Luther would actually welcome that support and this was the first denomination of repute that came out of the Harlot but when Luther died it was not long until the it had a hierarchy like the one it had fought this move of God by the time of the second generation came along was right back under the wing of her mother she had gone back and didn't even know it they had taken on their own name above his name name they were living their own name to and all the denominations are doing the very thing today they are living their own name and not the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that is easily seen for every church is known by the way it worships but none are known by the power of God now here I want you to get the picture they're known by the way they worship and they're known by their Theology and their doctrinal stats but they're not known by the power of God they they gave up the power of God for the power of the state they clung to their own name and made their names their own names great it was that old Spirit of getting everybody into his fold today the Baptists want the Methodist to come over to the Baptist the methodists are out to proelite the Presbyterians the Pentecostals want them all each claims to offer the most and hold out the greatest hope a sort of door of Heaven uh or at least a way to a more abundant entrance how tragic it all is but again the scripture says that God anointed Jesus at nazarus with the Holy Ghost and power and he went about doing good and healing all that was oppressed as Jesus went away he told his disciples to T into Pentecost unto at which time the very same spirit that was upon him would come back and fall upon them and fill them notice it is is not even the doctrine it is the spirit of Jesus that is to give us our identity the identity again for the for the Israelites was the life of the Lamb to be on the door our identity again it should not be just word only but it must be the life of the spirit of God Amen so again again he said that they were told to to tear the Pentecost until the same spirit that was on him came back upon them and they would fall on them and fill them and then that called out body the church would be in his dead upon the Earth taking his place I want you to get the picture we are to be in his T we are to be taken his place we must come in his name doing his works and because the same spirit that was in him was in them then they would do the very same works and any people that is truly the body of Jesus Christ the true church WIll manifest the same works as Jesus and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them at any other church that does not have the spirit and manifestations is going to have to account to God can you imagine standing there on that day by a different name or identity I want to say today the power and the works of Christ must be our identification so is either when you Tak what some organization said some man-made Theory you know that preach the doctrine of that theory then that's their credentials this is their acceptance you know to the Deacon board or whatever it is to be in good fellowship with that organization but and and as brother brand was I don't have anything against that but what I'm defending is Jesus said these signs shall follow them that believe here is what we are defending and it says in John 14:12 verely verely I say un you absolutely absolutely I say to you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and how can a man believe he is sent from God and then turn around and deny the very commission that God said would that would be the identification of every person that he sent out I want you to get not one man not one person well not one great man among us but every person have that identification The Works that I do these signs shall follow them that believe Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the same in every detail except his Corporal body amen but yet here he is in a body on the earth a bride body a people a church called by his name identified with him by his works by his power amen so how you know men are so willing to take on another name I'm Lutheran I'm Methodist I'm two Soul I'm seventh Thunder I'm this I'm that you know some I'm perusia we're this all party Spirits all organizational Spirits all Daughters of the amen everyone I'm Daughters of the same horish system with a hierarchy of man some great one leading us on let me tell you we have a great one and it's Jesus Christ amen he's the great one it's his name that had must be ENT we're identified with his name must be the exalted name Among [Music] Us so men will willingly take on other identific ations but the identification that he sent out would be these signs the works that I do this is going to identify my disciples amen so how can a man say there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost how can a man say there's no such thing as healing of the sick how can a man say there's no such a thing as speaking in tongues and cting out Devils when that was the very credentials that Jesus pinned onto every believer that that he sent out that's the authority listen this shows you have been sent of God you said well many many will come to me and that day and say Lord Lord but let me tell you that may be them with a lying sign and a lying Wonder but the church's identification is he is the same yesterday today every ever that the works that I do shall he do also amen that these sign shall follow them that believe in my name in my stad this will identify here you will know these are mine they will lay hands on the sick and they shall recover they will cast out Devils they will speak with new tongues that is our credentials Lord yes you might go to school and get a PhD and lld or whatever where you want that's all right that's your identification to your organization and them's all right said I have nothing against them wish I had them but the identification that Jesus when he sends a man is these signs shall follow them that believe see that's the identifications that he sent by God so to know that a man would be sent of God he'd have the same life of God therefore the same power of God therefore the same works of God you see how important it is that our message must be John 14:12 amen The Works that I do shall he do also and greater than these shall you do that must be our identification amen we must be known as a people who believe Mark 16 amen we must be known as a people that when people come in here and the sick are coming with heavy laden with sickness or heavy laden with sin that they can find a place of Refuge that must be our identification amen I ask you today would Jesus call you a Believer the spoken words Original Seed brother brandham poses this question he said the works that Jesus did if a man has the seed of God in him with the spirit of God watering that seed the same works that was manifested in Jesus him being the Original Seed of God his death brings you back to the original origal seed of God and if the same spirit that was within him is in you the same Works will be manifested you don't believe that we'll turn over to John 14:12 you say I'm a Believer brother Brandon I sure am a believer all right I'm going to see if Jesus would call you one see if the word of God called you one very very absolutely absolutely I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall you do because I go to the father what is it same seed thus works the same manifest in his church that was manifested in Christ he said so John 14:12 heavens and earth will pass away but my word Shall Not So no matter how much word we have you say well we're a word church and I believe in the word yes sir amen but I I want to say again letter kth and without the spirit is just dead that's right amen even even the word preached must be mixed with faith that's right so well we're pure word if you don't have faith mixed with it it ain't of no account that's right amen so you see if he ever was God he still God Amen so he said it's a lack of faith that has been preached into the people that makes them let that six sense which is Faith laid dormant so it's so important Faith be preached Faith with the word faith with the word come on Amen signs fallowing them that believe actions of the Holy Ghost not just word not just doctor not just known by doctor but known by the works [Applause] Jesus even said if you don't believe me then look at my Works brother Bram would go on and on and on I'm going to do I'm going to do a sermon on it one of these days brother Bram would go over and over he said the bride must stand at that same spot who can convince me of sin who can say I'm an unbeliever The Works that my father does I do now the token or the Holy Ghost is the power that keeps the death angel from our church without it we're just a meaningless group of people we're just a corpse without a life kiss all you want to on the corpse it's dead make love to it all you want to call it all all kinds of pretty names it's dead paint it any color you want to it's dead we must have the Life of Christ the Holy Spirit must be applied to the church and when it does it creates an atmosphere now I want you to get this because both wisdom and faith can both produce atmospheres and and brother Brandon would preach that sermon wisdom versus faith and he would show he said let's let's take these two sources what you call atmospheres and see what they create so wisdom creates an atmosphere and Faith creates an atmosphere atmospheres both of these sources will produce create an atmosphere so he said I want to ask you something I say this reverently it's to make a point point so God forbid did you ever go into a church where the pastor is real starchy the congregation is the same way that's right what is it it's that atmosphere that brought it think about that you go into church the pastor's real starchy and he says the congregation's the same way why he said it's the ad atmosphere that brought it you go into place we say well wait a minute pastor says wait a minute there's no such thing is that nonsense I don't believe in such thing as Divine Healing about baptism of the Holy Ghost you'll see every one of them the congregation and if there's an eagle in there somewhere he'll get out he'll get out from amongst that bunch of chickens uhhuh exactly the truth sure will he can't stand that he's an eagle he's skyb built bird not a barnyard amen now we find out those atmospheres and you get in where faith is taught in a church you'll find a church in that atmosphere sir so let's take the other side for a minute will you have faith taught in a church amen you're going to find a church in that atmosphere amen because there'll be an atmosphere of believing there'll be an atmosphere where Miracles can happen miracles of a new birth mirac mirales of the baptism of the Holy Ghost Miracles that has save you from sin come on Miracles that will heal the sick that will cast out Devils Miracles When Faith is preached when the true faith is preached Miracles will happen now he said oh God let me get this to you if you can see it that's the reason people come among the saints where they're praying Believers Paul said he didn't find any in the city Only Timothy that was like Precious faith that he had you know the rest of them were all denominational see but when you he get but when he got into that atmosphere see he you find those things going the atmosphere has created you find people living by faith when you get in a place where it says my why the Bible is true God heals amen you walk around their congregation and you'll find those like sister Lanta I was dying of cancer and I was healed come on Amen what one moment dying the next moment well amen go back to the doctor and find out what not one trace of it amen why because fath fa was taught and because of that It produced an atmosphere and in that atmosphere healing took place Hallelujah why because we believe we were living in Bible days in Bible times preaching Bible Doctrine Bible truth with Bible Holiness with a living God Among Us Hallelujah and we saw a living God manifest himself Hallelujah and that's not the only case time would fail us to just go through one after another after another after another after another stranger says what what do you mean what was the matter with you well I'll show you on my record come home with me come eat dinner with me I'll show you some I got a record there my neighbors know I was this kind of condition I was paralyzed for years I was pray prayed for what is it that word in that church listen now that word in that church that group of believer has created that atmosphere well if we're really preaching the message if we're really preaching the word it will create an atmosphere where there will be healings and miracles and signs and wonders and power and the works of Jesus will follow Hallelujah say brother Tim you're kind of an extreme preacher while this is an extreme gospel these things are hard to believe well you'd have been very hard pressed in the days of Noah You' been hard pressed in the days of Enoch when he kept walking with God and was not going to be another Enoch in this day a bride seventh from the second Adam going to take a Rapture each step we take takes us closer Home the word in that church that group of Believers has created that atmosphere now how is the word in Simplicity but yet in its completion ever going to grow in a place where knowledge overshadows that and say says it can't be so see it can't so when knowledge is preached from a seminary the children die I don't care if it's a message Seminary amen when knowledge is preached from the Seminary the people die the children die amen but when faith is preached from the word the children live amen that's the different just life and death amen you know you know we we we know we know the power you know I I've I've seen I've been in churches I have been in churches calling themselves by the by the word of God preach to them and and the pastor tell me Well in the year 2000 I got a revelation from God ain't nobody else going to be saved I said well Mercy goodness I said I wouldn't want to believe that I said don't you know what that'll do it'll damn your children your grandchildren your loved ones everybody else I said you can't close the door of Mercy amen but you see that produced an atmosphere so you know one of their preachers come up to me and said brother Tim have you seen anybody even in years saved I said yeah sir oh no I'm not talking about one of the believer's children I I'm talking about out in the world yeah I said my son-in-law brought his nephew Jeremy ersin to Camp with his long-haired hippie boy a drug Pusher a bartender selling drugs on the side living at high or at least using drugs on the high living on the side they live living a a runchy life I watched him come to camp you know something about Camp atmosphere it's charged people come with expectation amen they know they know what is done in lives they know the healings of Miracles that have Tak they know the transforming power Jeff want wanted this nephew saved he was in trouble he was astray he brought him to the camp said we're going camp camping will you go camping with me he didn't tell him was a church camp said oh you know as he got closer you know he said now um this camping we're going to do uh there's going to be services and you know we're he kind of explained so you know he just thinks he's been given a bad deal you know for the weekend and he's mad and angry sits in the very back back there I told the deacons leave him alone I said he don't want to be here he kind of got tricked into coming just but the Lord will deal with him in his time and that boy was sat back there on the in the back the first service or two the next one he's about halfway up come through the prayer line and and you know he watched others coming through and he stood back and he said Jeff asked him said did you go to the prayer line yeah or do you want to go through the prayer line well I already did but ain't nothing happened to me like happened to them you just stand there kind of sad next service he's on the he's on the front row and it's a morning service on Saturday morning and I was going to take the ministers out to to eat a me mediately after the service but I felt right quick you know we we we we have a dinner break and you have to work with the camp times and the cooks and all of that so you know service has to be kind of cut short so I I we normally don't didn't have an altar call on on on the morning but I felt the nudge of the Holy Spirit as he moved on my my heart right there and I went into there and I made an altar call that morning I was I was fishing I was casting the net here Jeremy come we led him to the Lord God changed his life that night in the service and Sunday morning he didn't know he didn't know now how to shout he didn't even know how to shout so he whistled you can hear him you know all over the place he just UPS you know in his own way shouted did it hold he's still a believer does it work he's a married man with wonderful children serving the lord it works the token works the Holy Ghost works the atmosphere you get them in have you seen people saved yes is Mercy over no is it Grace yes it's amazing grace it's a god rich in Mercy he can take the viest of the viest The Sinner of The Sinner he can take a man that hadn't hadn't had a a sober day in years and years and one moment in his present take every bit of it [Applause] away Chang his life forever that's our God that's the power of this Christ amen that's the workings of the Holy Ghost ghost but you see it depends on what atmosphere is being preached if wisdom is being preached and you can preach the same word in wisdom or you can preach the same word in faith so he says so he says you know you get that word in that church has produced a atmosphere that's what we want produced an evening light Tabernacle is an atmosphere where the Lost can be saved where the drunk never ever drinks again where the dop head has found his joy in the Lord and he don't need it anymore amen come on where faith is preached from the word the children live amen you see what happened in the Garden of Eden there you see there was those two atmosphere and and Eve got off of the correct one and got onto the wrong one and when she did she died see here comes Satan with his wisdom and what did he do he used to quote yeath God said so he said so they cannot stay if your church has got that kind of atmosphere of wisdom oh child if you want to live believe the word that's what we want to be as word Believers we want to be identified with him who is the word now now you know I hear it said oh this atmosphere you're talking about it's just culture brother Tim it's just culture you're just Southern because you're Southern you know you are more free and more open and you know more more more expressive you're not uptight and cold like us Northerners so it's just culture now we got a Canadian here this morning but I'm not preaching that her I'll just make a disclaimer there we got a few more Canadians around here don't raise your hands you'll be identified but you know I I want you to say brother Brandon spoke of the Canadians at Edmonton and he warned them he warned them very very sternly and this is right in the height of the healing Revival it's 1957 and he and and and I I I want to say this as we as I make these comments I don't care where you live I don't care what culture you are I don't care what race you may be black you may be white you may be Hispanic you may be you may be Chinese it doesn't matter what race you are of course you're all God's children but it doesn't matter what you you might be Jews amen and the holy ghost that made Jews shout and dance and speak in tongues and glorify God on the day of pente because if it gets on a German it will make him do the same thing it has nothing to do with your [Applause] nationality brother Bram and God projecting his love spoke to the Canadians there in Edmonton he said and and I I'm not trying to reflect this on the churches in Edmonton God bless them all this has nothing to do with them they wouldn't even in existence back then this is this is speaking to what I what I'm pretty sure was a Pentecostal group he said surely I know what I'm talking about he wouldn't let me do those things and prove he's here and he was started singing the song there's a fountain filled with blood and was making an Altra call said you want to make you want to lose your guilty stains come on down now each one of what's the matter with you Canadians what's the the matter it's a good thing to be conservative but don't be too starchy you're going to grieve the holy spirit away from you and you won't have no Revival listen to me I speak in the name of the Lord break up that stubbornness among you that starching get to your knees you know you need repenting I speak in Jesus Christ's name yes sir if you want to have Revival warm your heart to God and then he goes on he says here you're too starchy you better get right with God because the hour is coming when you're going to scream to find this and you won't find it thus sayeth the Lord that's God speaking find your way to the altar you are different in different shame on you when the Holy Spirit come and do things he's doing right in the midst of you and you sit like you're froze to death get out of the seat and get to the altar repent or perish that's true don't know why I'm saying this something is saying to me to say it I'm giving you a warning this may be your last one too you repent I don't care what church you belong to if you're not repenting to the love of God not in your heart you're a sinner on your way to hell that's thus sayith the Lord and he goes on he said you've got to have a a breaking up before you can be remolded again you just went to church so long you got so mossback and stiff about it that's right you need a repentance you need an oldfashioned experience of God's love in your your heart and and you remind my voice will haunt you as long as you're Immortal that's true I speak it in Jesus Christ's name let me say something else another thing you got something against somebody you better be making it right right now it's setting off dark in this building think about that amen what a what a stiff warning so it doesn't matter it doesn't matter whether you're Canadian whether you're cold northerner whether you're you're a Mexican whether you're Hispanic whether you're German what what your your nationality has nothing to do with it break out of that stubborn spirit that says I ain't going to worship god oh you're not going to make me I'm not trying to make you do anything I'm giving you opportunity to Worship the Lord of Lord and the king of kings and to wash his feet and make him welcome break out out of your mold break out of where you've been break up the follow ground yes sir hallu you see you make up that atmosphere with what you are on inside of you so the atmosphere in this church is made up of what's inside the Believers amen and the atmosphere or the or should say the spirit of Leo will make your atmosphere dark if you have the Holy Ghost then its atmosphere will manifest I want you to understand there's something about atmosphere it is actually a supernatural thing amen and you can create an atmosphere because you are a super natural being if you have been born again and even if you're not a supernatural being you well everybody is you're either God or the devil there's only two spirits in the world you're either ruled by the holy ghost or the devil's got the hold of your life come on Amen it's the devil that makes you do things that are contrary to the word and live an Unholy life amen so you see whatever your atmosphere is or what's on the inside of you is going to produce an atmosphere and if we're people with the Holy Ghost it ought to produce an atmosphere of the holy ghost moving it ought to produce an atmosphere that people love to come amen they love to come like they love to come to Youth Camp I know there's Deliverance for me I know the power of God is there I know I know I can be healed I know I can be saved I know I can have Deliverance for my husband for my child for my need amen you talking about an action church we ought to be Jesus Christ an action on the earth Jesus began to teach and do it's not just teaching it's also doing so atmosphere is a supernatural things and when the presence of the Lord comes down it creates an atmosphere for Faith that's why we don't want to have a meeting that the atmosphere isn't charged with the Holy Ghost oh yeah sometimes it's sobering sometimes it's solemn sometimes it's soul searching sometimes you sit quiet sometimes you sit there on the edge of your seat and you're intense and you're listening and you're hardly responding but but you are responding amen and in other times it's Joy amen Joy bells are flowing and we're rejoicing and shouting you see it ain't all running the aisles or jumping the benches that ain't what it's all about amen it's but it's getting in the atmosphere where the presence of the Lord comes down amen and creates an atmosphere for for Faith now actually you're own faith will produce an atmosphere you see you get to believe in God and things are going to happen you go to expecting you you you know people people come here for our special meetings and and they they will come you know expec and hear the speaker and expecting the Lord to speak to them and I know that the Lord's going to do certain things and mighty things and wonderful things and they come with that expectation and that faith and that expectation produces an atmosphere and that atmosphere produces results but we don't have to have special meetings every service at evening light Tabernacle is a special service I have preached in in countries around the world I have traveled into dark Africa I've I've been down in the South Africa I've been I've been in in Asia and priests in China in the underground churches I've been I've been down in New Zealand and the Fiji islands and all over Europe as far as from Serbia all the way up in into Norway all over Canada then United States everywhere I go I'm a special preacher I'm a special speaker when I come here in evening Life Tabernacle I'm a special preacher I'm a special Minister amen with a special anointing amen with Hallelujah with a expecting a special God that makes us special and I'm preaching to a special class of people of believers who create a special atmosphere Hallelujah who knows all things are possible to them that believe that nothing's impossible Hallelujah that we can know and we can know that he's the I am God that the I was was I will be but the I am H your faith will create an atmosphere but you can't just come and say I just a HomeTown preacher today just a HomeTown brother just brother Aaron just brother Joe brother Timothy these guys are go out they're special speakers they're conviction preachers we have convictions every time we come and service like this you ought to expect God to move amen don't don't just sit down well we're just going to go to church we're not going to church amen we're going to the house of God and we're going to see Heaven come down Hallelujah we don't see God Walk Among the pews and the angels to encamp and the angels of the Lord to be seen among [Applause] us if we can get you an atmosphere believing you can receive the holy ghost we can get you an atmosphere of believing you can be healed from your sickness I don't care what it is name the sickness name any problem At The Mention Of His Name They bow they fall I've seen him fall amen don't only happen at Youth Camp it's happened at church it's happened in my office is happened in in in meetings abroad even as a word went forth demons cast out people right there in the pews Wither on the floor as the spirit of God cast out the Devils as the word went forth let me tell you friends that's what we believe we are a Mark 16 church we are a John 1412 church we are a Hebrew 13 and8 chch church we are [Applause] Christians we're identified hallu and his brother Ram said let this little handful of people sitting here get in a perfect atmosphere there will not be one feeble one in our midst the cripples will walk the blind will see the deaf will hear the dumb will speak without prayer or anything is the atmosphere said that's what happened when 25,000 were healed in one prayer in South Africa when they seen the Lord do something it create an atmosphere and they stepped into it catch the key they stepped into it if I can get you to step into it oh Hallelujah step into the water amen the angel of the Lord is here amen the water is troubled step into the water in the church there must be an atmosphere for the Holy Ghost and atmosphere for healing an atmosphere of the love of God an atmosphere of Peace of Joy it must not only be in our homes it must be in our homes but not only there but in our church if it's not there then you have a job to do because you are a creator that's right now I'm just going to tell you people walk in an empty building oh I feel God here oh that's such a holy place I feel God here well I tell you what when I feel God here is when God's people gather here when I come in here I feel an empty building I see empty pews that don't praise God I I see m music instruments that don't worship come on I see a Pulpit that there's no speaker in no preaching in come on but I tell you when you let the Church of the Living God the people of God Gather in the house of God it was no atmosphere till they got here but they began to create an atmosphere hallelujah amen they forget to pray begin to expect they came with expectation they came with a hope they came with a PR and they begin to exercise that and then they begin to pray then sing and then worship they're not just making pretty music they're inviting the [Applause] presence and the Holy Ghost comes down and when the Holy Ghost come down there's atmosphere and like I said if it ain't here you [Applause] created each one of you people that are born again is a Creator we must create an atmosphere so full and complete obedience put you in the word one yeah you believe it every bit it's all in you and you watch it working through you and when you let the word and you become one then it lives itself out and then you become a walk in Epistle of Jesus Christ when he's got complete control of you to make every word I'm going to make a few more points but I'm not going to promise to close so brother bradam would make an assessment of things after being on the field for some time at this point was from 1946 or 7 to where it was 1953 and he preaches a series calls Israel in the church by now he's got a pretty good thumb on the movement where an angel of God had appeared to him stepping out of a light a pillar of fire you know there's a pillar of fire in Israel it led the children of Israel that is that is the Holy Ghost and he veils himself behind a light God is light Paul would see him on the road to Damascus and he and he would know that that would be God because it was a bright light and it blinded him and he said who art thou Lord now he would have never called that Lord being a Jew unless he recognized this was the light of the Old Testament so he said who art thy Lord and he says I am Jesus that's right so if you want to know who the Lord is the god of the Old Testament he's Jesus I am Jesus so you see again the pillar of fire would would would appear here to this man and what he what he did coming out of that light stepped a man an angel of God and it would tell him of his misunderstood low ways and misunderstood life and that he was sent to bring a gift of healing to to the to the world and he was to pray for the sick well so this now would be after many many meetings and seeing God move in tremendous ways this would be after the South African meetings where there would be thousands saved and healed at the same time truckloads of crutches and Wheelchairs and everything else blind eyes seeing deaf hearing tremendous things like I said we believe in extreme gospel we believe that Bible days are here again now so but he would say now he talk about the church in the in the different spheres spheres that it's in he said now here's one sphere and here's another sphere and here's another one and down here is the nominal church now in here and up here is subblime here's where we supposed to be next right next door to heaven where the powers of God are leaking down and it drops on down and drops on down through this one to that one till this one and this is a nominal Church it goes on just on cold professions little ritualistic Affair that's the nomal church they just get the very slight drippings next Church up here is Full Gospel get some of the blessings but they go off in isms if we got to if we got to lift up into this next sphere here before we can ever go into a Rapture you got to get up in that before we can ever have it that's true so in other words he he said we're going to have to take a step higher remember we're Enochs we're the seventh from the second Adam seventh Church age all the way to Le oosa and we are the anex and we're walking with God so we're taking steps now and then to doing so he said we're going to have to step up another round so we're going to have to get off of where we're just getting nominal blessings which is a lot where a lot of message churches find theirselves in others you know where slight dressings but we want to get into where the full blessings of God I'm not satisfied with just being in the lower reals are you with me I I don't want a church that's that way I want a church that has so much Faith it's rapturing Faith so much grace it's rapturing Grace come on I want to I want us to live in the heavenlies brother John leay and I were driving along the other day we were going to to streetport to get some supplies for my house he he helped me quite a bit there getting things ready to make my move and he told me as we were going and we were actually talking about the services Sunday and lamb for the household or and and then I may have been brother Donnie Reagan's what a great sermon that was but anyway he he said you know brother Tim he said I just want to get where I just live in the heavenlies and he told me about the pressures in China where he was always under the threat of persecu ution and arrest you may not know this man but he's a hero in my eyes he would leave just knowing that there was millions that had never heard the name of Christ and nobody was taking anything to him and he started smuggling Bibles into the country and God was with him in a supernatural away you don't know this but even like Tabernacle supported him we sent sermons to him you know right to CH China address tapes sermons from our library here for him to you know to feed on to catch the atmosphere to to keep you know to to to encourage him they were a Lifeline wasn't they brother John and so as we you know he he saw phenomenal Miracles that took place you know where God would blind the eyes of the officials and let the entire shipments come in books and and sermons and witness material and all of that going in and you know and but he was always Under Pressure but that pressure made him live in the heavenlies he had to be sensitive to the Holy Ghost he had to be sensitive to its leaders ship I'm going somewhere because I want to tell you you are also Under Pressure that's right and it ain't the Chinese government where people rot in jail for years and years and years and years and even the US government will forget them but we're under pressure look what happened to Israel here the other day with their Invasion that same evil spirits are coming in against us in a ecclesiastical manner in a spiritual manner pressure upon the bride you you know people have said well we we want the squeeze you know we can't do nothing till the squeeze come well hello you are here amen it's not coming in the physical manner that like it does to the Jews it comes in an ecclesiastical manner because what they receive naturally we receive spiritually so you understand there is a difference between us but one is reflecting the other and watch Israel what's happening in Israel is the same attack against your family yourself your church your pastor you're under threat and instead of being withdrawn hiding depressed worried fearful oh attack my wife brother him did not I show you how to act when your wife was attacked how many times did I come out here preaching discouragement how many times did I come out with my head bowed low how how many times did I create an atmosphere of depression on this church it didn't happen why I knew we was the winner I knew we can't lose amen I knew that whatever we go through that God is on our side and we're coming out Victorious Hallelujah I did not start out to be a loser I started this race to be a winner and when I [Applause] will living in the heavenlies hearing from Heaven Guided by Heaven expecting Miracles he'd walk right through the government lines packing message material without them even seeing him that's listen God wants more than ritualistic Farms he wants more than just a denominational church members Pew armers he wants men and women on fire for God this bride will by no means be a lot of sin she will not be lukewarm she will be on fire for God Amen that's the Declaration so the token must display its power in the church that's where it must be displayed we know of the warning of the Holy Spirit what it would be in the end time and the leoan age but I also want to re remind you that there are Overcomers in Leo deia yes there is the lukewarm the Christ rejectors yes there is those who who are naked and blind and wretched and don't know it yes that is also Leia but there is another people in Le oia who are Overcomers they wear the robe of white amen they have the gold they are not poor and riched come on somebody they will sit with him on his throne they are Overcomers amen no matter what you see in Leo deia know this there is also another group of people right here in Leo deia one is called The Church the other is called the bride let me be a part of the Bride amen and she is not going down she's going up amen I want you to hear the message loud and clear in the vision you have been seen walking with the word stepping to the music and instead of going down going up you are not falling little church you are rising you're not going to drown hey man you're going to swim the atmosphere you see that's what brother Brandon would say what we need is a holy ghost atmosphere where the power of God's moving with one Accord and he said you sit there and you know you come down you just say well I don't know about it well you hurt the other person because you're creating an atmosphere and guess what if I get to preach long enough and hit the vein hard enough I'm going to cast you Devils out and I'm not talking about people I'm talking about the demons that would want to hold back the movement of the Holy Ghost amen you you see you can hurt the other person you can hurt the other person right next to you but do you realize if you get in the right atmosphere and you begin to worship God and you begin to respond and you quit sitting there with your arms folded but you start entering into the service of God don't you know it will affect those that are around you Hallelujah I tell you what there's some of you that have been so dead and dry for so long if the Holy Ghost would get a hold of you and move on your life we would everyone shout about it hallelujah amen it would create such an atmosphere because we said dead people come to life we saw those who were dead live again expectancy will get Unity among the people that's what happened on the day of Pentecost brother brandham told us they were there they had received the Holy Ghost and seed form like getting an acre it's you know it's not an oak tree but you have the potential Jesus had breathed on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost had not yet come because Jesus had not yet ascended and had not sent it back I'll send you another comforter I've comforted you walking with you as human but I'm not going to comfort you that way anymore I'm going to send you another comforter I will come to you how did he come on the day of Pentecost in the form of the Holy Ghost not another deity the same God the same Jesus amen so uh brother Tim is the Holy Ghost and Jesus the Same well the Holy Ghost just the spirit of Jesus Jesus had breathed on them and they had it in potential and every one of you have the Holy Ghost potentially those without it have the Holy Ghost potentially you have the promise that's the potential amen and what they did when they got in the upper room once they got Pastor politics you know they had to get past voted in another apostle that never am mounted to a hill of beans cuz God had his own man he's going to put there man can't put them there well we're going to we're going to select this one and he'll take the place of Judas and this and that once they got Pastor politics they got together and now boys what we're really here for let's get down to real business we're here because he promised the power would come from on high and he breathed on us and said receive the Holy Ghost and told us to T in Jerusalem till we got it and so now that's why we're really here you know if we get all this we got all this Apostolic succession behind politics in the church and our church politics and all this and who's going to be Bishop here and who's going to do this that we got to pass all of that but now let's focus on the real thing oh if the bride of Christ would get past all the politics of big I and little you and I'm the leader and I'm the one's got the truth and I'm the one that's leading the bride we can impal all of the politics amen and even in even in light Tabernacle we just forget the politics of it well they let this and preach and he's not my favorite and they do this and I you know I don't like that song and then they sing that and I don't I like this song leader better than that one and you know this and and that one drives me crazy and if they sing that one song one more time I'll quit well go ahead and quit amen don't quit church quit your [Music] nonsense amen get your poic behind you and get focused what are we really here for what are we really here for are we here for the songs no he's here for the song are we here are we here for the musician no he's here for that amen what are we here for we're here to create an atmosphere where he will come down amen because we want the Holy Ghost we want him in this meeting we want him in the camp we want him in our lives we want the Death Angel to Passover when other churches are dying we want our church to live because the bleeding word has life in it and so they kept blessing god brother brandham told us what they were doing he said they kept blessing God until the atmosphere got just right and there came a sound from Heaven hallelujah amen if we'll start blessing God in evening Tabernacle if we'll come to church and bless God until it causes a sound to come and join amen a uniting of sounds the sound of the Believers here worshiping God and blessing God and thanking him for the Holy Ghost and thanking him for healing and thanking him for miracles and thank you Lord I know you're going to do Mighty things and thank

filled with the spirit let's stand together as we worship God together kept blessing God until there came a sound from Heaven oh couldn't we get in the atmosphere that every crippled every blind every sick person everything with one Accord believing to the sick he said I I saw it in meetings over at Wood River Illinois he would talk about other places there wasn't a person left a pile of cutes a wheel chairs the cops are standing at the platform preaching like this and they just begin to raise up and throw them to the corner the atmosphere got right don't we want the atmosphere right go to
