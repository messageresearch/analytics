words to us so we thank you now father we bless your name amen you can take your Bibles and be turning revelations five if you give me just a little bit more volume brother Joseph on these closed monitors right here next to me please it's me you know I've been out for the last two weeks been fortunate to be able to travel with my family and don't get to do that very often when we go out and minister because the school but worked out to where we could travel we were a brother Josh golf's a couple weekends ago and had a tremendous service there with the believers in the last week but this past Sunday we were a brother of Bryce Collins and Claremore Oklahoma we just had a tremendous outpouring other spirit but it's nice to be home it's nice to be back with you all and trusted you come tonight with a desire to hear from the Word of God and I believe that God has something special for sister Abigail that's nice to have you home with us welcome back were you here Sunday well then y'all give her a hand clap of praise she's back they didn't keep her so we're gonna have to have her back so tonight we just want to take our time I want to look to the Word of God and trust that something will be said you know as Minister you don't want to speak anything of your own accord you want to speak with the Lord lays upon your heart so tonight by the will of God we will do that with her we're gonna look here in the entire chapter of revelations 5 so verse 1 and I saw in the right hand to him that sat upon the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book in the loose the seals thereof and no man in heaven nor in earth neither under the earth was able to open the book neither to look thereon and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look thereon and one of the elders said unto me weep not behold the Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to loose the seals thereof and behold I am beheld and I beheld excuse me and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth and he came and he took the book out of the right hand to him that sat upon the throne when he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elders fell down before the lamb having every one of them harps of golden vials full of the odors which are the prayer of the saints and they sung a new song saying about worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for that was slain and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God kings and priests and we shall reign on the earth and I beheld and I heard a voice of many angels round about the throne and the beasts and the elders and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousands and thousands of thousands saying with a loud voice worthy is a lamb that was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessings and every creature in heaven and on the earth and under the earth such as in the sea and all that are in them heard us saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever and the four beasts said amen and the four and twenty elders fell down and worshiped him that liveth for ever and ever you can be seated this evening Haman you're glad to be in the house of God this evening we were very fortunate last weekend I got to take my mother-in-law on the trip of a lifetime to Oklahoma and we got there she was she was excited she was gonna be able to go and see the people and visit to church for the very first time and Joseph got sick so she stayed home and babysitting while she stayed at the place we were staying and watched Joseph on we had church so I want to thank you sister Rachel I know you was really had your heart on that but appreciate you and appreciate your testimony if I can get a little bit more volume on these two monitors right here that'll be great but I want to speak to you tonight on it's let revival come now that that word can be taboo in the message that revival come because we think it may sound like as we're waiting on revival to get here when we know that we that the honors in her revival she's received so just by the grace of God tonight give me a little bit of time to explain the thought that I have the adult that the Lord gave me but the word revival comes from the root word revive okay and that word revive means to restore to life to regain life to give new strength or energy to and therefore the word revival actually means the act or the instance of reviving so is the act or the instance of giving life all right have you with me this evening then let's go get together in one heart one Accord now notice here in the word revived the definition has a key word that I want to speak about just for a minute it's a word restore restore to life in the word restore me to put back or to put art to bring back into a former or an original state so we find that revive means to restore back revival is the act of reviving which means restoring back to life therefore we can say that revival tonight is the act of restoring back to the original life not the life that you had when you were born but the life that you had in the very mind of God before you ever committed a sin before you ever committed that first act before you knew anything about sin and unbelief and doubts and all the pressures of life we find the word today means the act of restoring back to the original life that God intended for you to have and so I say let revival come come on Church let revival come let life come tonight let the word come tonight let it come and do more than just tantalize our flesh or excite our emotions but let it change us let it empowers let it charge us tonight let revival come let the life for this message come tonight and excite the body of Christ and we know that there's only one life and that life is a life of Christ so what we're saying is let the original life of Christ be restored to his brow let the original life of Christ his original desire his original thought of you let it be restored to you in your fallen condition you don't have to remain in that condition when God has sent us to work to restore us or revive us back to his original thought so you may say well brother Joe your scripture reading that was kind of off base right revelations 5 let me just go into that John notice now John there was a crime but going out who is worthy to take the book in the loose just seal serve and no man was found worthy so otherwise John in the entire human race they were they were hanging over the balusters who would say that they didn't know if they were in the plan of redemption they didn't know if that wasn't in the plan of redemption okay kill you with me now so we find here there there was a doubt there was an unknown but God provided a land that was worthy to take to boot notice no man was found worthy no prophet was found worthy no priest was found worthy Martin wasn't worthy Luther wasn't worthy Paul wasn't worthy Moses wasn't worthy Enoch wasn't worthy all the great men throughout the ages none of them was worthy William Brandon wasn't worthy but God found a worthy one that could take the book and to loose the seals are us God provided us a lamb God provided us a sacrifice he provided us a substitute and there was only one and the God provided the lamb when we read that the the lamb was worthy and the lamb came out from around the throne and the lamb took the book out of him that said upon the throne and the lamb took the book in revelation 6 we find that the book began to be torn the seals begin to be torn off the book and by by this what do we find that the lamb was in fact restore and fallen man back to eternal life so we can say that the opening of the seventh seal book is what brought revival to the bride so when the lamp took the book and he opened the seals notice now if we go back in Revelations five when he took the book and open the seals there was a revival breakout in heaven well you say brother I don't like me I don't like excitement are you gonna hate heaven you're not gonna be at peace in heaven we're brothers don't not everybody has to have like you you're exactly right you don't have to act like me I don't want you to act like me I want you to act like God want you to hang when you come under the revival message and realize you're not dead in sins you're not dead in trespasses you're not who you used to be but you're who God's called you to be thank God has sent you a message to revive you to give you life again though I'll notice how says and I heard the voice of many angels round about the throne notice the number of them ten thousand times in thousands thousands thousands saying with the very soft and meek voice we just want to come to church brother Joe you don't have to do all that screaming we can just praise God like this no they were screaming they were shouting they were crying with the loud voice worthy is the lamb what about an evening like Tabernacle is he still worthy tonight is he your worthy lamb look what he has done for you tonight where he's brought you from he's worthy to be praised and notice John how dignified and every creature which is in heaven heard I John and that was on the earth and none of the earth that are they gonna see they didn't hear me say nothing at all no John said everything in heaven heard him everything on earth heard him everything in the sea heard John John realized he wasn't worthy John realized that his his eternal destination Hagen if he was found in the book and when there was no man found worthy God provided the worthy one and when he took that book in he opened the seal John had a reason to shout let me tell you chuck we are both people on the book tonight that's not a cliche we have been darnay's found in the pages of the book we have eternal life we have been revived by the revival masses of this hour a revival broke out in heaven and I think if a revival can break out in heaven why can't it break out here tonight I need some more volume well my revival is going to stop real quick but we noticed when people pray for revival many times what we're expecting is a great Sunday morning service or a great wizzy night service but revival is more than a Sunday morning in a windy night experience revival is that you're asking God to restore me back to what I was in the beginning God restore me past my fears God restore me past the sicknesses that ravished my body let me look beyond my mom battles I try to condemn me let me go beyond my scene in my unbelief and try to destroy me let me go past all the failures of my mistakes and the things I've done in my past he filled me with an inexhaustible insatiable desire for the word God restore me Lord revive me tonight God more than a we see night more than a Sunday morning let it be a life o fire for God and brother madam would say it like this in the message the third seal he says now revelations he had said in the hour and the time but the last angel the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery of God is finished the restoration back to the word notice where we're being restored - back to the word the original word this is not a denominational word but it's the original word he said the Bible said that this measure of the last days will restore them back to the original faith back to the faith of the fathers but you think they receive it speaking of the church now no sir the last days he would restore the original word again as he said in Malachi 4 that she had forfeited notice the church had forfeited that word but not the bride he says now she was dead in her traditions and dogmas that he missed it notice she was dead in her traditions and her dogmas that she missed the movement of God he came took on flesh manifested himself opened the blinded eyes and raised up to that and yet they missed the very coming of the word made flesh and many have missed his coming in this hour he said now he says they miss him the living were manifested in the flesh by the word that is promised jesus said that the manifested word he said now he said to the bride or the Hebrew bride he says because you hold to your traditions to you make the Word of God without any effect to you it can't be effective you got to cut it down just a little bit whoo are y'all is it hot out there not this kind of hot these are hot I'm scared to touch them and we just said we're gonna get it down just a little bit more y'all got me on fire up here but notice now he says because you hold to your traditions you make the Word of God of none effect to you he can't be effective so their whole notes are their own ideas but they hold on to some man's idea or some doctrine some some Pentecostal doctor of some Baptist doctor or some church doctrine and when it does it limits the Word of God he limits the effective power of the Holy Spirit on that person in that life in that church in the Spirit of God came move and they can't have a revival because why because a hold no true traditions come down please he says now we've had denominational revivals you ask them to cut you up they shoot you to the top they ask you to cut you down they take their slow time getting there that's okay hey I wouldn't try to do this without sound man and to be horrible we're thankful for our brothers up there god bless you now that's good hey man he says we've had the nomination revivals he goes but we haven't had a real stirring no no no he says now don't think we've got revivals we have it oh they got millions and millions and millions of church members but not a revived no where no no he goes the bride hasn't had a revival yet now I'm not cherry-picking this and saying that the bride ain't had a revival because he preached it's the third seal in 1963 he still had four of the seals to go and we know about the Scriptures that the word has been restored to the bride but he says here now the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride he says we're looking for it but in a take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again look in the church of evening like Tabernacle say Amen to the Word of God it's gonna take those seven unknown thunders to wake her up again and let me tell you we're not reading in a closed book we're not feasting on that close but but every seals been removed and we're feeding on an open book with an open maze that gives life to the body if you'll just take it and read it they consume it and desire the same effect of the word oh [Applause] yes it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up and he will send it oh the devil says oh he ain't doing nothing this time he will send it he promised it now watch he says now she was dead speaking of the church so we find her the Lamb took the book beginning to rip the seals off and brother BAM said when he ripped his seals off the book he handed it down to his messenger who dispersed it to his people so he not only took the book but he had the authority and the power to open the contents and let you see that you were part of the original plan of God oh my you know we drag in the church I'm guilty you're guilty we drag in we've had a bad day but all if you can just see what John saw I don't care how bad your day is being least you're not headed to a sinner's grave in a devil's hell but you've been called by the work you've been anointed you've been elected your name has been found in the book truck you're going up and you're not going down dr. revival beginning the strike and let the wire talk I don't care how bad your day is being now word has been given it has been this sparks to our body now it's time for that body to take that word in and say let revival come let life come let healing come let deliverance call that salvation come let it come to the body tonight and let it change us revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he has declared to his servants the prophets now we believe God has sent us that messenger and there's no longer any mysteries now they want to make it a mystery saying you get them going past the label to see an age and then now we got to have another messenger no we're no longer people that's groping in darkness go from would creed to another creed one church to another church one denomination to another denomination those seven thunders has already thundered out the revelation of the seals and those seven thunders has already awakened the bride did you hear what I said bride those seven thunders don't opening of those seven seals has already stirred her he's already awakened her has already revived her given her life and that's why we can have a prize for a Bible the act of restoring to the original life not some life with the denomination not Surratt life with some idea of a man but we're being restored on a daily basis by the opening of the word back to the original thought that God had for us and he says now the churches if the churches would forget their Creed and the dogmas and just take the Bible and plead the promise then it would come effective to them he's speaking about the church the spiritual brought her today so called the church she takes the Word of God but she won't accept it she accepts dogmas instead therefore the word is not effective to her see because she tries to inject her creed or or with the word and it won't work so you can't inject your own ideas to the word and expect it to work tonight we find here in the third seal brother Matt makes this statement he says now in The Herald of us coming we remember we know what that is as to the book or the magazine that brother system were put out he said here they are they lived across the headlines is we need a prophet to return we need a prophet to return he goes and I guess when he does return they won't know nothing about it just like I said he goes we need a prophet to return who were bringing the word of the Lord and be fearless those are crying out for a prophet they're crying out for the word to be restored and yet he was there he ate with them he drank with him he went on trips with him he was his campaign manager and yet when he was there he opened a blinded eyes and he raised up the dead and all these things and yet they missed the very manifestation of the word for their day but let me tell you a little bride your eyes have been open and your ears have heard what prophesy sages it meaning it long to hear and long to see what because you've been anointed to have a prize my Bible on awakening in your soul then will you can't miss this coming because you're part of the coming Oh hallelujah hey goes here oh you can hardly probably print anything unless it's fast and pray and fast and pray sound of trumpet he goes get it how many reads you know you see it all the time fast pray fast pray that's all you hear fast pray we're gonna have a great breaking of the day that's a great thing there's a great thing that's gonna happen all of you pray now pray we're not too late yet Rob Rob says why do they do that why do they do that he goes they want an awakening notice what the church wants they want an awakening this is the Pentecost they want an awake and they're crying believing that they will be awakened they're good people but why is it what are they done they have not recognized the awakening of a bride they have not recognized the awakening of the bride oh they were fine with the signs and the wonders long as he was opening up the eyes and and giving her hearing to the death and raising up to dead they were fine with the signs and the manifestation but when the word broke loose and he began to reveal the secrets of God he began to reveal the opening of the seals and the very mind of God they fail to recognize who he was because they were whole note - Pentecostal traditions they were holding on to some dance or some jump or some emotion but let me tell you God ain't only in dance and shouting in amongst he's in his word and his word is life and he sent us life in this house to have a word board my Bible he goes there being Christians they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something supposed to happen but they're looking way off in the future for it to come when it's already happened right by you so we find in the third seal they were waiting brother BAM says there's been no stirring to awaken the bride but now he comes here and recognizing your day in 64 and he says now they have not recognized the awaiting he says when those seals were open the book became a new book the Bible became a new book because he received a life of the word and it'll become a new book to you why are you here tonight because something is stirring at your heart oh we're not here just for denominational ideas and to say we we've going to church and for filling our religious duties no we're here because something is speaking to us something that's pulling us something is drawing a service after service and they're crying God sent us a prophet God said it's a prophet and God sent him not only a prophet but he's sent in the message the seventh angel to their day to the to the word for their day and yet they missed him he performed the same signs the same ones he was making the Word of God live again and the people rejected him and pushed him off as an outcast but what about the bride Oh hallelujah the more she saw the more she believed and the more she believed the more she woke up and when she woke up chief again to have a revival because why she realized I don't have to be dead I don't understand seeing I don't have to be bound by sickness and disease I've been born again he has sent me a word let's give a mean life and I stopped that word tonight I accept the life of the word tonight but the church the church holds to her traditions not allowing the Living Word to quicken her and revive her and I wonder if many around this message haven't made that fatal mistake hold on to what used to be this is how we used to do it and are not progressing with the word for the rm6 and the world's falling apart again he says now the churches crowd the loudest so what are you hollering about a messiah what do you holland revival in our time back in this and then and the other what are you looking for it to do it what more do you want what does the church won't anyhow we've already got it when I say let revival come I'm not saying let there be another message come that's gonna open the seal I'm saying let the life the message that's been given let it come to my home let it come to my heart let it come to my turn and it changed me tonight that revival come let the life of this message come inside of me tonight it changed me where I'm not just a young person but I'm a son of God I'm a daughter of God Oh fire for God and when I go to my school they'll see something different when I go to my job I'll see something different where are they hollering revival in our town back in this and that and the other what are they what are they looking forward to do it what more do you want what does the church won't anyhow we've already got it God David to us it's his promise for the hour it's his promise for the hour we look in the Bible we see it everywhere through the Bible anointed ones come he says the only ones come on and made the word live again right in the hour for that hour let me just explain to you tonight what we saw after youth camp unknown aid ones making the word live God had called ministry God had anointed ministry to do what to lay hands on the sick and they shall recover but not only that to cast out demons and we've seen seven manifestations of demonic encounters and yet we've been anointed Church I should let you know that the power of God the spirit of God is with this church because we've seen those manifestations come against this church come against our youth camp and come against some of our people and every time they came against it there was an anointing there because God had anointed man to stand against it and make the word live again and I mean I tell you we're here to make this word live not to put it on a shelf not to put it on our belt buckle but I'll make the work talked a lot and they people be changed by the fire of God [Applause] it's more than a cliche it's more than your favorite quote it's making this word manifest and you can't do it but the revival he sins is doing it through you notice now in the beginning was the word the Word was with God in the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and the word is made flesh tonight Oh God gave us to Messiah he promised his promised word for this day it's just waiting notice now it's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again did y'all hear that let me just go ahead and read that one again if you got a pen and paper you may want to take this down God gave us the Messiah his promised word for this day it's just waiting for somebody with faith to anoint it and make it live again yes sir it's a real Messiah it's the Word of God and I trust I'm looking at men and women tonight that I take this word and make it live again Satan tries to come with doubt and unbelief somebody's gonna know what this word and say I don't have to be bound I don't have to be like that because while I've been given a word that's going to revive me but notice now the church system they don't want God's Word because they're holding on to their traditions say she kept the Word of God and because she held on to her tradition she keeps the Word of God from having an impact or an ill effect in her life in the same night he says what's a spiritual leave she don't want it she wants to keep her traditions and get away from the Word of God and let me say it like this Sonny if you want to hang on to your traditions and you want to hang on to yesteryear then you can't have a word revival as long as you're hanging on to some man-made idea some Creed from some denomination some idea from yesterday you'll never have a real born-again revival because why cuz a revival is for those that are quit looking back and you're looking at where God is and where God's going so we'll never experience a word revival long as we're holding own ideas and creeds and dogmas and you go to some churches brother and you'll get there as more than you go out they sing one or two songs take up the offer and invite to preacher you're limited to 45 minutes you get done they sing one song and they dismiss there's no altar call there's no moving other spirit because while they put God in their tool tradition box and they don't let the power of God loose among the people because a prophet of God said it's 45 minutes Herman is ideal but what if God wanted to go 46 minutes what if he wanted to go two hours what if he wanted to go three hours and you find many times after the service is the sermon is preached and you just linger in the Spirit of God he's meaning you get up and walk out but God is still hanging by and he's still dealing with hearts and life and many come up for prayer even after everybody begins to dismiss to our tutorial because waffle cuz God is not contained to your tradition God is not contained to your idea that the service is this that and the other and when it's all done and we done all that then it's over no God is over when he wants to be over and he's done moving when he wants to be done moving so take God out of your tradition box how did your creed box out of your yeah your yester your ideal box and let God loose tonight and even like to have enough that you can have a revival tonight that the Spirit of God can be free to move in our miss my brother Joe I felt God move once or twice I'm not talking to my feeling God move once or twice I'm talking about every time you walk through these doors you can expect a move another spirit whether it be your favorite preacher not your favorite preacher whether it be a Wednesday night or Sunday or a Friday or whatever day we have service it doesn't matter whether you come through those doors and you're draggin because many times we come dragon but yet the Spirit of God as dad the Bible says David encouraged himself in the word or in the Lord and that's what the revival does is encouraging that that's not who you are but we find now the promise of the word in the last days is brought to her but she will not receive it because she's holding on traditions and you find people around this message oh my they got belt buckles I start claim to fame they got a big belt buckle their messes believer well they got pictures plastered all over the wall let me take God ain't in your belt buckle and God ain't in your pictures God is in his word and he don't want your belt buckle he don't want you pictures on the wall he wants to word in your heart that's what God is looking for before we find me and today if you don't get my message you're going to hell you should committing spiritual adultery what kind of idea is that some today now trying to hold you and force you to put brother band I'm back in the pulpit they gonna dig him out of the grave and put him back up in the pulpit no they don't take a mechanical device and push play hold onto some tradition well I got a tradition was caught a fivefold ministry for the edifying or the perfecting of the saints how about let's stick with God's tradition of ministry you wanna hang on tradition let's stay with God's tradition of anointed man prophets preachers teachers evangelists missionaries let's stay with that tradition and let's see what God can do with that tradition I said well you gotta push play because God can't keep the fivefold ministry in line they messed it up you telling me God needs man's help to put this word and to get this bride ready for awhile I say absolutely not God has seen us exactly what we need for a word born revival he sent us anointed man he says anointed teachers and anointed preachers and anointed passes in a game of us a prophet for this last we got all that we need to have a word born revival church don't let man trying to tie you up with her idea shake yourselves from all those kind of beliefs let's have a revival life flowing back into the church I look across this church and I see the revival of embers are burning we see cancer being defeated we see a latisha being defeated we see all kind of things being defeated a little boy and not able to walk who jump up and walk see Devils are being defeated because there's a word born revival that's happening and evening lights having a let me tell you ain't just for the hand few or the hand pick it's for everybody here tonight if you'll just say let my Bible come I want my own revival when I face my my encounter with the enemy I want to have a revival on the inside something that'll raise up and say say you can't have me you can't have my joy you can't have my body you can't have my mind it ain't happening I'm a child of God I'm open son of God alright daughter of God tonight I'll open o to you but how can you act like that if you've never been revived if you never had life come on in C Church we're not looking for another messenger we're not looking for another message we have everything we need for a body change all God is looking for is to somebody to anoint the word and make it live for the help somebody take this word and say come revive on life power God come in me and live manifest the same size the same wonders the same power God Oh church that's what we're looking for in this hour notice now what separates seed from non seed program said the word does the separation Bob says they'll be so close that it was to see the very elect if possible but the word is what's ever he goes the anointed was only the word will separate them not sighs oh no they'll do the same signs but the word is what separates him that's why it's got to be a word revival and when the seals were torn off the book it was a word revival it wasn't a man-made revival he wasn't a Wesleyan revival it wasn't a Welsh revival he wasn't a healing revival he wasn't a Pentecostal revival in Wisconsin during the revival for this in Thomas for the bride to come forth and be awakened and revived by the power of God so she can take her place in her position as the Bride of Christ there was a word that was sent to awaken her up and I believe God has sinneth and I believe we're manifests manifesting that right now he says now watch this he says watch now when the spiritual bride when she begins to have a revival when she begins to come back and align herself up with the Word of God watch then again you see how that the scriptures at that time there'll be a message sweep out to catch that bride catch that woman the elect when she's ready to to line up and catch that word for her our they'll probably God said there'll be a message sweep out and in a catch her and she'll line with the word for her out that's why you're here tonight that's why you drive from Arkansas that's why you drive from all over that's why you can't go to some other church because God has sent a message God has sent a word in this hour and you're lining up with it in this hour he said there'll be a message sweep out - catch - Brian catch that woman the elect he says now then watch again to the spiritual church health that the group of people called out the Elector through every revival Martin Luther it happened same on wait through the Reformation it happened the same thing in Tommy John West it happened the same in a Pentecostal first started they dropped in women right back in line with the word and then they drifted away there she goes right back over in the chaos but then the time that the people are ready to line up there's a message comes forth and they line with it there's a message in God today has sent us a message through a vindicated prophet and I'm looking at a people that's lining with it if you're not going on your own idea you're not going on some man's idea but you're lining with the Word of God where it says that could be corrected you're corrected you line with it he says but you notice when people begin to try to line with the word there comes a fresh message from the Word of God right straight to the people and they catch that message and they line up every time that's why he sent Malachi forward to turn the hearts but the children are the fathers back to the children and the hearts of the children back to the fathers want because it's to catch the elect lady she gotta sent us a fresh message to revive you from your old dead denominational ideas you're dead man-made Crees and things of that nature and let me tell you church we're not a dead motionless church did you hear what I said we're not a dead motionless church no but we're a church that's on fire for God a church that's got life in it a church that sees science and wonders being performed in our midst it's not one here every two or three years but we see consistently the Word of God the removing the other spirit the stirring other spirit that revival fires blowing through evening light tabernacle and you find you hear many testimonies on the online come back at this service help this one and they felt the anointing on that one why because there is a revival that's going forth right out of this little church right here people's lives are being impacted because we're not holding on to some Pentecostal idea or some Pentecostal Creed no we're holding on to the dust saith the Lord see we're not part of a Reformation but we're part of a restoration to restore life rubber band makes a statement the word restore here means to return back to his former owner to bring back to the former estate off condition and he says and we can enforce a claim to be restored so you're here tonight and you're sick and body let me tell you the property God just said you can tonight force a claim on the devil to be restored if you've received this life that I'm talking about if you've experienced a revival that I'm speaking of tonight there should be no demon there should be no devil he'll stand before you because you have a right through the anointed scriptures to stand on this word and say Satan you can't have me you can't have my children you can't have my body you can't have me you have no part with me I'm a son of God I've been anointed for this hour and I forced acclaim tonight in the name of Jesus Christ you go back to Hell where you came from he says now Webster says restore means to bring it back to the former owner bring it back to a former state of condition if a claim is made on something to make that restoration you can enforce it and make it come back to its right place you can brother Mike you can you can tonight young person you can tonight forced to claim on your enemy depression you can force a claim on him tonight rebellion you can force a claim on him tonight diabetes you can force the claim on it tonight cataracts in your eyes behind you where you can't walk and see you can enforce to claim tonight God has given us a word for this hour to do battle with notice now what he says here in the message the fundamental foundation of our faith let me try to hurry to get through this he said Adam could speak to the winds and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to wildlife and it would obey him he could speak to the waters every what it was everything obeyed Adam that's what God gave him power over everything on earth but now through the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and his friendship and fellowship with the father then he lost that then he says what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that Paul did you hear what he just told you tonight what Adam was in God he came back and redeemed you and I back to them Adam had power to speak to the winds you Rimmer Dean back to speak to the storms in your life Adam had power to speak to the trees and they would obey him to speak to wildlife and they would obey Him and you have been redeemed Church of evening like time to come back and take Adams place and you can now speak to your story speak to your enemy speak to your mouth and you can watch that thing move because why because you're a restored son and daughter of God he said Adam never had to be sick nor do you he never had to be sick he never had to die he never had a worry he never had a heartache he never had a fear he just kind up in the arms of the father just like a child everything was his whatever he asked why he just gotten everything obeyed him because he was God's child and that's the child is heir of all things he said it when man felt he lost this and now what he lost in the fall Christ comes back as Redeemer did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us everlasting life he brought us back to an eternal fellowship in relationship with God to be sons and daughters of God to restore us back all that Adam lost in the fall he came back and restored you back to that church I [Music] don't think you got that everything that Adam was all the power all the authority that Adam possessed before the fall he came back in this hour through the revelation of this word and he broke down sealed and wanted in him he redeemed fallen me back to Adam's place as they saw and as they daughter of God and now you can speak now this is your time just speak to your enemy this is your time just speak to your trial this is your time to do the moving and the shaken because you have been redeemed back to the son the position of sonship notice when Adam fell the book went back into the hands of the original owner no man was worthy to take the book but we find a revelation is 10 here comes a lamb or a mighty angel come down with this book no longer closed it was open and what does he do he hands it down to John John and type of the bride so now this book that Adam had possession of before the fall now is being handed back to fallen man God restoring you right back Church to everything that Adam was all the power all the authority all the mine everything you've been restored back by this message do you believe that tonight so God didn't provide us their start trying to wrap us up God didn't provide us a restored word for us to sit back and be idle with it when the word came back in David's day the ark was being restored David just didn't go out there and sit up and watch how brother Joe we know what you're about to do we know the story of David and the art coming back no David just didn't wait he didn't come to church in this way I look at the ark I so nice oh we've been waiting on this brother in for a long time now art being restored to words finally being restored and nobody moves nobody shouts nobody does anything we're so glad that the Ark is coming home back in this rightful place know the ark was coming back the word was coming home the word was coming back to the people that it belonged to and what am I telling you tonight this word has come back to a people that it's belong to what did David do David didn't look out there and just say oh what a nice pretty no Dave but but God beside himself David begin to dance a little bit David begin to shout hallelujah David begin to have a good time but cuz the word what's being restored the word that had been lost from his old friend from generation to generation has now been restored to the to the Israel I'm in Italian Church this word this mention has now being restored back to the Bride of Christ through the opening of a seventh seal book we got a reason to shout we got a reason today we got a reason to have a revival I say we got a reason the word has top hole no word is changing us oh don't be ashamed to dance don't be ashamed to shout the word is come home you've been restored you've been restored you being my bad a constant state being restored to the original life Jove chapter 2 verse 25 I know you say it Brazil you're just charismatic not everybody's like you I don't want you to be like me to be better be a poor Church winner but just because you don't act like me and I don't have like you don't you stop the moving of the Spirit you yield to it God you move on me the way you want to move on me I can't be a brother Joe Adams I can't be a brother Aaron I can't be this brother of this sister but Lord however you want to move that revival car let life car let it charge me let me throw my hands up let me shout amen let me nod my hands you can't do number nod your head man I tell you what does have a head banging moment because my the word let me take the nominations don't have this word Pentecost don't have this word the Baptist don't have this word but you tonight oh you got this word I said you've got this word he unknown at you he's elected you ain't chose you this woman to have a revival the word has been restored some people of the book have come back to their place in the book Oh hallelujah Joel verse 2 chapter 2 verse 25 I will restore there's a promise maybe you're not where I'm at yet it's you got a promise I will restore to you all the years at the locust that depression has ate it you and Mom battles has come against you oh the locust is eaten that can't go worm maybe you battled cancer maybe you battle heart trouble maybe you battle diabetes whatever it is oh that the locust has eaten the cankerworm a caterpillar the paulmor my great army which I sent among you next verse and ye shall eat in plenty for five was coming I said revivals been promised and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied oh you don't have another reason to won't you don't have to go to some other Church looking forward a movement of the spirit you got it right here cuz they says you shall even plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord so don't tell me you can't praise them if you can't praise I mean ain't done nothing for ya hey somebody just open up tonight say God do something cuz I'm here to praise you I mean I worship you but I'm here to be restored tonight to all that the caterer the caterpillar the Palmer and the locust is eaten Lord let me fit that word tonight praise the name of the Lord your God that had dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed and you should know that I'm in the midst of Israel and that I am the Lord your God and none else and my people shall never be ashamed he's reassuring your church you don't have anything to be ashamed of sisters you don't gotta be ashamed of your long hair you don't have to be ashamed of your long dress you don't have to be ashamed of your modesty and all these other things not wearing makeup you have no reason to be ashamed because why because you've been restored back to the word and he says now verse 28 and he shall come to pass that word that I'll pour out my spirit upon all flesh now how many of your flesh tonight no mannequins here no wax figures here right we're all flesh I will an ain't brother Joe up here all night doing that but I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your old men shall dream dreams and your young men shall see visions and also upon my service and upon my handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit church we got a promise of a revival and I'm gonna tell you this is that what Joel is spoken back there it's the outpour today of the breath that's what we got speaking in tongue that's why we got the movement of the Spirit why because we have been promised a revival a word born revival and it's here did you hear what I said I said it's here you ain't gonna look for tomorrow you ain't gonna look for it on Sunday or next week are you camp it's here the revival is here man revival cold let the word come let life come tonight ah will restore I'm gonna put you back little bride into the very thought process that ahead of you before the foundation of the world our ruler store says the Lord thus the restoration of the bride teary God restores his flowers his leaves his nature his seeds of the earth therefore we know that God restore also his habitation oh listen what he says here he says now the only way that it can never remain dead his fort to lay in their own place young people you want to revival then get in the right place grandma grandpa you want to revive I'll get in the right place mom and dad you need a revival get in the right place he says the only way that it can remain dan is forward to lay in the wrong place but if it falls in the right place he's got to come back to life again so God he said let us fall in the right channel that's right for a restoration he says God has a loft that when the Sun comes unto that seed it forces the life out of that seed and death can't hold it anymore and tonight when sons of God seed that's been planted on the inside of your life when you come up to that s Oh n not the SU in there is not enough demon power there's not enough Devils in hell can keep the life from coming up out of that seed though Satan tries to cover you up though he tries to strike you in cancer though he tries to smother you with depression and whatever there's not enough dirt there's not enough past sins there's not enough failures then keep that Chi from coming if you only lay in the presence of the Sun you can have this life that I'm speaking of tonight when he said regardless of conditions notice he said I'll not suffer my Holy One to see corruption nor would I leave his soul inhale in brother Graham said there wasn't enough time there wasn't enough devils there was enough anything to keep Christ in the grave till his body begin to rot because there was a law that went forth and he said I'll have a church without spot without blemish without wrinkle and I'm here to tell you tonight Church there's not enough Devils there's not enough trials there's not enough heartaches there's not enough hardship that you go through that can stop that word from coming to pass there's a law that's going forth and there's a word to back it up tonight he said regardless how little we are how low we are high and pure we are how and holy we are how sick we are how flick did we are the law of God speared by his word makes it obey Him forces the issue give it back now let's move on as I could bring him to bring this to a close I got well I got till I'm done right Ezekiel 37 let's go there notice there were four messengers to aid it the tree of life or the tree Calla pillar tank and worm pollen worm and locusts program said four messengers destroyed the tree and he said there's four messengers of life that restore the tree justification sanctification the gifts of the Spirit are back and then the word and we find here in Ezekiel we find all four stages right here he says now the hand of the Lord zekiel is 37 verse one the hand the Lord was upon me and he carried me out in the Spirit of the Lord he sent me down the midst of a valley which is full of bones and he calls me to pass by them roundabout and behold they were very many in the open Valley and lo they were very dry dead no life and he said unto me son of man can these bones live and I answered o Lord O Lord God down nois and again and he said unto me prophesy upon these bones and say unto them oh ye dry bones hear the word of the Lord how many of you would say that tonight or let me hear the words of the Lord he said thus saith the Lord God unto these bones behold I will cause breath to enter into you and ye shall live and I will lay sinews upon you and will bring flesh upon you and I will cover you with skin and I will put breath in you and ye shall live and you shall know that I am the Lord and so I prophesied as I was commanded and as I prophesied there was a noise oh that was a revival begin to break out in the valley of dry bones bo came back to bone here's a bunch of cracking and popping but something was taking place he said Bo come the bone together and it went out but he'll load seniors came on the flesh and flesh came upon them and skin cover them but there was no breath in them they had all three stages but they lacked the final stage which is a stage of life for the Spirit of God quickens the body to life and I better tell you tonight evening life if you're some dry bones there's a word here that's been prophesied oh we you can hear the word of the Lord and he said unto me prophesy to the wind prophesy Son of Man and say to the wind thus saith the Lord God come from the four winds over and he said Oh breathe and breathe upon these slain that they may live and so our prophesied as I commanded as he commanded me and the breath came into them and they lived and they stood up upon their feet an exceeding great army dry bones dead but had a revival in a valley you may be in a valley tonight you may be drying in different tonight you may be justified you may be sanctified you may be able to shout put you're lacking something but I want you to know tonight you can have that life the breath of life the Bible says when that breath the life came upon them they became an exceedingly great army and brother man was saying like this in the restoration abroad days was two four stages of eat Ezekiel's bones coming forth but the life only come not when the sinew skin came was was come upon them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back he goes that's when come back that fourth messes of life and I'll say tonight let the winds of your spirit father blow on me once the musicians start making their way maybe you're here tonight and brother branham gives a story an analogy here of some some massive pine trees in a great forest he was riding down with one of the brother brother Backstrom I believe it was and they were riding on horseback at night and the moon began to shine across these big trees and they were white a barn over don't come through there and there was no life you know and come through many years ago and he said it was very spooky big white trees moon shining down upon them and and all these trees were doing the wind would hit against them and they were just began to go and I thought oh man what a spooky place then he said I thought to myself what the ocala pill over an Apollo worm left the calliper leti and what the caterpillar left the locust is eaten but I will restore I will restore said Lord hallelujah God's gonna have a church I will restore saith the Lord and brother makes the same he says now fundamentally they retrieved yes they were they were once a tree the Methodist a Baptist Presbyterian the Moody's they were all all the rest of them they were once great big towering spires but they say the days of miracles is past and you find today they say we don't need officer calls find today we don't need the Holy Ghost being preached to our young people find today they don't need a real revival we just have an intellectual understanding what is that blowing through and I will say to you tonight don't allow these messengers of death to eat at you t that your victory t that your joy t that your revival because I stood there and I looked and they're coming wind again and instead of bending they just begin to go said of bending and moving with it they just begin to moan and oh the days of miracles has passed there's no such thing as a Holy Ghost and he said I was discouraged kind of like John was I was discouraged and I said Lord you said you would restore and about that time the wind dropped a little bit lower and he goes and I looked and goes when I did I noticed there was some under groves down there hold the wind decided there was no moving up here with the old trees that were burnt over and dead but the wind dropped a little bit lower and there were some undergrowth down there and he said when the winds begin to hit the undergrowth they begin to frolic they begin to jump they begin to shout they can bend with the moving of the Spirit and I say what about an evening like Taverner won't you say like me tonight let the winds of your spirit drop down a little bit Lord tonight God and let me move with the spirit let the winds of your power let the winds of revival forgetting to strike me Lord and let me not be starchy let me not be holding the past audience but let me be somebody that can move with the spirit that can bend with the anointing that can go where the Spirit of God is going that can answer just same way the word answers he said every time the wind blows Tim little trees just dig a little bit deeper they said that Jesus Christ was the same yesterday today and forever these little trees throw their hands I'm saying hallelujah they rejoice over the word for their day but the big trees they couldn't be in with the Spirit they couldn't move but the new trees were alive the old trees were dead that's the reason they can't being because it's dead but there's a new birth coming on hear me tonight Church he goes in the st. George them old trees joy long time ago has come back in a new generation I will restore saith Lord when the wind goes to blowing I can give it a yes Lord I believe you're the same Jesus Christ I rose from the dead you live yet today Lord and the Spirit of God just sweeps it from one side of the church to the other you may think we're crazy but we're not we just got life and we're flexible I say even like Taverner it's time to lick my Bible comb it's time to let the Spirit of God moved from the front to the back I don't care if you're young or old let the power God move through here and let's have a revival let's have life come to this church let's have my come to your home let's have life come to you and your personal experience just play us something sirs Laurieann he's by your hairs briefly if you will tonight I'm sorry that I've been longer than normal but maybe you're here tonight maybe he'll say brother Joe I want that word born revival so I want to just talk about it I don't want to just hear about it but I want the winds of his spirit to drop down low tonight and begin to move I don't want just an intellectual understanding where I'm some dry bone out in a desert some Valley there but in the mess is a long time not flexible no life in it complaining oak rabid spirit hello brother Joe till I got one of our five I want that light that you spoke about tonight I don't want to be some burnover they can't move and Bend with the winds of the Spirit maybe that's you tonight you say brother Joe but the winds of the spear blow on me tonight you slip your hand up to him
