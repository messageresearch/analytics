in God or a hunger for God or an interest in the Scriptures we just want everyone to just feel free to bring them and we just be teaching subjects out of the word and I believe we'll just have a wonderful time and then if someone has inquiry they want to know more than we can work with those individuals one by one and deal with personal questions individual questions things that pertain to what's on their heart so we just want to open it up to everyone somewhat of an outreach just in our local area there are people all over the area they hunger for God but they don't know where to go and there's so much confusion in the land but we want to show evening light hold up a banner in the evening time that there's still Bible believing people that leave the Word of God and Christ is

yield my vessel to you Lord and give myself to you father once again we commit their service your hands Lord everything to be said and done for your glory and for your honor in Jesus name we pray amen amen it's good to be in the house the Lord amen let's look at Romans chapter 12 mercy that song there didn't fire you up your woods wet he hang back in the back there but couldn't hardly hold myself together amen trying to get some things finished up here but anyway we just had a wonderful time there by the Josh Bennet's this week in North Carolina and he sends his greetings to you and the church hear him in the Lord and really moved on Saturday night especially with the young people and touching the hearts of the young people that that's something that means a lot to me that the young folks can have their moment with the king a man and in his presence and we saw Amen demons that were cast out and a man just getting a lot of good reports from that and the young folks so we're just thankful to the Lord a ministry here in Romans chapter 12 and verse 1 it says I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto the Lord unto God which is your reason service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may be may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen would let you be seated this evening that's coming home and just begin to think on the word transformed and you know the word transform means to be changed it means to be made different than what it was before it's a it's a character and everything has been changed to be transformed you know truly that's what we desire in our lives amen we we don't desire even hear it even like tabernacle to to cause you to might want to just be maybe a good church member or you know a good person but we desire that your lives will be completely changed and and I believe a God who has the power to do that we witness it in our heart and our midst a man of every one of us would have testimonies of where and who we used to be and what we used to do but we met a power that was greater than what held us he man we met a power that was greater many men in this sitting in this building met a power that was greater than the alcohol that held you or the tobacco that held you or whatever kind of demon that would try to hold you you met something that was greater than that he meant so great that many of you in just a moment all it took was a moment and it was over amen and you were transformed never to go back to that again a man and we could look at this world even that we live in today and if we could take it back thousands of years ago we would find it to be a world that was without form it was void and darkness covered it completely it was in complete chaos it was no life there was darkness storms whipping all over it you know nothing to hold it whipping winds whipping in every direction but then a word was spoke and that word went out and the Holy Spirit we know follows that word amen you see when the past even when the preaching takes place amen the first thing you know is whoo right across the building goes the Holy Ghost amen the word is the conductor of the Spirit and when the word is preached the spirit follows it amen and when it goes out the spirit follows that word a mana fits the the Bible teaching the Bible Holy Ghost comes back and confirms Amen what has been taught if the Holy Ghost doesn't confirm it then we got our wires crossed somewhere Amen but the Holy Ghost goes there and the spirit would follow the Word of God as he would say let there be him and that that word would begin to take platform and would begin to take place and and we see even even a brother Brown speaking about God made man he said he began to speak the word and the Spirit of God begins to brood over the earth and out of that came East err flowers and out of that came every kind of species is that Holy Spirit begin to woo and draw that out of that earth amen and the and the Holy Spirit brooding it's uh it was like brooding means to be like a mother and uh you know as Jesus said I would I would brood over you as a mother hen over her chicks a man a brooding it's a creating the atmosphere that the word can be made manifest a man and I believe that's what we experience in our church servicing man as the Holy Ghost coming down as we even felt just a few minutes ago in a song or in the Word of God how it receives fit to call me madam begins to brood over our hearts and it begins to pull out of our lives and and he said he began to brood out Birds and then became animals and begin to get greater and greater until outstep the very reflection of him a man the brooding of God pulling out the image of God a man who said everything any higher a man than a man or our beloved woman she you know in the creation of God he said when this world that was in a condition that it was without form without void the Spirit of God began to move over it and the entire sure was changed he meant when the Holy Ghost comes the entire picture is chance hallelujah and that's a very direct revelation as if you've got the Holy Ghost or not that the entire picture has changed what you thought that what you thought was the great what you thought was wonderful now still seem to matter anymore amen the whole thing has changed it may begin to move and he said it turned it from total chaos to a Garden of Eden amen that's the power of this word that's a transpiler power of the word of God is a change of life from a life of chaos to a need and amen amen from a life of torment to a not life of peace and happiness promote ability to the power a menace here tonight to change sickness amen into health he meant we've witnessed the wooing of the holy ghost in our midst a man to take a woman sick with cancer and to turn it into health again we've seen the wooing of the Holy Ghost so take a man that was bound by every spirit of hailing and going to a sinner's grave in a devil's hell Amen but the Holy Ghost begin to woo and then maybe that life may have been dark without void amen storms all opponents miss but a word was spoken that life and that life was predestinated to come forth and and so the spirit followed that word and it began to draw it begin to pull Amen you remember the pool that you felt in your life even in this service some of you may not even understand why you're here but it's the Holy Ghost pulling upon your heart looking for life looking for truth looking for God and list looking for hope in the dying world there's a power here Amen the Holy Ghost that I'll take the vilest sinner and make him a virtuous child of God amen I'll lay my life out of control wonder don't know what's right and what's wrong spinning around in darkness but there is a power here amen to come upon the Word of God and to call life out of that body amen and so the earth in this dark chaotic condition but the Spirit of God begin to woo and begin to draw what the word spoke about the earth a minute changed it from chaos into a Garden of Eden you know I began to look in there me know after God had built his wonderful creation and it wasn't in a Garden of Eden there was no doubt there was no fear I mean the word fear wasn't even imagined yet I mean there was no death there was no die a man may be transformed all of this into a Garden of Eden him and it so changed what the world used to be and you know I but after after he had done that the enemy came and and you know the enemy don't have the power to transform he has the power to deform and so I began to look at these two words transformation and deformation or transform and deform and then the transformation is the act or the state of being changed it it's a marked change in appearance or character and it's always a transformation he said it is the word is used especially Amen for a change for the better Oh hallelujah every one of us can testify that God made a change in me and it was a change for the better amen a transformation is a change that increases value amen a deforming is a change alright but it's a change that alters the value but it don't increase it it devalues it and this is what Satan did to man you know he took it from a life of a wonderin and I mean and I think we can't even hardly imagine in the world that we live in and the things that we go through the mind battles and the spirits that we face Amen changed it from a life of no worries and no heartaches and no goodbyes and no trouble and to what we have now that sounds like it lost a lot of value he deformed the world that we live in in and and you know Brian was saying something about you know going into a cornfield one time and he said I would think of as a limb you know had fell off a tree and it fell on a stalk and that stock was trying his best to get up as straight as it was supposed to but there was something that was laying on him that was deforming it for what it was supposed to be and he said the stick was laying on him so we also find wild creepers that have come in and in her to begin to deform people and they they're not want to it that you know a creeper will come in and begin to push against a child of God until he can move off of his promises and it bends him in such a way to where he can't see the Godhead straighter he can't see the revelations that we have in this hour what is it is the creepers that are coming in sowed they meant by the enemy and he said it's there and he said we were used to try to take him and cut them out and pull him out and pull him out he said but he was always there trying to deform amen the seed that was there and he said we're all still in the image of God but some are so deformed until we walk contrary to what the word says we've to walk we talked country from what the word says we should talk we live contrary from what the word says that we should live amen seeing has done this evil to the daughters and sons of Almighty God he's a deep former to deform it to pervert it to change it from something what it was originally he man we see that Satan has had a mighty work in this hour that we live in in that he would take the Word of God and he would take the effect out of it hey man he would take it such a place to where people don't believe in a religion that has power but there is a power hey man there is a power that can raise a sinner and make him not just live with those things and look at you know come to church you okay just believe in God and you'll be safe but no there's a power that are transform that life then I'll take it from a life of sin and make live above and beyond that but creepers come in and say no we don't have that kind of power anymore but see God hates a powerless religion he hates a religion that says there's no power all these they have a form of God in this they have a form of righteousness they come to church they live you know seemingly okay good guy good neighbor good to this good to that but God wants something more than that the Bible said they would have a form of garden 'less but denied the power hey man he told that to Laodicea it says you're lukewarm you say you have need or nothing you have you out you're rich and increased with Goods but I say you're blind and naked and you don't know who you are Amen what happened something had been brought in their creeper to bring it to such a place that it didn't even recognize it was blind but see God hates a powerless religion it has to have power in it it has that sincerity and sincerity brings power and power brings real worship not forms of worship but genuine powerful worship to know you've passed from death unto life there's a change in a second place ye who at once dared in sins and trespasses yet hath he made alive he transformed unit oh my don't you know that if you were you find yourself in a dead condition it's an increase in value to find yourself now that who was dead to be made alive well hallelujah many of you were caught in forms of religion but in dead and all kind of creeds and dogmas of man but there's a power that raised you up and made you live again God wants to perform his word by his power but when the church denies his power how can you how can he perform and vindicate his word when the church explains everything away or saves us for another age somewhere how can God who wants to fulfill his word performing among the people and the people deny that he doesn't if the people deny that he heals and he can heal hear the people denies that he don't save no Lord he don't feel no of the Holy Ghost no more Mercy's over he can't provide none of that but God hates the former religion he hates a powerless religion God wants to perform by the Holy Ghost vindicate his word and the church wants to perform but see they have didn't hide the Holy Ghost they want to make a big organization somewhere make a big membership Amen I tell you right now we're not interested in a big membership we're not interested with names on a book somewhere we're not interested in shaking hands with a preacher that's not former religion I'm not interested in just having a forum where I'll come and I do my little ritual and suddenly or Wednesday I want my life to have the power of the Holy Ghost vindicated on the inside people joined churches and called it I got South saved as blasphemy ain't about joining churches a menace about dying out and giving yourself to him be born again you know there was a young man one time in a paradox he says there's a young man one time that never had experienced the baptism of the Holy Ghost was in some formal you know Church didn't believe in it and he says he said but until your life has change and a miracle takes place like that unless that happens you can't be a Christian there must be a you become a Christian there must be a change in the spirit of man to give him a new birth and God alone Saul the one can do that he said you know I went to one time to a very fine boy it was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family sounds good doing it fine boy fine girl fine family this boy all of a sudden came up with some idea and he just walked away he'd done something wrong to that little girl and promised to do a certain thing that wouldn't do it instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should it wasn't in him to do it and so the father and mother called to the scenes that we desire to know what's wrong with our boy he said it's not easy to do sometime but you must be truthful and honest he said therefore the boy was a Christian as far as a believer he had repented he had been baptized he had his position but he had not yet received the baptism of the Holy Spirit no matter how much he thought he had he said you thinking you have it and having it it's two different things you might be able to say you have it you might better show some evidence of emotion but unless your life is vindicated Amen that you have been changed Amen in vindicating what you're possessing to have you still haven't died no matter how many emotions how much jump run shout sensation speaking in tongues all these things are alright I believe in him but unless your life coach with your testimony you haven't got what you say you have hey man this young fellas parents his mother was German he said there's no reflection on the German but there's a strain in that family so they just sit and you can talk to them and they stare you right in the face oh yeah we got Germans in church guarantee you he may even preach your heart out and then look at you you know if he said you can wave at him you can say good morning and they'll just stand there and look at you he said it's a strain in that family and then in that gene he said I sure you say I've chiffon sir fine morning just stand and look at you and it send an intelligent woman and I come to say I'd say come to see us sometimes she doesn't stand and look well our brother and their father your mother that way the brother this father this boy strictly harsh moody hot-tempered high-strung oh as some Irishman's here - that's his whole family except one out of the family who's been filled with the Holy Ghost the father and mother both are Christians filled with the Holy Ghost they brought this young man in the way of the Lord and now the young man is about 17 18 years old fine kid real model Boyd home he's got a brother that's just vice versa but all these others are trying to do right and his boys trying to do right but he said the genes of the father and mother is in this boy no matter how much they are converted the father mother know much how they are converted still remains in the flesh and has been interpreted to this boy therefore the boys kind of complex in him just like his mother's family will forgive won't apologize and that's where the boy stands today and he said you know I said to the father you know no matter how much you've raised him up look at you you sit down all your families are drunks fighting shooting cutting people so forth said to the mother look at your family they're a bunch of people that sit there won't speak just irreverent to religion but he said that's not you you're the only one out of all your sisters and brothers and your sweet kind of forgiving what does that the Holy Ghost that's the thing that made you tender and sweet not your people anymore it's Christ living on the inside of you hallelujah I said to the boy look at your family practically all of them but the father of drunks moody hot-tempered high stroke but you're kind and you're forgiven what is it the Holy Spirit it's not you it's Christ living in you and I said now the same thing has to happen to your son father raised up said my son went to the altar he is baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ all they say I know my son has come to Christ he said that might be all right as far as outward motions he might be identified with believer as with believers but until he is born again he receives the Holy Ghost I'd advise that young man and never marry a woman because you'll make hell on earth under that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in he said then his nature will be changed and it will take the very nature that's been bred and through to the loss of the genes of his father and a mother and all his intellectuals and trying his best overcoming he'll never overcome it on his own but there is a power he can receive hallelujah there's a power here tonight that will change your whole body it'll change your mind it'll change your thinking it'll change your attitude it'll change it all what is the transformation how do we get this why what does this transformation do God does it by the spirit of his word he plants the seed and he throws his spirit on it and it brings forth what it was supposed to be hallelujah his only spirit transforms a sea to be the vindication of its kind so as he planted the corn and he planted the the the rose bushes and all kinds of flowers and every kind of species and he said and he began to brew over it in its throat his Holy Ghost on it his spirit on it and it began to pull and it pulled out corn and they pulled out tomatoes and it pulled out flowers of every kind it pulled it all out what was it the power that was in that spirit and if he could pull that out of a cold earth remember the word had been spoken can it also do it upon men and women who the word has been spoke about and the word calls you sons and daughters of God and it don't matter how much the devil tries to cover you over with darkness and fear and anxiety and I believe when that spirit begins to woo it's going to come forward because that power is greater than what holds in what harms the power to transform is greater than the power that deforms amen what kind of seeds you are to show what's on the inside of you you can't hide it whatever you are it shows on the outside you can't keep from it you can't make the tree anything but what it is it's going to come forward so if it's a seed of an apple put in there you can't change it it ain't going to change as far as humanly spit abilities the builders come and bring it into a peach or a parent but it's already been put in there there's nothing I can do to change it oh my man there's nothing I can do to keep it from coming forth if it's predestinated to life and if that seed of God was placed in your hearts before the foundation of the world they need a devil contain that nothing he can do to keep her from coming he can't cover it up with enough seeing enough creeds and enough dogmas and enough things of this world to keep it from coming to pass it will come to fruition and manifestation another day that the world laid in darkness in chaos all kinds of religions washing of hands pots wearing different kind of robes so forth laying in the midst of utter chaos the genuine Israel of God had been so perverted and so bent from the laws and statutes of God to what God says your your sacrifices are nothing but a bunch of traditions you and your traditions make the Word of no effect your traditions has calls this these creepers have come in and turned what was to be holy and what was to be righteous into nothing but a bunch of changing the money and changing of you know a good skit together until what God was saying become a stink in my nostrils it became nothing but a traditional God help us to keep the creepers cut back to what I worship don't come just a tradition or I have to our attitude towards Christ ain't just a tradition about I got to do my Christian duty but there's something on the inside of me that just probably and bubbling and I can't stop it from coming forth it's there and ain't nothing you can do to stop it and here there was a word spoke for that time of chaos Isaiah 6 behold or 9 and verse 6 that under us a child is born unto us a son is given his name shall be called counsellor the Prince of Peace the mighty God the everlasting father and of his reign there'll be no end and that word was God's Word it wasn't just the word of a man sure eyes he used Isaiah to speak it and people are like what are you talking about they couldn't grasp it but their Holy Ghost who followed the word and they began to search down through six hundred years until they found the recipient of that word and it was a little virgin walking down to a whale and she met the angel of God and it begins to pull from her the helm a highly favored maybe said me who you talking to me yes I'm talking to you man but holding you shall be formed ain't made a child of the Holy Ghost and his name and he begins to speak all these wonderful things and something so pulled out of her to where she can respond be it unto me be it unto me according to that word and in the middle of chaos God was fulfilling his word in the middle of all kind of darkness and every kind of religion of the world and things are Roman oppression God was fulfilling his word hallelujah and there wasn't enough death was lined up there that could keep that virgin from taking birth taking seed and giving birth and a little why come forward what was that why let my people go the devil tried he tried to spray it he tried to let a creeper come in he tried to turn him you don't come to himself well show me what you can do show me who you really are shall turn these stones into bread religious Devils still doing the same offers anything such as a thing as divine healing showed me let him heal somebody then I believe no they won't believe no the same devil stood at Jesus said if thou be the Son of God come off the cross the word said he was the son of God it didn't matter what the devil and his questions was the word said he was hallelujah amen they wasn't don't matter what the devil the devil may say about you or one of the critics may say or whatever anybody may say it only matters what the word said about you and then the word called you a son ain't nothing the devil can do about it but in the middle of chaos in the middle of his this Satan's eating trying to cover this world with all of his nonsense and it's getting worse and worse and worse listen witness world ain't getting better it's getting worse this world ain't getting lighter and more light is getting darker and darker and dark come on somebody and their men are impressions of the spirit center here I mean I find more young people bound by anxiety and fear and depression more than I've ever seen in my whole life maybe not just young people but everybody it's the spirit that is come and in the middle of this chaos there's a word that's been smoked hallelujah I'll have a bra without spot without wrinkle and the debt will try to come and cover it up and see anything so an ain't enough power in the church no more and then God don't do that not though he'll and God don't save any sense creepers in but there is a power here and that word a searching for that virgin to compose and that word will reunite with that body and there will be a bride without spot without wrinkle there is a little return of the Lord Jesus he promised he would I don't care how don't you get hallelujah I don't care how many Devils coming to this room I don't care how many Devils of depression and anxiety and fear want to filtrate this body or filtrate this round there's a wire that's been smoked and he can't do nothing you don't come too late devil because there's a bride that's united with the word and there's a spirit pulling it out of her hallelujah hey man predestinated God by his foreknowledge knew every one of you and some of us got stories of I was hearing some just this weekend speaking about their great-grandfather being in the war some of them made it through the beaches there in Normandy one thousands of died but yet there was a reason because there had to be a seed passed through their gods watching over his elect he knows the names that are written on the Lamb's Book of Life and he'll come he'll he'll stop wars you change bullets directions of bullets he'll change bombs making where they don't detonate you know I was brother Daniel maser some of you many of y'all remember him from Czech Republic I remember correctly his father was in World War two and his but he was working there in Czech Republic in a in a factory building building airplanes and stuff to try to fight the Germans and and he's there and the sign Candace the sign of the signal came there for air-raid Germans were going to bomb the factory and and they they got ready and they hunker down they watched as just almost seemed like hundreds of German planes went right over right over their factory and they knew that was coming for them they they had so you know I already had knowledge of it in fact broken the codes or whatever and know that there was going to bomb that factory and they got to after the war and they found some of those men that had actually flew over there because they flew over the top of it and they didn't bomb there they bombed about three or four miles or ten miles down somewhere else and they totally missed and the guy who was one of the pilots said you know he said we didn't know what happened he said we was coming across there he said we didn't see no factory we saw nothing but fields he said so we didn't see anything too far hello somebody but there was a man there who was working in that factory who had a son that hadn't come forth yet a man and a minister of the gospel for the Daniel maser and God would change the whole the whole scene ain't meant to protect that seat Oh hallelujah Sam he's watched over your grandfather's in good life great-great-great-great-great higher before you can go back and he's watched a layman and directed them and this happened to miss meringue and then that time it seemed like it just may be a normal thing or didn't realize what was going on but God's been watching over you not just since you've been born God's been watching over you since the foundation of the earth hallelujah he hasn't been watching you for 40 years or 60 years or however old you are 15 years or 15 months he's been watching over you since the foundation of the world hallelujah and he knows the names that are there and he's going to bring them for you and the lawns of your father but you're going to have fellowship with him until he was transformed into a body of flesh he said I wanted a son he was in me but through wedlock I came as he was transforming to a man like me and you became like your parents he said now for God's sons we're after your attributes of your father amen the journaling in there and your father and your mother the incubator to bury you amen the earth and flesh is also the incubator that bears God's seats now if your sons and daughters of God then you were in God at the beginning you are his attribute if he wasn't there than you never was normal ever never will be he said because I can't I cannot bear for my Lords a son of a man here a man there I can only bear my own sons and to be men my own likeness sons and daughters who was in God at the beginning you've got eternal life you say we believe we got eternal life there's one former eternal life and that came from God and if you got eternal life that life was always was good luck devil on quenching out of life that always was you can't do it it's impossible because it's eternal in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among it we were in the Lords of Jesus and went to Calvary with him he died with him you raised with him and today we're sitting in heavenly places with him filled with his spirit sons and daughters of God and we can have fellowship with him you know he says he says here he says talks about the father that was half half Irishman my mother was a half Indian he said my family tree is terrible and if you ain't careful get on ancestry.com and you'll find out your ancestry tree is terrible I guarantee you you'll find drunkards you'll find horse thieves they don't tell what you'll find traitors you'll find all kinds of stuff in your family lineage it's there and it comes through a mint through the through the family lines and he said you may not be able to brag on them much he said well when the Holy Ghost comes you changed families hallelujah you changed families God transforming you God pulling you over to himself hey man you realize I never was that I am here that's not who I love that's not who I am that's who I was hello Louie you might not be able to brag a man on your family tree but you can brag on him hallelujah you may not be able to brag even on your father your grandfather grandmother whatever but you can brag on Jesus Christ amen Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's never done nobody wrong he's the same today he still got power he still heals he still saved he still sets free he still delivers that's my father amen he still comes on the scene in the midst of a storm he still comes and even any wounds have broken hearted he still does all of that he's my father can we brag on him a little bit tonight he's a champion of champions he's the God of all gods he's a lord of all lords he is full of power he's full of blood and redemption and all the works that he's doing he has not lost one house God sent his transforming power to fulfill his word in Sarah and Abraham Sarah and Abraham were beyond childbearing and it's a mystery that's in the Bible how is a man that's 100 years old and a woman that's 90 going to have a baby is that possible I mean even in today's science and it's a great impossibilities that he can do to where he can do heart transplants and every kind of thing imaginable almost is it really possible for a hundred year old and a 90 year old to have a baby but there was a word that was spoke and he told Abraham you're going to have a son now Sarah tried to perform that on her own and she brought forth a man a bastard child the son of the bondwoman amen but when the word was performed by the Holy Ghost amen when he came down and visited him there and the day on that day that day at the tent Amen the Holy Ghost came and it began to woo upon Sarah until it changed her body he said well how do you know it was changed well it wasn't but just a little bit after that that a king of a nation wanted her for a wife how's that possible for a young man to want a ninety-year-old woman for a wife something had to happen and that power so changed her until it changed her back to a young woman again what was it signify it was a type of you and I come on Sarah you tried to do things and you tried to do it and you ain't done nothing but produced dead works but there is a power Amen I change your life forever it's a transforming power of the Holy Ghost amen Enoch was translated from death about what he walked with God and was not how did that happen by God's transforming power what did God do that for is a type of rapture in the churches coming Jesus body was quickened after it was dead what was it transforming power the word has got to come to pass it's God's work playing in your heart if you want to go into rapture if you want to be a Christian genuine place this word and believe it as the Prophet and God spoke to the Prophet said take that scroll and eat it and becoming a man every promise in there has to be manifested it's God's original seed don't let some educated theologian try to pump it out of you don't let him spray you with some carnal science and knowledge or some kind of education somewhere believe God hallelujah you want the transforming power of God in your life begin to believe him do as merry dance I'll take you at your word okay if you take him at his word it'll change your life if you're sick tonight and you begin to take God in his word he's the Lord God that heals all our diseases that pie begin to work in your body until it transforms you into a well son or daughter of God hey man Abraham didn't take the scientific research of his day but I'm too old I went too far I've done this he called it all nonsense and staggered not at the promise of God he was strong giving praise to God he knew God was able to perform what he promised how many children of Abraham we got here tonight Amen just because it's dark around here don't mean that God forgot his promise just because there's a lot of chaos going on this world and amen the nations are all tore up and politics is all tore up and money's all tore up and all this nonsense of this that and the other trying to fill trade around Amen I don't mean that God is not going to still fulfill his promises but it's in the middle of chaos if you realize all down through scriptures it's right in the middle of the most chaotic time chaos all around and God steps on the sea I had all this ought to be look where it's got it God's gonna step in any moment it was in the boat that was rocking and carrying on and it was about to go down that's when he come walking on the wall hallelujah Amen if you're in a bunch of chaos tonight and you don't know which way is up and which way is down you don't know what's going on around you you've lost your Bears start looking for Jesus because he's walking around he's looking for you and he's saying come my child he's wooing at your heart he's wooing said come on step out on the water believe if you belong just waiting on your believe me if you believe it I'm coming hallelujah amen sometimes it's in those dark moments that's when Jesus steps on the same it was in Martin Mary's dark moment Lazarus had died for days look like their friend had left them he called for me didn't come and it got so dark but it didn't change who he was didn't change his abilities it only magnified his ability woo man it didn't change it he went from just a God who could heal they saw him heal many times so I'm healed blind man the darker it got the more it magnified his ability to where he could say Lazarus come forth and if he wouldn't have spoke the name Lazarus everyone in there would arose that was the power that was there Oh God do we realize what powers among us tonight Isaiah an ordinary man with unclean lips says woe unto me humming unclean Lord I'm unclean man I got unclean lips without angel came down and got fire off with God's altar and transformed his lips and those lips come from a beginning from a wandering man to the lips of a prophet with thus saith the Lord who God transforming power 120 fishermen little sellers of peripheral women gathered themselves an upper room close the doors something I'm not enough education to sign their names but God transform them from fishers to fishers of men for men and women of the street to saints of God and Marlow the transforming power of Almighty God power a local church member maybe a presbyterian of Methodist Baptist Pentecost or something down the street II wear this to find spirit on him newborn any of them been thought at the feet of Gamaliel one of the best teachers in the land what happened on his road down in Damascus I've got a bunch of people who's believed in God's Word and they begin to cry out and begin to pray and on the road the power of God met him and it transformed him from a church member into a church goer and from up into a prophet of God who wrote the Word of God in the New Testament from a church member to a saint hallelujah the power to change you say I have Christ but are you changed you can't have him and not be changed so well I got the hallelujah you don't know Christ by hallelujah you don't know Christ by dancing that's an attribute you know Christ by knowing him as a person that's coming to your heart and the form of the Holy Ghost and he took away your sins and he planted an undying faith an undying faith in a resurrected Lord Jesus not an intellectual conception not an intellectual conception but a new verb to change you to change you from the creature that you once was and that's how you know him then you can dance in the spirit amen then you can clap your hands or whatever emotions the Lord puts on you it comes afterward hello somebody you don't dance to get the spirit you get the spirit and then dance a man you don't dance a man you don't shout to get it you get it then shout it comes afterwards but you can't have it without having him listen this he said I wish that he would take a bunch of preachers in this valley here and let them know we're not crazy we're not holy rollers or a bunch of trash what is it it's the spirit of the Living God among us and men and women are drunk on his goodness it's not witchcraft for men or telepathy it's the spirit of the Living God turn loose of your traditions amen turn loose of your elders and lists and listen to the voice of the Living God it will change you hello somebody it will change you you won't be one of the persecutors you'll want to be one of them amen if you can pass the barriers of all your doctors until you can float in the presence of God something will take place you won't believe the days of miracles are passing Oh Lord you'll believe they're right here because one has been performed on you hallelujah Amen when you have been a miracle you know God still a God of miracles hallelujah when you've been healed by the power of God you know God still heals when you've been saved by the power of God you know God still saved when you experienced the blood of Jesus you know there's still blood [Applause] hallelujah it'll change a man that's what God can do hallelujah supernatural God does not change his nature to fit people's nature come on somebody you know first sermon I ever preached I had I guess I put it mine I searched first sermon ever preached was a lot a goat show of all things we had a in Shreveport Louisiana and they won't ask dad actually to speak on a Sunday morning for they'd only have a little devotion and he said well I have a church he said but my son he he'll speak I went well thanks dad what am I gonna speak on these all don't worry about it come and I'm all nervous and tore up well I get up there and I begin to think you know in the goat world there's something called a scorecard and it's written there you know what a goat you know maybe what a perfect goat would be and it's so many points are given to stature and confirmations and all kinds of things and it breaks it down in other little points and so as you show your animal judge in his mind is adding this animals points up and then theoretically he supposed to take those points and then place the animal according to what he's added up in his mind so this goat is 95 out of 100 and he goes first and on down and on down and so I was talking about the scorecard and I said you know I said the problem with the scorecard it's supposed to be the absolute I said but many breeders want to take the scorecard and change it to match their goat instead of taking a goat and trying to breed certain characteristics to where it matches the scorecard and I said the Bible is the same way people want to change the Bible well God don't teach that more and more that ain't the same no more you know that ain't right that's our church don't believe that what does it matter what your church believes well the preacher don't believe what does it matter what a preacher fits in the Bible it's in the Bible it's our absolute we got to have an absolute we got to have a hit I'm thankful that the word that we believed didn't have to have a new Bible that had to be written but we took the King James Version brother Brown took it and he made it lil it came alive hey man amen and then higher our ambition is not to take the word and change it to match what we believe because listen if you leave the scriptures you leave the message this message is not met if it ain't in the scriptures it's not message Amen so this Bible is our absolute so supernatural God does not change his nature to fit a person's nature people has to change their nature to fit God's supernatural plan and wise people cry who is this it's God in the midst of its people they don't understand that God will never come to your level you've got to come to his level God not come to meet you requirement you've got to meet God's requirement and then when that requirement is met upon the promise God made to redeem the people if that requirement has been met your entire being changes your entire being changes your thinking changes your habit changes everything about you changes your desire changes your living changes your ever everything changes because it's not your nature no more it's not your life no more it's a life of Christ living on the inside but people are afraid of the new birth but you know what new birth it's a mess I don't care where it's at it can be in a pigpen cows table in a pink decorated hospital room it's still a mess a birth when it takes place it's a mess new birth is the same it'll make you do things you didn't think you would do it'll make you cry boohoo rub around on the altar no matter what you do I'll never ask God to try to bring a new birth to my level I want to meet God's level of the new birth and receive it listen I think the time to water down the Christian walk people have watered it down to such a point that men can live in pornography and live and all kind of sexual sins and still have the Holy Ghost what that ain't that a that's somebody taking their level or God's level and trying to bring it down to their level God's not he don't operate like that he takes you and brings you to his level the new birth changes the man it changes a woman it changes their desire it changes their atmosphere it changes their appetites it really wrestle with God until the blessing comes you say well I'll dance in the spirit I spoke with tongues but look and see if something may not be right we'll get a weed growing now on to you got to get from this weed now to a week humble sweet with the word obedient obedient to the word lest the Holy Spirit come in and let God change you you can see a type of this change in the tadpole tadpole was born as looking like a little catfish or something just a little thing with a little tail on the swimmer swimming in a mud hole and you can watch the change as it begins to take place it begins to come up to the top of that water and it begins to take a little sip and it goes back down and it comes back up and it takes a little bigger silt and it goes back down and it comes back up and it takes a bigger silt and all of a sudden that atmosphere of that other world begins to do changes in his life and all of a sudden little legs pop out of it and the tail falls off and that world pool gets greater than the world that it was born in hallelujah amen I believe it we may all come to that moment our life what would come into the house of God would get a little sip of that atmosphere we get a little simpler Spirit of God moving and it begin to pull and they begin to whoo and they begin to draw until that world got greater than the world that we was born in hallelujah that's when you know what young man's been changed or young woman's been changed that the world they was born in has lost its power you can see it also in a butterfly as it comes a little ugly caterpillar and we're just creeping along most of you smashed him with your foot oh look the thing and it just sits over there and begins to eat begins they eat and begins they and something begins to change but you would say it was beginning to sing a song I'm wrapped up I'm tied up I'm tangled up in Jesus and it builds itself a little walk occurred and it's sitting there and it's eating and it's eating and it's eating something that's happening something is popping out and the next thing you know that ugly creature has changed to a butterfly hallelujah you know the change God has rolled in your life but I want you to understand God has done even greater amen because a frog can go back to the same waters amen amen a butterfly will go back down into the same and meet you know laying on the same leaves but God has done something excuse me not something greater he has taken you from a tadpole and change you into a butterfly he's totally changed your heart when you receive the Holy Ghost you're no longer the same your characteristics has changed everything about you is saying God has worked a miracle in here hallelujah and he's still a miracle working God I've seen him just this weekend come down and change a little girl it was so bound by fear and you when we went to pray for her she began to scream just sort of blood-curdling scream and begin to pull away from us minister but by the power the power of transformation we begin to call upon that thing and rebuke that spirit of fear and it left her he still got that power he still sets free the druggies he still sets free the drugs and the alcohol of you he and all the tobacco in the world once you get enough of that atmosphere you don't ever want to go back to that again so I brother band I'm talking about the pig he said you can take a pig and you can clean him up and you can wash him up you say put some lambskin on them so ain't that a beautiful lamb he said but there's still a nature inside of that it's still a pig he said if you can ever change that on the inside to be the nature of a lamb then you don't ever have to worry about that pig going back there again hello somebody hey man that's why we want our young people to have more than just a religion more than just a little religious service and a religious duty Amen we don't want they Amen we don't want to just put a covering on them cover them with a message cover them with a script you know just to covering a tradition I mean what we won't we the nature of God to come on the inside and I don't just think for the young people s for the older like a lamb when you get that change the lamb begins to forfeit is where I can dress any way I want to it's none of your business it's not me it's the Bible I can do whatever I want to do I've got that ain't me it's the Bible it ain't I'm a man up here behind a pulpit dictating rules and regulations and leadership it ain't about dictatorship listen we don't I know brother Tim's heart my heart and any other ministers heart true minister of God they don't want to be your Holy Ghost we don't want you to have to take us everywhere you go and go Kate where they should know Kay she's oh that one looks good no I ain't interested in that we ain't interested in going any man anywhere with you that Jesus wouldn't go but if you get him on the inside of you you don't need a preacher no you don't need to do that nope you don't need to do that it'll be a life that's lived a transformation Amen a change you want 7 times past dead even many here tonight one time you can look back you say yes sir I was dead you deserved to go down to a sinners hell Devils are senators grave and a devil's hell but God who is rich in mercy God who is rich in mercy I'm so glad he's rich in mercy I'm glad he's not just rich in Murray you're just rich in money or rich of materials which he is but the greatest thing is he's rich in mercy how that we were once dead you has he quickened and made alive he changed you of who he was to be a new creature in Christ not just a tadpole but a butterfly not just a pig but a lamb not just a sinner but a saint that's the power that's in this word and anybody that says different is a creeper you know why because they creep me out I want out of that because I know what God has done for me this church knows what God's done for you people come in here sometimes you know I've heard people's like wow I don't know if I can be around them they're such holy people we weren't always that way I can name druggies I can name drunks I can name cigarette smokers I can name Amen Oh womanisers I can name all kinds of stuff they think the harlots and everything
