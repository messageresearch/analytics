just a moment Jesus today is a wonderful day in your presence is a day you made you've ordained this moment you've called us to this time how thankful we are for Grace today the favor on our lives Mercy that endures mercies that are even new every morning and today Lord we accept those mercies and by faith we just reach out and claim what belongs to us we're your children Lord we have gathered in your presence we're here Lord in your name and you said that you would gather with us where two or more gathered you'd be there so we know you're present Lord but not only do we know by the word but we know by experience we have felt you we've witnessed you as you moved among the congregation as you anointed songs and now Lord we're asking you to anoint the word as it goes forth Lord we can only do so much as humans but Lord if you just help us as we step aside and you'll use the gift of God that's in our lives and minister to Hearts today I know that lives will be touched healed and delivered God I pray Lord for all of the requests that was read and there was many Lord did you just reach out to those today some of them are listening in and they're they're needing a touch from you Lord some of them are shut in not able to come and assemble together and they're needing a touch and I just pray Lord that you'll come their way you're not confined in one body today as far as the man of Galilee but you are there dwelling among your people by your spirit pastor by their way today bring healing bring Deliverance bring joy in their hearts bring them to understand and know that you watch over them if your eyes on the sparrow you sure care for them now anoint us Lord as we look into the word today as I said I'm only human I can only do so much I can read what's Lord the the things that I have placed upon and and pinned down lord I I can I can read those things the scriptures that you've written and I know you're going to anoint that because it's your word Lord and your spirit will follow that word as it goes forth as we speak it and it'll move mountains it'll cause us to take wings to fly over our troubles I ask in the name of Jesus today bless your children God meet the needs of your people around the world the word doesn't get old is this just fresh today and Lord even if it's months later they'll hear this message may it Inspire their hearts to believe and the the spirit just follow the word to their hearts I ask it in Jesus name amen amen God bless you amen isn't his presence wonderful I love him this morning amen I love you I appreciate all of you for being here today if you'll turn with me to Matthew chapter 17 we're going to get right into the word today we have the communion service following this service today so we want to welcome all of you today in the wonderful name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen good to have the greens here today God bless you see you here and different ones I I hope when you every one of you when you leave from here you fell blessed amen strengthened moved by the spirit of God God knows you too God bless you amen good to have you in this service of the Lord today Matthew chap 17 and verse 14 we're going to read from and when they had come to the multitude there came to him a certain man kneeling down to him and saying Lord have mercy on my son for he is lunatic and sorely vexed for often time he falleth into the the fire and often to the water and I brought to him th him to thy disciples and they could not cure him then Jesus answered and said oh faithless and perverse generation how long shall I be with you how long shall I suffer you bring him hither to me and Jesus rebuked the devil and he departed out of him and the child was cured from that very hour and then came the disciples to Jesus apart and saidh could we not cast him out and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say into this mountain remove hence To Yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible to you amen God bless you can be seated I'd like you to turn to several more scriptures today um that I want to read that is along this same line of thought and I do this because we do have um you know didn't want you to stand in a long time so let's just go to Mark 11 and we're going to read from verse 12 today as well and then I have one over in Luke and John uh that we'll go to to today as we just kind of read some of these scriptures and prepare our hearts for the communion ahead and verse 12 says and on the tomorrow when they were come from Bethany he was hungry and see in a fig tree of far off having leaves he came if happily he might find anything therein and when he came to it he found nothing but leaves for the time of figs was not yet and and Jesus answered and said unto it no man eat fruit of thee Hereafter forever and his disciples heard it now down to verse 20 and in the morning as they passed by they saw the fig tree dried up from the roots and Peter called remembrance calling to remembrance said un him Master behold the Fig Tree which thou curses is withered away and Jesus answered and said unto them have faith in God for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith therefore I say unto you whatsoever things you desire what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and ye shall have them and then turn with me to Luke chap 17 and verse 5 and we're going to read from this passage of scripture now we've come from Matthew to Mark now Luke and the apostles said unto the Lord increase our faith and the Lord said if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say to this s sycamine tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you and then go with me to John 14:12 and let's read from there very familiar scripture to us as Believers and I have another passage to read from John verely verily I say to you he that believeth on me how many are believers this morning the works that I do shall he do also and Greater Works than these shall he do because I go unto my father and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name I will do it and then go with me to chapter 15 and verse 7 and we'll read this this scripture together and then go to the message if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you what what powerful scriptures we have read this morning amen what what wonderful words that have been left for us in this day and this hour and I believe that are really pertinent for this time that we're in and I want to speak today on the mountain movers the Greater Works and maybe I'll speak more than once on this but we're just kind of going to go into some things today as we um consider these scriptures now Jesus as a second Adam of course what he spoke happened and and of course in in one sense Jesus was limited in that he could only do that which the father showed him to do and secondly there were things that he had to work against in his realm that of which he was working because the Earth was upon a curse and so you know he could not at this moment change us all back to young people and take away all trouble from the world because it was not that time of his work of redemption he would start with the soul of man and bring the kingdom of God within and promise you know a greater Kingdom to come but in yet he would walk in this realm of Kingdom Life and walking in this realm he would he would control the Demonic world he control the demons that would would get in winds he would control the winds and the waves uh and he would uh multiply fishes and Loaves and he would do everything like calling back from the dead or Healing The Sick he would show the power of his kingdom as you know as as he immediately began to go out and Minister and the first thing he began to do was cast out Devils showing that there was a kingdom that was coming that was greater than that Kingdom that was presently there and of course the Earth that he lived Liv upon as I said was different from the one that the first Adam lived upon there was no curse in Eden you see as I said the work of Jesus was to lift the soul of man from The Curse of sin and to take men who were born in sin and shapen in iniquity and make them into being sons of God with power and authority against Satanic rulers of this world now brother brandham and the um the great sermon of Christ the mystery shows us the plan of God how that God would reveal himself in a threefold um Revelation or three-fold purpose of his Plan of Redemption and it would be first to reveal himself in Christ so he would show in Christ what men and women were to be in God's kingdom and and I I want you to to stop for a moment and and bear in mind the kingdom is is coming but the kingdom is already here the kingdom is here in that we are people of that Kingdom in that that we have received the Holy Spirit of God in our life and the King sits upon the throne of our heart his kingdom has come within us the kingdom of God is within you that is the domain of the Holy Ghost and it is birth you into the citizenship of Heaven now so you see he would first reveal himself in Christ and we can see in Christ his attitude toward the sick we can see in Christ his attitude when he came and and faced demonic Powers he cast them out we see his attitude toward the lost in that he came to seek and to save that which was lost so whatever attitude was in Jesus Jesus Christ and shown in Jesus would be also shown in the other Sons and Daughters of his kingdom because remember he he did not just come in order for us to see God um you know just manifested and and then go away but he came to birth sons and daughters in his kingdom people who would be of his same genus of his same seed of his same life have his same power reside in within them and so you see in this great sermon of Christ and mystery he would he he explains that we first first he would reveal himself in Christ and then he would want to get preeminence in the people and of course he gets that preeminence by us being born again and the King sitting upon the throne of our hearts and then of course then you take them back to Eden so you see his three-fold purpose first reveal himself in Christ second to reveal him to get preeminence into the people his bride and then take them back to Eden this is God's great plan now there's a great misconception today that we're not to go back to Pentecost but rather we are to go back to Eden and when I say Pentecost I want you to remember we're talking about the book of Acts we're talking about the acts of the Holy Spirit we're talking about an Acts 2 experience and so there's a misconception that we are not to go back to an Acts 2 experience but rather to go back to Eden and and yet that is God's goal it is true God will have an Eden upon the Earth for a great Millennial Reign but you see the only way for man to get there is by first going to back to Acts 2 back to Pentecost where God indwells man through the baptism of the Holy Ghost everyone will go back to Eden and and everyone who will will they can only do it by going through that acts two experience it is the the door it is the the doorway that Peter held the keys to to open up the key into the kingdom was to repentance through baptism in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and receive the gift of the Holy Ghost which baptizes you into the kingdom of God where you become Kingdom hirs and citizens of the Kingdom now it's without argument that before the world is burned off and cleansed for the Millennium that Elijah is to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers this is a job job of the message it was to turn our hearts back to the faith of the apostolic Fathers as he said in birth pains read Malachi 4 and see if we're not supposed to have a message in the last day that had turned the hearts of the children back to their fathers back to the original Pentecostal message word by word and he says Brothers we are here this is what the message is about it's about turning your heart it's about bringing you back to the faith it's about restoring you to sunship it's about preparing a bride for for uh to to meet the bridegroom now but you see first he would restore man from his Fallen condition and establishing himself as the king in our hearts and eventually the Millennium and then once again the lion were laid down by the lamb and nothing shall H or destroy in my Holy Mountain but it's a bit precautious to say we're already back to Eden amen that's a bit precocious to say that because we're not there Amen in fact it's still a ways off amen there's a before there can be a millennium there has to be a resurrection amen there has to be the change of our bodies there has to be a Rapture there has to be a married supper of the lamb and then you know we come back in Revelation 19 to take the world over again the righteous walk out on the ashes of the wicked so we you see all of this has to be before we can get back to a full Eden condition but right now we operate in the realm of the Holy Ghost even though we operate in Fallen bodies and we will live in a fallen world and we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and and and powers of darkness and spiritual wickedness in high places and and I want you to say to you we don't do that without victory but there is a Victorious prde of Jesus Christ who is an overcomer in this day now you know when originally before man then the Earth was in an Eden condition and as king of the earth Adam spoke and he dressed the garden and nature obeyed his command God gave him dominion over the fish of the sea the foul of the air he gave him power to dress the garden now he would not do this by the sweat of his brow that would be a part of the curse that would come because of the Fall he would do this as Jesus did by the power of the word the second itam shows us that Jesus controlled you know controlled the the winds and the waves they obeyed him they obeyed Adam in the beginning amen all of that was all subject to him because he's a Son of God now but when man sinned the Earth fell with him and Adam lost dominion and Satan then takes his place as the prince of the power of atmospheres and man sold himself into sin and became subservient to the devil to sin to disease and sickness and and so you see when when man sinned it was like he crossed a great Chasm and and there was um as he crossed it there was no way to get back to God there was no way for Redemption every everything he had put himself in death on this side and and now he is there on the side he's now subject to the elements that he once controlled the wind and the waves and and the the storms now instead of uh him controlling it they controlled him just like the weather does today it controls you it'll control your mood it'll control the atmosphere about you it'll control what you do everything else is is and storms come and all of these things is because man talking about Adam gave that up and lost dominion and Satan becomes The Prince and the power of the air and he becomes the prince of this world Jesus calls him that he also becomes the God of this evil age which becomes worshiped by millions millions doing his his bidding now so he put himself by you know in in death on the side and he left himself no way back and so what God did because it was not yet time for the Messiah to come the Redeemer to come God gave them a temporary fix as it was a sacrifice a blood that he would receive th this because he said the day you eat thereof that day you die and so here a lamb would die in their place and through that Lamb's blood man could have fellowship with God but only with blood between them now I want you to remember there's coming A Day friends where we will fellowship with god without blood between us amen there's coming a time in the in the in the ages ahead in the Eternal ages ahead that there will be no blood between us there will there will be no veil of blood between us we'll stand there face to face with God but right now we have to have the blood between us now as we as we see this on one side you know he's a Son of God he's an offspring of God one side of the gasm he's a was an offspring of God uh in he had inheritance of the earth he could control nature he could speak into existence he was a Creator himself he was he was an offspring of God stop it for just a minute let's just go back in our thinking you know um dogs give birth to dogs cats give birth to cats humans give birth to humans God when he gives birth what does he give birth to another God Amen a little God a Son of God an offspring of God Amen God life is Multiplied amen so you see this is why the Bible said you know even of the prophets you are God's because the word of the Lord came to them now so you see on one side he's he's a Son of God he's an all springing from God he his inheritance is um of the earth he can control nature he can speak into existence he's a Creator himself but on the other side you know when he crossed the chasm and here comes this void between him and God he's separated from his sunship he's a sinner by Nature he's under the hands of De and Dominion of Satan and God took a sacrifice the chemistry of a blood and you know and yet the blood of bulls and goats could not could not remit sin it would only cover sin so the remembrance was there it's like if you had a red spot on your hand you cover it with wide the red is still there but you know it's just covered over with something you see there's still a a remembrance of it but you see here again God did something when he came he provided a bleach for sin amen his blood was of greater power than that of blood of bulls and goats you said well brother Tim you know under the blood of bulls and goats a illegitimate child couldn't come in the congregation of the Lord for 10 Generations you know I I found out you know just studying some a little bit on genealogy that after 10 after about 10 Generations they cannot pick up any jeans coming from there and so for 10 Generations they can enter into the congregation of the Lord think of that but it's not so with the blood of Jesus the blood of Jesus I don't care if it's one generation away it doesn't matter if you're illegitimate born you don't know who your father is doesn't matter amen nothing that's right nothing of that is brought in the remembrance of God the bleach of God's blood so eradicate sin and yes you can go in the Rapture Hallelujah now you said oh brother Tim they can't make it in if they wern't born under sacred ceremonies of matrimony they can't make it in let me tell you if the blood of Jesus cannot take away that sin that you didn't even do it does not have the power it's no more better than the blood of bulls and goats it couldn't take away sin but this Blood removes every stain of sin no matter whether you did it your grandfather did it your mother did it doesn't matter the Gen genealogies before it's all wiped away and you are of a new gen amen you your old genus passes away you're no longer the son of so and so and so and so or daughter of so and so and so and so you recognize I am a son or daughter of almighty God I have been birth into his kingdom I'm his child and God Don't Make No Junk and ain't one of your names he'll ever take off The Book of Life the Lamb's Book of Life nothing read Romans 8 nothing can separate you from the love of God Amen he he's oh you say well brother Tim I've strayed way away from God he's going to go out after you goodness and Mercy's on your Trail he gonna find you somewhere he not g to leave you where he found you either he gonna lift you up out of that muck and restore you as a son or daughter of God now so then that sin is like putting into a tub of bleach and the coloring of sin when confessed sin goes into the bleach of God's blood the blood of Jesus well you know try to find it and when the coloring of sin goes back through the mediators and down to time until it hits the accuser and it lays on Satan unto the day of judgment who is he that condemned you certainly not God and the one who is trying to condemn you the very things that he's condemning you of lays back on his head and he will burn in hell for it and not [Applause] you that makes you The sinless Virtuous bride of Jesus Christ you never did it in the first place and again what was his first place his mind before the world began and the good thing about it is he can't change his mind about you what God thought no matter how low you are what God thought of you amen he's got to take and bring you up to matches what he thought and what did he think think just look in the word tells you over and over what he thinks of you so what happens to the sun once your sins are plunged in the bleach blood of Christ your sins you know lay on the accuser until the day of judgment but what happens to you as a son you become in perfect fellowship with the father again I I I want you to get that perfect fellowship with the father again standing on the other side of the chasm and let me just say it the chasms even done away it's totally obliviated and God do ever even remember there was a Chasm or you ever was separated from it cuz you always were his and you are his and you stand there not as a son with a past BL BL but a son or daughter of God without blemish so you come in perfect fellowship with no remembrance of sin against sh no stain of sin can be found anywhere you're free just as a Clorox could break up that ink until it couldn't be found no more and sent back to whatever form it was even so your sins once plunged in the blood of Jesus it breaks up through the blood of the mediator he so destroys it until there's not a shred of evidence against you I I know some of you are sitting there thinking well uh that that would take a a long long time sister jeie you were in the prayer line and three or four people right in front of you their sins called out you're Desiring a baby but if you'll give up that smoking God will give you that desire and then she comes along after as she repents and it can't be found no accusation no word same Angels there come on same discernments there same word is there same power is there and it finds nothing but just blessings just passing on a blessing that blessing still on your life today Hallelujah for he said I'll never leave you or I'll never forsake you and the same one that forgave your sins healed your body Hallelujah that's our God so it don't take a long time it takes one moment of confessing and believing sincerely say God I've been wrong forgive me so when sin is confessed and been dipped into the blood man or woman has been dipped into the blood of Jesus Christ we the blood is the Holy Ghost let's stop for a minute and explain when we talk about the blood we're talking about the spirit because we do not have a vial we do not have a vial of of blood like we have this vial of oil here we don't have a vial of blood that each one of them gets a touch of the blood amen but what do we have the Holy Spirit which is the life of the blood comes back upon you that's what we're doing when we anoint you with oil as the Bible said we are anointing you as a type as a symbol of the Holy Spirit and placing that between you and the sickness and the trouble that's causing that is that is upon you are you with me it's it's an action to cause a reaction but we don't have a vial of blood like I got this bottle of oil amen we have the Holy Spirit and when he comes into you you he annihilates sin and he'll even stand between you and sickness Hallelujah now so when a man or woman is dipped into the blood if once they when they when they're baptized into the spirit it kills all symptoms of sin and every molecule of sin goes back to the devil and is laid on him to the day of judgment where his eternal destination will be thrown into Lake of Fire and the chasm is bridged and never to come in remembrance again and a man stands Justified as a Son of God Justified means declared righteous now Moses would come under the the blood of the of that temporary blood that was given that could never take away sin Hebrews tells us the blood of bulls and goats could never take away sin and yet it is something now and let me just stop here and explain all of the Old Testament Saints would go into place called Abraham's bosom it would be a place also called Paradise and they would go into this place and they had to wait there until the Redeemer came that could deal with sin because the blood of bulls and goats only covered sin and only made a way for them to enter into this place until the real lamb would come now this is why John would come and say behold or look the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world because the blood of bulls and goats couldn't do it now Moses though standing under that blood he's under that Covenant and under that blood he can have fellowship with God under that blood with that blood between him he can operate in Realms a as as a as a as as a son of God and Moses under the blood of bulls and goats his blood can never take away sin but covered to the Messiah the Redeemer come but with his confession in the word of God God could take that simple man and put his words in his mouth and he proved he was Jehovah's servant for he would walk out there and Jehovah spoke to him by Vision he walked out stretched his arms his hands toward the East and and God spoke to him it's God's thought God God used this man so God spoke to him and he says go stretch out your that rod in your hand toward the East and say flies and Moses under the blood of bulls and goats walked out there with and took that stick reached toward the East and said thus sayith the Lord they come flies and walk back now it's already been spoke now remember when a word is released it can't return to God void see he walks on back it's already spoke it's a thought now it's spoke now it's expressed it's a word of God then then it it's come into human lips and a simple man under the blood of bulls and goats now then first thing you know maybe there's just a little green fly starts buzzing around don't look like any change next thing you know they're five pounds per yard amen why what was it was the word of God spoken through Moses the Creator because of the blood he was standing in the presence of God and his words wasn't his own words and so he's so again that's what Jesus said in John 15 if you abide in me and my words abide in you now stop a minute I want to I want to wipe something out of your mind because the reformers taught that abiding in Christ was spending so much time in study and prayer on your knees consecrating yourself and you know if you did that enough you could ask what you will you know and it shall be done but that is not what abiding in Christ is for him to abide in you and his words abide for you to abide in him and his words abide in in you is it comes by and through the baptism of the Holy Ghost so every one of you who are spirit filled people today are right here abiding in Christ and he abides in you there is a Unity takes place you become one with God Inseparable from God come on nothing can separate you from him amen read Romans 8 again neither Li you know life or death nor principalities or powers or things to come or things in the past nothing can separate [Music] you so if you abide in me and my words abide in you then ask what you will and it shall be be given to you now brother brandom asked a question after saying these kind of things is where is the church standing at and I want you to think of it a moment where where is it you're standing at if you've been filled with the spirit would you have if you have the Holy Ghost within you would you do if you are offspring of the Creator which you are if you are an offspring of God a little God which you are then you if you abide in me and my words abide in you ask what you will and it shall be given to you so where is the church standing at now you know there again Moses under the blood of bulls and goats Let There Be frogs maybe there wasn't a frog in the country in the hour's time they're 10 foot deep in places now what is it it was God the Creator hiding himself in a simple man now so we asked ourselves a question if the blood of bulls and goat which can only cover could put a man in position to speak the creative word of God and bring flies into existence and why would we stumble at The Bleach of Jesus Christ blood who could speak a squirrel or something to in existence you see you see you don't want to stumble over Simplicity you you make this something hard you are a son or daughter of God that's who you are now and so if you Mark 11:22 if you say to this mountain you know if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said this is Bible amen so where is the church standing where are you standing where does that place you I'm going to tell you where we are in this age we're on the cusp of the Rapture it is the hour of exploits where the greatest and I want to just make this plain the greatest massive Divine Healing movement that's ever been is is about to take place I'm not talking about okay I'll go buy me the biggest tent and I'm going to have the biggest Revival and we're going to got have the greatest people no that's not what we're talking about we're talking about the most massive greatest Divine Healing move that there's ever been are you with me that is about to take place where even those who you can't find a a dimes worth of their body left is going to to come back together again yes sir and stand on their feet and the de of The Seven Ages from Calvary all the way to now is going to rise again and not only that but you if you're gray-headed you know you got artificial joints you got this you got that you're going to drop all of that you're going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and guess what it'll you'll never get sick again right now we pray for the sick and you'll get sick and die or whatever if you run up your time on the Earth but there well in that you it'll be a Divine Health that will sweep over you and you will be changed you'll never have a cold a headache a trouble a sorrow amen and we are on the cusp of the greatest massive Divine Healing that has ever taken place you say it's all over I say it hadn't even begun yet good now we see this age that we're living in and we were told and how can I overcome that it's one of the grandest of all ages this leoan is the grandest of all Church ages because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity I mean if we went into the seventh seal and we see the breaking of the silence there which I won't spend a lot of times there but just saying you know it's there that the incense is offered and and and mixed and and goes up into the presence of God and prayers are answered that have been waiting for his coming and his end time plan is all set in motion and there ain't enough the devil can do to stop it once it's open it can't be closed back up come on so it's the greatest it is the greatest age because it's the ending of time and the blending of Eternity now what what I even saying there is because you know if it's blending that means that you know that we are moving coming more like that eternal right so rather than less Faith less healing less miraculous the closer we get to it we are blending into it becoming more like the Eternal so don't expect less expect more amen we already see it now so let's just expect more amen we know as far as the world you hadn't seen nothing yet the worst is yet to come well for you the worst is not yet to come The Best Is Yet To Come amen we are not going down we're going up you know read read revelation chapter 12 Satan is cast down and as he does a people ascends so you're not a part of the Fallen World you're part of the ascending world so one blends to the other and we're standing on the cusp or the edge of Eternity on the cusp of Eden where all wrongs will be wred where full Sons speak and their words are back we full sons are robe position adopted with a ring of authority that and has that ring of authority and take every Power that Satan has away from him and that's not something just coming that is here that's what's been released so markk 11:24 says whatsoever you whatever you say to this mountain move and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you said will come to pass you can have what you said and brother brandham reads that scripture and he again asks the question where is the Pentecostal church at today you don't realize that confess truly confess sin amid sins it builds a bridge across this Chasm that takes a man back in the presence of his creator and makes him a Son of God Amen he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also there you are barely I say to you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what You' said come to pass you can have what you said glory to God it's my God revealing himself in humility God taking a humble Sinner and cleansing him by his blood and dropping that confessed sin into the Clorox bleach of the blood of the Son of God and putting his own life into that man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost how many believes You' received that so he asked the question then if we have the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost what's wrong with us when Elijah dropped the robe for Elija he's got a double portion of it Jesus said the works that I do shall you do also and greater than less shall you do for I go to my father what's wrong church and I I just want to say you know the question is asked at the river where is the god of Elijah well the answer is he's right here in Sons and Daughters of God come on I mean you're looking for him to come you're looking for a move Yonder but he's already here in bright form where is he he's here now take what has been given to you and strike the river if there's something uncrossable in your life a sickness a trouble a trial some child out of the out of the way go and take and strike it with that mantle the holy spirit that has been left to you from Jesus Christ and strike that River and walk across you're not going to drown in this you're not going to fail you're not going to have to get a rad booat and get across amen you'll walk across cross your River now this is the hour of perfect Faith come on why would it be preached perfect faith if that's unattainable if we couldn't have it or if we don't have it I thought Malachi 4 was to turn our hearts back to Faith and why wouldn't it be a perfect faith well when we get it no we have it I'm trying to bring this to for you to understand you know it's not something just for the for the past it's not something for the future it's something now yes sir now faith gets you into the family of God and makes you a literal son or daughter of God faith makes it possible to please God you know when we believe it releases God's righteousness Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him as righteousness so when we believe we're righteous amen Faith makes it possible to please God remember Enoch had to please God to go in a Rapture Faith makes that possible amen but but faith gets you into the family of God and makes you a literal son and daughter of God I want I want to take two takeaways from the scripture first John 5 And1 whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that Lo that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him so two takeaways I want you to get we are born of God therefore we're begotten of him so you are now a begotten son the Bible says now we are the sons of God so 1 John 3 And1 says look this is the love or look here's the love the the love first 1 John 31 but what manner of love or here's the love that the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not but beloved now somebody say now we are the sons of God it doesn't appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is I like that now amen I really like that because it places you right now as sons of God not future right now and yet it don't all appear yet what we shall be and you can look at yourself but I got this imperfection and I've got that no it's not so much an imperfection it's you are growing you are rising and as you rise there you become more like him are you with me amen you begin to look more like your father every day you begin to behave more like your father every day but now we are Sons amen yet it doesn't appear yet what we shall be but we know this but we know this though that we know this when we see him we will be just like him amen I may not be complete and mature and and everything and image yet but I will because when I see him I'm going to be just like him Hallelujah there won't be any Misfits in heaven amen will everyone be Sons and Daughters of God with attributes that look like our father amen now once you are in the family everything that belongs to the family is yours let me say that again once you're in the family then everything that belongs to the family is yours now it's like in Luke 15:31 he's speaking to the brother the prodal here and he said to him son thou art ever with me and all that I have is thine so this is this is sunship amen I you're always with me and everything I have is yours did this this is the order of sunship Amen I'm always with you I'll never leave you or forsake you amen and all that I have is yours now you see he could add the fatty cap anytime he wanted he could add the ni's robe anytime he wanted can add the ring on his finger anytime he want he can have a party in the celebration anytime he want all that I have is thine every promise in the word is yours it's your inheritance it belongs to you you're in the family the Bible said and I'm reading this from the Amplified but in Romans 8:17 if we're his children then we are his heirs also and Heirs of God and fellow HS with Christ sharing in his inheritance with him only we must share his suffering if we're to share his glory so he tells us we we're his children and we're also HS again everything that God has is ours go to Ephesians chapter 1 and three and and again I I share this translation praise be to God for giving us through Christ every possible spiritual benefit as citizens of Heaven so as a citizen of Heaven amen you have every possible spiritual benefit amen come on verse three says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings where in Heavenly places in our position in Christ as a son as a daughter we have been blessed with all spiritual blessings Hallelujah you're blessed amen now that we're in the family we must take our place as sons and daughters and act like what we are and have amen and the moment you received God's Sweet Holy Spirit you became a possessor of eternal life and everything in it are connected with it is yours so he says in first John 51 he says and this is a record that God has given us eternal life and this life is in his son so first of all it's his it is the life of Jesus Christ chist is coming to you that's what the Holy Ghost is it is the literal life of Jesus Christ it's not a jump it's not a dance it's not a run in the aisle it's not a tongue is not a gift it is his life so he has given us eternal life and that life is in his son he that hath his son ha life and him that ha not the Son of God had not not life and these things that written to you that you believe on the name of the son of God that you might know that you have eternal life God's own life and that you may believe on the name of the son of God so a believing one possesses the life of God within his soul and makes him literally actually a child of God we're not going to be children of God we're not someday going to be offsprings now we are the sons and because we are now everything Heaven owns is ours come on everything the life of Jesus is in us not a third person the person God himself come dwelling in you deity tabernacling in your life that's who you are that's what sunship means now it's not a question of Faith it's a question of have taken our place hello of acting the part of enjoying our rights and privileges as Sons and Daughters of God living according to unseen realities where we're walking by faith not by sight where we're looking at that other dimension not looking at where we're at remember we're in the greatest sinful age there ever was so it's all obvious what's out here but we got to walk according to an Unseen World we are looking to the Unseen and what was seen and the Unseen come on the word tells you what was seen in the Unseen so we we can look in there and we can look in the Unseen and we can see and that's what brother bradam taught us he said you know you set before yourself a vision of a perfectly healed person and step by step you walk into that what is it you're looking at the Unseen what does not appear now when we look at what we see we're not looking at what we see we're looking to the Unseen and we're seeing ourselves perfectly well healed delivered set free now after you're born again you do exercise Faith but it's an unconscious Faith but brother brandham told us it's a faith just like getting in your automobile and starting up there and you know hitting the button and starting it up what is it it's it's you you do do that unconsciously you expect it to happen and when you're a son or daughter of God you you you know you just expect it to happen you expect miracles CU God is a god of Miracles you expect healing because it's promised to you as a child of God you expect Deliverance you expect salvation for your CH children come on you expect it amen because you it's an unconscious faith we know God's going to do this this is his word it's already done you don't think of your faith or how much you do or don't have we're not to be occupied this is brother brandom's word on a on a Prayer card uh you know his prayer letter that he sent out prayer CLA with said we're not to be occupied with our feelings or our symptoms or our faith or our lack of faith now here comes it here we come do I have enough faith for this we're not to be occupied with that that's not that that will hinder you where you're at don't look to see if your faith is strong enough for this you don't not like David he didn't look to see if his slingshot would would would work perfectly amen he had faith in almighty God Amen he was trusting in the god of Israel amen his eye was not on how big the giant was but on how big his God was and that's where your eyes has got to be is on how big is my God how able is he to save oh my children brother he can reach further down than what you can look up so look up to him amen from the ends of the Earth look up to him and be saved amen so we are not to be occupied with our feelings or our symptoms or our faith or our lack of faith but only what God Said amen the simple way he said is to begin calling the things we have prayed for ours so you begin right there the things you prayed for that's mine I already possess it it's mine amen and you thank God for them before you feel them or see the answer so you go right on your unconscious there's no thought we oh it won't work today amen you know I'm Out Of Tune I'm out of touch you know my faith isn't big enough that's not what you think on you think on this one thing my God's big enough my God is able my God has said this I'm just taking him at his word and the Hand of Faith reaches out and takes it amen amen I don't have to beg for it I don't have to plead for it you don't have to coers God into giving it to you amen you don't have like Smith Wigglesworth said one time said men have become excellent Beggars and poor Believers quit begging God and start believing God and start confessing that and look to the Unseen not looking at your symptom not looking at how you feel but what did God say occupy yourself with one thing saying my God is able my God gave this to me I am his son I am blood wash Blood Bought I belong to him this is mine it's my inheritance it's my promise and that's all I'm looking at I don't care I'm not looking to see if symptoms got worse or better I'm not looking and see if my child's doing better today or worse I'm not looking at circumstances I'm looking at a Divine promise now where you will stagger is when you start looking at the problem look at God's word I'm the Lord God that heals of all thy diseases and they shall be there and their offsprings with them your children will be blessed in the land come on all of these promises that lays there in the scripture they're yours amen he promises the Holy Ghost to everyone that ask him I won't disappoint you and give you a fish you ask for a fish I give you a serpent I ask for bread I'll give you a stone I won't disappoint you I'm a good father I'll give the Holy Ghost to everyone that ask him so we come to the attitude with God you made the promise and I'm just going to take it I'm just going to reach out and say it's mine thank you for it Hallelujah those would you know seeking the Holy Ghost would just come with that attitude and say thank you Jesus thank you Lord the promise is mine there's no way you will keep it from me my sins are under the blood I am a Blood Washed child and I am claiming that promise fill me with the Holy Ghost God is obligated to his [Applause] word part of your repentance is repenting of considering your own problems bigger than God your own sins bigger than God bigger than Grace you don't think of your faith how much you do or don't have I don't know if I have enough faith for this no you don't occupy with that you won't put your eyes on one thing look into the Unseen you have to deny what you're seeing here oh yeah it's evident your eyes are saying and you know you got problems you're sick there's there's there's trouble amen I mean you know we're not going in this fantasy world and saying oh it ain't there it's there but we're not looking at that the Bible said Abraham considered not his body now dead nor the deadness of Sarah see he didn't consider that he didn't put it in the equation he looked at one thing God said I'm going to have a son and I'm just going to walk with him till I have it I'm going to walk right into it it's coming if it ain't today it'll be tomorrow if it ain't tomorrow it'll be next week if it ain't next week it'll be next week but whatever is on the way I'm looking at the Unseen God says it's already here it's already done it's already finished now so we're not to be occupied with our feelings our symptoms our faith or lack of it but only with what God Said the simple way is begin to call things that we've prayed for hours thank God before we feel them or see the answer God is faithful he cannot deny himself the word of God says when you pray believe so mark 11:24 tells us that we we must believe that we have the answer even though we don't see it yet nor feel it yet 1 John 5:14 whosoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know we have our petitions that we have desired of him look at what he's saying he he says when we ask we already know we got it because he said ask anything in my name and I'll do it now God said faith is not that's Hebrews 11:1 faith is not faith shall be or that would be only hoping for and hope isn't faith hope is an expectation but it's not Faith you see is is hoping that somehow it'll come to be but faith says it's already is you see you see so faith not shall be for that would be only hoping for and not present as believing and having faith begins now now so you think of God's ability his provision in you through the new birth you think of his faithfulness to make his word good to your experience but for many of us our focus is on our faith or the lack of it rather than God's ability in US of his Provisions for us through the new birth you're not to think of your faith of how much you have or don't have in fact the matter is if you're weak you are to say I'm strong exactly right that's what you to say you are declare in the face of weakness that you're strong so you're not to be occupied with feelings or symptoms of of or faith or lack of it but only what God Said So we live by faith but it's an unconscious faith when God tells you something you don't think of your faith like I said you lack of it think of God's ability and provision simply take him at his word because we know this he cannot lie if God says something it is so it is so and if it was provided by the new birth you can have it you already have it you see again the Bible said in Galatians what is Galatians 2:20 that we live by the faith of the Son of God so I want to ask you when you're born again having been crucified with Christ never yet I live but not I but Christ liveth in me and the life I live now in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God so I am living this life with God's faith with the faith of Jesus if you have the life of Jesus and the nature of Jesus then you have the faith of Jesus so again what are you talking about your faith I got to check and see if my faith is good well are you born again well if you're born again well what kind of faith is that that is the faith of Jesus so do you have enough or not is the faith of Jesus enough for this or not now so if it was provided by the new birth which it is you have it that's right you don't have to you know anything provided by the new birth whether you know okay let's just stop for a minute you say well Divine Healing okay Jesus made it clear when the sanan woman came to him and asked for healing for her daughter now she was a woman outside the Covenant she she was not under the blood even of bulls and goats she was a heathen Pagan woman a Grecian woman from and and she's Phoenician and here she comes and she wants healing for her daughter so she's grievously vexed with the devil and Jesus said it is not right to give the children's bread are healing to dogs amen all right so he said now listen you're you're a gentile and this this bread healing belongs to those under the blood under the Covenant and at that time the Covenant was blood of bulls and goats that was the approach to God somebody with me now amen so healing is the children's bread so you're not asking for something that doesn't belong to you you are asking for something that is rightfully yours it's what the children eat the children get bread and if you're outside the Covenant and we'll have the right attitude and will'll just humble down and say like she did well but Master even dogs lick the crumbs that are under the master's table come on Amen I I even dogs get crumbs so if the dogs get crumbs that dogs get healing too so she placed herself in the line of receiving through her humility but I want you to know it rightfully belongs to you you can have bread anytime you ask it he Saidi a good father if you ask me bread you think I'll give you a serpent a snake you think I'll give you a scorpion you think I'll give you bad some something bad now he said if you are evil father men and you know how to do good for your children you know what it means to be a good father what the heavenly father give you the Holy Spirit won't he give you that healing that miracle that desire he wants to do it he just says come knock and it'll be given to you come seek and you're going to find just ask me you're going to receive now so you simply take him at his word knowing he can't lie you know it was if it was provided by the new birth you have it you don't have to claim it by faith you already have it you you even you don't even have a right to it you have it it it's a it's a spiritual unseen reality you you don't have to believe for any of it you just need to act on it in other words right to check out that's all you have to do the money's there amen it's the posit in the Bank of Heaven Jesus Paid It All and there's enough it'll never run out brother Brandon would say you know are you like a little mouse eating a grain a day going to allow and say I could better not take very much why you got a whole Grainery full you'll never run out eat till you're fat amen little fish in the ocean I better drink sparingly of this water I'll run out water one day you could never drink it up in in a million billion trillion fish lifetimes you cannot EX ex the goodness of God come on Amen you cannot exhaust his mercies cannot exhaust his grace I'm talking to you Sons and Daughters now so right to check out what was wrong with the isua what was wrong with the isua church they had the Holy Spirit but it was on their human spirit and they use it maybe just to blow the whistle dance around a little bit but I want to remind you we are beyond that we have the supernatural Supreme token now when I say we're beyond that I don't mean you can't blow it out the whistle no more I don't mean you don't dance and Shout I don't mean you don't rejoice in God but what I'm meaning is is that we have even more than that we can we can move that tra down the road now you see just like I I preached about the hour of true worship the other day and G Jesus said in John 4 the father is seeking such to worship him and to worship Him in spirit and in truth now many people have the spirit and they have no truth the other has truth have no spirit it's like a man that that has got money in the bank don't know how to write a check the other knows how to write a check got no money in the bank if you could ever get those two together and I want you to know this is the age this is the day that the two comes together amen we're not just all spirit and no truth all truth and no Spirit it comes together we're not just check writers and we don't have nothing in the bank and we're not just we're not just those who who say counts the money looks at it on paper man got I mean hey interest now I've got a million a billion uh you know just keep you rising and Rising but you don't know how to write a check you can't access it but you see it there promises are there that's in the word it's there but you don't know how to write the check this message is to bring it both together where that there is those who know who they are and what they have and know they can write a check if anytime now if you could just get them to recognize who they are get back to the full word of God with the baptism of the Holy Ghost it set the world a fire with a new Pentecostal Revival you see you know one one becomes word word word and have no spirit and then they they studyed the scripture and and and the quotes and the message and oh yeah we're sons of God they believe that but they don't have any faith with it others there got a lot of faith but they don't know their sons you see one is like one like I said one's not like one's got a money in the bank and but can't write a check the other can write a check got no money in the bank and brother Brandon said if you could just get the thing together till men and women could realize you that have been truly baptized in the Holy Spirit and you have the token to display you have every right to every Redemptive blessing that God promised everything that he promise is yours hold your token that's the Holy Ghost over your unwavering Faith as you pray and over his word faith in his word so then he says he he he he goes on and talks about this you know just like a Elijah and Elisha here Elisha received a double portion and so have we amen this is why he said Greater Works than these shall you do so you see he would draw parallel between Elijah and Elisha Jesus Christ and the church Elisha received a double portion of Elijah's Spirit symbolized by when the mantle came down and when the Holy Ghost came down on the day of Pentecost it was that mantle man years ago there was a man by the name of Ben Bryant he claimed to have the pillar of will the the pillow that William Bram slep on I don't know what he ever did with that pillow but he bragged about it and wagged it around and showed it around I have this pillow and I just say whoopy dooo but you don't have a pillow of some man' you have the mantle of Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost and it's not whoopy do it's wonderful Hallelujah it makes you realize I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God and now I take this cloak and I walked down to my River to the thing that's hindering my faith that's hindering me from crossing over into a promise and I smite it with that Holy Ghost here I am I'm a son or daughter of God Amen and I'm not afraid to ask for and believe in the Supernatural now we saw in this day we saw the son of man Ministry I we're talking about the ministry of Jesus Christ God repeated in our day exactly right we we've seen it to the point that some even thought he was Jesus Christ said well brother Tim that would be blasphemy of course it's Antichrist to deify brother brandham but it shows how close to the ministry of Jesus that he was it also identifies him as as that Elijah that was to come it identifies him as as John the Baptist they ask him are you the Christ are you the Messiah some would mistake John amen now the same thing you know some mistook him because they saw the ministry of Jesus Christ repeat now they ask him in question answers three and 64 brother brandom now brother brandom could look could could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that and he said one sense the word that's exactly the truth and another sense of the word it's Antichrist that's a difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ would be an anti Christ for that person of the Lord Jesus Christ is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high and will come again in great power and glory and I don't know what people do who say he's not on the seat of Mercy because brother Brandon places him right there the person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of the Majesty on high and will come again in great power and Glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him it's exactly the truth and you become Christ you remember my message on Messiahs the word Messiah means the anointed one now if you are if you have the Holy Spirit you become the anointed one and see then there's all kinds of anointed ones so there's not just one anointed one yeah let me stop here for a minute the focus anymore is on false anointed ones if you're anointed you got to be false no the anointing don't make you false you were false and false seed and even an anointing Came Upon you but the anointing is not false it was sent for the true the rain is sent for the wheat but the tears get it too nothing wrong with the rain nothing wrong with the anointed we are the anointed one of this last day just as Jesus was anointed now you are anointed just as we saw brother brandom anointed now you're anointed and this is what he says then there's all kinds of anointed one here they are all throughout this building anointed one standing here on the platform and sitting here behind me anointed ones you're anointed yes you're placed you're positioned now so he said it was so beautifully typed in Elijah and Elisha when Elisha was taken up Elijah the old Prophet going home and and um when he was tired and weary there was a chariot hooked up cross the river there to take him home on the horses of fire and you notice then when Elijah and Elisha crossed the river the school of the prophets was up there watching him and Elijah Elijah took his mantle struck the river what he did it divided he went cross and the young prophet he said the young Prophet what are you following me for what do you wish he said that a double portion of your spirit come upon me a double portion of that Mighty Prophet come upon me and he said you ask for a hard thing but if you see me when I go away then it'll come upon you so you can imagine how he watched that prophet and in that now in that day the prophet was a word for he was a manifestation of the word to the world and he knew there had to be a greater Ministry come because it required a greater thing and when Jesus was here on the earth he was Elijah these things that I do shall you do also and greater than these shall you do because I go to my father now what are you going to do watch him who is he the word watch him and when it comes to creation and things is true Jesus never straight out created anything and brought into existence he took substance first he took water made wine took bread and made more bread he took fish and made more fish but he promised that greater things would be done you see it's why it's a more evil day than it was when he was here it's still him but he's using your Tabernacle so right here in a more evil day God's doing greater things this is the age it's the time of the Greater Works note that we can do the Greater Works now many people thinks well we do the Greater Works we we spread we give out Bibles we uh we preach the gospel we uh we have great meetings and we we well you know like brother brandham said about it somebody said to him brother brandham you say greater than these shall we do well we preach the gospel that's greater he said well then just do the things Jesus did if you're calling out the greater work just do what Jesus did and then we'll talk about the Greater Works so you see the Greater Works is to continue it's it's like players in the symphony you've got to know what page you're on Amen are you walking in step with the Gospel of Jesus Christ or you on the right page of the symphony if you're on the wrong page days of Miracles are passed amen it was only for a certain season we're not in the season of it well you're on the wrong page we are not we're not on that page we have passed that there was a time in the ages where that was what was being preached days of Miracles of B but we're not on that page anymore God turned that page and he shows us he still heals he still delivers he still saves amen and this page if you're on the page the prophet was come on Amen you're going to see the Greater Works the signs to follow amen the power to move mountains because we are people who are mountain movers devil defeaters Overcomers in this last days call for this time in this dispensation to fulfill all the word that was written of a bride and it's not coming it's here you're on the beig Hallelujah yeah we got greater revelation we got greater knowledge but that knowledge just showed us how much more money there is in the bank amen it just it just let us know that there were things left for our age that God had in the bank in store that we got even more than what the other ages had and so there's more in there and if there's more in there there's more for me I can write out a check for it Hallelujah I tell you today you ought to get your pen out and you ought to write out a check and say I want this in the name of Jesus Christ I am a blood wash bloodb son or daughter of the Living God I accept that Divine promise it is mine and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against me Hallelujah because

as [Music] Savior filled with the spirit you're welcome to come and participate with us today I just wanted to remind you just a little bit about what we're going to be doing we're going to be taking the communion we're going to be taking unleavened bread and the wine which represents the BL blood and the body of the Lord and as we do we're going to have the the ushers bring you row by row and um we'll have two lines coming through and you'll go out the out the center the men will go over here to the right the ladies go to the left to go to foot washing those who do not want to participate in foot washing you can go just go back to your seat if you would like and just wait so as they are having foot washing they will be coming back in going to be worship and singing and so on and um so we're going to proceed further with this I want to talk about it just for a moment and I've explained this many times but for those of you that are not familiar I just want to share with you this situation that was in the Corinthian Church and as they would come together on the first day of the week which would be Sunday to honor the resurrection because that's what Christians did the Jewish people would come together on the seventh day which is Saturday and they would worship the Christians come together and they would Worship On the first day of the week and they would break bread and if you will remember originally the communion was a Passover meal so it was a full meal and they would have lamb that would be brought for household every house would have it and they would take of the unleavened bread and the wine there in their time of Passover so it would be a meal that they would have together as uh families would come together have the Passover dinner then they taking of the bread and the wine along with the Passover meal but when Jesus was at the last passover and he had Passover with his disciples at the end he would take bread and he would break it and he would say this is my body which is broken for you now we know on the cross not one bone of his body was broken that was prophecy but the way the bread was broken was is that his body would become broken in that he would come into the 120 in the upper room and from there others and all together we each one being a part of that body would all become one loaf we'd make up one loaf and so when you come to the communion table tonight you are this evening you are actually taking that and and pronouncing I am a part of the body of Christ now not a part of evening life light Tabernacle the body of Christ I'm a part of the body of Christ then Jesus Took the blood which he called the blood which was the life of the grape it had been squeezed out and he would take the the blood of the grape and he would drink it and he would pass it and said this is my blood so again the the wine would represent the very blood of God which is the holy spirit so when you take out the cup you are remembering not only am I part of the body but I have drank or received his life into me and you are testifying of that now in the book of Corinthians Paul sets all of this in order it had been a meal and he said to them he said now we got a a problem he said you know you're bringing your food you're all eating together and then we're taking the the communion breaking bread here but said you know one is hungry and the other is drunken and you say you know some have and some don't and you know you're shaming one another because they Rich has abundance and and the poor has little and you're shaming one another and he said don't you have houses to eat in so eat eat at home and don't despise the Church of God and shame them that have not and he said I can't Praise You In This because this isn't right what you're doing but I've got a solution so he says 1 Corinthians 11:23 I have received the Lord L that which I've delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me and after the same manner also he took the cup and when he had sep sayeth this cup is a new testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation himself not Discerning we're not playing church here this is for Real so if you've been living a double life don't come up here without having repented and being right with God because this has caused many are weak and sickly among you and many are they sleep they're dead see judgment has come upon them because he said if we would judge ourselves we wouldn't be judged so there would be no no need for sickness or death or things to come on us because of our double standard life if we judge ourselves and realize it we're not worthy to take it cuz we have not been living right but when we're judged we're chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world so he said wherefore my brother when you come together to eat t or wait one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home so this is what Paul said it in he changed it from having a meal together to a time where they would just have the bread and the wine to remember the Lord and would be part of their worship and that's what we're doing today furthermore we believe that another ordinance is foot washing and we take that from the words of Jesus in John Chapter 13 where that after the the supper being ended Jesus guarded himself with a towel and he began to wash the feet of the disciples and he showed himself to be a servant he humbled himself and washed the feet of fishermen and he he would commission us and tell us that now you do this too and you remember why you are really here is not to be served but to serve others so when you go to foot washing you remember the life of a Christian is one of humility of humbling to every word and promise of God and serving him with all your heart and in doing so loving and serving one another so Peter would say to Jesus said well you know you're not washing my feet I I'm you're not going to wash mine he said well if I don't wash it you'll have no part with me well then Peter changed his mind he said well I tell you wash my Wash Me from head to toe I I want to be fully committed and Jesus said no he that is washed and in that day they already had bath houses and everybody would be bathed and cleansed went through their purification to come to this Passover so he said he that's already had a bath doesn't need to have their whole body washed just their feet now there's a reason for this we have been washed we have been cleansed we have been pure but where we walk in the world where we walk in the paths of life where the disciples would walk from the bath house to the Passover room their feet would get dirty and when we walk in the paths of life we go through things troubles come Sorrows comes heartache comes but we as Believers are here to wash the dirt off of one another and encourage one another to be fully clean so if you've been washed you've been Sanctified you don't need your whole body wash just your feet you've been walking through the world let's just wash that off things that maybe we shouldn't have done or didn't do right let's just wash it all off let's just start out here a fresh and a new Passover or this communion service it's kind of like a new beginning it's a remembrance he died for me I receive his life I'm a part of his body I'm here to serve I'm here to be washed Wash Me Lord and let me as a brother encourage another and wash the dirt off of them God bless you as we come to the the table of the Lord this evening and what will happen we we'll have the musicians and Elders those that need to go first so we'll turn on some music here to start [Music] this but let me first have prayer over the bread the wine ask the deacons to join me [Music] here let's bow our heads together father today stands before me is this plate it has upon it the bread un leaven leaven is a type of sin in this case and it represents the unleavened body of the Lord without sin and that we are to live a life where that we do not habitually and continually sin but where that we obey you before me Lord is the cup the lives that has been squeezed out of the out of the grape how is called the blood of the grapes it represents your blood that was shed for us as we take it I pray that you'll sanctify the bread and the body and the blood and that you'll sanctify the believer as they come through today and may they walk in newness of Life serving you with all their heart in Jesus name amen amen
