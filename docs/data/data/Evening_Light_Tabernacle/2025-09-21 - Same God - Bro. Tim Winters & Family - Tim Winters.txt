========================================

[Music] I won't be discouraged. Even when I'm discouraged, I'll remind my soul of all you've done before. I won't be distracted even in the distraction. I will trust the one who's greater than the storm. Oh, I will trust the one who's greater than the storm. [Music] I don't need another reason. I don't need more convincing. The same God who made a way. The same God who's here today. Even in my darkest room. This will be the truth I'm holding. The same God who made a way is the same God who's here today. [Music] I won't be shaking. Even when I'm shaking, having done all I can do, I still will stand. [Music] &gt;&gt; And I will worship. &gt;&gt; Yes, I will worship. I will face whatever comes right in hand. I don't need another reason. I don't need more convincing. The same God who made a way. The same God who's here today. Even in our darkest moment, this will be the truth. I'm holding. The same God who made way. The same God who's here today. We believe. We believe you, Lord. If you're not done moving, then I'm not done waiting. If you're not done working, then I'm not done praising. &gt;&gt; If you're not done moving, then I'm not done waiting. If you're not done working, then I'm not done praising. You're moving so I'm not done waiting. I believe you're working. So I'm not done praising. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't need another reason. I don't need more convincing. The same God who made a way. The same God who's here today. Even in our darkest morning, this will be the truth I'm holding. The same God who made the way. The same God who's here today. I don't need another reason. I don't need more convincing. The same God made away. The same God who's here today. Even in our darkest moment, this will be the truth. I'm holy. The same God away. The same God who's here today. The same God. The same God who made a way. The same God who's here today. The same God. The same God made a way. The same God is here. And there is no one higher, no one greater, no one like our God. There is none more able. Christ our savior great and glorious. There is no one higher, no one greater, no one like our God. There is none more. Christ our savior, great and glorious. There is no one higher, no one greater, no one like our God. There is none more. Christ our savior. [Music] I don't need another reason. I don't need more convincing. The same God made a way. The same God who's here today. Even in my darkest moment, this will be the truth I'm holding. The same God made away is the same God who's here today. [Applause]
