where the prophecies are now being fulfilled and the word of god is now being made manifested in bride form and satan in all of hell is against the revelation that christ has come and he's here today in bride form and he's coming again we'll meet him in the air and ascend with him with all the resurrected saints it's been the promise of the ages but we are the ones upon whom the promise has come i pray lord today that you'll just move in a mighty way father that you'll move the man part out and just let us be an oracle of god and father that you'll also deal with here that you'll give them ears to hear what the spirit is saying may every person make a place in their heart to receive the word today if it's just getting a little rid of a little self or a little pride or little ambition or something that isn't right lord let it be that everything gets moved aside so that there's room for christ in their life i pray lord for healing for those that are sick deliverance for your children lord that you cause the weary hands that hang down to be raised lord you'll cause faith to be elevated so that it reached the level of the promise that you'll cause your people lord to be what they're called believers lord that they really believe i ask in the name of jesus that you'll bless your children that is assembled together today those around the world lord that are listening in father we ask that you would bless them in a mighty way some of them have written expressing their anticipation for this service today they've already met in their local churches and now it's across the world and their time is evening time i pray lord that as the message goes forth you'll stir their hearts to believe and to receive from you now in jesus name we ask these things as we open up the word today open up our hearts to receive in jesus name amen amen god bless you if you'll turn with me to chapter mark chapter 4 we'll read from the 26th verse and then we'll let you be seated man what wonderful hours that we're living in if you give me a little more sound up here there's none mark chapter 4 verse 26 and he said so is the kingdom of god as if a man should cast seed into the ground and should sleep and rise day night and day and the siege should spring and grow up he knoweth not how for the earth bringeth forth fruit of herself first the blade then the ear after that to full corn in the ear but when the fruit is brought forth immediately he putteth in the sickle because harvest is come amen may god bless you can be seated be turning with me to genesis chapter 17. as we just speak about that harvest has come i believe we are in a very wonderful hour where it is a harvest season we are seeing the um [Music] visions that have been spoken of for this hour come to fruition we um we know that already there's driverless cars and taxis in the streets of america we see a woman vice president that is in the high offices of of our country we also have a catholic president and so we have certainly behind him a beautiful but cruel woman pulling the strings in the white house and so we we see a gathering together as they as they um bind themselves together with the gold to stop climate change but i just got news for them the climate's going to change this world is going to burn with fire and so nothing nothing they can do can prevent that because they've sent away their day of grace and um the word of god is against them in the meantime we we've been told to watch russia watch russia keep our eyes on the king of the north and uh of course we are watching the world is watching everybody's eyes is on russia right now as she gathers up her cubs the old mother bear uh gathering up her cubs and forcing the rest of the world into a union and um and america of course is turned to speak as a dragon we've never heard her speak so devilish in her life as she comes against um religious freedoms and freedoms of all sorts um you know as she goes running over every everything we see an economy that's falling we see the world that is falling all around us in many many ways and um as it is happening of course russia's invading the ukraine and that now has caused israel to do a gathering and right now israel is gathering hundreds if not thousands of her of her jewish people gather those those last stragglers back to their promised land and that's not all of it but in this harvest time there's also a bride that is gathering a revival that is happening and i'm glad to be a part of that revival and and so we should possess to for our promises as the spirit of prophecy is among us wednesday night i'm sure you noticed i knew that the spirit of prophecy was here among us and and god speaking and revealing himself and we want to just continue to move on this into the things of god today and just look and see where we are in time now last sunday i was speaking or was trying to breach the subject on abraham coming to el shaddai and today we want to take that a little further so if you'll turn with me to genesis chapter 17 i would like to read from there this morning and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lords appeared to abram and said unto him i am the almighty god walk before me and be thou perfect and i will make my covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and abram fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name any more be called abram but thy name shall be abraham for father of many nations have i made thee and i will make the exceeding fruitful and i will make nations of these and kings shall come out of thee and i will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and i will give unto thee unto thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger and all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and i will be their god and ame and god said to abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which she shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you and he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations and he that is born in the house are bought with money of any stranger which is not of that which is not of thy seed he that is born in thy house and he that is bought with thy money must needs be circumcised and my covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant and the uncircumcised man-child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he hath broken my covenant and god said unto abraham as far as as for sarah thy wife thou shalt not call her name sarai but sarah shall her name be and i will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea i will bless her and she shall be a mother of nations and kings a people shall be of her then abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart shall it shall be born unto him that is a hundred years old and shall sarah that is 90 years old bear and abraham said unto god all that ismail might live before thee and god said sarah thy wife shall bear us thee a son indeed thou shalt call his name isaac and i will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for ishmael i have heard thee behold i have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly twelve princes shall he beget and i will make him a great nation but my covenant will i establish with isaac which sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year and he left off talking with him and god went up from abraham amen these are wonderful words that we have read today and sharing in this first of all we spoke of the church jesus did he compared it with with a wheat plant as it goes from from the grain back to the grain again and he said the kingdom of heaven will be like this then we would see that how that abraham brings it starts on his journey we took it last sunday we were dealing with justification and sanctification and the stations of abraham's life and his walk with god and remember it is a walk you know remember god called him to walk with him and that's the thing no matter where you are you must walk with him you cannot stay in one place and too many stay have stayed in one place way too long amen and but you know as as abraham would come to a place he would build an altar and dig a well and certainly perhaps you had worship there and you had revival there but it's time for you to make another step forward and you know the the assumption is that that once we lose that experience of that first meeting that joy that came with it that feeling of relief of sins forgiven it becomes stale and stagnant it's so that the flow becomes choked or blocked somehow and this is very common too common with too many christians you know there was a mountaintop experience a a period of the reality of christ it was unmistakable and and then there comes a slow drifting away and and then there was a brief moment of intense love and of joy and deep running peace and and a period of of wholeness when without straining you you found yourself patient and kind and gentle you see it was a time of believing and then a dull dryness takes over and and i just um you know as we think of that i i ponder really are christians or believers supposed to just live on a memory of what they experienced in the past you know memories fade and they become confused but contrary to that the holy ghost is is described as a river of living water and it doesn't come stale or stagnant it's a flowing stream and god was trying to bring abraham in his walk to a place where he met on el shaddai as a flowing stream as the as the god who supplied all his needs as the god who is more than enough that from him would supply nutrients and and a continual flow of goodness you know um you see in the early church there was always an excitement a stern of life in that early church and the church today by and large has has lost this many times we look around and we ask where are the changed lives and where where is a belief that men will die for those early believers in the book of acts they received their vitality from the spirit of god from an experience and that experience was called the baptism of the holy ghost and that's what else shady i is it's the place where in type that abraham was baptized with the holy ghost he meets el shaddai who is the breasted god we'll go into that a little more but from him came resources of life and it was an inexhaustible resource it wasn't a one-and-done thing it was there for every moment every hour for a daily walk for a continual consecration and so you see in that early church they went from glory to glory because on the day of pentecost they met the almighty god who empowered them with strength and change their name and gave them a seal of circumcision gave them a guarantee of the covenant within their own la their own set maybe others couldn't see it but they knew they had experienced it they had had it they knew the the pain of being separated from the world and from sin and the and and the the dying of the old man but they knew also the joy of being marked by god and by claimed by the holy ghost and so you see this is what happened on the day of pentecost it was that it was that grain of wheat it was that harvest season it was a time of renew of renewal where where it comes to fruition of every promise being manifested things that have been laying hidden in the scriptures now come to light as as even peter will preach and he'll pull out of joel's prophecy and say this is that he'll look back in other scriptures and he'll identify what god is doing because it's all now coming in a seed form but eventually through the successive years that followed the church began to drift it began to lose its first love and it would crumple into a backslidden church until it becomes so buried in era so in blatant falsehoods and formalisms and that original church then became like a buried seed that began to deteriorate and soon it was nothing like nothing like the original church and finally a fledgling leaf would struggle from the ground into the light and and of course that was luther and and as we brought with abraham the same thing that divine call to the promised land of the holy ghost was justification now justification is an act of god whereby he pronounces a sinner to be righteous because of that sinner's faith in christ justification is a release from sin and though it is not the baptism of the holy ghost it is an experience of the holy ghost amen justification does come by the spirit of god justification per se does not make anybody holy it simply declares him as not guilty before god and therefore he is treated as holy the actual change toward holiness in the center occurs in sanctification it is like brother branham would use the the illustration of a cup that he would find in a chicken pin he would pick it up and he said it's a good cup you know it may be even mama's best china it's a good cup there's nothing wrong with the cup it's dirty it's filthy you see justification picks you up and man he picked you up and identified you and it said you are your good cup amen and and you're i'm going to justify you're justified you could be used in mama's kitchen again but you see you're dirty so you need sanctifying so with the bleach and the cleansing and the washing and the purging and whatever you had to do to clean it up you rest you restore it and you set it in mama's in mama's kitchen right but you see it's now sanctified and set apart for service but that's not the end of the cut the cup will be filled amen and put into the master use are you with me that's the baptism of the holy ghost to be filled with him now of course as you know i it's like playing the the game of baseball you can't skip a base you can't jump from justification and then get filled with the holy ghost they account it don't happen you have to be sanctified amen in the days of of wesley the church advanced from a justified state to a sanctified state now to sanctify something is to set it apart for special use to sanctify a person is to make him holy now brother branham would tell us in the message that countdown he would tell us these experiences were real let me let me just go and cap them over for a minute by this quote he said i want you to remember that the church called church is not the church the church is the church spiritual and ten thousand times ten thousands of lutherans that joined the church knew no more about justification than a hog knew about a side saddle they knew nothing of it and in the wesley age how tens of thousands profess sanctification they knew nothing more about the sanctification power of god and a rabbit does about snowshoes they absolutely didn't know it but there was a people who achieved it i want you to get this in mind even though you look and you see failures there's somebody going to achieve it amen he said now you see where i'm getting to there was somebody who knew what justified meant in the sight of god having peace with god through our lord jesus christ there was some of those lutherans who were loyal they believed it no matter what the catholic church said they believed god's word they stood on it because the messenger that is preached the just shall live by faith and they believed in a justified state and they were able by the grace of god to achieve justification having peace with god to our lord jesus christ and then along came the methodists with sanctification there was many of those methodists were actually sanctified now a lot of them claimed they claimed it and knew nothing about it the methodist church taught sanctification they they said they got down and they cried and they got back up and said glory to god i'm sanctified and they went right on living like they always did but some of those men and women was actually sanctified from the things of the world and lived a consecrated set apart life now you see those would be the bride of that age there would be those who will come up in the great resurrection and be resurrected and go in the rapture with us now they're because they are people who had a real experience with god now through the experience of sanctification the the wheat plant was moving back toward the original grain and wesley became like the tassel it was a pollination age and the gospel would spread worldwide and missionary societies would raise up and and bible societies and and and the gospel would be spread everywhere it was the pollen age now you see in your walk with god you cannot bypass sanctification you must be cleansed and die up to your bad habits out to the world now and this is what brother branham told us in countdown he said if a man sets a thought on just justification in other words believing on the lord or just receiving the message or just saying god sent a prophet or i believe a certain theology or certain aspects of the doctrines of the message that's all you got to have he's wrong he said if a man sits on the thought of just justification is all you got to have he's wrong he's got to be wrong and if the church believes like many of the pentecostals he talked about the full gospel charismatic that the holy ghost is it that's just repent and get the holy ghost that's wrong because you got to get sanctification in there to cleanse before the holy ghost comes in if you don't you leave out the blood so again again this would be the issue that we would face as there would be millions millions of people added to uh to the the church that would be how they have a um an experience of what they call baptism in the holy ghost and they would do it and not even be sanctified they would do it and not and not even their lives changed they would speak in tongues and have a gift to the spirit without having the spirit now originally though the original movement at azusa street they all believed in the sanctified life they did not bypass sanctification they believed in holiness that was their roots they all came from the holiness movement women didn't cut their hair men didn't follow hippie fats but you know the war came and and the women went to the factories and while while the men were at war and for some their uniforms would require pants and cross dressing began to be popular it began to be accepted as a as a you know i mean today people look and they still kind of frown on a man cross-dressing but women do it all the time and man but cross-dressing began to be popular certain women were wearing pants to everything but but formal events and you know there again um they they begin to um they didn't go they didn't wear them to church and among the pentecostal churches like the assembly of god and other trinity pentecostal churches they began to embrace a new doctrine and it was called women's liberation and the women's liberation as they embraced it they shed their holiness beliefs and the women began to cut their hair and paint their face and cross-dress wearing men's apparel taking man's position and the traditional family was gone from the pentecostal churches all the while still claiming to receive the holy ghost because he spoke in tongues because he had a gift from the spirit and not the spirit himself the spirit of god leads you into sanctification now a modern device called television crept into people's homes and and it made sin absolutely beautiful and glamorous you know it made it oh it was the trick thing to do is the popular thing to do as brother branham has said the devil landed here a few years ago and with his great army and hit in hollywood california and he's invaded the united states with his demon powers and and it gave them all one mind you remember this is the working of the beast to give them all one mind where they all think alike and so it has happened that that that it has changed the thinking of the other christians even today where and and look back and we can see programs that we can look back on as now is something that looks very innocent like i love lucy they were they they were among the first though that mocked and belittled the housewife and before you know it traditional marriage and traditional families were mocked and scorned and soon people had one mind from that one vision of hell and hollywood stars were that hollywood stars were patterned after they patterned after an inspiration from hell and and they and and now again in the churches they begin to pattern after that vision and they patterned their dress they wore their makeup to look like them and as early as 1954 brother branham when he's preaching on abraham he talks about how abraham strayed from the promised land and he said so at the church until the church had become backslidden and and so they were so backslidden until even the baptist whose doctrine was founded on justification by faith in christ backslid over eternal security that were once saved always saved you know there was there is a true there is a true eternal security where once you're truly filled with the holy ghost you're sealed to the day of redemption you are sealed in with christ and the devil is sealed out so there is a truth to eternal security but they took eternal security to of once saved always saved to the extreme and begin to look at sin as though it didn't matter it was something you know everybody has that we can overcome it's just frivolous you know it didn't matter what you do because you confess jesus as your savior so it don't make any difference how you live make no difference how you dress god doesn't look on the outside god looks on the inside and so you know they they would say that doesn't make any difference to me about sin a little beer in the refrigerator a little cocktail with the boss a little uh extra kiss with the secretary a little bit you know married two or three four times that doesn't really matter god looks on the heart and i'm justified i accept him as savior and so they begin to believe that they were saved in their sins not from their sins and so again when if you're really truly saved you don't want to do those things you see sin desire has to be dealt with or you cannot be truly saved now so the baptist would lose their holiness those people wouldn't go to dances they used to maybe trim their hair but they wouldn't bob it women wore skirts too and especially to church and they became so secure in believing once they'd always say i had a baptist man tell me as he lift one cigarette off of another he was divorced twice and was contemplating the third marriage and a few weeks before he'd been arrested for drunk driving and and and he he was um he was saying you know brother tim i am sure of my salvation if the rapture would happen this minute i know i would go up to meet the lord i'm anticipating to come in the lord any day now so sure was he of his justification that his sins were forgiven that he was he was convinced he was ready to meet god that moment and needed nothing further now you see the christian church begin to look more like the world dressing like the world losing his holy life you you often wonder why did brother branham's constantly strike out against it it was where the church was going and he was he was hollering and screaming to them don't go over that waterfall turn around before it's too late he was trying to get them to repent and to come back to god and finally he couldn't get him to repent so he said get out of that boat come out of her my people amen that's going over into the tribulation that's going to seek out yonder somewhere get out of it while you got a chance and flee to the ark of safety get into jesus christ now all of them the baptist methodists the pentecostal the feminist movement affected the church even the pentecostal the liberation of women had begun they were removing this what they thought was shackles and chains of holiness and this just transformed the women thrusting them into a modern feminist move and soon ever spread of a holy dress and every a holy look was totally gone from them and brother branham was constantly crying out against it you wonder sometimes why he would be so hard you know why it was he saw where the church was going and and he saw that they were bypassing the very works of sanctification as he as he said on an unconditional covenant those things such as bob are dancing and and card parties and and playing and bobbing your hair and painting your lips and manicure in your face and all that thing is the attributes of unbelief and that hurts pentecost but that's what's good for your brother that's right couldn't walk the old narrow path just like a hog going to swallow a dog to its vomit and there's where the pentecostal churches return oh you don't hear very many amen but i tell you brother it's the honest and good truth you see they they were rejecting that they were turning them around here he was a voice of warning the voice of god speaking out in that day and time that the whole world matters every word matters man shall live by every word not just some of it but every word and it all matters he said what the trouble of it is the devil landed up here in hollywood and come through television stripped off our women and done everything that was and ungodly to be done and and people call it all right and here come your ladder rain scattering or whatever it was and actually it was the full gospel move calling themselves a letter ring and and that became the big charismatic move called liberation of women and everything like that and he said it's a disgrace it's the works of the devil you ain't going to love me after the night brother but when i meet you at the judgment bar i'll be clean of the thing and that's one thing sure i'm going to tell you the truth about it amen the word amen means so be it and that's why brother branham preached so hard against cutting hair what the bible says about it amen this is what the bible said the pain in the face he used example of jezebel and and vamping men and the whole sexual revolution that began and then the cross-dressing which was a spirit of perversion that grew from out of that until men don't even know how to be a man anymore now so yet they still spoke in tongues and prophesied they were still claiming the holy ghost and receiving the baptism without sanctification now as he said there's this great doctrine among the pentecostal people of the liberation of women they're wearing great long earrings and doing all kinds of dressings a young fella sat in front of my house a few days ago in a little truck crying that his wife pentecostal speaks with tongues gives prophecy and said the whole church wears shorts and she goes right on the street at eight or nine o'clock at night picking up little cigarette stumps that others have thrown away and smoking and still shouting praising the lord and giving prophecies now prophecies and tones are gifts of the holy spirit they are not the holy spirit now so here was the church now again they had stopped at justification all the way trying to claim the holy ghost but instead of getting the holy ghost and we'll get into our lesson this morning they took the breath of denomination instead a dogma that if you speak in tongues that you got the holy ghost now so again but abraham was led by god he went through and as we've been to it the the uh where the divine call to the altar age now we're coming to the age of the holy ghost genesis 17 1. i did that for a little background now and when abram was 90 years old and nine the lord appeared to abram and said in him i am almighty god this word is el shaddai wall before me and be thou perfect now this word almighty god el shaddai in the hebrew it comes from a root word shed and that word shad means breast so there there there again is is we're seeing a son of abraham that had already come from abraham but it came from abraham's strength that was ishmael but now there is a promise given that there will be one born of the supernatural and to be born of the supernatural is to be born of the word now the full word had not yet come there was parts of the words revealed justification more light revealed sanctification now gifts of the spirit were being light was shown on them and a baptism as they called it in the holy ghost but again you know the full word had not yet come there were mysteries that were not yet revealed there were truths that were not yet given but brother branham tells us at the opening of the seven seals revelation 10 the full word is to be born in the manifestation again and vindicated by the spirit of god in full strength i want you to get some of these points the full word is to be born into manifestation and it will be in its full strength amen as it was when it was here on earth manifesting the same way doing the same things it did when it was here on earth amen hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever luke 17 30 jesus said in the days the last days as it was in the days of sodom when the son of man that's the word will be revealing himself again it'll be the same thing so now there's a promise that god would reveal himself in his fullness that the full word would come now the full word would come so that there could be of a child born of and by that word i'm trying to make this plain to you today that this message produces a birth and it is a word birth now brother branham told us in birth pains he said we're in the laodicean church age and her messenger is promised in malachi the fourth chapter he promised to do it the message is to bring back the word bring the people back to the word birth to be she is to be delivered of a new birth according to malachi 4. so we we've had you know wesley or luther with [Applause] what he called a new birth which was justification and sanctification would come and now that the gifts would come but brother branham tells us that there is to be a people that it comes of a new birth of malachi 4 and malachi 4 used to restore the hearts of the children back to the original apostolic fathers so again there would be a people restored back and have the same kind of birth that they did on the day of pentecost now he says in birth pains the word must deliver the word bride church the church has got to be delivered out of her a bride for christ she's fixing to bring forth the perfect word back there and the word is coming for the word bride as a woman is a part of a man taken from him so the church will have to be a word abiding church every word of the bible not systems dogmas nothing added to it it'll have to be in an unadulterated pure virgin word so again the word he said is going to give birth to a word pride the message is coming is going to give birth there's a new birth of malachi 4 and it is the same birth that they had back in the beginning now god of this evil age word bride heading up in the person of the word of god made manifest in the evil age we're living so this bride will be the person of the word made manifested manifesting all the word every promise every gift his righteousness his holiness without which no man can see the lord a child of the supernatural was promised you notice this god is promising here without shadow i'm going to give you a child and it this one your body is now dead you can't do this on your own this is going to be without works without human effort it won't be something worked up it won't be something imagined it won't come by shaking the preacher's hand or joining a church it will be an absolutely supernatural birth but you notice before this could happen and the promised son came because of sarah's unbelief they got ahead of the promise and abraham had a son of his own flesh born of a bombs woman and not of the free woman ismail was abraham's fleshly strength why isaac could have come only through the supernatural because sarah was now 90. abraham a hundred god would have to restore their bodies and and heal sarah of her barrenness what was god doing god was prophesying portraying through them foreshadowing through their lives that what he would do at the end time that he would change the body of the living church and resurrect the dead in christ in order to bring forth the long-awaited promised son but before he could come there would have to be a bride born out of that word to present to him and abraham was used to show us that the promised son would be born of the supernatural and not a man's strength turn with me to genesis 16 and verse 2 and sarah said unto abram behold now the lord has restrained me from barren now she's going to blame god i'm not able to do it god didn't make provisions i pray thee go in unto my maid that it may be that i may obtain children by her and abram abram hearken to the voice of sarai now through disbelieving the promise of god was for her sarah i decided to help god out a little bit by offering a denomination a bounce woman to bring forth christ now that's what men have done they have wanted to help god out do it by human efforts instead of by the supernatural now instead of coming to know god personally by an experience of justification it was changing shaking hands with the preacher making intellectual confession of faith and joining a church and outward baptisms and works and human efforts again with sanctification instead of coming to know god personally by an experience of sanctification it became self-righteous manufactured holiness instead of coming to god know him personally by an experience of the baptism of the holy ghost pentecost the associate movement they substituted speaking in tongues and many times this was something manufactured a confusion of language just a senseless jabber now ishmael was something abraham could produce by his own strength that's the pentecostal age this is where the real twin comes into view because he would come the supernatural as the word was coming into view for people to be be born with and let me just say it a little differently this layout of cnh is the age of pentecost this age of pentecost would also be the harvest age where the church returns to what it was in the book of acts but before the grain could come there's another stage called the shock now the shuck is the stage of the grain that it is a twin to the grain itself it looks like original grain it can be mistaken four million for original grain but it is not the grain and and because the true grain is where the bride returns to the bride she was at pentecost and azusa street fell short of that now like ishmael looked like and he was accepted as a fulfillment of the promise but he was not the fulfillment of the promise he was only the shock that came before the grave now god promises the greater wheat that he planted at pentecost in the book of acts would return back to grain again now these other stages of the wheat plant that we read about from jesus own word of the blade and the toss on the shelf they were not the promised restoration even as ishmael was not the promised son neither was the souza street pentecostal the restoration of pentecost they were called pentecost like ishmael was called abraham's seed but he was not of the promise he was not the one that god was bringing a rapture for are you with me now so again in the exposition of the church age she said the lutheran age did not restore the church it started a reformation the western age did not restore then then this then speaking of the azusa's movement he says the pentecostal age did not restore but god has to restore for he cannot deny his word i i want to get this to you god still has to do what he said even though we got an ishmael even though we got an abraham seed and some would say well just let let him be the one let him you know let let him live before you i'll bless him but he's not what i'm after i'm after one that's going to come by the supernatural and it's going to be by you drinking from el shaddai it's you going to take the promises of the world and these words there are going to be made manifest in a bribe people listen here he said he said that god has to restore because he cannot deny his word god will take the church right back to pentecost of the beginning so no matter what anybody says what how many ishmaels are there how many wild offsprings that are there amen how many that shout and didn't get it how many that believed and didn't get it how many to speak in tongues and didn't get it god is going to bring a people amen back to pentecost of the beginning the word will give birth amen and it'll be a word birth just like it was on the day of pentecost now in jehovah jair brother bradham explains this and i'm going to read this in its entirety here he said we'll finish this but he said the covenant has to be confirmed with the royal seed of abraham which are the people out of the gentile not jews the people of the gentiles for his namesake taking it for his name the church that's got his name will come back into him because that who she is her life listen when the holy ghost fell on the day of pentecost the life was given to the church and that church went right out and produced they wrote a book behind that church a book of acts and what it did because it was as christ in the apostles now jesus said in john 15 i am the vine you're the branches and the vine does not bear fruit the branch bears the fruit it is energized by the vine well now if that limb first one come out on that tree produced a book of acts if it ever puts out another limb it'll be the same life and he uses example of what he saw at john sheriff's farm where he took him into his citrus grove and he showed him a tree that he was experimenting with and it was an orange tree and had oranges and lemons and grapefruits and tangerines and tangelos about nine or ten different fruits and brother brandon asked him what kind of fruit this tree is at and he said oh this is my experiment and he said but it's an orange tree he said well what are all these other fruits doing on there he said well i drafted on there and he said um said so next year when it blossoms and brings forth fruit then this that is bearing lemons here will bear oranges right and he said no it won't bear oranges it'll bear lemons and he says oh well you know it's coming out of an orange tree i don't see how i can do it he said well because it's been grafted in and it's uh it's nature is lemon and he said you know but what what about it he said if that tree puts forth a branch of its own he said it'll bear oranges just like the original root wasps now he said oh brother that when the holy spirit come up onto that vine a producer is fine the first branch they wrote a book of acts behind it is that tree ever puts forth another original limb if that tree it'll throw the same thing it'll be jesus christ now we've got methodist presbyterian baptist lutheran everything else was grafted into it barren denominational fruit but if it ever puts forth another branch she will be a genuine christ-filled christ-centered word of god amen that's what the bride used to be a man genuine christ-filled christ-centered word of god amen then he talks about the the bride tree and this message on that and he said well what the palmer when he ate the cankerworm you know what one left the other and eight and and he said until the whole thing was eaten down the method is eight and the baptism eight and they each took their part and the whole thing is cut down but that's not the end of the tree the word says i will restore saith the lord hallelujah all the years i will send back another church i'm quoting now i'll send back another church in the last days hallelujah amen i will restore that original power again in the evening time it shall be light down in the heart of the tree no matter how many branches have been pruned that will come forth the royal seed of abraham god promised that he would do it i will restore all the years denominations say i will restore all the years i prune the thing off but yet there will come a vine or a branch out of the heart of it and that branch he said will be like a tree planted by the rivers of water it'll bring forth its fruits in its season it will not its sleep will not wither amen it will it will not it will not die and decay are you with me amen it'll be an everlasting eternal tree and he said that the branch it will be energized by the life of the vine jesus having no lips but your lips no eyes but yours and mine amen no hands but yours and mine he energizes us oh listen that's the power of the holy ghost energizing the people setting them on fire are you with me now amen whether it's preaching the gospel well whatever it is about or seeing a vision by the eye laying hands on the sick it's christ working through the branches of that church every office literally electrified by his presence hallelujah you don't have to live a backslidden complacent life unless you've been cut off of the tree but i'll tell you if you're in the tree the light that is in that tree will energize the branch and bring put the power out of that branch hallelujah listen it has been prophesied the promised seed will come amen there has to be somebody that is in the image of the lord there has to be a church that believes in the full gospel there has to be a church that has the full word manifest in itself not just part of the word the full word manifested through a bright people because she's a word bride but there will also be another who will not be of the promise that was this is a pentecost it was not the seed and although like ishmael was the seed of abraham it's not the promised seed yet god would appear to hagar i'm trying to get something to it because you're gonna you know there will be signs wonders miracles there will be manifestations will be healings when people believe are you with me amen yeah and so you know the angel appeared to hagar and showed her springs of water revivals they will have revivals great meetings miracles signs wonders but so will the bride come on amen it's not just the angel appearing to out here to hagar it's not just blessing on them it's on isaac in isaac shall i see be blessed [Applause] don't lose sight of who we are genesis 17 20. as far as ishmael i've heard thee behold i will bless him i've made him fruitful i'll make him a great nation i make great denominations out of them and they get blessed prosper big buildings great programs they do great things they're gathering don't count all of them out some of them are in the book of life some of them wind up at the white throne judgment after the tribulation on the other side of the millennium and they're given life but they're not isaac they're not the promised seed i want to get you i want to get you here because my covenant verse 21 i will i establish with isaac the supernatural seed amen yet there will be great gatherings there will be great moves there will be great bindings great harvest time some will be bound together and their common thread will be gifts of the spirit speaking in tongues others will be bound together by by their methods of justification or sanctification and it'll bind them all together and and they all come together as one and bundled together but there's also being a bride gathered don't forget and all of this what god's real purpose is sometimes we look out here and we're so we're so about identifying them and identifying oh they got miracles and signs and watch out and what tell listen it ain't the signs and wonders to watch out for the signs and wonders are yours they're your inheritance the angel was not yes and because she was a part of abraham's group she got some of the blessings and the the angel came by and the angels spoke and the angels sold sell thousands of water and the angel the angel bless them but that's not what god's purpose and plan was god's promise and purpose is get a bride in a rapture and she's not going to be a weak powerless group of people whose only weapon is argument that she got a better argument than somebody else about the godhead or about the original sin or about water baptism or that's not it are you with me now both ishmael and isaac are called abraham's seed but god makes a distinction and he actually brings a separation and he says the children of the bombs woman will not be heir with the free woman they will not go in the rapture together i've got a body change for one i've got come on i've got an appearance and i've gotten revealed of the mysteries to one there's one that this is what i came for this is my purpose this is my plan but yeah i'll save them too yes i remember it's meal too now this is what makes it really hard because of scissor street pentecost and the bride people the bride age are also called pentecost and one is the original and the other has made the first claim on it now here comes the wheat plant again just before the grain of wheat comes there's a stage that looks exactly like the grain and can be mistaken for the full corn but it's not it's the shout out now brother branham tells us in resume of the ages that this age started just after the turn of the 20th century and it was to be the age in which the true church would return to being the bride she was at pentecost and let me tell you it still is god hadn't given up on this promise we know that there must be a necessity of necessity to be a return to dynamic power the believers sensed this in their spirits and began crying out to god for new outpourings such as was at the first century and what seemed to be the answer it wasn't the answer but it seemed to be the answer came as many begin to speak in tongues and manifest the gifts of the spirit it was then believed that this was the long-awaited restoration it was not now i want you to get from your messenger azusa pentecost was not the restoration so they were not the book of acts and they were not the true pentecost but there is one that is she is about come on now his word can't fall to the ground yeah you've got issue but that's not what i intended that never was my plan i've got a greater plan than that and yeah i'll save him too but there's more that i'm going to do with the bright elect people and he said that's what was thought to be a restoration and final quicken into the rapture had not come it was a mixture of unrighteous partaking with spiritual blessings and manifesting the holy ghost or the mixture the unrighteous partaking of spiritual blessings manifesting in the holy ghost it was devil power also devil power as men were under the control of devils yet no one seemed to realize it and then to prove it was not real these people before a second generation had appeared organized and wrote their unscriptural doctrines and built their own fences as every group ahead of them did so again he gives identification he said they become a bounce woman there wasn't a free woman they identified them as a hagar themselves as a hagar not a sarah so these pentecostal charismatic full gospel people were given the promise of el shaddai god was leading them right there notice this the open book about the old and the new testament but they took the breast of denomination specifically the dogma of speaking in tongues as the initial evidence and they denied the birth of the word now brother brandon says some very startling statements and i want you to get this he watched the pentecost slate after he comes there he made the promise of el shaddai nurse for me let's stop here just a minute remember shaddai comes from the root word breast well you say what does god have to do with breast he god god there god was giving birth so in the type he is shown himself as one who has given birth to a child abraham you're 99 but you're just a baby to me and because you're mine i got the right to name you so he gets a new name come on amen i'm going to give you my covenant which is a seal of circumcision amen that you that the world is cut off and you're marked by me you are mine are you with me and i'm changing your name and i'm changing sarah's name and i'm giving you now the full promise i'm going to give you both breasts of the old testament and the new testament i'm going to give you of the full word of god i'm going to give you the full gospel the whole word every promise every provision are you with me amen and that was offered to the pentecostals to have a real birth and but they didn't do it they grabbed the breasts from denomination where they come out of i'm quoting but then the real seed real seed came to nurse on that breast now the azusa movement organized on the evidence of the holy ghost being speaking in tongues even daddy bosworth knew this was wrong and lost his position among him he got kicked out of the assembly of god because of his position but they took the breasts to denomination by nursing for their strength a dogma of the church of the initial evidence of the holy ghost now this is where they pentecos gets the azusa movement gets their strength from i spoke in tongues and if they need strength again they just go back and speak in tongues again they draw from the dogma a dogma is a a a a a belief that is that is set aside by the church and they draw from the belief of the church that that is the initial evidence and the bible never places it as the initial evidence now so again you see it is not tongues is not the evidence of the holy ghost tongues is a gift of the spirit and not the spirit and yet they can still speak with tongues bob there paint their face drink their cocktails cross dress sniff a little cocaine marry divorce remarry drink alcohol get drunk get rescued for drunk driving and even even sometimes they didn't even have to many times to leave their denomination they could still be episcopalian catholic and yet recruit re and reject the truths of the word of god brother branham's telling us over again the holy ghost cannot deny himself let's get it straight the holy ghost will agree with every word of god seed not arab with the shock he said but when you come to say i and my father won remember that's what jesus did he come and brought further part of the word and when he said i my father won they all left him so we can't receive this and so when they come to i am my father one these other things like original sin baptism in the name of jesus christ one god the shock the shock mocks that that's right and then the chuck pulls away from that but then he says the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god in its fullness and in strength for he is the same yesterday today and forever so i want you to get it the real genuine bride church will bring forth the entire word of god amen in its fullness in its strength for he's the same yesterday today and forever amen now as he said in seed not air with the shell pentecost took speaking in tongues and they denied the birth of the word that's exactly what they did they'll take so much of it but they won't take the rest of it denied the birth of the word like mary did watch there won't be no more organizations after this no notice what they did they took they took from the breast of denomination here here instead of a seed coming that came from el shaddai from the supernatural and from abraham nursing his strength here it comes from a bones woman and the strength they're getting comes from the bones woman of an initial evidence of speaking in tongues now but what there will be no more organizations after this you see ishmael came by reasoning and by man's own human efforts to bring the word to pass instead of the supernatural the azusa bunch like abraham did they took speaking in tongues they worked up emotions with manufactured tongues instead of waiting for the real manifestations of god but what there will be no more organizations after this god won't deal with another that don't mean there won't be another form that means god will not deal with another the move of god will not come through another now so again that that means that god will not use another organization to bring his word through now physically the israelites today are a great nation of arabs that surround isaac the jews they demand to receive the inheritance only given to israel right so is the church billions compared to the bride are you with me and they are claiming the same inheritance they're trying to put their foot on the ever promise the rapture the body change divine healing anything that belongs to the bride of christ they want it too they are israelites now there are i'm going to just use some facts here for a minute there are 2.3 billion christians in the world today in terms of overall number the world christian currently counts 644 million of them are pentecostal charismatics worldwide including all the members of pentecostalism's 19000 300 denominations and fellowships so the movement that began in 1906 has now grown and has mighty branches 19 300 denominations and fellowships out of them have come more than a half a billion converts now you don't me if you don't think that they become a great people think about what think about these numbers if you can wrap your mind around it for a minute that they're you know we have 8.3 percent of the world's population that's what we're talking about one in 12 persons today is pentecostal or charismatic one in 12. and looking at the current global distribution of pentecostal charismatic christians the encyclopedia counts 230 million in africa 195 million in latin america 125 million in asia 68 million north america uh 21 million in europe and 4.5 million in australia and oceania now you're not going to tell me friends that god hadn't blessed them and there hadn't been a huge gathering brother branham told us he said even when it was happening he said i foresee it as as the foolish virgins being gathered because they are not getting the oil you see they they might have a profession of fire but their light goes out now the pentecostal charismatic movements one of the fastest growing trends in the world chris of christianity today you know it has been for some time it grew from 58 million in 1970 and now is 6.56 million or six six five uh 656 million 6.56 billion think about that or half a billion little over 0.65 million billion now 0.65 billion they've added six million people since 1970. now if you don't think there's been a revival if you don't think there's been a stir if you don't think there's been something happening it's been happening now and and how did they do this through speaking in tongues and in many cases i want to get this it started out as genuine but then impersonations followed until today there's hardly a thread of it but what that is real and becomes just worked up emotion until there is now 19 300 denominations and fellowships pentecost is a form of christianity that emphasizes the work of the spirit and the direct experience of the presence of god by the believers pentecostals believe that faith must be powerful powerfully experiential and not something found merely through ritual or thinking pentecostalism is energetic and dynamic therefore it is a different experience you have with the person of christ and no certain uncertain time is a life-changing moment you can't come to through to true christianity through your intellect you have to be willing to experience it first and that's exactly what our message teaches that you can't come with just your intellect you've got to experience it first and it's a life-changing moment and it's a devin experience with the person of christ and it's energetic and it's dynamic it's something that you know brother branham types it as a world being renewed for the new earth is not a reformed earth through a reformation but a transformation it's not a dried-eyed confession but the igniting of the fire so he states that the baptism of the holy spirit is a definite experience that a person must receive and he tells us he explains this in future home he tells us it is an experience he said it's just like the world when the world gets renovated for the new heavens and the new earth he said you talk about explosion he said why the heavens will catch on fire he said that it'll pass away with a great noise and and it'll be an explosion it will rock the whole thing got to kill every disease and every thistle and every thorn and the fire will burn it up and remember he said it's not just a literal fire it's a holy fire and we're not talking about the burning for the millennium now we're talking about the new heavens and new earth where god comes to live on it and he types it out with the same thing he said when a man receives the baptism of fire there's a lot of noise around there they think it's a shame to hear people scream and shout like that but just wait until the earth gets her baptism so he types at the same thing you know that that sin nature is burned off every shred of the devil ever come on now every disease of sin every evil thing gets burned away and christ comes to live upon it and it's an explosion are you with me so brother branham taught us the same thing he said you cannot receive the baptism of the holy ghost without an experience when it happens now if you believe say you believe every speck of the word you say you say you believe every speck of it then the word is laying in there waiting for the holy spirit to put it to work but it takes the light into the candle here's a candle with a wick and the tallow and everything in that candle to make that candle and he said then the fire comes on it but until it comes it will not shine any light no matter how perfect the candle is how perfect it'll burn it's got to be litten and then it burns and when you believe and are made up of the instructions and the holy spirit of love joy peace long suffering goodness the fruits that bears out until the holy spirit with a fiery experience comes down and lights that candle you haven't received the holy ghost you've got to have the experience to have the holy ghost say brother tim that's pentecostal yes they preach an experience we should be preaching experience too we certainly should not be preaching baptist doctrine or you just believe the message and you got it you see it's not just simply believing and then confessing you have it the token is the holy ghost and let me tell you the fullness of it didn't come to the evening time when the full word was born into manifestation by the opening of the seventh seal do you realize that you are a people who for the first time in seven ages since the fall of the church can have the same baptism of the holy ghost that they did on the day of pentecost do you realize it come because the full word has been restored and out of that word is coming to birth a supernatural birth [Applause] you must have the token the holy ghost if you just substitute the word token for holy ghost that's what the word token is the holy ghost you must have the holy ghost just plain without it all your believing is in vain you'll live a good life you listen to what the word said you go to church you try to live right that's fine but that's not it when i see the blood that's the token you say why the blood because on the day there on the day of pentecost or at calvary the blood cell was split open releasing the life of god and on the day of pentecost they were born of the birth of god born of the blood the light that was in the blood came back upon the believers now you say well i believe every word brother branham every word said brother branham that's good but that's just being able to read you look in the bible you know they did not receive the holy ghost when they believed but after they believed you see down in samaria let's go to acts chapter 8 and verse 13. i'll just give an example there's two places in there where you were sealed by the holy spirit of god after believing but watch down in samaria they had received the word but had not received the holy ghost they had believed and received the word but still needed the experience acts chapter 8 verse 13 and simon himself believed also and was baptized in a few minutes he gets to be called a child of the devil because he tries to buy the gift amen but he also believed and when he was by and when he was baptized he continued with philip wandered behold in the miracles and signs that were done and when the apostles were at jerusalem heard that samara had received the word of god did you notice they had received the message amen today we would say well that brothers believe the serpent seed that brother has believed god sent a prophet but that brother believes the seals is open that brother has accepted and embraced only he believes and now in baptism in jesus name we baptize he's got the holy ghost no he doesn't he has received the word not the spirit he has received and recognized and believed on the theology but he has not received the holy ghost it's an experience watch so mary had received the word of god they sent them john peter and john who when they were come down prayed for them that they might receive the holy ghost far as yet he was falling upon none of them only they were baptized in the name of the lord jesus and then they laid their hands on them and they received the holy ghost so i want you to notice they believed received the word embraced its doctrines accepted its truth and still needed the spirit and that's the problem in many message churches today they've done all of that and ain't got the holy ghost therefore they're not living overcoming lives now jesus speaking of the holy ghost in that day he told us yes in that day ye shall know not guess not hope not imagine not believe because the preacher said go back to your seat boy you got it i want you to get this jesus said you will know that i'm in the father the father me and i and you so the holy ghost is something you can know paul said in philippians chapter 3 and verse 9 and and being found in him not having my known righteousness which is of the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith and he says that i might know him what and the power of his resurrection now notice that i may know him this says this is not a guest this is not an imagination this is a knowledge you know him notice this and that i might know him and the power of his resurrection how do you know the power of his resurrection is when you yourself died to sin and raise up triumphantly over sin just as he rose up triumphant over death hell and the grave notice now we've got to know him in the power of his resurrection i once was dead i can point to a dead man but i'm alive now and i have the keys to death and of hell come on that's that's the experience of every true baptized born again believer are you with me so now again in the in the late 19th late 1800s i'm gonna get this as we kind of move right down into this thought now in the late in the late 1800s in preparation for the last age there was an open door the bible speaks to this an open door that was set before the world and the holy ghost began to be poured out now this will explain to you why the world is in the condition it's in and he tells you in jubilee year he said the baptism of the holy spirit fell the first time since pentecost in russia back a hundred years ago which that would be about by his calculation then would be 1854. and that's history now i've been i've done quite a bit of history on that that those russians would spill over into armenia and armenia there would receive the baptism of the holy ghost and through a prophecy given by a boy prophet of eight years old who prophesied you're going to have to leave armenia and flee to the west and go and he describes a country never seen a map and describes how to get there and you will land on the east side and you will you will go in the west side and you will be blessed and it's there that there will be a blessing that will fall that will bless the world and demonstration of armenian descent was a grandson of those who moved from armenia because they listened to a prophecy that was given by the holy spirit as they there had received the spirit from there from the visitation of the russians and received the message of pentecost and now they come over there and then they find there that the same tongues and gifts and things are happening on azusa street and there demon secarion would in 1952 begin the full gospel businessmen that would be an oasis for brother branham where that the voice could be heard the voice the midnight cry amen to the to the all the virgins all the virgins the wise and the foolish go you out to meet him the bridegroom cometh the message of his coming and it would be herald and there would be an awakening among the foolish and that would realize we don't have the holy ghost we don't have the oil and instead of getting it they get tongues instead and it binds them together and they never hear the call come out of her my people they never get the prophecy so they wind up in the tribulation but there in in russia the holy spirit fell and i want you to think moves over to armenia these people hear it they will they will receive it they will embrace it prophecy falls among them real prophecy and with this prophecy they will cross crossed the sea and they would come and they would wind up in l.a and while there while there that because of heeding that prophecy because it would be 50 years later after the prophecy that the that that that boy prophet now a man would say now the lord is revealed as the time let's flee now and they sold out sold out their farms their heritage their family heritage everything moved across the seas it was driven to get out of there you know why a persecution was coming and and then you know what happened in armenia if you know history they extermina and terminated on a million of them a genocide of the whole people and wiped out the whole countryside the turks did it that's right now so the holy spirit fell there in russia now watch brother branham said the baptism of the holy ghost fell the first time since pentecost in russia 100 years ago that's right that's history and they had the baptism of the holy spirit worked signs and wonders a hundred years ago and rejected it russia as a nation and turned it down and when they did they have now turned to an anti-god anti-religious become communists cold brutal hearted if you won't listen to god he'll give you over to a spirit that'll condemn you and be turned over to a reprobate mine to believe a lie and be damned by it and that's where the russian stands tonight is damned in the sight of god because it failed to receive the jubilee message of the baptism of the holy spirit that were turned over to a reprobate mind they believed a lie and are down by it in the sight of god that's russia that's the condition of that country all americans can now clap their hands and say oh yeah you know down with russian up with ukraine and up with this and up with america well listen to this and it's your life worthy of the gospel i want you to listen to this indictment against the nations because remember in our generation they are rejecting the seal of god remember laodicea turns christ down now if russia had accepted the pentecostal blessing 75 years ago when the holy ghost fell in russia there wouldn't be communists today now 75 years ago they had a great revival in russia god came among them they had great revivals weigh into siberia what did they do they rejected it and today the country is gone and the churches can't have church only under permission and they're doomed under into judgment has gone off in this wild tantrum of communism and sold out to the devil yay rushes of the devil 50 years ago the holy ghost fell in england just after that came george jeffries and f.l bosworth and charles price and smith wigglesworth and those great warriors of the faith 50 years ago and offered the england the holy ghost revival but what they do they laughed at them they put them in jail they called them crazy thought they'd lost their minds the churches refused the people to come hear them they were healed of they healed the sick and they cast out devils they'd done great work and because that because at england as a nation rejected the gospel her sins is known throughout the world there's hardly a more apostate nation in the world even including rome and france and then england she is a mother of apostasy right where finney and many of the great men preached in the hay market and charles g finney and wesley and on down and she turned it down and even last week in the paper she find out great men so weak into the sex of women until spies come in and their head man found some of them mowered them and their magazines just packed it in their sin scandals and right in their government is so disgrateful name their disgraceful name across the world she's rejected the truth she has her at her excuse and she finished she's finished the england is all washed up with god a long time ago yay england america 15 years ago nothing to say of azusa street but just 15 years ago this is 63 when the great divine healing revival continued on from pentecost to jesus street broke out in the nation and there was revivals in the capitals washington dc you've seen them you've watched deep calling the deep right there right there in the capitol just a block down from the from the white house amen the president's vice president great peoples governors great things taking place governors and men were healed like congressman upshaw had been a crippled for 66 years and they could not turn their face and say it wasn't so it was right before them but they turned it down and tonight that's the reason this nation stays she's doomed there's no hope for it at all she has crossed the line between judgment and mercy and she's elected in what she has here to control the nation and today we have yet another catholic president a total rep of bait come on amen awoke generation are you with me she has rotten to the car her politics are rotten you cannot say we had an honest election it didn't happen hey man the morals of this nation is lower than anything i can imagine her religious system is rotten her than her morals she becomes in doing this she's now joined herself and all the churches and the nation to a federation of churches and has taken the mark of the beast what a thing cry why christ gave them opportunity come to my feast the feast of pentecost which means 50 and when he when the holy spirit poured out of russia they were that was they were called to the feast of pentecost spiritual feasts they turned it down to england the holy ghost was poured out upon them they turned it down america the holy ghost was poured out upon them and they turned it down don't you see revelation chapter 3 laodicean age christ on the outside while saying i'm rich and i increase it good and god i don't need you come on amen he said he bid three times and three times he sent out they did not listen to the feast and then he said again he said go compel the people to come in the table's got to be set the table's ready there's still room and i believe oh my that maybe within the next few months or year or whatever it is god is going to send another shaking across the country because there's somebody there's a predestinated seed out there that the light has to channel somewhere somewhere in the world the nation itself is gone she's gone but god's shaking another people there's somebody gonna receive it amen they will be born of the word they will be baptized with the holy ghost they will drink from el shaddai they will take her strength from him are you with me church amen as he said i was down this week and i saw in little rock or hot springs said the the governor of the state of new york some kind of striptease over in honolulu honolulu dancing with her below that another renowned man what a disgrace look at our nation today look at the condition of our nation look where she's went to how she has sunk and that was minor to what's going on today it's not just in the governments in your neighborhood it's in your schools it's everywhere you look look at the religious system how can it be that the churches can ever get in that condition area now because they have rejected and refused the message of god the invitation to come to the feast could you call that a life worthy of the gospel that you could you call a life that would set and permit the people to do the things and smoke cigarettes and then he tells about a church you know what down at a ballgame they were having the pastor smoked cigarettes after another another baptist church they had to let out the for the church from sunday school and extra 15 minutes so they could smoke and he said john the john smith the founder that church prayed so hard that god sent a revival till his eyes swole at night and his wife had to lead him to the table and feed him with a spoon that man would turn over his grave if he knew the church that church had got in that condition that's the only thing remember jesus said those that were bidden and turned it down would not chase his supper when god i want you to hear this when god sends the holy ghost and he knocks at a man's door and he deliberately turns it down sometime he'll turn it down for his last time amen then you won't be a privileged character you can sit in church and listen to the gospel agree with the gospel it might be so much to say i know it's right but never put a finger to it to help yourself you just listen to it you know i believe it's right that's just sympathizing with i he said i can believe that's the ten thousand dollars or i could believe that's good water to drink i mean you know but refuse to drink it you know what i mean this is eternal life and to refuse it one day you'll cross the line between judgment and mercy you won't be privileged then to come and receive it let me tell you we're really close to letting those with our filthy be filthy still and those that are holy be holy still there comes a time where the line gets crossed there will be a day in the near future there'll not be another soul saved are you with me there's a day in the new fear near future not another opportunity will be given to really receive the life of jesus christ the last one will be receive the token the ticket the holy ghost to go in the rapture and you can't go without it are you with me we are in a serious hour and when the nation is condemned why don't we clap for america too because our nation is condemned she is lost she's crossed the line between judgment and mercy you can't vote somebody in that are changing you can't elect a president even the scallywag we got in with mr trump he couldn't do anything they fought him on every hand for every good thing he tried to do and they wrecked everything just as soon as they come in and wrecked it until we have a wrecked economy a wrecked nation wreck value wrecked police force wrecked everywhere erect political system everything is in shambles and there is no hope in this country the only hope there is is a rapture that's why it is so important for you today to be nursing from el shaddai to take your promises to get your strength from the holy ghost and pull from the word of god amen that's why it is important for you to nurse on that holy ghost until your body is changed until your experience is no more stale and stagnant and yesterday's memory but it is a fresh and it is up today it is something that you're getting straight from today [Applause] by rejecting your day of visitation it separates you from god now i've been laying these things in very methodically and very carefully i have been doing more teaching than preaching some of these brothers will pick up on some of these things and they'll catch the inspiration of it and they will preach it evangelistically but these things have got to be laid out where you fully understand where you're standing where you know your day your hour your visitation and what's important in this time when you preach you hit the surface of things now i'm going to go just a little further because i know i know our time is now running out and i haven't really got into where i want to go but i'll recap it back off when i come again next week i'll be in phoenix but i'll come back again and i'll recap some of this but i want you to know i want you just i want you to realize as we go through these things don't dismiss these move of gods in the past as something that wasn't real and that their experiences are unneeded in the early 1900s god dealt with the pentecostals with an outpouring of the holy ghost and since there's a bride of all ages there were elect pentecostals who received the message of the baptism of the holy ghost and they were elect men at their time don't look back at azusa street and say oh they're just a bunch of backwash that was a false move it was a real move it's where the life of god was at that time elect men among those elect was john g lake apostle to south africa great man of faith smith wigglesworth f bosworth host of many others there were also hundreds of other men and women who wrote on that wave of revival and they were born of the word for their age the truths that were being released at that time and let me just tell you of them they will make up them and be part of that great ransom throng in the resurrection they will be joined by wesley and the methodist age the luther and the lutheran age and the others from previous ages and they're just as much bright as we are they'll be at the marriage supper of the lamb however it is that same pentecostal azusa age not these elect women but the pentecostals who are that lukewarm portion who reject truth and are spewed out of the mouth of god and the real glory is gone the real outpouring of the spirit is void and many times it's just left even brother branham would make note of this with just a bunch of whooped up music where people are worked up and the tongues were given given away from the original to a worked up bunch of nonsense or a confusion of language i never received the holy ghost in a pentecostal meeting i went to pentecostal meetings till i was 9 years old 13 11 11 years old i've been the altar there i tried to get the holy ghost there i had my experience of being beat on the back my chin dribbled my instructions to say jesus jesus jesus jesus until you get a confusion of language i never could speak in tongues i have but i never did it there but let me tell you something it didn't start out that way and i'm going to just tell you our message did not start out as a powerless message without healing without miracles without signs without wonders without power it did not start out just simply believing the message is right and you got the holy ghost it didn't start that way the pentecostal movement if i could just go with you just for a moment because i want you to understand that though there is a false there is real and even brother branham would tell us in 1963 and stand in the gap he said though has been though it's been impersonated there's always to be a real genuine gift of speaking in tongues in the church but we as a message community have largely dismissed it all as being false and we threw out the baby with the bathwater but it didn't start out that way to be jabber and gibberish it started out as a genuine move of god genuine tongues that could be understood when the holy ghost fell it fell first in topeka canyon or topeka kansas under charles parnum this would happen about 1900 1906 would be azusa street it would start in that movement from a black brother who was a convert under charles parnum and was a who had been taught in his schools because he had he taught classes on the holy ghost and brother seymour would be would be um would receive that experience and then he would go to to azusa street preach these things or he would hear these things hear the priest and then would have that experience in 1906 but when it fell in topeka canyon kansas i don't think there's even a canyon there but under charles parnum he talked about you know the history of that movement talks about a woman who rose in the meeting and spoke for 10 minutes no one in the audience knowing what she said and an indian who had come there and was visiting from the pawnee reservation in the territory that day and he visited the services she stated that she heard him speaking in the language of her tribe and that he could understand every word of the testimony there are no zeus street when the holy ghost fell there people traveled from all the world to investigate what was happening it was a large um probably more medium-sized auditorium with a upper room upstairs and the the place was open day and night for several years they would have preaching two or three times a day and the people would be in the prayer room day and night there was a prayer prayer going on night and day at the close of the preaching the crowds would would retire to the upper room to pray some more and when the time came from preaching every service the people had to be called from the from the upper room of the place and someone would ring a bell they'd all come downstairs for the service there was a young teenage girl there by the name of kathleen scott she was there praying in that upper room of the azusa mission there was a man that entered the building and hearing prayers he he went upstairs to the prayer room and the moment he entered kathleen moved by the spirit of rose and she began to point at the man as he stood at the head of the stairway and spoke in a language other than her own for several minutes then the ringing of the bell started calling the people to the preaching service he interrupted it and the man grabbed a hold of kathleen and went downstairs and waited until the order was restored in the auditorium as it was getting ready for the preaching and he testified he said i am a jew i came to this this city to investigate the speaking in tongues no person in this city knows my first or my last name and i'm here under an assumed name nobody knows my occupation or anything about me i go to hear preachers for the purpose of taking their sermons apart and using them in lecturing against christian religion but said this girl as i entered the room she started speaking in a hebrew language she told me my first name and my last name she told me why i was in the city and what my occupation was in life and called me to repent and she told me the things about my life that would be impossible for any person in this city to know and then he dropped to his knees and prayed as though his heart would break that's jesus christ the same there was a man by the name of jacob robert the jew he was a christian but a guilty one because he hid his christianity he's a rabbi he didn't want anybody to know that he believed in christ he had his deep split within himself one swelter night in 1960 of july 1960 remember the healing revival still going on he's invited by my friend to the first assembly of god church in pasadena texas while that revival was in progress he was invited to go to it and he was a little reluctant to go because he was wary of their emotionalism he heard about but he agreed to go the service was a typical pentecostal service it was songs testimonies hand clapping finally a sermon and at the end of the sermon the evangelist invited anyone present who had a personal problem to come to the altar and receive prayers received the prayers of the congregation and suddenly he was this jacob he was seized with a whole longing a great longing to lay down this burden some double life he had carried so long to resolve once and for all that conflict that was in him when the preacher asked about his special need and what it was he didn't say anything he just remained silent and the evangelist said that's all right god knows your needs better than you know yourself and turn in the congregation he requested to the to the the people that come stood around him to to pray in the spirit form and at that there was several men left their seats and come to stand behind the kneeling rabbi some stood behind him some son stood by sightings a few laid their hands on his head and shoulders and others just simply bowed their heads and they began to pray and speak in simon simultaneously some was in english others was in tongues and suddenly jacob raised up from there and turned to look behind him and his cheeks were flushed and wet and he said that was beautiful which one of you is jewish he looked around said well which one of you knows me you forgive me i i don't recognize you who is it that knows me among you men here you were just talking there was still no answer the church became silent said it came right here right here from behind me is that just exactly where you're standing he said to one of the man are you jewish and he said me he said no i'm irish my name is john grubber said you speak hebrew he said no he said i i don't speak hebrews but that's the voice that's the voice right there said i don't understand a word in hebrew and he stood up and he said you were speaking hebrew right then and he told the story his voice was full of emotion he said can you imagine and and john and and jacob would say later and said can you imagine that big irishman behind me speaking the most beautiful hebrew i'd ever heard could you imagine an irishman speak in hebrew at all and he said how do you know my father's name no one in texas knew my family but here he said i've dreamed a dream and hebrews said it perfect hebrew i've dreamed a dream that you will go into the big populated places and there you will preach and there will be ones that will that have not heard will understand you because you jacob son of rabbi ezequal will come in the full fullness of the blessings of the gospel of jesus christ and the rabbi looked at us and said what do you make of that and there that man turned there from his split decision there of trying to hide as a jew and be a christian become a real christian so no it wasn't just gibberish or jabber there was real genuine speaking in tongues and the prophet of god said it's always supposed to be in the church now i just want to say if that happened in the plant while it was the shuck what about when it's in full grain i just want to say you know we think so many times oh but it's drying time now you know that just can't happen today we don't need that today that you see that was when the plant was green and we're the golden grain and all the moisture has now been baked out and we're laying in the presence of the sun and ripened and you didn't ripen you rotted that's not what that means it means all the immaturity is baked out the greenness immaturity parcel word has now given away to full word partial inheritance to full inheritance like brother branham said we now have the perfect divine interpretation of the word of god and he said and jumping up and down trying to speak with tongues is over with jumping up and down like a kid he said trying to speak in tongues is over with it's not that tongues is over with i mean goodness that's part of the word how could we leave part of the word behind it's trying to speak with tongues by jumping up and down working up an emotion you see the greenness has been baked out we do not have to have a we do not have to have a an impersonation we can have the real that impersonation is over with this is when it comes back to genuine grain again brother branham told us in the third exodus he told us he said he equated it like the brothers of joseph when they sow that dreamer down to egypt and said we won't need your visions boy we won't need your dreams yeah your dream ha ha ha you know you what what's going to come up now you're going to be a slave down in egypt we were going to kill you but we can make some money out of this we don't want prophecy we don't want speaking in tongues and he said he said you see what i mean he said i'm sure you can catch that that's a reason of it is because they thought they would never need it they thought they would never need that dreamer they'd never need the holy spirit to speak they were seed of abraham they were prosperous but they didn't know there was a famine coming they didn't know that the prophecy was still going to be fulfilled are you with me and he said that's the reason they thought they'd never need it we don't need speakers with tongues oh no this is after the seals he said we we don't need interpretation interpreters of tongue we no no longer need old testament prophets to set us in order by the holy spirit we understand it they've adopted man-made systems to take the place of the holy spirit therefore listen this therefore there are people that's elected who has their names on the lamb's book of life they can't go for that they are spiritual minded therefore they cannot go for that they cannot stand it they no matter if their fathers and mothers was lived in whatever organizational church you see brother branham in his clothes in prayer and it is rising of the sun he would pray this he would ask god to pour out the quickening power of the holy ghost upon his saying quicken their mortal bodies then we shall hear genuine new tongues powers of god love and told dying grace living grace and a resurrected christ a body of bride representing him on the earth that was brother brandon's prayer over us are you with me in in condemnation by representation again a prayer over his church in jeffersonville granted father healed the sick and afflicted bring them back to the old-fashioned revival type of the people today of people today bring them back to original pentecost bring them back to the blessing bring them back like pentecostal in a.d 33 give them the pentecostal blessing may the power of god come into the church may there be divine healing gifts give to the church may there be speakers with tongues interpreters or tongues may there be gifts of prophecy and all different manifestations and not make believe or try to believe or put on but may it be real genuine coming with the word the word of god made known prophesying things that comes to pass amen let me just say it as we try to sum it up if the light that was in the stump produce justification want the seed be justified if the life that was in the apostle produced sanctification won't the seed also be holy if the light that was in the shop produced the gifts of the spirit won't the seed have the same amen how can we deny any part of this word all of the word will be summed up headed up into the grain hallelujah he speaks of this maturity and by the way he refers us all the way through his his ministry it's a scripture that is seldom preached to anymore today you hardly ever hear a message preacher refer to this scripture and brother branham did it all the way to his last sermon in 1965 and now it's an overlooked forgotten scripture now y'all sparked your curiosity long enough to kind of get your attention just before i close isaiah 28 9. whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast what's now he's going to have somebody he can teach knowledge there is a people that know their god who will do exploits amen there will be a people none of the wicked will understand but the wise shall understand you say brother tim you've been preaching about drinking from el shaddai this is totally different this is now the scripture referring to something here as immaturity and he said who shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine them that are coming to maturity if we're in the grain we should understand doctrine amen we should have received the knowledge of the truth amen for precept must be upon precept that means command that must be upon command anymore if what bible commands that a woman not to cut her hair they don't cut their hair if it commands they don't paint your face they'll paint their face if it says that a man should cut his hair he don't wear his hair long like a hippie come on somebody amen if the bible commands something if he commands me baptized in the name of jesus christ for remission of sin we obey what he said if he said you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost there's somebody going to receive it amen for command must be upon command and line or rule upon rule here a little very little hallelujah amen that's the whole gospel it comes from genesis to revelation and the whole gospel must be brought out the full gospel must begin here and they preached it and when they did the power of the holy ghost came look word upon word scripture upon scripture it almost compiled together amen oh my you see and our experience then must tie with the scripture what's now far with stammering lips another tongue will he speak to this people to whom he said this is the rest hallelujah this is what the holy ghost does this is the rest the repressing amen wherewith you may call the weary to rest and this is refreshing but they wouldn't hear it now again brother branham preaches this and brings it out even in his message communion and he said when did that happen he said when was this scripture here fulfilled seven hundred and twelve years later on the day of pentecost stammering lips set upon the people and they were filled with the holy ghost and began to speak with other tongues and the holy ghost took their lives over and they ceased from their worldly thing then they entered into a rest with christ this is the finished work hallelujah this is a seal this is the sabbath and paul applies the scripture to how the holy ghost speaks in tongues look in first corinthians 14 21 in the law it is written with men of other tongues and other lips will i speak into this people yet for all of that they will not hear me saith the lord wherefore tongues are for a sign and then he goes on he said it's a sign to them that believe not amen but nevertheless it is a sign it is there it is a it is a sign it is there with a with stamina lips and another tongue i will speak to this people again i'm showing you if god still speaks in genuine tongues no it's not the initial evidence of the holy ghost it's just one of the evidences of the holy ghost the holy ghost says many things the holy ghost is the word in the word is the power amen these signs will follow them that believe that is the sa that is the sign of a holy ghost church they will lay hands on the sick that is a sign of the holy ghost church in action amen if they will cast out devils they will have power to make satan flee that is a sign of a holy ghost church they will speak with new tongues that is a sign of a holy ghost church though it's been though it's been totally impersonated though it has been confused you today can still drink from el shaddai you still can receive from the full word of god amen there will be in this bright tongue's interpretation prophecy gifts of the spirit because it's in the word that will be word of knowledge come on amen there will be word of wisdom there will be laying hands on the sick and they shall recover there will be power abram that is laying in that drive that will be overcoming power living in his people even she will not be a powerless group of people that leave out of here but she'll be a people with genuine movement fullness of the holy ghost with full power full anointing full presence
