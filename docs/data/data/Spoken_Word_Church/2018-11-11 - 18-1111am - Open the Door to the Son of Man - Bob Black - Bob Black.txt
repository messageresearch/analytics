to do this morning I'm not used to opening up the Sunday morning service so I if I you know mess everything up y'all just show me some grace but I talked to brother waiting brother Dale this morning and they they made it their safe to Kentucky and playing it you know both ways appreciate brother Beiler's this morning so just remember the Eman and pray for them that everything will go well and then they're gonna go and apparently the forecast is for rain and they're wantin snow and I'm not really a hunter shot I understand how that works but we'll we'll just pray and believe for a little bit of snow instead of rain that everything will just work out and they'll come back bless that everybody will get exactly what they wanted to get then and as far as that goes and then today is Veterans Day and if you know you know we got Memorial Day which is celebrating the ones that had passed away in service and Veterans Day celebrates the ones that had served in the military so we just want to I believe actually so I don't miss anybody could you just raise your hand if you were veteran here I believe brother Colley brother Daugherty brother Joe all right and brother Johnny and brother dick are missing today brother brother Donnie went up there with him and brother dick is out cuz his wife is not feeling well today and he called us more than just to let us know so we will definitely remember them in prayer but thank the Lord for all the veterans that have have fought for our freedom and for all good things yes if if it wasn't for the ones that had gone before and and kind of gotten together with some when I preached last Sunday we were talking about how really you know in the gospel the ones that had gone before make it a whole lot easier for the young ones falling behind because they kind of paved the way and they take care of tackling all the all the hard stuff and and you know we're you know brother brother waiting brother they aren't here so I can talk about them I just really appreciate them so I don't even know if they're really ever understand how much I appreciate the the kind of like an old icebreaker goes through and you can follow behind and guess it gets everything all smooth out of the way so you just all you got to do is just yield to the Lord and you follow up kind of in their footsteps so we just we just think that thank the Lord for the ministry that he's given to us and for the word that he's given in this bag alright let's go to the to the word I'm gonna read this morning um did I see system Milko back there well praise a little sister milk oh you're gonna get to hear this again you gonna get a double-header because I preached this over there last Sunday so you get to hear it twice but we're going to read from Matthew 24 23 verse 23 to 33 and then revelation 3:20 but before we get into the word let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to you Lord for the word that you've given unto us in this sight in this day and order we just Lord there's so many mysteries and things that seem kind of hard to probe it or but yet you've given them to us in our hands Lord and you've laid them in our lap and really the only thing for us to do Lord is just to open up the door of our heart and and to receive what you've given for us and I pray Lord that this morning in order may be something that be said to help somebody to just crack that door open a little just keep open it up until you have total preeminence in Lord as we were listening to that sermon that was playing before the service now I believe that you were working in continuity because you the prophets saying about how you won't they have preeminence in your people Lord of God help us this morning Lord Jesus to just open the eyes of our heart Lord God Lord we know Lord's usually said we've come together gathering together and what kind of gathering would it be if you weren't welcome here Lord and so we just welcome you Lord with with open hearts open arms everything just inviting you in to come and fellowship with us and we know you're here Lord because it the songs have been sung the atmospheres been set the little believers have brought their pillars of fire together together were uniting together in one great big pillar of fire and so we know that your we know that the promise has been fulfilled where you said that where the twos are three is together together you'd be with us we believe it Lord God now come now Lord Jesus and open up the word of our heart that we can be fair that we can receive Lord Jesus that you'd be revealed at us we pray and we ask it the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm gonna take this off Matthew 24 yeah now I have I have preached this before several times but you know I think that's one thing ministers kind of kind of have a problem with sometimes if I preach it again you know but repetition helps us and you know that's one thing I'm kind of learning over the years is that we need it over and over and over to really seek Him and so maybe it'll appreciate a little different this time because you know you look back at your notes and you and and things just keep opening up probably at probably the moment I step off the platform it'll open up even more so it just keeps opening up and unfolding more and more and so let's just read along because I did I'm gonna take a little topic but this morning of a title of open the door to the Son of Man and Matthew 24 23 says then If any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ or there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders insomuch that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect we know brother Branham talked about how that was the Antichrist pointing you to the should look at the wrong thing where Christ is Christ Christ is going to be in his bride behold I have told you before wherefore if they shall say in dB until you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chambers believe it not see identifying the wrong thing for is the Lightning cometh out of the east and Shina theeven under the west so shall also the coming of the Son of man be it Jesus talks a lot about the son of the coming of the Son of Man I'm a priestess this morning like you've never heard of the son of man before I'm just I'm just gonna lay it out cuz you know he talked an awful lot about the son of man and the son of man is a very mysterious thing because this is we have we've heard brother Dale and for the wait have explained us before that really appalled not only that none of the disciples and under the all down through the seven churches never really got into son of man couldn't couldn't talk about it that's a secret waiting for this day for you for it to be revealed to you and I here in this day for so ever the carcass is there will the eagle's be together together the fresh kill fresh kill of the word every day it just keeps getting better and better more and more unfolding immediately after the tribulation of those days shall the Sun be darkened and the moon shall not give her light and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in heaven and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn and they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven with power and great glory the Son of man coming it was this Son of man and he shall send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet and they shall gather together his elect from the four winds from one end of the heaven to the other which is exactly what's happened now we're coming from different places all gather in the gap because that's what that's what you've all come together this morning for as is hopefully to hear the word and that's what gathers you together is the word you heard the word and it brings you together you see and he shows and now learn a parable of the fig tree when his branch is yet tender and putteth forth leaves you know that summer is not so likewise ye when ye shall see all these things know that in the year even at the doors so there's doors there's a lot of different doors but I want to talk about this one particular door that involves a lot of different doors being opened let's talk let's look at revelation 3:20 I know we've heard this being preached a lot but you know like like Matthew Mark Luke and John all preached Jesus different little ways I maybe look turn it a little bit different and maybe it'll be helpful for you this morning behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me you may be seated the Lord is a blessing to the earth was reading the word behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me and sup means to come in and have communion with you and open up the word and reveal himself to you that's what's happening today well you know brother Branham preached just from faith all the way to communion from faced Communion and if you look at the statue of a perfect man that's the whole journey of a Christian from faith to communion because of communion the word is open up to you fully and and and God has that second fold he asked prettiman SAT and so that's that mystery I'm just gonna lay it out exactly the way I believe it know it that mystery that's been waiting to be revealed all down through the ages that capstone revelation of the preeminence of God in the church is that capstone revelation now you the the the revelation of the Son of God has been preached down through seven Church ages but now in this end time God sent he came himself because that's what the shout the voice in the Trump was God Himself would come down with a message to turn the hearts of the father that turn turn the hearts of the children back to the original Pentecostal faith of the father's so you know you hear brother Branham say a lot of strange things like you know he begins to talk about his tight we're turning a corner now and you know that kind of blows people's minds that we're turning a corner not turning a corner who says we're turning a corner well but the prophet of God said we're turning the corner he said say strange things like you know I'd rather live in this time than any other time why would why would he say that this time when it looks like it looks like the church is getting bombarded from every direction and and the true believer is getting trimmed down into a smaller and smaller minority and everything is getting smaller and smaller so many people are falling away but yet there's gonna be a true bride that's gonna that's gonna receive the word for her day and accept it and become God revealed in a human flesh you know I I was talking to another brother recently about how years ago that even that that kind of that kind of preaching would be received as what are you what are you talking about brother by a brother who ever was would be saying it john 14:29 that day you shall know that i my father one that i am in you and you and me and i'm and you know how it goes everything's all wrapped up together and you'll know who you'll know who you are you'll know who he is and and just say that god will be inside of you dwelling inside of you that it just kind of boggles your mind but yet we know we know just by looking around at the signs of the times that what what's going on in this day that something's taking place you know you think about those all the different prophecies that brother Branham talked about that things would begin to transpire as as things as the word will begin to unfold it would have an effect on the world that the devil is doing something at the same time there are all those different prophecies of the of the electric cars coming into being and and how you know years ago we think that that God that they'd have to like run a track down in the middle of the road but now you can see you can see it more clearly that it's that Google and different cars Teslin and they're putting GPS devices in the cars so that they don't have to have a track in the road but they can run without without wires within it without any of those kind of things and it just keeps unfolding because things keep moving that's just exactly how the gospel is it the gospel keeps unfolding as you keep getting into it little layers come off and you begin to see more and more as it has an effect on you and you talked about how that prophecy of how Nazism and fascism will move into communism and and we can see that coming to pass today as well and the Worman rule in America that you know I they sent me an out my work sent me down to Orlando a few weeks ago maybe a month or so ago for working to go to a conference and all during that conference they they kept it's putting so much emphasis on women leadership women women their special groups for women and special groups for that well I so much special focus on women because because in the natural that's there's a special focus on women but in their spiritual God is putting a special focus on his bride because she's the one that's going to fulfill that new test all the new testament scriptures are going to be wound up in you and i got to be careful i'ma get on this afternoon's message because this afternoon I would be speaking on the New Testament for field and where does that fulfill that so you can see all of these things bringing right up to America and ruins at all these things being moving up so you can see just by looking at the natural that what something has got to be taking place and what's taking place is God is having a preeminence and as a bride he there's something spiritual that's happening something spiritual that took place that that caused man to even start thinking about going to the moon to leave the earth because God's got spiritual astronauts that are fixing to leave this earth and you know you start thinking I'm going to leave this one of these days I'm gonna leave this earth you can't leave that you're not gonna leave this earth just because you want to just because you you said it in your mind that it would be a good idea for me to leave this earth I think the rapture is a good idea but you have to open up the door to the son of man and receive that son of man in Revelation that's the secret that's the key to leaving the earth you say well I think it'll be a grand idea I have us grand notion that that you know that's how a lot of people in the message today they sit in message churches and they say because I'm hearing the message because I'm here around it that's what brother Branham got onto you on the token message if you want to go back and listen to the token just because you around the message does not mean that the message is in you just because you're around and you talk about the rapture does not mean that that you're going to take a rapture there's a secret to take a rapture and it's not just that you got born again there's a secret to going straight from from walking around to to having your body changed and that's secret that god himself came down and spoke through a prophet and preached from 1963 on that message yeah I understand not not in the years of preparation not in the years leading up to that because when brother Branham preached his spoken word is the original seed he said there's something there's something else that's got to come he said that Malachi 4:5 6 has not yet been fulfilled modify Malachi 4:5 6 says that there's going to be a man come to preach the return back to the original face to preach that original face first that that message had to be preached to return back to the original faith and now it's up to you and I to receive that that's the second fold of the threefold mystery of Christ revealed in his church the second folders you receive that you receive that word and you become the word so that God has preeminence in you and that's what the Son of Man revelation is the son of man is not just part word we're brother I'm said in this in the seven churches they dipped into the into the Son of God revelation they dipped into it a little bit that through Martin Luther preached to justification and they dipped into a little bit they had just a little bit understanding John Wesley dipped into it they had a little bit more understanding of sanctification where where Luther occurred what John Wesley could look at at scriptures like there in Thessalonians where it said he didn't entirely sanctify you and he didn't quite have a perfect understanding of what that sanctification was the sanctification of the Spirit what God had come to cleanse you and make you walk like you and what like him and talk like like you and like human and all those things but but not just dipping into this into a son of God now we've come beyond that into where the God can reveal himself in the full preeminence have total control over the individual and by total control I mean down on the inside of you got--he's redeems your soul down on the inside he redeems your soul that faith that's Galatians 120 because he puts his life inside of you he puts it I know I don't live the life I live I live by the faith of the Son of God I live by his faith because when you get born again he gives you his faith and that becomes you become like a little solar system with that Sun down on the inside a son inside because to quote control everything it starts having control and it begins to work its way out so that the planets all of your your five senses your memory reason constants affection they begin to be under control to that to that Sun down on the inside lip against a movie you begin to cast down reads and you begin to say I don't when that that carnal that carnal thought which is enmity with the Word of God because they rise up and say it's not it's not possible for you to be God it's not possible for God to dwell on the inside of you begin to gas down reason with things that work come up and you get you get laid off and whatever guy I know that God he's Jehovah Jireh I know he's still able to provide he's still able to give me a job because he said he'll not leave he'll not forsake us he'll not leave us I've never seen the righteous forsaken or begging bread and so that that faith begins to work out from you and and then the whole the holy the Holy Ghost is what sealing it all in together but yet there's something missing there's something missing when brother Branham preached the smoking world his original seed he said there's something something else has to happen there's got to be a third pool open up because when brother Brandt preached the third pool he went through the third pool and I'm just gonna be real playing I hope I'm not blowing anybody's mind this morning this is the third pool because you go through three pools your own self you there's three pools of your journey just like there were three pools of brother Browns journey just like there were three pools of Noah's journey and three pools of Moses journey and three pools of Abraham's journey and three pools of Jesus's journey they all went through three pools and you've got to go through three pools that's the only way that you can know who is this Melchizedek basis because you've gone through that same journey that Melchizedek went through you go through the same thing and then you can be identified with him you can have that same kind of understanding because you've gone through three pools but there's got to be something happening for you to go for that three put that third pool open up to you that what happens is that God sent a message the son of man message to open up everything to open up what the doors in the door is open up with the true baptism of the Holy Ghost is their token token Christ the mystery of God revealed what the what the message what the message is all about and that that open that when you would get into this into the messages preached after the seals then the word begins to open up to you it becomes it begins to come become a living reality to you and that's what you've got to open up the door to the son of man when you open up the door of the Son of Man that the son of man begins to be revealed at you but you have to open up that door I ain't even looked at my nose you got to open up the it's uh it's left up to you you know you know brother branham he talked about how that that the devil's giving you a vote he votes that you not gonna believe it and God voted for you that you will believe it and it's left up to you to whether you go which way you're gonna vote it's up it's up to you God's not gonna override your free moral agency he's not gonna override your freewill you're not like a plan or a mountain or a thing where I could just speak to and say let it move let it let it do because he won't he won't just speak to you like that he'll speak to you through the lips of a man behind the pulpit but you're different than a plan or a mountain or or a river or something you have to open up the door yourself you've got to get into the word and find out what it says you know and I don't wanna I want to say something encourage I want to be encouraged and identifying to you because when you do open up the door when you open up the door to the capstone revelation then that capstone revelation becomes revealed in you it becomes alive in you when you begin to see what what the Prophet is really talking about and I believe that's what the fivefold ministry will sit for the fivefold ministry was sent for the edifying of the church what does that mean the edifying of the church it means when people come to church they sit they sit around and they begin to get in their mind well they're the born-again experiences all it takes I'm born again and and that's all there is to it here I sit and I believe the message I believe that God sent a prophet but there's more than that to it because brother Brown said that you're born again and then you're baptized into the body you know what does that mean you're baptized into the body that means that you come through from glory unto glory through stages that bad the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the revelation to you it's as it's revealed God takes you up higher and higher from from a loop a low point from a little child from a little baby where you can t you don't even know how to turn the keys you don't know how to drive the car and he build you up and build you up until you know what to do with the word that's what the son of man revelation is it somebody that know that God can trust what to do with the word you know you know we we all want to get into the speaking condition we want to get into back take us back to where Adam could speak to the mountains speak to the stream and it would obey Him whatever comes out of his mouth would what would come to pass like brother man I was speaking to the squirrels speak to the wind speak to the waves but how could you do that if God can't trust you with it God's not gonna give that kind of authority to a little baby that can't don't even know what to do with the car keys but he's gonna he's got a he's got a he's got to train you and make sure that you are a mature Christian and maturity does not come through psychology it doesn't come through no morality book somewhere you know people tried today trying to find a way to get their home life straightened up to get there all the problems in life through through psychological books and whatnot if you get into the capstone revelation and straighten up your home life and straighten up your personal life and straighten everything up you don't need psychology all need morality what you need is the risen Christ the resurrected Savior in your life it is the rising of the Sun and he's risen this is the rising of the Sun where the light would come to the top of the tree and it wouldn't it would show forth its glory in his church and his bride it's the rising of the Sun because he's risen he's taking you from from a little baby for him what he's redeemed your soul on up through the second pool the redemption of the spirit and now it's time for you to catch the revelation of the redemption of your body to win the adopt it's Adoption time you know when brother branham when he talked about things like that when he would say those strange sayings like it's bride time it throws people for a loop it's bride time it what does that mean it's time that the bride is catching the revelation of this hour in the revelation of this hour is a resurrection revelation the voice of the resurrection the voice of the redemption of the body because we're the son of man is death cannot abide with a son of man when the son of man is around death as god somebody's got to come up from the grave when the when the voice of the resurrection is sounding and the lives of the people because the voice of the blood has a voice when his life is sounding forth in you when it's speaking out the others something's got to happen how can death abide in the son of when the presence of the son of man when the Son of Man is revealed in his people somebody's going to come up from the grave that's the message of the hour your brother might have said it's Adoption time it's adoption time what does that mean that means that he's took you to you from this little baby form adoption where you were you were walking around and seeing didn't know anything about a Gentile with the the the apostles and and things that it's a column barbarians not knowing anything about the scripture not having any understanding of what what salvation is not not having an understanding understanding of the of the genealogies that he talked about but yeah he adopted us into this body he pulled us out he called us out and adopted us into the family but now he's drawing us up into a place where you you're a mature Christian and not not tossed about by every wind of doctrine not tossed about by air every time somebody a preacher out on the internet says something strange whatnot I believe it's coming time now where we know where we stand we know who we are and when the bride begins to realize who she is she becomes an invincible army why because she knows the tricks of the devil she knows what the devil's up to she knew that she can die she's identified with the scripture for her day and she knows the hour that she's living in and brother Brennan would say something like it's harvest time because that quart of weed has been planted and it's grown through seven Church ages and now it's come to maturity now the little art is being baked out into the light of the Sun until every green is baked out and you know you look at a wheat plant being maturing out there in the Sun and the light of the sun shining on it bakes it and it gets harder and harder and harder that little wheat kernel is able to withstand but something happens in the shuck the shuck can't stand it anymore and it pulls away that's that's what's happening now I believe the shuck is pulling away and when the shut pulls away then the bride could really come into her full manifestation she can't come into full manifestation until the shut pulls away but when the shuck pulls away and all of the green is baked out of it then you'll see something happen then you'll see then you'll see a true anointing I believe that's what brother Dale's been preaching on about how you want to see you want to see that that revival get the word back in get that Saru bubble built up the temple he he he got everything he took what had already been preached and said well now this is a little bit out of place this goes over here this goes over here and he got the foundation leaf but now it's time to get that word get the art back into the temple and then you'll see the pillar of fire come back in then you'll see an anointed Church then you'll see but what we need to do we need to make sure that the ground is all tilled up that we're ready so that that that son of man capstone word will have a play a place of good ground to fall into a good ground and I know I know how this kind of preaching is we were talking about last Sunday about how years ago you come around to the messaging and several of us were about how everything just seems like you almost don't even know what what they're talking about what what are they talking about but you just keep Word word world on top of word and she keeps building until the word begins to unfold and you begin to have an understanding you begin to have a revelation of what's taking place and so if it just sounds very mysterious to this this morning I assure you just keep hanging on just keep hanging on because it will keep unfolding to you and what what we're after though what we're after what we're in this for is the redemption of the body so keep hanging on until that capstone revelation keep unfolds to you and get into that that's that's where the focus is let me drink some water here everybody doing all right and Matthew 24 says so likewise ye when you shall see all these things know that it is near even at the doors even at the door because you know you think about down when the children of Israel were down in Egypt there's God takes us through doors he takes us from one transition to the other from one place to another from one place in our spiritual journey to another you see that down there in Egypt they they had to go through a door to come out through a door they had to go into that door that was covered over the Lamb blood to come out through that red seed door to be able to come out through death and so God took them from one door to another through the Red Sea on until they got to Kadish Barnea and Katie smart knee oh well you could say that's a door where they they stood there at the door to the promised land but yet they closed the doors of their heart and they said it's not for us how are we supposed to go and take the land when there's giants in the land after all the things that they had seen after all the things that they had witnessed God doing after all the things that they had witness they they failed to go through this door into the promised land this is the promised land into this door over this over this breach into the promised land from sevens from sevens into an eight I hope I'm not blowing anybody much this has been priests for for years and years and I how how could they so they got to keenest Barnea and and and they stopped at that door they failed to keep going on and and and so that God had to had to raise up another generation to be able to take that word and and carry out because you see what a Dory is a door is a separator when you go through this door when you go through each of these doors it separates you from from the world that if the love it for the love of the world's in you the love of God is not even in you so as you go through these doors it separates you more and more and more from the world until the final separation you step through that door you overcome death death the last is the last enemy to be destroyed and you step through that door and escape the bonds of the earth but what what God is doing is he's taking us through these doors and you know how the message works each of these doors had a porter there to stand to stand so that you hear the message of that day as Irena has preached he was the porter for that day and he preached his message and he opened the door of deliverance so that they could step through out of that church age out of that age into into the being part of the body because God is building his body he's building his body through the preaching of the gospel and so they would have hear that message of that age of arrhenius and it would open up a door and other people of Ministers the five-o ministers would catch that revelation of arrhenius and they would preach it in their little churches all their little simple he's all around and so the ones that hurt they're preaching to step through that door because they were preaching not their own doctrine but they were preaching the same message that they heard Irina's preaching so when we get to this we're not preaching something different everybody thinks to five-foot ministry is preaching their own ideas that we've gone beyond the preaching their brother and we're not preaching something different we've and what he has preached we received it to ourselves that I believe become the word so that we can preach it back out again and then others can also receive and become that word too so you know really if you don't believe in the fivefold ministry I wonder if you believe that somebody come become the word I believe that you believe I wonder if you believe that anybody couldn't receive the voice for their day and even in the supermarket or even at work or whatever if anybody is able to speak that word and call somebody's life to be changed the preaching of the gospel is the highest form of worship because it's taken it's taken the message and it's preaching it out that others can receive it and become that word and so as they as they preach that word and each agent open up a door and open up a door as they preached it at the end of the end of the previous age and it opened up a door that the others in that age could come through and and in the next stage so Irena has preached at the end of Paul open-up authority and and the ones that received that would become that word for their day until you get to this this day where brother Branham here he's standing and he preaches and spoken word as the original seed something's got to happen Malachi 4:5 6 has not yet been fulfilled it's got to be fulfilled because all of these people standing here something's got to be preached to turn them back to their original faith of the father's to the original faith and what's got to happen is that God was send a third pull message a third pull message to turn your heart back and to literally turn you to literally turn you so that the head could come down and he would have total preeminence over his body total preeminence over you and so when he preached that word it was not just for you to say I believe that he preached it I believe that God sent a prophet but it was preached for you to receive it and to eat it and to eat that body word of the son of man because jesus said except he eat my flesh and drink my blood except you eat my flesh and that blood is inside of you the token life identifiers you with that word living out through you speaking through you a lift voice speaking the gospel out except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you except you eat that body word of the son of man and what will the son of man give the body word eating the body word of the son of man will give you will bring the preeminence to the bride Oh understand what I'm saying this the son of man is not just one individual the bride as a whole was gonna fulfill the son of man the bride because look when the when the head come this is why when Jesus was down in the tomb he he didn't bundle all of the his garments together when he rose from the grave he took he took the part that covered his body and laid it over to the side go back in the scripture and see if it says that then he took the part they covered his head and laid it over to the side because that represented the entire body and when the head comes to the body then it will draw the rest of the body from the grave because the word is attracted to the word like a magnet the only when the word comes and is expressed in individuals the only thing that can happen it's going to be a natural reaction the voice on earth will draw all the dead in Christ from the ground and it will live and walk and so you know when you see when you begin it when the son of man revelation because they open up to you I believe we should be turning in our seats to look for the dead ones they have gone on because one of these mornings between 6:00 and 9:00 you'll turn and you'll see the ones you'll see brother Garrett sitting next to you you'll see you'll see the ones that have gone on sitting next to you and what why is it going to happen because you have eaten the body word of the Son of Man you have opened up the door and who's the door the Bible says that he is the door there's got to be something there's got to be something to open up that door right he is the door and faith is the key that opens up the door and we know that faith comes by hearing faith comes by hearing the word and so what what unlocked each of these doors as the porter preached his a message and the door was open to them a way of escape out of each church age the message of the day the message of the hour received gave each generation face that gave them faith and it allowed them to unlock the door but what about this door what about the door what about the door of death what about the door of the rapture what's going to open up that door is that perfect revelation of who Jesus Christ is the Bible said in John chapter 10 they said in Jesus then said Jesus unto them again verily verily I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door but By Me If any man enter in he shall be Schade saved and shall go in and out and find pasture the son of man is the door and this whole thing is the son of man that's why in Revelation it says that John heard a voice and he turned to see the voice and he saw one like the Son of man walking through the seven golden candlesticks it's been the son of man all the time but he came in a son of God dispensation because they couldn't understand that that capstone revelation had not come so they only had a partial understanding of who he was that it could not completely understand who he is but now you and I can because the capstone revelation has come and you can understand him from Genesis all the way to Revelation you can know the beginning from the end you can know what happened in Genesis what caused the fall and you can know how the New Testament will be fulfilled in the book of Revelation you can see you can read it all the seals have become an open book to us every the seals is what makes is it an open book because what are the seals do the seals unveiled Jesus Christ the seals turn off reveal the whole body word everything that God has done everything that he has done for you every day I the whole redemptive plan everything that he has done to redeem the world it's all torn off so that you can see plainly who he is here's the door and faith opens the door but you know a lot of times the Bible the Bible warns of those that would keep the door shut they the Bible says that you you don't go in yourself and you don't allow others to go in you start thinking about what that really means he starts thinking about what that means and the day of Iranians you had people that would not receive the message for their day but they said they were believers surely you did the the history bears record of that fact and we know that's the case today false prophets was arise and they would begin to say things like you don't you don't need to go to church you don't need to hear the the word for your day you don't need to open up the door of your heart and so they would they would by not they didn't go in they didn't go in and they shut the way for others by not receiving the word for their day and so you can see how by the preaching preaching can either shut the door open the door preaching can open up the door by by preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ to the people so that they can receive something for their selves or it can shut the door where nobody is a it's just the door to the opening of that revelation we're still doing all right it's my prayer I I hope I'm not blowing anybody's mind or anything but I believe this is the truth I believe that I believe that the the minister is called to preach the truth and I believe it's for anybody young or old I you know that's one thing I don't agree with us that that little children need to have a little watered down version of the gospel I believe that everybody can hear the deep truth of the gospel you know these are these children and whatnot you know you look at the things of this world they go out and and and begin to know the depths of Satan you know it's got about got to where today you can go out on the internet and find that you know when I was in high school I you know it was pretty bad but now you can know you can learn about pretty much anything the devil can think of there's somebody out there willing to manifest it and and the Internet is full of that stuff and now you know the kids and the young people everybody can go out there and and learn about the depths of Satan well I believe it's also possible to learn about the death of God you know brother branham preached about he said if a man is able to disable two to fully give themselves over to the devil until the devil's working in them and fulfilling his his dastardly plans and so forth well God is able to fully take over an individual as well and the way he does it by the by the preaching of the gospel so I believe well you know the way I try to do it with my children and whatnot when we gather around used to used to you know that you just had kind of a enough light to preach it I be a good Christian and and and obey your mother and father and do these kind of things but I believe that as the as the years have gone by more and more light as being shown on the gospel until now we can have a little devotional as what we're talking about we're talking about the five companies of Elijah and what that means we're talking about what is the face of the father's we can talk about what is this difference between son of man and son of God and Son of David and we can have those little discussions with with our children to where they know even even without the baptism of the Holy Ghost at least they're taught right at least they know what the statute of a perfect man is I believe every man woman child in here every parent in here is able program said a mother is a preacher of her home everyone is able to raise their children up in the admonition of the Lord by teaching them the message of this day you know you can you hear just just a little bit maybe it like brother wait sometimes says he says you know when you sit in church you you might only be able to get because of our the limit of our thinking capacity might only be able to get this like 15 minutes but when you go home and and your mom and dad they begin to break that word down to you and sit and have a little devotionals and things and begin to open up that word to you but it'll it'll cause an effect but open up open up the door to your heart and see the what what stymies people what causes people to fail to realize what's happening is that the word is being preached the word is being lived through people through individuals how can it be that the Word of God can be lived in an individual this flesh and blood that's walking around on two feet that there's not like visible pillar of fire over them that the word has preached through men's lips that's what you know I somebody was telling me that the reason they don't come to church is because they just can't get past that idea of it that that's just some man up there some man up there speaking and you know another thing that's hard for people to get by is that that God God can live through the individuals of the congregation that a man sitting in a congregation could be could be God made manifest he could be living out that word and that that just that that see how God is revealing himself in simplicity he reveals that he he hides the simplicity and reveals himself in the same he comes down and veils himself like he did in back behind badger skins and then behind the flesh of a man Christ Jesus and he and he veils himself so that the world can't see it and he's veiling himself behind your a nice skin hey man I'm sorry I gotta get some water let's see we we keep the door closed I think think about the son of man when the Son of Man came the Son of Man revelation came everybody was fine everybody was fine as long as brother Branham preached being born again the Pentecostal experience all of those things but when he just like Jesus when Jesus began to say I and my father are one except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood when he began to talk about I am the resurrection and the life when he began to do all those things they loved him when he talked about breaking the bread and the fishes and all those kind of things but when he began to get into that third pool ministry didn't they begin to have a problem with him and see they couldn't go behind there their veil of tradition they had all these these they couldn't go past the tradition of the of the Wesleyan Church and the Lutheran and they got they they got so stuck on you know this is the way my Church believes it this is the way it's been taught for years and you know you can point fingers at the denominational system and everything but but still I believe that even today that's still our problem is because we you know as you come from glory to glory more like really the message is the same as it was 40 50 years ago but I believe that more light has shone on it and so really the preaching of the gospel when you when you heard preachers preach 4050 years ago it seems like it was almost different in a different vein than it is today because more light has been shown on it and so God has taken us he takes us into a greater unfolding of the word and you got to keep up with it if you can't keep up with the footmen how can you keep up when the horsemen come it just keeps getting faster and faster and you got to get moved beyond your traditions where you're still holding to things that somebody taught 20-30 years ago and you you just can't move past that that that false doctrine that a little bit where it just wasn't quite lined up right and you know you hear a preacher preach something it's something I know it's true in my case it'll stick with you for years and years and it's just hard to shake that but when you can let that thing die get that thing away from you and let the true reveal word it slot into place and I know I know I've used the expression like a Tetris game before because that's really what it is the Word of God like those that little block game if you've never played Tetris it's this little block game and little blocks that have to that you try to slide into place and that's what the Word of God is like this this pyramid-building when you can't even get a Razors Edge between because you've accepted the word for your day and it just moves right into place one word at a time because God is building his body he's molding you into his image and if you won't if you got a little tradition or something in in place that block can't slot right in there it won't move right in there if you believe it's not for you it's not for me it does brother branham really mean that did God really mean that and I had a quote about that well we get questions oh here it is and God's Word calls for a total separation he said the question is to the people today does he really mean it and when you accept what the church says does he really mean it then you put yourself in the same condition that Adam did and join yourself with the woman of the church of this world and separate yourself from the blessings that God has promised to every believer that was separate himself from the word world to the word now that's the truth does he really mean it but when you down in your heart of hearts believe that and accept it for that to be the truth and it'll slot right into place then it'll begin to manifest you in your life and I believe that's why brother Branham preached messages like works his faith expressed you know he preached that after the seals because when you really believe that that it'll begin to it'll begin to manifest in your life it becomes the life of Christ you know brother I preached that sermon doors endure after the seals because that's that you've got to open up the doors of your heart he wants to have total complete preeminence in you total control over you not just relegated off to the side somewhere not just put off but every door in your heart every door in your life completely opened up that God can dwell in you that brother I'm talked about the door of tradition the door of egos and ideas and the door of your private life think about a church where every door is flung open wide where God can move freely all throughout the house of your of your being and have total control of you that's what God wants us to be and faith is the key to get us there I'm gonna go ahead and close a little bit earlier they're gonna meet let's let the musicians come on up and we'll we'll just end right there because I believe that faith is the key and how do you get how do you get faith by hearing of the word faith comes by hearing of the word and so how do you get right faith by believing the word for your day by hearing that capstone revelation of the Son of Man except you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no life in you except you eat that body were the son of man you don't have any life God has come down to through seven Church ages through that son of God dispensation until he comes to the final till he finally gets ready to reveal himself a son of man and how is he gonna reveal himself as son of man through one man or through the Bride of Christ there standing on the earth today a man don't believe that a man let's stand to our feet let's just give Him praise [Music] you know this message is the lighthouse that showed us which way to go yes let's just worship Him [Music] [Applause] [Music] that [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I [Music] [Applause] [Music] if there's anything in my life able to eat still job [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man where would this be without that light house of the Son of Man revelation you know I believe that the the worshiper and really what what really brings true worship is a revelation and and how should we be able to worship in this day you know God the Bible says that he inhabits the praises of his people now actually we better be able to praise him in this hour because of the word that we've heard a man the praises after he inhabits the praises of his people because we can give him thanks for what he's done for us in this hour let's just sing that again [Music] this lifter here is to embrace [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] a man you love this morning well let me give you the test
