========================================

all right good morning teer good morning good morning good morning good morning all right here we go we're recording we're ready to go all right now we're in the first seal and we have been this will be number what four yeah number four let's go to Matthew I've got it up here so you know I to open your Bible go to Matthew because we look Martin just come on in there was questions that the um disciples had of Jesus and he went on the Mount of olive this is right before his crucifixion because Matthew 25:26 27 keep going this is when he was crucified all right so he's he's telling they ask him three questions what shall when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world all right great question so Jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you now many of us have read this without Revelation and we we kind of put it off in the future but remember when the seals open the prophet took us straight to Matthew 24 and he started putting the seals in Matthew 24 show knowing that the seals had already been opened or preached by Jesus Christ right okay he knew why he was here he knew what the signs would be and he knew what was his coming back I need to get all of this I don't care about me as long as we get this I want to get the here she was saying I need to move over or something but anyway that's okay many shall come in my name now what's he telling them take heed that no man deceive you now why is Jesus telling the people somebody's going to try to deceive you right from the get-go right from the front very first thing somebody is going to try to deceive you yeah right take heed that no man deceive you for many not one many shall come in my name not in the name of bbub or the name of whoever Buddha Hindu no many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many all right so now we're going to stop right there because that is the first seal you say what's that got to do with the first seal well let's go now to um Revelations 6 we're speaking on the seal Revelation 61 and I saw when the lamb open one of the seals can everybody see that Jo you see that right and and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals I heard it was a noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and say and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sound him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now down Through the Ages many commentaries had believed and shown that that since it being a white horse that it had to do had to do something with Christ Purity righteousness um whatever you want to say um but we found out when the seal was open when when the prophet of God went back to Matthew 24 there's you false Christ looking like a white righteous Church you hear what I said looking like and being so close remember it's going to be so close till it almost will deceive the very left right but it won't it will not ever deceive the elect it'll deceive the foolish virgin it'll deceive deceive anyone without the Holy Ghost and it'll deceive some with the Holy Ghost yeah it will don't brother Brandon was deceived and he had the Holy Ghost he was the prophet of God he thought that was white horse rider was the Holy Ghost right that didn't come from his Inside Man that came from that Spirit realm that you and I have got to fight fight fight fight fight remember your soul is just as Eternal as God is it never it never never is false never was false that's what we got to realize and understand what's inside of us is more real than we are yeah right and it never send a day in its life if you're born again if you're born again now if you're not born again it's just as dirty and black as the rest of it but what Satan's done is he's come down through the spirit realm coming on a w horse ReliOn religion now you know listen if you're bothered today by alcohol and drug abuse and and prostitution and pornography if you're if you're if you have a problem with that today you're not born again but Satan's not in that they's not in that that is a product of unbelief Satan is over here in the spiritual realm sitting beside you today look around there's no one beside me I'm okay look around brother R he's okay over there a little bit police is far behind him but really Satan is not see he's just like he he tries to remember he tries to be like God when God bursts you and you're a newborn baby in Christ you're just as Eternal as God is God doesn't worry about your soul right right you're done like I said you're in rapturing condition you're you're you're the real person that that was birthed in you is as Eternal as God is cannot sin you can't hold one not even you can't even say Justified what we say Justified Justified means we did it and then God took it away that Eternal on is inside of you there's no way it ever it ever did it that's what we we got to realize we got to realize that when these seals open it is showing us not that this is just the Antichrist it's got to drive the Antichrist out of you and any any any any word one word off of the word of God is Antichrist you say we can't make it yes if Jesus walked on the face of this Earth for 33 years he was a sinless Son of God and if he's come and dwelt in your soul what are you sure we were born in sin that's the part we got to deal with that's why we're sitting here today that's why we have to go to church you cannot get it by yourself no way right I was looking somewhere the other day and there was a lady made a commentary about something she said well my church is is where I am you know she goes to the woods and prays that's fine that's fine but that's one thing that God put in his word that says forsake not assembling yourself together and much more as a day approaches right so if we're not going to church more now than we ever did then we backslid all right we must we must you say well how do you know well I'm telling you I can tell you from personal experience if I was Sting it home today I'd be backslid right I would I'd be backl cuz I know I need to go to church what is that iniquity iniquity knowing you need to go and you don't go knowing you need to be here listen God knows we're weak human beings in our strongest we're weak right and our you can deny whatever you want to deny they say well I'm full of Christ when you take a body change you'll be full of Christ but before you take a body change you got to deal with that thing you born with called a nature okay sure the old Nature's dead that was inside right amen but all Satan's done is Satan just moved where he could bombard that memory reason conscious affection imagination cuz really your body doesn't sin you know that we we've been through this a million times your body does not sin the flesh I'm looking at does not sin it's a product of sin that's right but it only does what that inside boy tells it to do remember this this hand that used to drink beer and and do things bad that same hand is in on my body but God's cleaned it up he cleaned me up from the inside so I don't do that anymore right things I used to do I do them no more right so you know that something's changed something had to leave you right so like brother Brown said it wasn't just a divorce it had to be a death the old you had to die so that the new creature or Creation in Christ could come forth and and you say well I'm off you're off the 7 no I'm right on the 7 but what what's going to happen I saw Behold a White Horse He s him had a bow now look he had a bow but he had no ARS all right he's a bluff we don't he's bluffing huh we don't notice that no you don't notice that but being a hunter I would know I you know I I could have a $1,000 bow and go set in a deer stand and you know what without an arrow I might throw it at the deer and kill it but I doubt it but I need some arrows so what's he doing he's going out as a bluff a crown was given unto him we don't give Jesus's Crown King of Kings the Lord of lords back forth foundation of the world we don't he doesn't need a crown he's already crowned sure we're going to uh when you say crown that doesn't mean we're going to just all go start setting crowns on his head no come on you know you his head's only as big as hours I know we get kind of carnal sometimes but but a crown means Authority first thing you see when you see a crown you think man that that guy or girl must have done something to give them some kind of authority so a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering into conquer all right now let's go back to Matthew 24 take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many so what do we see in the first opening of the seal we see a white horse rider riding out with a bow with a crown looks like Christ right doesn't mean he were deceived thought it was Christ right that's what they say in many times now in it's just getting so much in the denominations now to where it truly is they're just lodes you go to a you go to a Baptist or a Methodist or you even talk to them and it's like you know they go to church come as you are come as you are come as you are you know God's not there okay God's not there when the prophet of God I've told you before when the prophet of God said that they are lodges how in the world if we think brother random was the prophet if we know brother random was a prophet and he prophesied many things then you got to take what he said he said they're lodes God's not even there anymore why because what they've done is they've took a name that oh sure they love Jesus Christ and you know a lot of like we were talking the other day a lot of Catholics are are more sincere than we are they go to math every Sunday [Applause] every Sunday and we miss you know when we when we want but they're sincere but like the prophet of God said they're sincerely wrong okay that's the deception many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many now how are you not going to be deceived the there's only one way you can't be deceived because the five foolish virgins are deceived because of one item remember the prophet of God said Christ the lamb and the Holy Ghost is the same person so when you say holy ghost you think of Christ you think the Lamb of God when I see that word Christ to me that's the Holy Ghost amen that's the Holy Ghost all right so because what watch this let's Get on Up through here let's read 24 because for there shall arise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect behold I have told you before wherefore if they they they who's that the Antichrist system they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold he is in the secret chamber believe it not how there's only one way you know it's cuz you got him in here that's right right that inside teacher will tell you no I'm not in the desert you don't have to go out there no I'm not in the secret chamber no that's the only way you're going to know it so when we come to the first seal now what's the first what's the first seal doing showing you who you are you say no it's the Antichrist remember the Antichrist is false it's only a mirror image of who Christ really is right so you got Christ here he's the number one guy you know I was talking about you know last Sunday it it's real hard it's kind of hard for us to believe but you know Satan he he really thinks he can whip the one that created him yeah that's how deceived he is he thinks he can whip the one that actually created him uh it ain't going to happen but he thinks it's going to happen for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall receive many now what we've been talking about the mystery of iniquity what is Iniquity knowing to do better and don't do it or doing something knowing that you shouldn't have done it that's iniquity you say what's sin sin's unbelief okay now if you're born again today you're not an unbeliever but you do have things in your spirit realm we're not even going to include the body the SE the the the five senses of the body is this is nothing but a shell that holds that's what I said about Brother Richard at the funeral and death to me is is is so simple when the body the only thing that's fire in this body is the soul that God give me that's what's fireing this body right the light even though a sinner is is uh maybe condemned he has a being he has a light he has a soul and that Soul goes somewhere right same way with Brother Richard his body quit working when your body quits working your Soul's got to leave cuz it cannot inhabit something cuz this is the case that the thing's in right everybody understand to me it's very simple this is the case that the real way dils in now when something ain't firing right we go to the doctor that's right it's not hurting our soul that's right it's hurting our body right cuz we have what we have receptors nerves nerve endings we have all those things that but now when when uh not to be too graphic but when the soul leaves the body they can cut it and do everything they want to with it right and they don't don't go ouch right all that receptor and all that firing mechanism is gone that's because you are we're all children of light when we're given a soul we're all children of light now the Bible say says is your light become Darkness that's what happens when you you go through life and you you continue to do the things you do and and your soul just keeps getting worse and I mean maybe not worse and worse but it's it's it's a Blackness until God can come in cut that out kill that old nature part of you and let your light shine I said to me that's very simple very simple that your soul is your whole firing mechanism the only reason I can talk is because of the Soul's inside of me not the spirit that's right what the spirit does the spirit enhances the soul right everybody got that cuz you your brain doesn't do your memory your brain's just like that computer right there it's what's put in it right okay C taste SP smelling here is what the body can do okay but it can be deceived you get into the spirit realm memory reasoning conscious affection imagin all that's done in your brain and your brain is nothing more than a receptor just like a computer and what you put in it you know that's what they always say junk in junk out good in good out right so all those years we were Sinners it was junk in junk out we showed Who We Are by our actions but now remember though we have come up to a day to where it's moved closer though see it used to be that oh we know he's a sinner cuz he does and you make a list but a real sinner is the unbeliever right that can be sitting right among [Applause] you right that's right not out there that's right not in the barrooms and not out there that to me that they've done uh seared their conscience so much to where you know God can deal with them for a certain length of time but God's not going Bible said God's not going to always strive with man right right very longsuffering like we were talking about he's the only person that could create Grace and make it work we don't have Grace we have to acquire Grace that's right we weren't born with Grace no no no what you looking for my sister no not no not here they okay yeah yeah okay all right it's sisters are coming today so he was looking for them for many shall come in my name and say I am Christ and shall deceive many there's only one way you will not be deceived and that's have the baptism of the Holy Ghost now let's move up a little bit further the only way you're going to take a body change though is to enhance that by letting your soul I I want to say this override anything that your spirit realm brings in listen you can have the new birth right and commit iniquity that's we do it every day every day we get up we go through life and we go Lord forgive me for that what was that iniquity you knew you shouldn't have done that and you did it anyway right or you knew you knew that you shouldn't do I mean you should do something and you don't do it right right I needed to study one hour more yesterday and I didn't I knew I should have but I didn't I listened to a ball game I'm being honest sorry being honest but you know what that condemnation came to me late in the evening that that's what was happening cuz we and you know what that does that to me that that enhancement is is telling you because a lot of times you know you go through life and you do things you say well that's not so bad it's the little foxes that spoil the vine you know we need to commit to if we studied 1 hour we need to commit to two hours okay a day 10% of your time is the same thing as 10% of your money for many shall come in my name so they're going to be so close all right but now the only way you're going to know that is to have that one inside of you but also you must what we say uh Proverbs we're trying to get get rid of this iniquity right how are we going to get rid of this iniquity for those of y'all that weren't here let you want to get rid of iniquity let me show you the Bible gives you every provision until I can't find where Proverbs is there it is it's Proverbs I think 16 or six I got it WR down here I just got under all this pile of stuff 16 5-6 right and tomorrow we're going to talk about Ranger Rick today gets that in the mail so to bring it to her 16 you want to get rid of iniquity verse six by Mercy and Truth iniquity is purged there it is right there by Mercy what is Mercy the mercy of God to you is that he in your sin and your condition of sin he came down spoke to you you received what he said and he birthed you into the body he gave you the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the greatest Mercy anybody because remember if we were born in sin shaping their iniquity espouse from our mother's womb a liar doomed and on our way to hell right there's only one thing can save us and that's the baptism of the Holy Ghost right Mercy Mercy is the Holy Ghost now what's truth truth of the word you got to put the two together you say that is the same you can have a false Doctrine and have the baptism of the Holy Ghost sure you can Brother Brad did we got to go right back to the example he preached the Holy Ghost was the white horse rider in 1957 and 59 look at Mighty conquerer he reads he leads re he reads Revelation [Applause] 61 did I not read it to you last week where brother R said I have made a horrible mistake the Holy Ghost had to come into the room what was the Holy Ghost doing the Holy Ghost wasn't protecting William brandham the Holy Ghost was protecting the word I've always said you take if you take William bram's life it's a wreck he tried to kill himself twice tried to commit suicide twice tried to kill some children when he was a boy right a that right remember he said I'd have emptied the gun and I'd have killed every one of them but God wasn't protecting William brandom or he'd be a respector person he was protecting the gift that the man had right he was protect he knew that gift had to operate and it had to operate right so he he helped William Brown through his life just like he helps me and you Hey listen that's just a list of stuff he done what about the things we did okay and we're not prophets and we're not you know not even trying to be but God has through mercy and Truth iniquity is purged what is Purge it leaves you it doesn't come back it leaves because from Brother Bram standing there on the first seal he says here stands the lamb and there goes a white horse rider what was it running from it was running from the Revelation that had been brought to the prophet cuz remember Satan hates Revelation he can't stand to be around Revelation truth he can't stand to be around truth that's why he has to move away from that and and what you and I have to do is we have to believe that that's what happens we got to believe that that's what's happen to you and I right amen because they're false Christ listen the Bible says they're going to come right so they're here right they said they're going to deceive many right but they won't deceive the elect the elect is the Born Again baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul no way that that inside person can sin see that's a paradox you say well uh I like sometimes when some of you look at me a little strange but Martin Luther had the baptism of the Holy Ghost right just like you do right and he taught a trinity smoked the pipe and drank beer that's right so don't tell me you can't have the Holy Ghost and and have some error right in your life sure you can cuz tell me how Martin Luther was a church age messenger a prophet of the age and he could do these things over here and not have the Holy Ghost he had to baptism of the Holy Ghost for his time for his time amen this hadn't been revealed yet but now listen this is proof of it because if Martin Luther was to resurrect today come and sit down right here not just listen to me but listen to any minister with the with the revelation of the hour that we have I'll guarantee you he would repent of what he did I'm not talking about just saying oh I'm sorry no he would be he would be so overwhelmed with repentance knowing that what he done is he took the word of God and he twisted it a little bit had his own idea but that Holy Ghost Inside of him was as pure as God Almighty is that's what we got to understand that if we have Christ in us we don't have to worry about any other fults anything that's right but we have to let him work through our spirit realm that's right I've said before still working on it you do not get a revelation from this Dimension right this Dimension is false this Dimension was not supposed to be here hello this Dimension was not supposed to be here the first three Life Light matter or or or depth and height and whatever it is not supposed to be that's why I like brother hery always said he said this was not so this was not so this was not sure God knew about it but it's not in his it wasn't in his you say well an original plan then it changed no his plan was he wanted people to be on the earth in human bodies living on the earth Eternal right you say how do you know that so that's what we're going to when we fell we fell from that position now we're down here working our way back to that position right all right so the grand the grand finale is what God saw start with cuz remember the the the beginning of God's thought and the ending of God's thought remember end is not like what we say what we think it's just like this it has no it has no time involved his thoughts are Eternal he's had this thought eternally let's just keep going back he's had this thought eternally but what what has happened though this is my thought I have no quote on this but the reason God did what he did what he's doing now is to prove to Satan that there's somebody sure he Mar Eve right he Mar Eve man fell we're in this condition Satan loves it I mean he loves to move around in this in this realm amen cuz it's all it's just all false right amen but when you get a revelation that comes from the mind of God that seventh Dimension where God is he sends it straight down to you and the devil has to back out of the way and let that Revelation come in to me that's why brother R said there's nothing higher than Revelation nothing any higher than getting a revelation from the almighty God nothing amen so our Revelation when he got that Revelation that uh that that was the Antichrist not Jesus Christ don't you think that Prophet was shouting Glory Hallelujah because what he had done is something had been purged out of his life now remember we'll read it next Sunday on the second seal he says he says I don't have a clue what the next seal is what he had done he what he done he took he had took and wrote about it and preached it back in the 50s seven seal and he was looking at his old notes well when he saw this come up and he saw that he was wrong in his thought you hear what I said wrong in his thought that that was the U Holy Ghost he knew the second third fourth fifth six at least had to be something different than what he thought cuz even when you get to the fifth seal people don't read those little things that he talks to the commentaries before they like to get into the meat of the sermon I like to read the commentary cuz what he does he goes back and reviews well on the fifth seal he thought that was Souls under the altar he thought it was all Christian right he thought it was all Christian false false I did that wasn't all Christians that was the fifth seal Jew that had been killed under Ian and Hitler and all down Through the Ages the 68 million that were killed involved Jews and all that that the Catholic Church killed and they were killed and that was a separate group of people than what he thought originally so you see what the seals does what the seals do if you don't go through the seals and it doesn't correct us then it's not open right right then it's not open when it opens up it will correct things that needs to be corrected okay so like you talking about Luther he had the Holy Ghost but he did all those things but not today not today well the word he had word was for the just shall live by faith all right that was the baby form of justification that when you come into the body Body of Christ are when you sorry let me rephrase that when you come to a repentant condition and you are Justified all right now the Bible says that he who is just he who he has Justified we try to justify ourselves that don't work but if God justifies us he's already glorified us but now there's some people that can come to justification that never makes it the sanctification right and they're not saved unless they die under that condition but they're not bright that's what I want you to understand they're not bright you are not the Bride of Jesus Christ until you have the Holy Ghost in your soul doing the things of God letting God that's that fiery mechanism all right they didn't have the word about then to tell them that that was wrong that's why they could drink the word the best example I've ever give and and and if you'll look at it in my view take your hand and do like this this is how to tell whether your um left eye dominant or right eye dominant right you hold it right there all right now look all I'm seeing is Aaron and a little bit of Regina right all you're seeing is what right here that's all you're seeing but now does that negate that there's 20 something people sitting in this room right you can't deny that there's other people sitting in the room but all you all I can see is there when my hands are up here like this that's the same way with the word of God that much was revealed to Martin Luther that did not do away with all this truth and Purity that's out here that's right but now what about the next step John Wesley okay now I can see joce Danny Aaron Regina part of Christine and some of brother Joe little fat Li up over there but now hold on a minute does that make this any different no Aaron's in the picture right but does that mean you're gone no you're still sitting but you see what so God opened the full word now so that this is part of it but it's not all of it but it was all of it when God showed that to Martin Luther the just shall live by faith that was his Revelation for the day and that's all God wanted it the time you got to understand one thing we question things that if if God God did it the perfect way and we got to accept that God did it the perfect way cuz we go well I wonder why it's not for you to wonder that's right I'm telling you that God wrote that Bible so that every born again Christian can get born again can go through the statute of a perfect man and take a body change he wrote it right here brother K and you know what there it's not our idea to change it we can't change that and you know what that's the only way he knew you could get it was the way he wrote it so we must accept that that's why you know everybody say well we need to change this change that no don't change the word of God it didn't change the word of God when brother Brown preached the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost no he was like this Paul had scales on his eyes right until God opens his eyes cuz a lot of times that word see what good does it do to see something what good does it do to physically see something see means to understand I if you don't put you need to put that in there cuz I want to see you upstairs I want listen the only way you're going to physically see Jesus is to see him by understanding of Revelation in the word first you'll never see Jesus Christ unless you see him in the word first right that's what these seals do they bring Jesus Christ right out of the scripture they bring him more clear they tell you who the Antichrist is right now this mystery of iniquity see as we are speaking you should be it should be something boiling over saying hey I need to get rid of this I need to you know quit this I need and it's not just quitting you should be done you should be finished with all that other stuff cuts and smoking running around you know that that went out at the new birth it better have or you didn't get the new birth all right now White Horse He that s on him had a bow and the crown was given unto him now next Sunday we are going to read quotes in the book right but I want to read a few that's on my tablet just for a second she so pretty that's my grandbaby we going to read a few right here Butz I want you to see this it'll blank out but it'll come back all right right here I like this app if you don't have it you need to get it right this is the second seal he's a shrewd fellow when he sees this thing coming coming up then he throws everything he can out there to upset it before it gets there right did you know there will be false Christ arising in the last day it should follow immediately after this after this great message that this brother will speak which was himself that will actually come and be anointed in the spirit of Elijah immediately now one more right here four seal right here watch [Applause] this we've had Elijah's garment we've had Elijah's robe there's been people John Alexander Dow is buried up there wrapped in a robe he said he was Elisha we've had all kind of things like that what is it anyhow it's only to take away a truth that is going to be presented so the truth had to be on the earth remember what I said to have a white horse ride off you got to have a real white right church right because Satan is not an originator of anything he's a copycat he cannot he he cannot create right he's not a Creator he's a perverter right right it only he said it was Ela we had all kind of things like that what is it anyone it's only to take away a truth that is going to be presented see they had false Christ before Jesus this time remember Gia right Gia said hey we had a guy come by and he took 400 people out the desert said he was Christ mhm nothing to it he said but if this man Jesus is Christ you better leave him alone right right they had false Christ before Jesus's time see they always do it it's Satan running out a counterfeit what is a counterfeit you got to have a real dollar first before you can make a counterfeit well they don't do dollar bills they do hundreds you got to have a real hundred $1 that'd be kind of crazy they have a real $100 bill that they have to cop off of to make the counterfeit there's no way you can make a counterfeit if there's not a real Bill there so there's got to be a real Christ a real Lord Jesus Christ before there had to be a Satan that would try to copy him they always do that it's Satan running out of counterfeit to upset the minds and the faith of the people before the thing actually happens that's this age that's this age right here right G said the same thing let's don't read anymore we have stop right there for a second but uh false Christ now I want you to think about something the only way you're going to know that this false is here is for something to be true inside of you right and what was the greatest what is the greatest deception that ever hit the face of the Earth the greatest deception in the religious realm not all that others in in the religious realm what's the greatest thing that got man away from the truth when they took a threers god when they took God and made him God in three persons that was the greatest thing that happened in the religious realm 606 ad right here th Ty right before the five Ty this is what the Dark Ages when they killed 68 million Catholic Church killed 68 million Protestant in 606 ad they come up when they went to n in Rome that Jesus was not the substance of God he was a like substance of God he was created that then it took the father son Holy Ghost baptism all those things that to me that was the greatest so now the first seal then the greatest revelation of the first seal should be that Hear Me O Israel first commandment
