========================================

god bless you this morning try to get this working again all right we're on uh we've been we've been studying on where paul was talking about rest after after going on through a through a journey through the wilderness the children of israel were trying to get to a place where they could rest so before we before we start studying this out let's just go to the lord in prayer well god we're so grateful to be able to gather together amongst your people and around your word and we just pray lord that you'll just bless today's services and bless our little study now we pray in the name of the lord jesus amen so in hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 it says let us therefore fear unless the promise being lest left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it for unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it for we which have believed to enter into rest as he said i have as i have sworn in my wrath if they shall enter into my rest although the works were finished from the foundation of the world or he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this wise and god did rest the seventh day from all his works and in this place again if they shall enter into my rest now now like the last time we were talking about if you just just to kind of remind you as we study this out there's these patterns that are repeated throughout the scripture and there's this always this pattern of of of you start out on a journey and then there's a labor and you you can even see when god created the world in seven days he he worked he labored and then he said he stopped there was a place where god came to a place of rest now even in your christian journey you you you start you hear the gospel preached and you say you know there's i think there's something to it when you begin to to ask god to forgive you of your sins and you enter a justified state that the holy ghost is working something in your life and then you start working you start laboring i see that that pattern but see you're not in a rest yet you're not at rest and so now you think about what rest is now rest is um you know we're talking about the condition of your soul the state of your soul where your soul is at peace and you know maybe maybe examine ourselves this morning and think you know if um i i i was just laughing at something i read the other day where somebody i saw somebody said um uh a hundred percent of people 200 years old are all dead now now you think about you know if if if time were to go on and things you know eventually you're you're going to go down in the ground so you begin to meditate on things like that and you think it what's what's the state of my soul is it really at rest am i at rest or am i am am i a place of turmoil do i do i know that i'm where i'm going to go a lot of times i i love the story of charles not charles um i forget his name john wesley's parents when his dad when he was on his deathbed and he had all of his kids around him and he said i'm going to paraphrase but he said i take such comfort in knowing that one day i'm going to see my children again because they're all christians and i'm a christian so he had he was he had a rest in his soul that you know i'm a christian and one day you know even though we're parting that that i'm gonna see my children again and so you know you think about rest in your soul is something bad might be happening on the outside he was on his deathbed and he was and on the outside it looked pretty grim but rest on the inside is when you have confidence so what gives you that rest you know we talk about um this is almost like i i i remember you know so many little little lessons from my parents growing up about rest and that those kind of things and you know that that uh you talked with i talked to when my kids growing up but you know i really want to hone down what rest is because you know you can get in your mind that if you go to a camp meeting or something and you feel something special happen in the supernatural movement of the spirit you know that you know that that's rest but then you go home and you're you're not in rest you're not you're not you might not be you know your soul not might not be have come to that place of rest so rest goes beyond and just like feeling something or maybe or you know seeing something supernatural or just saying some good words but rest has got to be it's it's it is a supernatural thing that comes from god it's it's and we know what it is it's the it's it's what the holy ghost does in your life but what is rest so now let's back up for a second and just kind of look at that pattern again that we were talking about that that first first there's labor and then there's rest first first there's labor now think about going through the the outer core inner court holy foleys that in that in that holy place there's a lot of labor going on you're trying to light the candlesticks as brother brown will explain you're trying to keep them lit they go out let's get smokey and everything and you're going over that table of showbread and and you're studying out the word and probing and you're working and then you go over to the altar of incense and you're praying and you're god forgive me and everything and you're you're going through all these motions of being a christian and and and trying to trying to figure things out what does it mean to be a christian what does this scripture mean as do these people know what they're talking about is the message true and all these kind of things but then when you go into the holy place you cease from your labor and you're at rest now even god and when he created the worlds on the seventh day it got we talked about that earlier that he ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and god blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had arrested from all his work which god created and made and in the old testament you know the fourth commandment was that you hallow that that that that sabbath day and you keep that day but jesus when he began to preach he said come unto me all you that labor and i'll give you rest so he's taking it up to a uh he's showing us the true meaning of that rest that god wanted us to have but even that in that when jesus said those words coming to me all year that labor he's talking to people that are laboring because you got to have the labor first the labor comes first in a sanctified condition where you're trying to work things out and figure it out what's right and probe and study and then comes the rest and there in exodus chapter 20 remember the sabbath day to keep it holy six days to shout thou labor you're going to be laboring first and do all thy work but the seventh day is the sabbath of the lord thy god and it thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son not our thy daughter thy manservant nor thy maidservant nor thy cattle nor thy stranger that is within thy gates now you see how this pattern you can you can understand things by looking at the pattern that's laid out first you start on your journey and then you labor and you're doing a lot of work work out your salvation with fear and trembling and you're working but then you come into rest which is what paul says yeah that's that's not exodus that's uh that's the scripture we've been reading here in hebrews it should be a hebrews 4 11 that's a typo let us labor therefore to enter into that rest labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief now what are what did brother brown say rest was now rest is to have everlasting rest to have everlasting rest rest from all your troubles and all your work now that doesn't mean you're not going to have troubles and worries that but that means when you have a trouble or worry that there's some kind of confidence there that there's a plan that's being worked out that you can rely on god that his promises are true that even if something if the doctor tells you something bad you're still resting even though maybe on the outside things are rough but on the inside you're resting and we're talking about the condition of the soul no more task masters that means that means that there's not the devil isn't like running you rough shot and and taking control of your mind and of your thoughts and things and and and and making you bow down to his every whim of smoking cigarettes and and uh you know alcohol and doing things you're at rest because god has taken over god has taken over your innermost being no more restless nights like like jesus there in that boat when all the he was sleeping because he was at rest when everything else was in turmoil around him and that boat was being tossed to and fro but he was at rest and the brother of them said they were on their way to the promised land of rest it flowed with milk and honey the grapes was so big that two men packed one bunch over their shoulders in other words everything they had need of would be provided everything they needed was in that promised land now of course a lot of times we think that we need a big old giant car and all kinds of things that we don't really need but everything you need is going to be provided for and everything we need is provided in in god's word our brother brown said in hebrews chapter four in that sermon he said now the thought is if we are on our way to the rest what is the rest where is it is it joining church now if you join church and you're just coming to church that you might just be laboring you might still be laboring and trying to work things out and and we're in a work work that work mode is it being baptized a certain way is it becoming a member of the greatest church in the city wearing better clothes do any of those things give us rest i mean i'm talking about the confidence where you know if you're going to die today on the way home that you know where you're going to go is it education is it money so we can quit work and just lay down rest the rest of our life as we call it no that's not it now when jesus began to speak about this sabbath the pharisees and the sadducees who were keeping the law they they began to get confused at the way he would explain this because he he was he was trying to point out to them that you think you know i know what your your your purpose is is supposed to be and and you think you understand but i'm gonna change things a little bit for you and he said in mark chapter two he said and it came to pass that he went through the cornfields on the sabbath day and his disciples began he look at him he's going on the sabbath day which was supposed to be set apart for them to not do any work and he's plucking he's he's he's doing work to pluck the ears of corn and the pharisees said unto him behold why do they on the sabbath day that which is not lawful and he said unto them have you never read what david did when he had need and wasn't hungry he and they that were with him and i'm just going to skip skip over that but you know david when he had when he was hungry he went and did what was supposed to be he ate from the table of shoe bread which was supposed to be set apart from the priest and so so jesus is trying to tell you that he's trying to prove to them that they didn't understand what the sabbath was and he's trying to prove to them that the sabbath is supposed to be to help people not not to burden you but to help and isn't that what the holy ghost is supposed to do to not burden you down with with a lot of things that you have to keep necessarily but it's supposed to be a help to you to deliver you from your task masters to deliver you from your place of of turmoil to deliver you from a from your righteousness to help you and he said unto them the sabbath was made for man and not man for the sabbath therefore the son of man is lord also of the sabbath and again in mark chapter 3 he entered again into the synagogue and there was a man there which had a withered hand and you think about how skewed their perception of the sabbath was they watched him whether he would heal him on the sabbath day that they might accuse him and he saith unto the man which had the withered hand stand forth and he saith unto them is it lawful to do good on the sabbath day or to do evil to save life or to kill but they held their peace and my how skewed their understanding had to be to to think that it would be better to keep that to keep what they thought was a good regulation that to save somebody's life they thought it would be better to just let somebody you know stay in there in their condition and he said he looked around about on them with anger being grieved for the hardness of their heart so there's the people that had no understanding of what the sabbath really is he saith unto the man stressed forth on hand and he stretched it out and his hand was restored whole as the other so in colossians it colossians paul says let no man therefore judge you and meet or in drink or in respect of an holy day or of the new moon or of the sabbath days which are shadow of things to come but the body is of christ now let's let's sit on that just for a second and think about that because he's saying that you understand he's saying that the pharisees and the sadducees and the jews of that day they had another state they thought they had an understanding of what the sabbath was and all these these things that were typing something in the old testament that would be fulfilled in the new so these things he said they're a shadow of things to come but the body is of christ what does that mean now if you hold your hand up in front of a light source you can see the shadow of that thing and that's why he's saying the body is of christ with the body is the thing that is being shattered so if you have if you held your hand up in front of a light you can see the shadow and we'll say that's the old testament sabbath day but the body is of christ and the body is the thing the body is that that holy ghost sabbath that the thing that is being typed of in the old testament the body is the holy ghost that that's that that god will give us in the in the in the new testament the body is of christ so we look at these the old testament type and we we by the new testament we begin to have an understanding of what was being typed in the old testament what is the what is the sabbath in the new testament and in the message shalom brother brown said the holy ghost is our sabbath the bible said so come unto me and all ye that labor and heavy laden i'll give you sabbath to your soul not a day paul said you you that keep a day i'm afraid of you but there remaineth the rest in hebrews 4 to the people of god a sabbath keeping now in in and let's let's think about what the effect of the holy ghost is and then we'll understand what a real sabbath is the effect of the holy ghost is in john chapter 16 jesus said i have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the spirit of truth has come he'll guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatever he shall hear that shall he speak and he'll show you things to come in other words you come to church and you you bring the holy ghost in you the word and then he will speak back to you what the true meaning of that word is so that the holy ghost is revealing to you the word and in hebrews chapter 4 in 1957 he said i want you to remember that unless we find out unless god has revealed it to us no matter how much we go to church that has nothing to do with it god must come by revelation and reveal himself to us so we're looking for revelation now now you see how see how look look at that journey of a believer you you start hearing about the gospel and you want more of it and you begin to labor but it's not quite it's not quite seal in you but when you come to a rest you know you know what god has done for you and just in jezebel religion he said and and i just want to kind of bring this out when when brother brown went beyond the curtain of time one of the things that the people beyond the curtain of time told him was he he began to ask him well well will paul have to be the judge for the gospel i preached that he preached and he said yes and he said i preached every word just exactly the way he did and the millions screamed out we're resting on that now what were they resting on they were resting on the word that had been preached they were resting on the word that that that uh that brother branham had preached they were resting on the fact that it was the same thing that paul had preached and they were resting on that gospel was going to bring them out of the grave they were resting on that so that's the kind of rest that i'm talking about the rest that gives you confidence and you think about those beyond the curtain of time or resting they they had such confidence that they were resting on that you think about here's another example too in genesis chapter 28 where jacob when he when his when his parents began to worry about who he was going to get married to and and uh they sent him off to go to go find a wife and he he he's knelt he he stopped off made a little stop and placed next to next to a river or or wherever and he said and it says he took a stone and he laid his head down on that stone for a pillow and while he was asleep he began to have that that the dream of the of the the ladder with the angels going up and down the top was crying what course what that what was that ladder but you see how that perfectly types he put his head as rest on a stone which types your revelation just like faith is where your resting place is at the bottom of the ladder and when you're resting you you have confidence and he took that stone that he put for his pillows the next morning and set it up for a pillar and pulled oil upon the top of it it was an he anointed that stone and he called the name of that place bethel but the name of that city was called luz at the first and you think about it what a strange thing to rest your head on a rock that doesn't sound very restful but yet we rest we get our rest on the rock of revelation the revelation of jesus christ now see how you can have feelings and sensations and everything but that doesn't necessarily give you rest but when god's word is revealed to you then you can have confidence you can have confidence in what your position is and where you are now let's think about what happened on the day of pentecost we're talking about rest now all that time that uh before before the day of pentecost they they were probing at who whether jesus really was who he said he was and they were concerned after he died on the cross what you know they're wondering if he really did arise again and and there was all that they you know they're working they're laboring they're trying to work things out they're when he said it was hard to be understood things they didn't understand he'd say you know in matthew 28 19 be baptized the name of the father son and holy ghost that don't make any sense it doesn't seem like you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood that doesn't make any sense but yet they hung on and they're they're laboring and working out work trying to work it out in their mind but on the day of pentecost everything changed because now they're resting they know what they believe and he said and in acts chapter 2 or verse 15 i'm just going to skip through some of these scriptures he said for these paul began peter began to explain what was going on because he identified what was happening with the word and he said for these are not drunken as ye suppose these aren't drunken i'm gonna tell you what's going on it's the holy ghost seeing it is by the third hour of the day and he began to identify he said this is that that was spoken of by the prophet joel this is this is that and he said this jesus hath god raised up you see how he's he's now resting it's it's not something that he's probing at anymore he knows what has happened jesus is alive and that same jesus that rose from the grave that same holy ghost is now working in the bride he said this jesus hath god raised up where we are all witnesses and he begins to quote the things that david talked about that david has not for david has not ascended into the heavens but he saith unto him the lord said unto my lord sit thou on my right hand until i make thy foes thy footstool in other words he's identifying with scripture that i know where god is now that he sat down in the throne of my heart and he said therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly you see how when rest comes from knowing assuredly from knowing because the holy ghost has revealed to you the person of jesus christ therefore let all the house of israel know assuredly that god hath made amen that same jesus yes let me get crucified both lord and christ so brother brahman said in awakening jesus he said you say you're a christian he's talking to somebody i think in a prayer line he said i believe you are you believe what are you resting in what are you resting in some day he'll raise our bodies up after they've absolutely completely perished if you don't believe that why you go to church if there's no resurrection aren't we amongst men most miserable what are you resting in though his word of promise he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live i am the resurrection and life we're resting in what god said and not just the words on the page but we're resting in a revelation of those words brother brown said and we would see jesus he said our soul rests solemnly upon his word and faith cannot be based anywhere else all theology and man-made isms are sinking sands and faith cannot find its resting place upon the shifting sands of man's theology it's got to find a solemn resting place on the immovable rock of almighty god's word there's where it anchors god said so that settles it that's forever the truth he said i'm resting on his his ability that's my hope and stay i'm resting upon his ability i'm resting upon his grace not upon what i am what he is i'm resting on his promise because he made the promise and he swore to the promise and i know that we have eternal life you see how sure resting is when you know that you know and we're going to stop on this and jesus promised that it would be another rest that was typed in the old testament that's why he said come unto me all ye that labor that work you're working you're trying to work it out come to me all year that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest the musicians should go ahead and come god bless you [Applause] you
