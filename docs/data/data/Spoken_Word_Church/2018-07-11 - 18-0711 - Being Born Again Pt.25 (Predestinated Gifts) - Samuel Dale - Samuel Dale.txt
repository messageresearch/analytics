things and just pray that you'll bless with all of us together in you he were brother Addison there and help him and sister Gail the Lord touch her have your way in Jesus name Amen they've been reading this for quite a while but we will read it for a few more services okay first Peter 1:22 seeing you how purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever now watch our thought tonight because you're being born again not of corruptible seed not of corruptible word right but of incorruptible then he tells you for certain what it is by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever so keep that in your mind and we'll get to it in a minute and come to that point okay so let's go now to Ephesians 4 to try to pick up earth out verse 8 wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto me and now what did he give he gave gifts unto men all right now we're gonna read in about three more verses what he gave so it should be understood all right now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the door parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave that out here's the gifts and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some past evangelists and some pastors and teachers what far far the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ now once till in other words it's got to be fulfil till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ or the statue of a perfect man that we've been on for quite a lot all right now what's that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted in other words pressed in brought in tight by that whichever joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make an increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love you may be seated the Lord had two blessings to his word and we pray that you'll just settle in and think about what we're trying to bring we have been for quite a while Peter speaking on the weather comes the last one I was in their water goat but they're coming they're running say running so everybody got back I reckon there back so that's huh okay I get to take off for a week or two no but we've been talking for quite a while about the statue of a perfect man all right now the prophet of God said it was necessary that we have these virtues in the message you know faith virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and he covers dark we'd give it over and over and even the last one we were giving that he said that these people that would have these virtues would be the ones who would go in the rapture all right now so then it's necessary that we receive these things - and he said it there was no way in other words we can't if we don't attain unto the virtues then and why would God write it in the word what would be his purpose so it's in there to show us what we have need of to become settled sincere sealed in Christians who walk in the light of the word of God all right so we went through that and brother Branham on the statute firm and he said how faith had be born again and he said and then these things are the things that God expects to be added all right so we got up to that point of talking about faith the new birth all right bringing us to that point to where we start at okay now I kind of told you the other day that I was going to put a message in between I didn't realize it one that be about three or four but that's normal for me so when I tell you I'm gonna preach one you might we'll get ready for three so that's alright too but we said we was going to place a little point into work that we would get an understanding of these things all right we read in Peter we've read it over and over being born again which means it's a process of going on it's not born again or being born again means something is in motion and moving and that's the way it is with a statue of a perfect man brother Brent said you were born again to faith and then these are the things he expects you to add to become a seasoned veteran Christian you know and told us even though that would be the necessity of taking us in the rapture all right now see then we come to that point to her that we studied over and over on the thoughts and wondering cause like I told you for 40 years or whatever brother mold in 1971 he preached a message called series message about 65 sermons on the stature of a perfect man all right and when he finished I asked him a simple question now we know we've we've got how these virtues it's not a point of whether we can have them or don't have them or who has number one it's required of us to have these virtues it's not something in the book to just lay there that we can do if we want to all right and that's been the basis of why we're here 50 years after the going of the Prophet because he's give us time to get the message understand the message walk in the light of the message but isn't it odd that after about 40 years of moving along and doing pretty decently all at once you begin to see whole churches in the message just falling away preachers just 40 years 50 years preaching and they've just fallen away see that's what we were talking about Sunday the to Bible says it must need to be a falling away well you can't fall off a house you get on it so then the message had to be presented and once it was presented see now the people are falling away from the truth all right but we're hammering hard to try to get us to see what it will take for us to go out of here and a change of these bodies all right see we can't just any daddle around and say well we just go into church we're being good what do you want brother Dale will we wear it services we we do everything we can do do this I want you to to wear that these virtues will come within you we read it where the Prophet said fill me up Lord that I may teach others we'll get back to that in a minute what to the fivefold ministry to bring these things into being all right now as I said I asked the question years ago how do I get these virtues well I mean I'm honest it was about 80 or 81 that the Lord spoke to me about it that through the opening of the word directing it exactly to 327 church age book where this mentioned your Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 will do two things first turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father's number to reveal the seven thunders which is the revelations contained in the seven seals and it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that's a verbatim quote and I'm bringing you read through 27 in the church age will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn us back well what's going to take us in the rapture I thought I thought we believe this message was what was going to change us I mean have I missed that somewhere is there some something I thought this message was to be the thing that would change us all right I mean if I'm wrong on that I surely have missed it a whole lot go what am i doing looking for something else oh no that's what everybody's doing now all right but we got up to the point of talking about the new birth and I told you I'd inject this message into this because how do we get these virtues if they're required and according to the Prophet read the statute of perfect men's day they're required required for a rapture I didn't say that he did think it's going to take these things to bring us to that position well right now how do we get them we've had the part the Prophet brought his message right we're not looking at us covering Sunday we're not looking for some other prophet to come or some other thing to happen or something to be here to bring it in some form of redemption because probably the brother branham preaches to the Future home I'm alright he preached us to the future home that was the hot development of the message that he brought to show us that that would be the finality of the eighth day all right so there's not anything about redemption to be brought if you think there is I'd like for you to tell me where it's at because see if you can be preached that's what I told a man at home my home are one day he was sitting there talking about it and and kind of making lights you know and so I just let him hang his ownself and he was talking about you know that said brother branham brought this message and swept off the foundation cleaned it off here said we are we're gonna build a church we're gonna build a temple I said well okay if that's what you think and that's what you believe but I said first off all the want to ask is one question did brother Branham preach the future home yes yeah I said well then there's not anything further beyond that so now how are you gonna build a temple that was all I asked me much I was finished you know not just asking me what was he gonna do I said what do you gonna do run around done priests just to these places are you gonna go back and preach over again he didn't like it but that's all right I didn't know problems with it I didn't throw him out of my house cause he differed with me I just I just asked him a simple question if the Prophet Priestess of the future huh then where are you going to do and according to that see in the future home everything would be all brought back to eternal life all right but see getting to the point now that we started Sunday in talking home we accept the fact now I'm using a way to approach this that you'll catch it in a minute what I'm doing so but is it true now that the Bible is the Word of God I mean is that true the Bible is the Word of God you go over here to this church tonight and ask them that question when they say yes sir that's right the Bible is the Word of God we've got the Word of God now you know and we've got the all of the things of that Word of God that we as us covered there Sunday we don't have to worry about it we just ask brother Branham yeah but he ain't here but his message is here right asking brother Branham what is the new birth across the mr. Gardner of the or do say the new birth is the birth of the word in you the word that you've received the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you okay there's the answer from the Prophet brother Branham how are we predestinated that's a great mystery how are we predestinate he said we're predestinate about foreknowledge he said because foreknowledge is where it starts and then he can predetermine by his foreknowledge so we've got the truth uh-huh brother Branham we asked him question see that's I don't think he have any problems with that we're asking him to answer what he taught all right now see I believe he brought the message unto us I don't believe anybody else can come along and interpret that I've never looked for anybody to try to interpret what the Prophet said now to speak to me about it and put together the message to her that I can have an understanding is not interpreting in it oh yeah that's your West in now if it's right I just told you illustrated it run around and watch the new bird revelation of Jesus Christ personally I didn't try to interpret it he's the one that said you get what I'm talking about I know we won't finish tonight on this message because I got a lot of quotes that we could stay for quite a while and read alright but what I want to do is just get to point to you of one thing is the Bible the Word of God what is this message God's Word brought from the letter form by the Prophet which was the only one that could do it huh from the letter of the word this prophet we call brother Branham then you know Malachi 4 loops everything there that has been brought to our understanding and thank God for technology to word that you can just we used to search for weeks and months for try to find a quote that you could remember brother Branham said something and you'd listen to tape after tape after tape trying to find that right now it's just there it is well that put it in a great technical or technology and would you say a great age of scientific geniuses the word now does they're just nothing you know I mean they're they're doing all kind of things and and going into actually as brethren what broke up said broken into God's laboratory they're going into scientific things and toward is amazing alright because the Bible said the Bible said it would happen as in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the Son of Man all right the Bible says things to us and tells us the very day in the hour that we're living we talked about it back under you know a few years ago when the towers failed in and read the scripture where it says when the powers fall putting it right in to the Bible of the age and the time that we're living well see then the point I'm getting at is the Bible true do we need another Bible I enjoy reading some of the other you know scriptures I've got a good many Bibles and I'll read them to compare the understanding to see if if they hell if the the translators held the same point because really technically you think about it the people who took the Bible and tried to translate it there are not people that were trying to interpret it that was not their purpose their purpose was not to interpret it to us it was to bring it down into language they break it down to where we can understand it you get one combo so that's why it's not called you know so and so's translation because he's not trying to interpret a real real person anyway he's not trying to interpret it he's trying to get it word-for-word all right and brother Branham said why we have the Bible he said two were even the the bucks and the hand is in the right place we know how to look for another Bible we don't have to try to figure out some other thing we just believe the Bible all right then believe in the Bible then that puts us in a marvelous situation with a horrible one because it will be made manifest what we believe right God's going to bring it out in this day brother Brad said it he was not want to try to prove that this Brad wouldn't fall like he's so he's putting it out to her that we can see he's it right or wrong alright now that shouldn't be settled as to where the Bible is right or wrong if it's not and you're still arguing over those points we haven't even got started yeah and we will be around here another 500 years let alone 50 you know so that ought to be settled to that point and if we can find something in that Bible then we can expect it to happen so we read Malachi 4 and we find that this messengers to do two things we find what is to do and how he's supposed to bring the word we read in Luke 17 30 even in the day when the Son of Man will be revealed we read revelations 10 7 as to those things and we quickly relate to the point that that has been fulfilled because it is part of the Word of God no no you followed me I ain't asking you to agree with me I don't never ask nobody to agree with me I ask you to listen and see whether or not it's truth alright so then is it true that the Word of God had been brought to us and the Prophet said pure and unadulterated I believe that so it's pole or NOC then it's been brought here and unadulterated from all mankind through that message as I've always told you and I've always believed it this way I don't believe brother Branham I believe he could make mistakes era as a human being and did well look the message he brought he's pure and unadulterated went way down brother they'll coach I got no here we're bread Ralph said to white all right it was the Holy Ghost yeah your honor let her around sat down but you know one thing that I like what he said you ever thought about the way he said it one time about those things he said you make sure you say what I say and what did he say he says because I'll be held responsible for that you believe he said dad now so if you're only able to have been able to get a hold of the message up to 1960 or 61 under when he gets into really he gets into the sealed so it'd be really 63 but just number you know 62 63 if that's all you had and you as a preacher and you had no contact with nobody to get any further information you know God wouldn't hold you responsible right because the Prophet would be responsible no now I've always told you - they ain't nobody remember how we brought it the other night Sunday the Prophet stands before nobody a prophet stands before God and God alone see there was nobody back there in the 50s and 60s even though Clarence Larkins said to what horse rider would Zoli was the Antichrist and that was probably her somewhere around the turn of the century the Yeti wasn't the Prophet see when the Prophet came on the scene then everything became responsible you ever noticed him you go back through time and where we are we we have the Pentecostals and then we have the Congregational whole into some different things or through that rule and we keep going back and the Baptist is well back here right you know what I'm talking about the Baptist's run turn of the century back on beyond Dyer you know what in about secret about 1959 or 60 little run said the Baptist has just now become a denomination you know one because they just then turned him down that's what caused them to become a unit you explained it some other way when we know 100 years ago that became one did you see they wouldn't accountable then we're getting down to a fine line I said Sunday about this see the Prophet stands before nobody he goes straight to God all right now but anybody else from there on down there's got to stand in the place that we're all commanded to repent if we're not right see then to fivefold ministry has to answer to the Prophet come on the five whole ministries got an answer to the prophet in other words answer how you're gonna handle that like I've always tried to explain something well how was it there in the Bible that Paul could call doom on Phillips's and how many Asst you don't study your Bible Paul you remember that the two guys it was teaching that the resurrection was priced and Paul called him in and you know what did he have a right to do that because they were teaching what he taught Paul was teaching the very thing that they were teaching at the resurrection read your Bible Paul teaching the resurrection pipes but Paul was teaching that the physical resurrection had not come to pass but a spiritual resurrection they were teaching a physical resurrection had come to Pais that's what I'm trying to get you to see how serious it is to be a minister it's not a hat you know it's not just a thing boy I tell you what I love being a minister huh no only quit three times a day yeah ain't no joke it's only three I try not to do it full-time but you see the message has been brought we know it's in the Bible right we know it is the Bible you're getting it the Bible the message that's the Bible all right now you and I are gonna be responsible for what we do that this Bible has been vindicated you know you say well brother Dale wait a minute this oh this old Bible that old King James Version yeah that was the one the Prophet you he ran out of the verse and drive sure but the the King James was the one he said did the ends and the butts was even in the right place well I can find where this go well go right ahead you're just running yourself crazy you're not getting what he says this age will be judged by the prophets message that was read right out of the King James to us all right so now is the message in the Bible is it the message is in the Bible the Bible is the master each other I mean we can we can say well those were the finest good the Bible is the message the message it's the Bible all right and see then we'll be judged by what we do with that but we'll be judged by what we do with that cause the Prophet will spoke of in the scriptures behold I send you Elijah the prophet you don't take that to be your own scripture written to you now if you don't you don't under you don't want the Bible I won't I want the one where the Prophet the vindication comes down to work that I can see Christ right in that word now do you believe that it's in the Bible that there's a no mother of revelation 17 with harlot daughters you believe that and you believe that those people will be judged by that Bible are you do you believe they'll be judged by that Bible all right well because their name is in the Bible the situation is in the Bible of them existing so they'll be judged by it so this Bible is going to do one of two things to you and I it's either gonna bind us and cast us out or it's gonna bind us and see us in then which one do you want it's gonna do one of the two because it is the Word of God now and like more do we need to bring as proof of of the Bible being true and how much more is it that if we can find ourselves in the Word of God what about it now if the Prophet was in the Word of God and he spoke of the bride would she not be part of the Word of God are you following me see now you see where I'm going see then all we got to do is find our place in the word is it true that brother Brennan said how you do you do it he said you don't read he was wounded for our transgression he said you read me James Colley was wounded and I talked about him being Christ I'm talking about him being wounded and sick and that puts him in the word are you getting it that puts him in the word I made him cry so to get all that puts him in the word all right now being in the word then he can say that he was wounded for James Colley he was bruised for James company and with his stripes James Colley is healed that puts him in the word right okay if you're getting the point of what I'm driving at is the fivefold ministry spoke of in the Word of God okay is it but now I'm asking you this question is it in the Word of God the same way the mother cough or is in the work is it part of the work the same as Malachi 4 is part of the work see then that's why the Prophet would bring it 154 Church age book I'm getting these off a member from the head so if I miss it you know I think that's right what does he say talking about that it's not the person who comes predestinated eternally from God right it's the seed or word that right now it's not the person this person here this elements who we are the man we call William Branham the man Park its predestinated by God's foreknowledge but her brother said he knew what he would do and you he'd receive it and so he had it there for him so he's predestinated for me but the word that he broke goes all the way back to eternal life before the foundation of the world all right well I then why would it we not consider that the fivefold ministry said the word the same way because that's where we're not getting it the fivefold ministry is gifts from God to the church you know that deacon sometimes is of man okay see we're going over a few eyes you know that matthias took the place of Judas he's never mentioned the right tire where he was put in because man chose Matthias ever how you pronounce that if it's right what brother on say he said man chose matthäus he said God chose Paul he they were not to a voted on Matthias to put him back in but a wonderful point that they did do they didn't realize it and didn't know it and maybe you had never thought about it but there you got eleven apostles Judas has taken out had Paul been made to twelfth that would have been great and he was the one to be placed are supposed to have been look man put matthäus Matthias is 12 what's Paul 13 that's wonderful in the scriptures you realize in the original there was - Ben 13 there's 12 tribes and one the Levi number right come on trying to show you a little bit of something you'll think about it to find our place in the word and find out we're in that word and then maybe it'll help us that was originally - Ben 13 tribes not to 13th - being a tribe it was supposed to been 12 tribes and Levi would have been the metacenter the priests all right but when sin entered the picture they pulled out the man out of the center and he wound up with twelve tribes am i right you had to put this in the end of the place of that when you you remember two of them went off and c13 is right number you know when you get over you ever study this and the message you know that when we get on over to the millennium and the thing it'll be back to 13 just illustrating how perfect the Word of God he is if we'll just think about it it was always meant for that Levite to be the sinner he didn't have a tribe he had no inheritance have you read your Bible if you ain't going read it and Levite had no inheritance God was his inheritance but he was in the Word of God trying to get you to see are you in the Word of God alright so we know now for a certainty the to make secure of Malachi 4 was to do those two things 327 Church Angela he was to turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father right because John the Baptist turned them from the Old Testament word to the New Testament bringing forth the random was come to turn it back so that puts him in the word would that put you in I and that word to I like it when you get over in the scripture where he he told him and said let it be known that I turned her hearts back you remember that one but listen what are you getting - brother Dale if the prophet was predestined they did not listen to the wording it's not the person that's predestinated eternally are you women it's not the person predestinated eternally it's the word or seed in other words the word it's predestinated eternally see brother Branham then was predestinate by foreknowledge that God knew he picked that the nature of the man everything would be right but then what come to him with melikhaya for that's predestinate eternally from God oh those prophets were predestinated eternally what he called one of them which one was it he said I knew thee before the world and ordained you as a prophet Jeremiah what about him that prophet is God's mouthpiece to mankind no matter what age what's the talking about and even when brother Branham covers it you get on over to we're in the New Testament that you've got all of the Apostles within he speaks of AG of us being a prophet they chosen for that job those prophets were so chosen till if you go to masterpiece and listen to brother Branham you will see him telling you that the prophets built the body of the Lord Jesus because they were the word that built that body and John come to introduce the head and the head was Jesus Christ alright so those prophets had their part to build the body of Christ but what about the fivefold ministry can you follow the same line of a minister why is the minister has to have all the qualifications no my right any other fivefold ministry you've got to have those qualifications right or he can qualify for a ministry you've got how the qualification given the vertical priesthood it was perfect in line you see one that there's not a lot of fivefold ministry that are real genuine I'm number one to say that I don't have a problem there's a lot of preachers that call themself ministers I won't I'm not saying I ain't gonna listen to him I'm just saying angle make much arrangements well because they're off the word well who you what I move I'm me who are you that solves that problem we got all that straightened out ain't worth nothing you ain't Norton nothin either and there's no way in the world they ain't gonna give me no raise to preach on the fivefold ministry and I know when realize it's gonna make me go this way instead of that way well you know I done went this way because I know what a ministry is I've talked to ministers about their call to preach and walk away then God you either didn't call me that away or you didn't call them one one of us is misted yeah he followed you what a call to preach was called appreciate no rooster crowing up in a tree or a dream you have or a bad thing I come through the Baptist come on I come through the Baptist since you had the kids jump up when they hollered I'm called to preach I'm called to preach so what was it once you called it well I've had such bad luck well I didn't know bad luck called you to preach I didn't make light of them then but I thought about it that's why brother Allen said it this way he said you'll see scrapped needs of ministers and others piled along the way because they don't know what it is do you know what a the ministry is we just read that it was gifts given to man my phone ministry's gifts giving the man what's the profit come on Rafi there's a gift to mankind the fivefold ministry is a gift to mankind I didn't write the book you know what I mean the profits when it says he's one who said it and I read it to you there the other day what your pastors ordained and leads you through now what are you gonna do if you don't have one oh brother deal I got you there but a random it's my pastor you know he's going off the scene you can't you can't tell that ministers got to be some live kotas the gift now you know what I brought Sunday you that were here the fivefold ministry does not have a message we only carry the message the Prophet brought if we don't do it that way we're not in the ministry at all we don't have a message of our own the brain no we're supposed to bring what he said because according to the scriptures and according to the Prophet the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the site but do we believe it anyway is our dependency upon the fact of a God called gifts of a fivefold ministry and yours one's gonna slap a lot in the face it's missing out there cuz they're they listening you got a have a pastor I pastor a church you know what I've got a passenger ain't talking about this a brother Brendan's my pastor and then I'm the pastor of this no no because that parts didn't going on you can't do that I've got a live pastor your says wait there says Aaron Bob must be in the back room on the pole for us and there's brother Louise for ministers these are my pastors plus we don't hold it we've got all the ministry here you just my life at sea when you got him College no we're not in no way do we believe we got the fivefold ministry then you got to come here whatever Minister has got to have a pastor you believe a pastor has to pay tithe let it run said he's the first one that will that close enough well who do you pay your time soon here yeah yeah yeah and all that comes through this pulpit see my ties just telling you outward on the line my tie that comes to me I can't spend it on my own I can't take that I must give it to someone so I pay the preachers they come through we'll ask for an offering if it's a missionary etc right but if it's not a missionary or something special we don't pass the plate for a ministry that comes true I'll pay you because I got a plate I he says a little different what we think we think well who you paid I - I've had this said to me who do you pay ty - you're the preacher you can't pay it to yourself okay so I find somebody I can give it and many preachers don't say that no they're sitting in multi-million dollar buildings right and I ain't nothing to be nothing to me whatsoever well what about the fivefold ministry do you depend upon the fivefold ministry do you depend upon the fivefold ministry or you depend upon your own sail what is it if your pastor the Prophet said it ordained and lead you through then one wouldn't you not find your pastor why would you not want God's Way do you believe that he only read it to you some more I mean you want me to keep reading what he had to say you know here at one time of the message questions and answers' law having a shadow d9 we believe in church government and the government is ordained of the holy spirit in the Bible the pastor is always the head of the church the pastor is always that's God's elder in the organ and organization you have to come through the bishop you know we were done organization know the Bible there's no higher order in the Bible than the elder of the church just tell me where it's at there's no higher order in the Bible for the church than the elder which is the pastor he's the highest order of the Bible hear his voice in 1958 I'm persuaded that a lot of them don't know God and congregation and the congregation will never live any higher than its pastor they're bringing these up Pergamon church age which is 1960 that church ages so you talk about the hidden manna was a special revelation he said when he hidden manna dies brother Branham let's put him up there but come on right down this let's just get read what he said okay but the hidden manna was a special revelation because he had to teach the others see a little more knowledge of the scripture no that's what he had that he could teach other he's supposed to be is that right you'll never live no higher than your pastor you just remember that he and called he's the Shepherd that feeds you if he's the shepherd I like that if he's the Shepherd he's got to know where the mana is to feed the sheep now a little special watches super sign 1962 I can show you where God puts gifts and power in the church now hold on to that gifts God puts them in he talking about no speaking in tongues shouting the reason I listen I can show you where God puts gifts and power in the church I want somebody to put your finger on the scripture and show me where he took it out where he took it back from the church it's a super sign to the believer that we passed from death unto life because we feel that Holy Ghost Church I know what most people think they think a minister is a you call me when you're sick or you call me when you die you know what I mean you glad to have a fivefold ministry when you die gonna need somebody to bury that's not a joke that's true the point is what I'm saying is what do we need it all the time could it be one that we're not being could it be the reason we're here fifty years after the Prophet left is because the people are not putting their total confidence into the Prophet showing out to be pretty good right now in other words what I'm saying is going out to be pretty close call you see I'm just falling out every day leaving the message their dependence is not on it a lot that brought you into the message is no longer in the message what about the fivefold ministry it's the Bible right what did we read while ago about the fivefold ministry let's just read a few things wrote around them see than the massive statue of a perfect man number two if you want to start with it he said whether I maintain my family where I maintain with it let me maintain Christ's hope of glory build me up Lord into this let Christ be my head that work came through me on my foundation my faith is in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness and brotherly kindness work in me O Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sinker ground denomination or no denomination friend or no friend that that work in me let Christ virtue his knowledge Lord that I might be able to teach those for God has set in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists all for the perfecting and bringing these virtues into it for the perfection of the coming of the Son of God or the perfecting of bringing these virtues into it yeah but I just take what the Prophet said I'm not showing me how you're gonna get any further because you just ended your own point he said the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the signs the Bible says it is now many quotes do you need let's see there's 13 direct quotes that says is for the purpose the perfecting of the body God is said in the church some apostles secondarily prophets gifts and so forth in the church for that for one purpose for the perfecting of the body how many more do you want there's 13 there and all of these I'm not trying to be arrogant or hateful I'm trying to be truthful brother Branham says the fivefold ministry is for the perfect team and bringing these virtues into it well know how you're gonna get it without the fivefold ministry you're gonna have to buy some finds you another way to get the statue of perfect man without the fivefold ministry but I'd go straight to the Prophet go to the Prophet and watch the Prophet say you remember what I've always said when we started on the internet I knew we'd get questions in time and I've got a lot of questions that say brother Dale what is so-and-so mean I had brother Joe to write a thing I refuse to answer any questions on the Internet if you want to know anything go to your pastor now that's still on they're going and said if you don't have a pastor go to the Prophet that's always been on it why because look if brother Branham is right God has said in the church the Apostles the prophets of teachers evangelists fart of perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it how are you gonna get it without them if he's true see we don't think about what a ministry is let me get this real quick we don't think about what a minister I got him here we'll run around he said it's not you doing the preaching I mean you're one of them it's not you doing the preaching he said is God doing the preaching now there's a true minister will say brother Branham it's right on that but will we say the fivefold ministry is right what about it well brother Li just get it myself let show me where are you gonna go with it you say but you think that I'm being some kind of a sarcastic hateful thing trying to make you believe me if you ever got that in your mind just remember your own we walk out of a church in this message and I told my wife I said you can go to that church if you desire I will not go anymore those were the doctrinal issue over the new birth and they said I can't stand that but I said if you won't go there are you welcome to go and I walked out of the Baptist Church and walked out by myself because I didn't even tell my wife I was leaving she made up her own mind for her to follow to do I'm not trying to build any kind of a kingdom that ought to be proof of how long we've been here and what we've been doing and how we operated what we do as a church see I'm not trying to be I'm trying to just do what God says the Ephesians says that the fivefold ministry is guilty what is a gift what is it gift it's something given to you and if it's given to you to try to receive anything back it's not a gift something you've done or didn't do or whatever I'm glad you don't like it according to Romans the scripture says the gifts and calling of God are without repentance you don't repeat to get a gift now listen I've got them laying here quote after quote where there's a fivefold ministry but there's nine spiritual gifts are probably seen but now the nine spiritual gifts a gift and go from one to the other one you could speak in tongues you could see how to Camus you maybe never do that again he says he said because that's in the body but he said the fivefold ministry is gifts five offices you know thought about that how many times I tell you that life Sunday I'll remember I got him laying here he said that's five full minutes for his offices he said even deacons are man-made I said read your Bible matthäus was man-made never accounted for anything in the Bible they should have waited don't Paul no but listen church how about predestinated gifts you realize the gifts the fivefold ministry is predestinated now listen I'm gonna say something that I don't generally talked this way and I didn't have no plans for anybody else to be here none of my business I stopped I preached when I preach I don't try to make it hurt anybody or what to do I just do what I'm doing if you don't believe you got away fine with me but gifts it's not the person that comes to me that's Nate and eternally it's the word or seed now can you follow what I've been saying Malachi for is the word or seed of the Bible right that's why we don't have a message we branch are supposed to break down what the prophet has brought and deliver it to the people right is it not true that Jesus took bread and blessed it and then he didn't hand it to nobody he's in wait a minute he handed it to the Apostles he didn't fight it out itself he handed it to them all the way through the whole Bible you don't have to worry about it that's where I don't worry because I'm standing behind the word or predestinated gifts I believe brother Branham now listen listen one saying the gift that he had which was the fulfillment of the Word of God to fulfill melikhaya for Luke 1730 revelation 2:10 7 and all of those scriptures was to be fulfilled by profit that was predestinated eternally from God and was going to take place it didn't make no difference who tried to stop it because if it's a predestinated gift you can't stop it oh you agree within the fivefold ministry as predestinated attorney not the person into sin brother branham wouldn't pretest flesh man brother branham was not predestinated eternally he's predestination from God by foreknowledge to come down to be the one that that would come through but to gift itself was a gift given to mankind to bring us the word what about the fivefold ministry if it's true the Prophet said the fivefold ministry is to break these things down earth - if that's true then Paul is riding Romans when he said he he gave some apostles he cashed on profits you didn't just get one ministry throw it out he gave a five fold ministry the gift itself was predestinated eternally from God come on I can read all night of unity if you've got a gift even a non spiritual gift Iori women if you even with a nine spiritual gift that's gifts in college or without repentance you didn't repent to get it and when the Bible says seek ye the most earnest gift that's not the fivefold ministry the fivefold ministry don't seek she is what she is gifts and calling her without you can seek those they said seek the most earnest gift but for the fivefold ministry I didn't call myself to preach may I illustrate a second all of you know the story some of you haven't but years ago Wade was doing good he could I've sent him down with the ministers of this message and he could talk pretty good and he's about to a thirteen years old but like all little boys he went out slid away went out in the world took a while to come back and stood in this pulpit declared it over and over and over that God had done told me he's coming by so let him tell you his story of how did he fault and run and done everything else one day God stopped him we had a little cabin up in the mountains we didn't have no landline phone and he was trying to get a hold of us and we were up there with her little cell phones and couldn't contact so he finally got back home then we got back home the phone was ringing off the hook daddy did I gotta talk to you okay I was just greening they've heard they didn't tell you the story how he thought he had a heart attack and forever sent to me Gil he did know what you see when he got where he couldn't find mom and daddy he goes outside at work and says Lord I can't find my Mama and Daddy to pray for me he said I guess it's not my daddy that I'm looking for you're my daddy that got settled on that part and the new birth got involved well all right I went to nanny one day told her I said to her you don't tell nobody but I said Lord doesn't showed me more then what about what he now said what do you mean I said he's gonna be standing in the pulpit with me ministry you said you sure - I'm sure what I said we can't tell him now how many people would keep that most everybody would run to him say I'm gonna put you up from the church well you gonna be you gonna preach I said we can't tell nobody mama keep it a secret we didn't not six months he had a pretty horrible time I still green cuz when your trust in God and you know it's true you don't worry about it you grin if not for the fact that you glad something then it's just the fact that you know who it's all absurdum he come to me one day and he said daddy sound talk to you I said you don't want to talk to me now he's setting the time I didn't question him and didn't say a word about what he said I said you don't want to talk to me I ain't the one you need to talk to he said do you know what's going on I said I've known for six months I still didn't say Sunday morning we're gonna put you up he's gonna be my son that's preaching that's it run son would you do that with your I said run mr. coach you know what brother branham said you go volunteer and god cait use you I said run until he runs you down you think I was worried about him problems no I said let on him lord if he's gonna preach he needs to learn now to get a little bit of wisdom and patience and times before he gets in the pulpit how about another six months feisty he said daddy said last okay Sunday we're going now she gonna preach what you understand what I'm saying if that was a gift in my life for that vision our dreams or whatever you wanna call it was morbid more of a knowledge coming to me see I wouldn't worry I knew it was settled the five film industry I see we tell the story of that but we don't tell all the story you know lives another boy involved because they was too in the Bible no it was too in the Bible the prodigal son went out and splurged and run it old route and not to come back but there was a brother that are with him you don't never hear that one talked about you remember yeah it was a little bit perturbed when Daddy had the prodigal son coming back and the big thing was doing but you know what I like did you see that's what Terrence had always been he just always been there you know what I like the daddy said one thing to the son and that solved the problem you remember what he said he said son he said you've been with me that he went out did you study read your Bible you know what old brother got over his pouting spell and everything went pretty good gifts what about it God trained you all of you laughed usually 30 minutes right that way the Prophet said this for one sermon he said what about it is the fivefold ministry predestinated eternally from God he's in the word it's in the word well I don't believe you went up and that ain't got nothing do with it dumb donkey telling you the truth you got to believe the dumb don't give truth right see just don't worry about when we're brilliant we can't figure out what you are don't worry about it I've been that way all my life ain't never figured it out yet but I do understand on one time I know what this whole boys been through and I know if it wasn't a gift in his heart he would not be pastoring this church today the a gift is a gift God gave you a gift he's Minister brother he gave you a gift for whatever is needed some apostles some prophets some evangelists pastors different ministries he gave different ministries so you got to find your place there's your adoptions and things you know you remember Manasseh over in the cornfield and should have been over on the other side you know the story of adoptions and things the Prophet taught you don't read the book everybody's got to find their own place brother Dale you're not afraid to stand up before the world and declare what you're talking about tonight cause if it's the truth it's not all right I got no problem if it ain't the truth some body's gonna holler because they can't stand it and they're gonna come screaming brother Dale I want to straighten you out well alright I've always been wanted I can take correction too so don't worry about it but don't come with me and tell me I want brother Dale I won't i won't straighten you out cuz this is what i think i don't care what you think bring me the profit bring me what he says and we'll talk we can go talk on your ideas your my ideas don't worry about it see when you stand in the position God will honor that and make it I've seen the dead raised the sick healed things happenin ever form could be thought of as Oh sister Julie the only thing I've never seen was blinded eyes to open so we ain't worried about that God's taking care of that part he's once doing this he just raised right why do you worry if you know where you stand it I'm talking about a gift ain't talking about me ain't talking about no people ain't talking about brother branham that human element he was was a human being is it true that he said one night at a motel with a gun in his lap is that true what he said why didn't he just walk in the other room say God you take care of it I'm going to bed cause he was a human being that was that outside man right give some collars or without repentance you don't repent to get a gift that's not here it's either gift to your aunt guilty you've even got a gift or you don't have a gift that's just as simple as it is because it's without repentance you don't repent to get it but is the FIFO ministry that's the point of making will quit is the FIFO Ministry predestinated eternally from God if it is we have a wonderful wonderful God and Savior we're supplied all he has need of I don't mean this in derogatory form I mean it in the truth the prophet has passed on I say it I've always been that way the prophet has passed on if you're waiting on the prophet to come you're gonna have to have your dependence upon him to come so get prepared go get him in our plane ready now I'm not throwing off on nobody that's God's honest truth I've always told you where I stand we got 30 40 days after the resurrection brother Branham could preach all over the world 30 40 days but he don't need no airplane to fly a gift what did he mean when he said her when who it was a hope that was praying with Oprah emini which one which was the life hope the medium what is meant when she said lord I don't know whether to marry this guy or not come on is that what she is praying seriously was that what she was praying I don't know what to do he said I send you Elijah the Prophet oh I'll send you Malachi for Elijah the Prophet give or not to be played with you can believe this or not that's no problem with me I don't worry about it you can take a gift and sell ice cream to an Eskimo if you got a gift they may be hard for you to think about one is you can do it in the gift line of natural people you have people would give that is in the ministry I mean in the church and things you don't let falls on that and you got people there that can talk good they can do this they can do that you don't never watch something like that you don't never listen to some of these guys with their great processing fret what's that word to use presentations that they can just man they just make you till you know it's been told if they these people that could do that and they have you standing up shouting money money and they're stripping you have ever done they can get and you hollered money they got gifts you carpenters Tony really carry gifts for some reason they learned a little something different than most people as to how to do things and it goes haywire my brother Gary we were down there and he was looking at a while see he's looking at there I just stand out on life and go I knew what the mortal guy was going through how in the world I'm not going to get this thing changed and Julie shaking her head so she probably heard a lot of it what you know one day something went me some can't take evidential I'll put this on with you know Patel I'm do that Tony comes in Tony's a good one you don't know I know a lot about him if he lays the tile down on the floor don't like wet Lucy have taken to relay it but that's a part of a gift when he's finished unified to worry about it he gifts or marvelous things the gifts the same to give to play instruments to give to work on cars to do this this gives and that's time because God is the great gift to hand down to mankind what kind of world would it be with all carpenters right it's what I told you about Richard he took a motor apart one day up in the building dr. house I said we're gonna joke it sucker I said if I've me not doing that to you when I took that boat out I'd write down where that boat went back I said cuz that's the only way I'd get back he said now here we're doing it you know what one day got back getting it run coordinates I'm surprised me get rolling what still I'm trying to break it part over you okay everyone said that's all I got is a gift to break that spell say see savings bond in both of your minds or what I'm talking about of the fivefold ministry so we try to break it off okay you don't know I do that you just watch it what you see Church gifts are a wonderful thing but what about the giver instead of the gift you know there'll be a lot of people at the white throne be given the gift of eternal life right they'll be given the gift of eternal life with the bride will be sitting there with the giver inside of them I want to give her didn't worry about Holly's other thing because if I got to give her he'll work it out because the gift is God when it says he gave some was he giving himself are you following me we're trying to quit he gave himself the greatest gift that could ever be he's Almighty God to come down to a mortal human being and just fellowship with you do you and the giver becomes one so you don't understand you know it's hard to explain something to people that they they don't experience it I can walk in the study and be down and out and just all on the bottom and I can say Lord I got a preach Sunday would you just help me now would you tell me what to tell the people and then I'll be all right oh yeah sometimes I get it sometimes I don't sometimes I get up and go hunting sometimes I get up and go out in the yard I go do this and do that I'll get up in the night walking through the house but you know all at once he comes and he says this is what we need okay okay then that's what it does cuz that's the gift everybody has a gift of some phone everybody has a gift of some phone but then it just gets higher and higher and higher then you come up through and you got gifts you got just now listen I'm trying to explain what at all so then you got gifts of like prophecies and and all kinds of things that's in the five spiritual gift I mean nine spiritual gift you've got all kinds then you move up another step and when you do you find up with five gifts not ten and he names them God gave the church on the day of Pentecost five gifts here's a quote from the Prophet brother Branham will the bride have a ministry he said sure she consists of apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers have you found your spot have you found your place because the gift will only work when you find your place the true gift then we had gifts and callings with it who was it come on maybe Roman I think he's right I believe it was Adolf Hitler that said one of those great men like that worldly mean not not Christian he said but my greatest goal is to reach the person that is the furthest away from me he didn't mean distance his greatest goal was to conquer the mind of mankind he done it had it not been for the gifts that was promised and a bride as to the age and the time we're doing he would have annihilated the world because he had it in his hand who ended World War one they don't even know what happened with Hitler he turned his whole thing over to one more and said I'm not gonna surrender I've read this the other day you know commentary about it he said I'm not gonna surrender he said you take over and you surrender the country you know what he doing wasn't a bunker and killed himself because he knew that that's as far as he could go Church what about it can we depend upon the fivefold ministry because listen you're either going to depend on the fivefold ministry to carry you through or carry you through and as much you know are you gonna put your dependence on brother branham racing you've got to do one of the other no come on I don't have no problem with anybody I need first one nobody ain't telling nothing about it I'm just saying you're gonna have to do it well get on with it he said well you sure do sound funny because you say that he could raise and preach through 30 40 day yeah but I ain't sitting around right now fiddling my thumbs I'm still trying my best to let that gift speak to the people that's my goal to let the gift that God gave me be for you cuz that's what he done that's why you've got a five fold ministry j esus co jesus christ is the gift that was given you say you sure took a long way to get to the Hat you know these ins tells you that five gifts are given those five gifts in jesus christ the word for the Aged in time come on musician the word for the age in time is the gift given to the church yeah what do you think about it that's why I don't want no problem I'm just as happy as can be about one time but I'm brokenhearted about the little bride because she's not putting her dependence upon the five film industry I'm sorry that's the life statement the people of this message are not putting their dependence upon the fivefold ministry you see Church why I stand wounded because you see if brother brand is gonna come back he's gonna have to come back through and teach the ministry and let the ministry teach us you tell me no problem you tell me who's in the best shape you sent down nervous and littering can't figure it out and wondered this happen I don't know if that we need to go here we need to go that we need to do this and I'm just going around down the road said Lord give me what to say to you people and let our people catch the word and didn't you manifest whatever you need to whatever you need to listing let's sing let's sing number 350 he's alive and well key of G G [Music] to turn [Music] how about it the helium island whaling is done

gift that you've given is not any of these Minister brother in this ministry you're alive and well in the hearts and the people of this day in the word you promised us the Prophet said the bride would would be the final voice to the final age so it's not just us ministers and it's not just the one that started the whole thing and bringing the message it's bringing it down to a place that Jesus
