Matthew if you notice I started off where Jesus was speaking here they wanted to know how to prayer and Jesus told Jose do you pray after this matter he said a lot of which are in heaven how do we beat our name hallelujah halibut I named I kingdom come you see I breathed places the word in your place in the word had I can occur and I will be done on earth as it is in heaven honey if you know that with Jesus prayer when he when the disciple took this prayer how did Jesus Hill he was older but he was not in them honey so we give to he go back to the 17-yard chapter Holly he was now he's saying he's speaking again he says now this keen of not coming it's already in you honey we're not looking for his kingdom of God we know it's already in us if I had a title this morning I'm going to use the full revelation is revealed on earth and full maturity is lived on earth how do you know what we've been in this message a long time how do you he's gotta be you know we don't you know over the years we've been like here we had to grow up we we started other charities and we fighting each other and we try to do prove Revelator prudent you don't need to prove God hello God stand by your own word other so you know where so we begin to see us a becoming into food is a maturity in the Word of God so now we can take the scroll thing is a God so we not discard anymore I don't get you say well the world is falling apart that's the world but it ain't got nothing to do with you so I begin to look at these things right here now I'll just stop talking about the four revelation here is coming to a full maturity is coming to it's time it's time for us to get ready but what we gonna grow up honey when we go grow up have you been writing the message of the 20 year and I'm still gonna temper something is wrong with your revelation how do you get a later Tip O'Neill to say God give me the bat to go topside a burner to sign out hello so we begin to look at these things right here I'd say you know I you just today I'll say you know I said when Moses would never hit the Red Sea her how do you notice here when they get to the Red Sea it was a lot more they begin to act like a little child at the Red Sea Holly if you know what he did he began to cry Holly begin to cry becau he would have her pressure put on him and he was biscuit he was forgetting of maturity Holly motor was standing there and he started to cry and what did God tell me more than what you crying for me take the word and speak the word and go for honey he demand the Red Sea did not open by cry the Red Sea open by speaking the word how do you know your position in the word holy so now I want you to notice so we want to begin over gonna slow down a few minutes and use the scripture I said no it's time to be able and mature sons of God what they've got the people in bounce in the message they try to take quote with our Bible and you get out of bounds you show me where brother Brandon ever left the Bible you cannot prove message when a call but you could take the message and see the Bible that is the clear that you feel revelation here tell what people's out of bouncing that maybe where I got a quote my brother Meza take it back to the woods if you cannot sign it in the word you ain't got a revelation yet he did not say on your call will become a new quote he said your Bible become a new Bible tell you once you see your name in the Bible oh yeah this is your writer on told me that this is the man well you got your Bible you Karen the man but will you cut the messy reveal you got his wife and she come out of here you can't separate the Bible from the bride in the Bible they ought to say something we want to look at the kingdom Jesus is the full revelation Holly is revealed on earth now would you to knows her people said brother I've been studying the message for years I've been looking in the buyer I've been trying to I've been living a good life one time we thought the message was wearing long sleeves and water and everybody were and everybody had to be dressed that's part of you ought to be holy but that ain't the message you can become a good priests other people dead one that way at that time and brother brother cemetery how do you and preachers at that day they begin to become a screaming they begin to say if I'm in one time here I wonder my brother Bridget he's never woman wear a dress she is a prostitute come on man when you show me that in the Bible possibly waiting addresses the spirit behind holu every dress it leaks it he'll call it here holiday daddy ain't got nothing to do with the front making a right but she that way that what people thought it was one time hey though it was a book of Ruth and then lower you live in a book a rule you're still under the law you ain't found Christ yet but you know notice that we want to look at how we get this revelation right one more scripture here different foundation I'm gonna speak on this fella right here because this guy right here was a religious man he was a not only he was a religious man he was a renowned man he was a people a man that everybody look up to and I'm gonna read st. John 3 about no one talked about Judah knows this guy right here this is a guy right here he ain't no word everything Madrid he dressed right Holly if you need somebody to come play for your baby in the heart bill he would have done that hallelujah done we're just got right here all his ducks in order I'll do but we are not trying to get you honey we're not trying to get you holida you know well you know we come to and we were taking her just with maturity if we were looking at all right this is a life that man was not smoking part of drinking but was he was a clean man he had a good testimony and he was a ruler in the sickness so we go to st. John the 3rd chapter beginning at the first verse and did everybody say that was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews how little got bigger yeah I lose I baby you brought one right here hey man it's me right here you told my man it's got no Moses but they didn't know the God that moves to preach maybe when they knew the goddamn modes of freedom whatever he was he would have cut where he was getting to it but it didn't movie he does no doubt he was looking at he could probably take the Bible in the Old Testament and tied you up he says her and in a in him what what he said and that was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus of the Jews this the same came to Jesus by night and said unto Him rabbi we know that thou art a teacher come from God for no man can do these miracles that I does except God be with him in a way you know where he was now how would you know he's he come to Jesus and he was acknowledging Jesus as a teacher but then why did he go to his teacher he went to his miracles so he never was that he would never employ his teaching he was influenced by his miracles so when he came to Jesus he was looking at what he saw the manifestation of the light now he said we know you are a teacher he was a teacher if he would have been finally cheated with a position he placed in the world huh but he was looking at miracles here so now would you know him look Jesus Oh Gina he was giving Jesus a compliment he thought you know you know people get excited about miracles I believe in miracles I've been praying for the sick if you'll believe it that part of it but don't let miracles they see because of a man can have miracles in his life and be going around running around come into judgment doing everything else how do you know that my brother and you preach the face repulses going with it he saw two preacher one I promised I wouldn't run to interpretate you one man was a genuine Bamboula or to go and none was a genuine devil so we look we cannot look at things like that we got to stay with the open word for this day so you go to here so Jesus watch that Jesus never quit Jesus never even acknowledged to come in you know if somebody go tell us right thank you brother yeah but Jesus said man ain't got nothing to do with it he said jesus knew that satan would be an impersonator and he would impersonate it with him gifts cuz he knew what jamming and jamming would did but you know where he was the word he knew all instant he knew that it was gonna be outpouring in miracle and then would the day the world will be deceived by hit up outpouring of miracle they never want you to be because they go see his miracles so he go to the says Jesus and Jesus said unto Him verily I say unto her Lee really I say unto thee except a man be born again he goes right to the new birth he goes right to the anywhere he say all they don't matter how they okay how much you scream I know how much you shot except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God you all understand it at all so he will let you understand how will we get there ever we got to come to a new birth his new birth is the important thing here people say well hey it don't matter I've been a good person that is not the new birth that's not the new birth hello the new Barfield were you in Jesus Christ become the very revelation thank God persons are you that is your new birth so we begin to look here we begin to look at the place right because we don't know what it you know how we go understand what Jesus purposes how we going to say what was his purpose to come here hallelujah he didn't come here to show up how did it go fishing with you I need to go hunting with you how Luda said that he'll fish rise with you hey that was not him purpose for coming oh brother you know what I'm wearing the cheese about bugs and that was not the first neither was that brother Brandon purpose for coming to the man bringing the message to the bride his message was not to come the show even though they anything wrong with that my name is Nadia purpose cause what I got is hey get you I got this baby I gotta get that domain than the God you better get the new birth you got to get Christ in you but we got to say what was his purpose to come his per be had if he come without a purpose and Jesus himself when he discover you ain't gonna do no better good and we just show up on earth he ain't got no purple familiar how do some people live the whole life ain't got a purpose you ain't got a purpose you see people today I bet people here they say you spot there you actually what they do I hear it no matter no purpose of life hey God no you just just living day by day no purpose but Jesus had a purpose and you said what was Jesus a purpose in the word I'm just gonna read this you write first John 3 verse 8 says he that committeth sin is of the devil for the devil sent from the beginning for this purpose for this purpose for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the words of the devil Aelita were sure there would work holiday deceiving spirit Holly what deceiving is not hollow he this evening Oh God are you gonna be so full idea that is not this evening the CMAs where is so close and look right is almost right how dude that is what this evening you got to be able to discern between almost right and take the Holy Ghost to do that cuz he said if it wouldn't be that way he would be see the very relatable as possible so we began to look up new names right here so we begin to look what was the purpose is to destroy the works of the devil we got to get that in our mind how do you say what the devil made me do it that is what the whole ego come to do what to destroy the works of the devil how do you said my brother your head away what it is here we start trying to get this right before we get the inside right how do you know where did we fall on our things we realize here I cannot live right in there no you hate the Holy Ghost girl if you could do it you would need the Holy Ghost you could give yourself but pat myself on the back no you can't pat yourself on the back you got to look the Calvary you got to look at what Jesus already done for you how do you begin to realize I couldn't do this in myself but I can do all things through him that's good to me earlier and he had a purpose here he purposes though he want his kingdom to be expressed you know where he want his kingdom to be expressed holiday don't you know why he he he said behold the kingdom of God is within you if the kingdom of God is in with you you must have a king to rule it if he got a kingdom may might be a king to rule it how did Jesus is our king hunger here's our king he the way you said would you try to say I think you got to become King Jesus in your life hundred keenya keen revelry the key Alpha and Omega keen the lineal divided keen the resurrection keen the life he's gonna become net in other words he goes here cuz he crisis mystery of God revealed and one of the most powerful messages that preach the whole seventh seal it connected all Hagar if brother Brandon could have took this matches alone and tied the whole Bible together crisis that misses got revealed how he ended the church ages and he said he looked at he looked at the clock said now 2 o'clock holly is the end of the second pour the third poll is open would the third book Christ the words running here's the third poll that sealed is crying I leave the trumpeters fire Holly all that is Christ don't you get inside no problem revelations over here this part the crisis this ain't all liberals Christ how do you say when you get the Holy Ghost you got the full book how many know where anyway so he go there you if you knows her I will get you something in a minute he did not tell the bride Holly to eat half the book how he did not tell about a happy book how they're done it's gonna be a full revelation might be a fool eaten it might be a full revelation might eat everything that's in the book hallelujah Lord the days you know today you know everybody got certain things in life most people don't like greens too much you know you agree especially kids you put some you put some super small some salad or something not solid stuff like green beans and stuff like spinach that kid lookin at you man anymore mister I mean I look at me cuz he don't see no need for the green but in the word but if the need boy honey even though I eat spinach not because I like I gave you a list and the stuff but I eat it because I know I needed my wife I tell me right here if I had my way alone I was just probably eat chicken every day I'm probably eat chicken every day you know I mean that this is she let me go on the grocery one time I say what you see there and she said hey would you wanna read mine she said get what you like that was easy I come back home with $40 for chicken she got upset she said when you buy all the chicken bother you told me to get what I like but cheated until he's to eat at all he did not tell him eat half the lamb he's I eat the whole plan how to eat it all up Holly so he wanted a while because now it's time for the full revelation to be manifest we gotta eat the whole book now Holly this is the ride coming to cry we gave me half her something level we gotta eat the whole day in the way beginning to look a little bit of petition in Christ and mister God reveal I probably use just he had a reason his purpose was he said Christ mister God revealed paid twenty five he said and the third to restore the King to restore the kingdom to his rival to the position that felled by by the first Adam back to where they woke in the cool of the evening will with his people talk with them fell the shipping with them Amy now sin and death has separated them from his present and his entire expression dude do you either do you read it so now he's he's figure he said but before the foundation of the world he to express o his attribute but he was so what do we go about what did the four of it we got to go back Jesus cry God become the full manifestation in Jesus's earth now I become to Christ is the mystery of God revealed how to cry God Himself come in tabatha himself hello which is called Emmanuel God himself in Telemachus is Allah so Jesus himself hello I would tell you what but yet still he had to come to a point in his life it is his him being God himself he had to believe his own words how did Jesus were not just going around he was not he was not what gave him in he knew who he was dad what Jesus saying he they you could describe my body discarded Kippur and I raise it up in three days he said what he just said it no he didn't say that he was preaching what the attributes are it's a holiday bit already spoke Holly I won't leave his soul in Hell neither will I settle my heart in the word user but JD look with David Dunn how could David Dunn older sin and Jesus going to hell on that Hollywood not good look at that David body he was looking at the word that David's whoa how did that was not David speaking that was God's we could do David you know if we begin to look here we begin to look at the face right here I say you know that's why we got to get back to where we come from he said to restore the kingdom by how do you now want to see Christ we wanted her we want to see cry we want to see the fullness of the word come back a little bit Jesus himself had to find himself Jim that we did he found himself he knew he was he goes to take the scroll but he begin to quote we were he there the anointing of God is upon me I know my position in the world Jesus himself he and he had to come to a baptism how do we receive the word well-pleaded well he's kept it there no need a God above me then he go right to the the desert the fruited he was a word he played with he realized to the devil to prove that the world is more powerful than quicker than any to end so he went to the desert of proof hell you could take the word and beat the devil any place anywhere anytime Hollywood you know your position so Jesus go down to the desert in the dermis come to it and it's greatest battle ad ever Holly we needed at his weakest point of life everybody got the wheat ports here I go do we what we look you know sometimes Melanie we lose loved ones great little people that we love people sure - sometimes separating you to such a weakened support and you that's - Pam didn't ever fight you - hardest but that time of your weakest point that's the time that God gave you more revelation nobody wanted to go do that but that's the time you get revelation that God proved it your son of God how do you let them he let the he get cut up the prudent yield son of God everything coming against you depression and every day they'll fight you your weakest part he was still standing on the Word of God how do you know when I've been sick for a long time and I've been praying how old to the Word of God honey you ready go down and faint then they go down and out so Jesus get down in the desert when he got so hungry and it got down then he was at its weakest point man boy you know when people get hungry they get crazy I'm gonna tell you right now you want to get a woman man and you let her get hungry I believe hello yeah you know you retry them down the road means I always get this attitude ain't stopping for a long time but that ain't gonna help me you're gonna watch it means you better enjoy driving by yourself and then women go let you know a rest I ain't waiting no longer already deep he said this way no no no get me some meat I'm tired of you been driving but Jesus that just weakest point when he was so weak you know it was been easy for Jesus he was it was God all he had to do is say let this mountain be come bring it man you told me he didn't want to cook bread with me again man in the world and you know you know what hallelujah let it be brand he would had all the bread he won't he could have picked up a stone said turn it into bread haloo he had the power to do it but if he would've did that then how would we have covered ears in the word we would have been looking at Mira because we wouldn't say I got to see a miracle before I bleed God he want you to see the word know where he was not trying to get you to see a miracle if we would have turn it into a stone into bread yeah we all would have been looking for miracles every time I try but I need to see a miracle how do you know he want you to see the word sadly so Jesus is saying to come to earth to Jesus if thou be the Son of God command that these stones be made bread hello Jesus ain't no ingénue and that Jesus had the authority to do so but Jesus also had the authority to recognize the voice of Satan because the Jesus discerned the stalled in the bread he had to consume it himself to the powered oedema god never told him the door and he said I don't do nothing except the father showed me he said it is written I'll do it he's a man should not live by bread alone haloumi got me we why did he did not take from what he said he told Adam you eat bread into the day you go back to the desert but would it come down to either that will let you know devil I got no I told Adam in the beginning I'll do that man ate bread I won't let you know man should not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he knew who he was Holly there were so he knew who he was saying Kodomo trying to give him to cast us out when I did give his angels charge concerning except you - I defeated gives us he's saying himself we're trying to figure out it's just really God if he's God angels encamped around me I know how he would I know they're happy they were there I'm up in Serbia - defeated again so he was trying to figure out who we really were he really wouldn't be sure Holly because that birth he came so mysterious saying couldn't figure this thing out so he trying to figure out who this man is read the devil don't you tempt the LORD thy God Halloween knew who he was how do you even talk he was fully mature word this say dk2 Muffy that I showed him all the kingdoms of the world show them the glory of them so I give you this I let you have all this that you have all mankind all your sons of God everything here I give you a everybody was already blown the guy oh yeah yeah we're appointed become on the keener word that would included us anyway I give you all the kingdoms read the word if you make me the second I'll make you the second person in the god here he would offer Jesus to be the second person in the Godhead Jesus was the guy what are you telling them it is red hallelujah I washing the LORD thy God and him only shall I serve he was the Godhead so you know so I want you to read I'm trying to get to this former show you coming up to here and we got a if before we could get a revelation to who we are we've got to get a revelation who is caught what is that what we gonna be how this earlier we're so you said we we try to get back to a place Holly we try to do but first off what the play have been done today how they even even in this message we got people that confuse himself in the message honey they've been so busy so busy trying to get the vibe brother Brandi and Miss Jesus brother Brandon only put Jesus first he always get a word preeminence but people today they want to see some Manresa holy one man that Ray and his name cried Jesus he conquered the grave and hail that would that made people mad cuz they say they wanna have some it was some flesh they can hotel Holly you know where brother Sam is your pastor he's not your God hello he only day he died God gave him what the gift that I'd if I kill any brothers that preach the gospel her came a divine you learning how to yield himself so God are used a gift to speak to the body of you but some people said get the body mixed up with the give how do they give ain't got nothing to do with brother sale that's the whole ego that's God's figure if you've no got nothing to do with me as God told it is his gift and if I learned how to submit or he can use it don't give me the glory killing Nazari it's here spigot Aliyah praise God and get the stain in order I'm just freedom and I told myself you know G here when I told you I had done quit preaching I said to let God do it that's been all time trying to put it together didn't I get up and maybe make a boo-boo but boy when he get to do it he always make it come out right I literally you know would that be so hard for man to do to translate yourself aside let God use that would it be that what this day I guess I gotta try to help God Holly I gotta try to do something new you need to try to believe Holly they were you helping God he's gonna do god I don't need no help Holly God don't need you to try to push him along he don't need no cheerleader he needs somebody to believe him Helen I'm gonna get here so we went to say I'm gonna say Jesus that ID he'd recognize who he was but Jesus himself even in his earthly ministry he had to come to his fullness because he could not claim all of even though he was he was walking on earth but it was a portion he could never really clean he walked on earth and he was in and when he walking on earth he was doing something that means you would do he was getting no meaning he had somebody Sears up on Holly there were dozens that was saying called it old age man I used to didn't think too much about it but they're getting to kind of show up now I mean I stopped you said you know I know y'all older people when I say this you say he never the boy I didn't turn 56 we've got y'all jump you don't you be smelling cuz I know you think it's handy you know boy he's a whole man but here we are but anyways I didn't you know it's something in my body a beginning you know getting the real realized now the day I picked up something I pick every time I pick up something I just ain't like Zack can pick it up one any I'm getting the feel the stuff man I mean is either when I got it up still the same man I used to be get you a Harley David and get you a pony deal let me go get you by your it was a part of his ministry that he himself he could not he he had a come to the border with himself he had to
