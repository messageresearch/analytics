something online another night about six weeks from now you know when no no hair keepers you know your hair is gonna be this long and your beard is gonna be this long but we're gonna try to keep it all trimmed a little bit and not wear such wild socks do not put the camera on those socks do not and his mother will have a fit your mama know you even have them okay she probably bought them for you didn't she Oh grief talk to your mama this coming Sunday this comes they're yellow they're banana yellow with two cans on them something Lewis would wear yeah got someone Nellie's them okay we have had a few requests if y'all would like to we're going to try to do this Sunday as we did last Sunday so those of you listening in or watching in or listening later on in the week we are going to send out the same text message basically to be the same thing we're not going to wish brother Dell another happy birthday that's okay if we do but tomorrow will be his birthday and he'll be 80 years old tomorrow so god bless him for living such a wonderful long laugh but sunday will service will start at 10 o'clock but as we were discussing now this friend he's going to be different because we're going to have two services so the second service will be just our normal what we have and I don't mean to exclude I say we the people that come every Sunday never wins didn't some musicians the deacons the ministers and some of the different lassie that comes that we're going to have second service will start at one o'clock so if you come Sunday morning that's okay we're still gonna do you know we'll be live-streaming Sunday afternoon if you want to go home that's fine if you want to stay you have to make arrangements to get you something to eat and eat in the car because you can't come in here and eat to keep our social distancing at a minimum so if you want to come please do for those of you that are coming Sunday school start at 9:30 just like we always do but regular services start at 10:00 and then brother Dale will speak and then we'll have a break and then one o'clock one house that service so if you'd like to come we wish you would make sure you stay in your car though do not get outside and mingle between cars so as we don't cause any problems we don't want to any problems we've let this open a little bit I hear the government's doing that too so let's just pray for our leaders that you know it's it's kind of strange that you become human until you're a politician so you know and then they have to do everything perfect so they're there all over our government but I I just wanted I wanted to if I was trumped what I would do is is I would call one of them people that are bashing him from seeing in and all them different fate news networks I would say come up here and you stand behind this podium and you tell me what you can do better than I'm doing if you're gonna criticize me come up here if you got a better way I'll hear it but say they won't do that no they won't do that but just pray for our leaders the Bible tells us to do that told us to pray for those who have authority over so he's doing the best he can they're the group he's got us doing the best they can but we know one that's perfect and that's God Almighty and we understand too that all things happen for our good nothing happens to harm a Christian right so and then all that there is going to be weapons formed against us but he's already raised up a standard God didn't did this surprise him the other day when all this happened he knew exactly this was right in what he foresaw and the plan he foresaw and he knew whether you would pray are you where you wouldn't pray same way we need to pray for brother Joel Forney laying up there in the hospital and Charlotte he was life flighted in the helicopter because he had bleeding on his brain he had a blood clot there in his right side of his brain that thorny half stroke and they're waiting for him to wake up we're just gonna pray that God will supernaturally move on the same they bought man's already done what man can do man's done what man can do they went in they've operated they've done the best they could now we're we're gonna ask God to do something supernatural bring him out of that because we need him and he has a group of people now that needs him there in North Carolina and we pray for them also so god bless you let's turn our Bibles to galatians 3 we're going to continue on with this journey of believer part seven we're going to get into we know that as Sunday what we're going to do is is move over into another chapter in Ruth and see how another person made her way through a journey that is a parallel to what our Christian journey is just like Abraham but remember there was four parts to her journey okay deciding whatever it was resting I read it and then reward it we got to get the reward part is the adoption brother branham talks about it's good to be born again it's good to go through the three stages of grace and get to the circumcision but tonight we're going to get to where Abraham comes to a place where he meets God in human flesh and he gets a promise from God that promise comes to pass and then God tells him to take him out and kill him take him out and kill him I'll give you the promise son now will you do what I ask you to do okay so we'll read it through the scripture and we will take a little snippets out and move on as we can also I just want to tell you that all of y'all they got your stimulus package pay your tithe that is game pay your tithes on that money brothers and sisters that's just you should already know now but sometimes you get things and you go man this is great oh well I need to pay tithe on that cuz this game so and even Trump told you to do it he said don't forget your spiritual leaders don't forget your church that you attend and it's important I don't see where where that the world needs some form of religion whether it be whatever it is and and I was thinking today I thought well we as the bride we we're we're you know millions maybe across the world but there's gonna be untold billions of people in that new city I mean can go in and out of the new city we're only ones that can but the world itself will be populated by all these people in the Old Testament they died under the faith that God is little babies all the little babies that died all the little babies just died right on up to we've got 7 billion people in the world now that's probably not gonna be but a million people make a rapture just say well that's six point nine nine billion people that God is gonna have to deal with and he will and he knows he's actually the dimensions of the earth and everything it needs well you know what we need but I was thinking though they're going to populate they're gonna be important they're important people there's somebody for us to congregate with and for us to talk about and talk to and listen to their experience as they come through the world and and I thank God that we know we're brother dick yes we can rest assured that will not heal not have to grown to get up out of that to get up out of that seat right there anymore he won't have to check his sugar anymore he won't have to worry about things anymore he's in a place of bliss and happiness that you and I will only attain to if we're born again my brother Dale was talking about Sunday you must be born again the resurrection you are not included in the first resurrection if you're not born again amen it has no you know ii remember the second death and all the second you don't want to see that second resurrection no you want to be in that first resurrection or be those that are alive and remain so god bless you let's read Galatians 3:16 but let's go to the Lord in prayer before we get started thank you Lord for having us a good day today Lord but now we remember in the forefront of our mind our brother Joel Forney Lord not just the Galant brother not just a soldier in arms he's a good friend and lord I pray that you would send the healing angels to that room Lord we know right now there's probably thousands of people lifting up prayers for that gallant man that has used the biggest part of his middle and toward the 50 year old that he's been traveling around this world and no telling how many people have been blessed by his ministry and have been healed many people have have got families now that didn't have families because of this man speaking the Word of God we pray that you would touch him father also touch sister Vanessa and the girls and the boys Lord we pray that you just be with them give them comfort in this time of need Lord I believe Lord then you've never left that part of healing that you'll always be that until we get into that new home Lord you'll always be a healer you set it in motion a long time ago I am the Lord who healeth all thy diseases so father we pray that you would do that be with each one Lord take care of us on our walk of life this thing that's come upon the world Lord this virus Lord we knew they was things coming but I believe this is probably not the worst of it because there's some really bad things in Revelations that we don't even want to talk about that we're not going to see because we're going to Lord we're gonna continue as Abraham we're gonna walk walk walk walk walk right into a body change Lord I prayed this you just be with the ones that are not here Lord the ones that are here the ones that are sick the ones this lost loved ones brother Dick's family Lord give them comfort brother Al's family give them comfort the loss of this mother their Lord we pray this you just bind us together Lord in one unity as husband and wife of a great bride and a great bridegroom in us in town probably give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our sins in Jesus name Amen collations 3:16 says now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made now that was a promise made he saith not and to seeds as of many but as of one not the full seed that was and let me bring us out just for a second because you know brother Dick was a seed of Abraham but that old person that sat there and that that expired a few days ago that wasn't the seed of Abraham that was the seed of mom and daddy that got him here so that he can declare the seed of Abraham that was inside of him and that city that Abraham was looking for what inside of him but brother dick and each one of us have their own have that city inside of us tonight amen so brother didn't knew that and you know why because he went right to that when he when he passed from here to there he left though the seed of mom and Daddy here what the seed produced the flesh and he took that seed of Abraham that face seed held on but as of one and to thy seed which is Christ and he just walked right over into where what all the other seeds of Abraham are amen what a joy I mean we missed by the day but what a joy that you can we can see that and know that it's a surety that that's what's going to happen and that a man of called Abraham walked on this earth physically just to show us what we're doing in this in time and this I say that's a covenant that was confirmed before God in Christ the law which was 430 years after cannot dis and all that it should make the promise of none effect in other words God put the law in he put it in effect to a certain degree but he did not dissing old that Covenant he made with Abraham it can't do away with that ma'am and though you got to be an Abraham to receive it he didn't give it a lot he gave it to Abraham for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise in other words if you do the Ten Commandments what did what did the rich young ruler said he said I've done them all but he found out he wasn't a seed of Abraham because you didn't give up at one thing and follow Christ but every seed of Abraham will follow Christ because it is the seed of Christ pretty simple for the inherence for if the inheritance be of the law it is no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise Hebrews 6 verse 13 from when God made promise to Abraham because he could swear my know by no greater he swore by himself saying surely blessing I will bless them multiplying I will multiply them and so after that he had patiently endured they gave him the promise at first but Abram had to become Abraham and had to walk 25 years and then after that 25 years he had to wait till that kid got 9 or 10 years old and then still was testing him being the seed of Abraham by promise so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word let's read this one quoting hood this milk as that we read it before but I want to read it more to get us to know that in this end time we have had this word home to an edge so there's no variation of saying well we might be or this might be the right way or this might be the right quote or this might be the right Bible know if you're guessing at that you need to be born again because when you get born again it will turn your sight right to the true true Bible and the prophets message and they dovetail so they can't be any different one from the other so this this man we call William Branham the prophet in the end time this is what he says about us when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes are doing the final end though you and I are attributes and this is the final in starts talking about us all right every son of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same things like I said before if you if you can't in some way put your Christian journey inside of what we've been talking about then I prop I begged you to start in Genesis chapter 12 and open your heart up and let God call you and you respond to what God said because God said then I'll make up the a great nation I'll bless thee I'll bless them that bless thee curse them to curse thee I'm gonna take you a land that I will show thee we understand now that that sure we have to connect to it because it doesn't make the promise somebody's gonna be the seed of Abraham amen you just gotta determine by your free moral agency if you want to be a part of that or not because that's what Abram ID and I just believe this I have no quote I have no I have no angel or light come into the room but I do have the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe so it ought to be able to tell us that God may have spoke to many people during Abraham's time and they did not respond just because it can't be any different than now no one will go to the white throne judgment I don't believe no one will go to the white throne judgment and say God you never spoke to me because see he would he can't do that he can't be a just God unless he takes you to the very day and says I called you on this day and you did not respond then I called you on this day and you did not respond and I finally called you on this day right here and you never responded amen but the promise of Abraham was somebody said I'll go that's what Abraham said I'll go I'll go in that same way with Mary Mayer said being unto me according to thy word you say brother that's too simple that's just the way God is that's being a free moral agent yes and no two simple words but very powerful and Abram gets up and he walks with God and he accepts what God says and he just keeps walking into different journeys of his life and we're not gonna pull it up but we went through justification and we saw that justification in Genesis 12 Genesis 13 the Bible tells us in the book of Romans I'm just gonna fly through these real quick to get to this last point because we've had had them before Romans 3 verse 24 says being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus now Abram Abram trusted what a man said he trusted what a man said get up and walk you have to trust in yourself that the justifier can justify you listen if you don't believe God can forgive you of your past sins you're lost I have to believe just as much listen to me I have to believe just as much for justification as I did for sanctification and as I did for the baptism of the Holy Ghost because if you don't start out in justification and get your past sins chopped off they just they just like Abram all these past has the idol worshiper and I have the idol maker not that was all gone but what do you do he grabbed a hold of a lot he grabbed a hold of a lot and took lot with him same way with you and I we take some things with us we're already been through this before but the problem is a lot of times we justify herself you see many times in people's life that they try to justify what they did I can't and will not justify what I did I did him I was there hey man you did them you were there and the devil reminds you of them every once in a while once in the morning in awhile in the afternoon yeah mm-hmm me too but you know what that cannot be God if you're truly justifying he never he never looked at Abram when he got to Sarah and Hagar and that little deal they made which was permissive will not perfect well he never said now Abram I promised you way back yonder now I know you were in our work God's never seen what I I love that about God he's never gonna bring up your past cuz he don't remember it oh oh man he just doesn't remember it so he's not gonna bring it back you know what he's gonna bring back he's gonna say don't you remember that night I called you don't you remember that night I called you and you responded and you got up and walked with me you was a free moral agent because remember as brother Brahim tells us Jesus Christ came and died for everybody that would accept him but he knew who would accept him and who would not and man so he can let somebody that's why I've always on predestination you Adolf Hitler are people like that their heart I use him for the horribleness of it but God knew that if he let laid off Hitler live a million years he could come to Adolf Hitler every day enable and they in Adolf Hitler's life and say you know Hitler I am God walk with me he knows by foreknowledge and predestination especially by foreknowledge first that he would not ever do it give him a million years and he'd never do it so therefore he could take him whenever he wanted to because he knew that same way with you and I though he knew that you didn't doing the things you did the things I did the things birth boy did all the different ones you're not alone we all got a past God don't know it but we still do but he comes to a time and he says hey man come walk with me just just move away from that just a little bit come with to me all ye that are heavy laden and I'll give you rest now see that's where you gotta start having faith like a Brahma even had where Abram said ok God if I'm gonna be a father in many nations I got no kids with even Sarah I'm still Abram and I'm still walking around in Egypt and I'm going to Canaan and I'm going to live and I'm making mistakes over here and over there he says I don't worry about that I'm not worried about that he knows the end from the beginning you and I just have to do what I believe Abram just yielded itself to that voice and that voice led him through all the different stages same way with you and I on justification don't try to justify yourself let God justify you and when he does it is a finished work for those who he has justified he has already glorified so if he if he brings you to a place just like we're gonna read in a few minutes Abraham God knew we're gonna read in chapter about eighteen or nineteen that God said I know Abraham is going to take this journey and this part that he played in the earth and he's going to tell it to his son and his sons gonna tell it to his son and his sons gonna tell it to his son and his sons gonna tell it to his son all down through the generations God knew Abraham was going to speak of this man that met him in his life and now what you and I do when you become a Christian you want to tell you want to tell how I met this man who did you meet ho let me tell you about him well have you seen him no I hadn't physically seen him but I see maybe where and then when you get a little further in your journey when you become Abraham and you get some yet to be circumcised then you look exactly like and you say there's God in human flesh I have met God in human flesh I haven't met God in human flesh but maybe not in you first part of your journey because Abraham Abram didn't either but now remember here's a little key that I was thinking about a few minutes ago when Abram over in chapter 14 he goes and delivers lot all right he goes in delivers lot has a battle and who meets him Melchizedek God in human flesh meets him and gives him communion now listen that was such a that was such a life-changing thing for Abram he never forgot that guy's face because I want to tell you something that man that had no father no mother and the lending of days no beginning of life he didn't meet a different person over here when he was Abraham he met the same man same man and put on a little bit of flesh over that theophany and they commune with each other Abram and you and I always will always remember that God that you met in the first part of your journey because sometimes it look like he left and it looks like he did it looks like even in justification all the way to to when he met him in the plains of Mamre you don't see him appear in flashy anymore but he appeared just enough so that Abram could have what and I a singular I to know who that person was and who he'll know him much more when he gets over here in this part of his journey that's the same thing you do same thing all of us do thinking about this is today God's gonna come and he's gonna meet you in a powerful way somewhere now not every day sorry God don't work that way he's not a granddaddy he's a daddy daddy don't call me every day and say you behaving maybe should sometimes but he should have a long time ago but I mean really dining a bit know what you do son how you know y'all having a good day what are you doing today bowling ball of love you see you later what's what God is that's what God is he don't meddle in your business he knows what you're doing you don't have to ask but he's still down through your journey he just appears every once in a while gives you a little taste of this and the taste of that and he met Abram as Melchizedek in Abram the even the justification journey were he still had lot with him listen he had to go get lot so he had a lot with him but as he moved on into sanctification what God do God put Abram to sleep and said Abram you ain't got nothin to do with this I'm the one doing this because I'm gonna meet you again in human flesh and you're gonna identify who I am because they've already met you one time yeah amen Ezekiel 11 says and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you we already talked about this and I will take the stony heart of their out of their flesh and will give them a heart of flesh you had in justification you had that old stony heart hard man hard specially against other people specially against church folks really I mean you know you did because you're contrary Abram look Abram had lied that was that he hunted by Ellis he took his life with him that was about it pretty much but I'll give them one heart so in other words he he softens yup I love that in Ezekiel because that really tells you to what God is doing you can't change your heart you can't change your heart has to be God to change your heart from a stony heart to a heart of flesh so then so then let's identify that that was God that did it it wasn't you because if you justify yourself you still got the old stony heart it's gonna show up somewhere and you know what God's gonna make sure it shows up well him and his the devil is gonna do it but God is gonna show you who are you at hey you ain't got rid of that thing let me get rid of this and let me give you a softer heart so that I can start working with you and that's what he did with Abram but then Abram in chapter 18 comes into sanctification the Bible says after these things the word of the Lord comes to Abram in a vision so what you're doing is coming to Abram in a vision he's getting a little bit closer sanctification is getting just a little bit closer to God I mean God's right there the whole time you just gotta walk get rid of all this stuff so that God can deal with you because when Ezekiel tells us that he puts a new spirit in you its sanctification you get a new spirit not the Holy Spirit you get a spirit to be able to be a little to take that soft heart and be able to use it God can be able to use it a little bit more we know what the property guard said about sanctification that's cleaned and set aside for service not put in service but he cleans you up and sets you aside for service and he doesn't put anything in there yet because you've got a process to go through Abram you got to get to Abraham you got to walk this journey some of you some of us went through justification in a long period of time could be sanctification in a short period of time or it could have been a long period of time for us some of us not heads not you just your socks but some of us it took longer but you know what God it doesn't matter to God he knows the points he knows the points you've just got to get to them and when you get to him then God listen I'm gonna tell you Lord you're obligated to tell me where I'm at because he did Abram he told Abram robbery was that he told Ruth Robert she with that now not verbally but through somebody some preacher some elder some layperson some deacon somebody see mama your daddy whoever comes to you and says hey son I see you're not doing what you were doing before I see you in the room not slamming the computer when I walk in the door hello oh that's a good sign that they don't want you to see what you're looking at right okay but you've got that thing wide open and you hear good evening friends instead of trying to hide the volume from the rap music because all the other whatever's going on on the computer you know why because your life's open then you've got a new spirit you're heading toward the Holy Spirit but you got a new spirit that God is going man this is fresh I don't what did I see in that how many times that we looked at things even as I get older at sixty years old I was telling somebody work the other day I said the things that used to bother me don't bother me no more and I ain't talking about in Christian world so much I'm talking about just like general right we get our age you worry about survival oh I'm sorry you ain't this age you worry about survival he's not worried about survival he's like I gotta get a job the boys going y'all have more grandkids but you see my point is as we go through our Christian journey off a lot of the things that bothered us in our past don't bother us anymore it should not bother us anymore now don't say well now you well then well by the way this is gonna be easy no not easy it's not easy it wasn't easy for Abram look at the heartache and trials he went through God put him in a a vision in chapter 18 our 6:15 put him to sleep and showed him hell this is what you deserve this is what you were headed to but I took you out you took the end it remember cuz what did Abram do before he got put to sleep he did everything God asked him to do take three Rams take three of this take two doves cut them to pieces push them out in front of you and keep the files off of them amen that's what that new spirit does it keeps the files out of off of you hey man keeps all them other foul spirits from coming back but you know what you were doing something to a point and then God shut it down God said now you're going to sleep Abram because I'm fixing to change you I'm fixing to change everything about you all these sacrifices and listen when you're in sanctification I know I did there was a lot of things I had to sacrifice my old friends the old way of what I was doing I had to get rid of a lot of stuff that I hid under the couch and then I had to get rid of that it was a sacrifice but you know what I was doing it because God had showed me what to do through the elders through the preachers through the message of the hour through the reasoning of the scripture God was showing me what I needed to kick out because remember in sanctification the Bible says the unclean spirit goes out now listen he doesn't go out willfully mine didn't my mines got my house and still got the claw marks on the wall as ice kicked that thing out all right I mean like and that's the truth because you had things in you that you had done for years didn't bother you to go sit and drink a beer we get my call here then Bobby go sent during late Louie's dick talking about didn't bother you bet now that demons gone because you don't want to do that no more because I'm gonna say that's probably get in trouble it's not the drinking part that bothers you because they tell you the Italians and all the different ones if you'll drink a little bit of wine every day it will help your intestines and it'll help you heart they have no heart trouble over there much at all anyway what I'm saying is it's all that stuff that goes with it right it's all them other demons that are hanging onto all that a man because you go to a bar in the first place you're you're not in the right place amen but you didn't mind going when you were a sinner because you know what that little guy inside of you was just as happy he's I thought we going the bar right we go on the bar right yeah boy it was like I got excited when I was but you know what he gets excited about something else now why because that demon had been kicked out and got sealed an it sealed it where that devil can't get back in there right okay but that's under sanctification the unclean spirit goes out not willingly but you know what he can't stand that new spirit you got cuz it's like this he can't stand it mine didn't oh thanks fog sure you get the same even your even your and I didn't drink a lot but even what I did my body craved and I know a lot of people were cigarette smokers but other time and different ones that that body was correct I didn't know you okay I mean three packs a day three demons a day all right great day so but that that has to do with your flesh a lot of times inside your body you did to inside your body now see I the problem with dipping or you know dipping scolding all that stuff but your body craved it well see you had to get rid of that when the demon went your body's still doing this hey man right yeah when I think god that's one thing he done for me because the day I walked up here and give my life to him I had pockets full of Scholl long cuts prayed I had it piled up in them you know if we're daddy couldn't see it I had hitting the house poor daddy mama couldn't see it but you know I didn't want that in the mall that demon just went on out and I said I know I don't need that no more so the very day and that you can't do that Coulter cued a lot of people even brother dick god bless him he had a problem with cigarettes a long time ago and he'll tell you they did he had brother Tom publisher and I you know you know you look at that demon your brother branham it's wonderful to have a prophet that tells you says I'd rather see my wife drunk on the floor right drunk on the floor then have a cigarette in her hand he knew the difference between the two demons he knew one had a bunch of tentacles than they were that thing was just gonna hold on to your body where the other one would not but we all had those but the unclean spirit goes out of sanctification because you know what you start going to church you start reading the Bible you start doing things you you change your environment Abram got up and left God took him to a places there are April I'm gonna you're dead cuz I'm fixing to kill you because remember Abraham's got to die so that Abraham can live I died like brother Dale said we our death has already happened death has no dominion over a Christian but like brother Clark said I do fear dying because there's always that you can't say when somebody puts a gun up to your head that you're not going to have a little sweat or a little sweat running down your armpits and a little bit of butterflies in your stomach why because you're still human even Jesus right before he went to the went to the crucifixion he said lord if this thing can pass for me let it pass the humanity part of me even when he was on the cross he said where are our lord who are you father where did you go in other words this hurts but he was so submissive just like Abram was so submissive to God that he just kept walking right on it doesn't matter what you know he had to get rid of lot he had to get rid of lot he had to keep walking then he comes to a place to where God brings a light down and he puts Abram to sleep and he says Abram I am going to do this for you because you can't do it by yourself that all right all these different things and then in chapter 16 we see that there was a wild child born out of Latin and we talked about that and discussed it but let's read this sanctification just for a second for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one Hebrews 2 verse 11 for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church well I've seen praises under the Ezekiel 36 25 go down to verse 26 a new heart also I give you now that was back there in justification all right a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit while I put within you why I'm gonna drive the unclean spirit out and I'm going to bring a spirit that we're gonna read about here in just a minute and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh now number two his life in Christ brother Brown says he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't God's Spirit that's your spirit God gives you a new spirit then he says I'll put my spirit in you but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you so he has to get you fixed up first before he can come in okay and nobody knows that but God what you need and then and then if we try to figure it out sometimes we mess it up we just let God do it let right here I'm gonna fix you up before I come in I'll give you a new spirit then he take then you take him anywhere you go all kinds of places he's got to get you finished so you can entertain him right you're not going there tainting that new spirit in the bar room you're not going to retain that new spirit in front of whatever you've been watching on the Internet you're not going to entertain that whatever whatever just put it in there because God's not going to dwell in an unclean vessel that's why that's cleaned and set aside another in the analogy there's no water in here yet but it's clean on the outside it's clean on the inside so now God can at least put something clean inside of you and you want him to seal it in by the seal of circumcision so guess what if I had done that a few minutes ago the unclean spirit wouldn't went out and if I'd have done that and put it back under another spicket put it under a tap please put it under a tap you know the beer would go in it you understand one exam but when he seals it now when he gave Abraham a new name and the seal of circumcision he sealed that in no way that matter how much Satan shakes it it's God of what got a seal on it brother Brown said how dare anyone try to take that seal off of that boxcar what until its destination so you and I are coming to that now but we see that you get a new spirit Abram had a new walk of life he comes into chapter 18 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of memory now this is not in human flesh this is appeared it says in in the footnotes of doctors go fill the theophanies so he met God and that was a quote I was reading in there and I didn't have time to bring it out here where brother Brown said God hadn't met Abram in many different forms and heard his voice in many different ways he said but he's going to come down and he talks about it meeting him one time at the slaughter of the kings and meeting that same man over here when he gives him the promise of the promised child all right so look so God doesn't change God doesn't change he's if he met you and justification he's going to meet you at the baptism of the whole everybody got that say amen amen I love him how he's just absolutely to explain like brother Browns for the brother I'm saying I'm most illiterate person can understand the new birth why is the walk of life it's your physical walk how you walk in your line all the stories of Abraham Abram Ruth and Naomi we'll get into that Sunday I believe in an extra and all the different ones that that never had the new birth folks never had the new birth even an extra God's not even mentioned in there but we know that he was the one that was doing the leading but you see Esther walking through this whole part of this journey and it was a journey of what me and you same thing becomes the bride of all different brides has a little man named Mordecai little short guy means little man you know that what guides her along he's not the king mind you Mordecai was not the king the Kings the king that's why brother branham's not God he's the eliazar he's the he's the Mordecai he's the one that presents the bride to the bridegroom now he's part of that bride but he's never the bridegroom there's only one bridegroom and that's Jesus Christ hey ma'am so listen I know we don't have that problem but and somebody may have been listening in the end or watching in I don't know that wasn't in my notes but the Lord appeared him in the point it appeared to him now we're in chapter 18 so we can go ahead and take bring check chapter 18 up let's go through this real quick now remember we come to this part of the new birth in type that we went through justification he's he's chopped off her past sins Abram is still walking making mistakes taking a lot with him and then he's gonna have to separate from lot and then he goes into sanctification where God puts him to sleep shows him what hell is and shows him all the different things and that little white light brother Brown said that amber light he's right there with Abram he was right there with you the whole time you may not have physically been able to see it but you should have been able to see it in the characteristics of things that you went through in your journey a man because you say that was God you come through something you say there's nobody could know that do that or explain that but God Almighty and it might have come from a preacher talking to you our buddies talking to you a Christian man and then you go huh and then you realize that that was God talking to you the whole time Abram I believe when Abram comes down to Abraham and he meets milk is it for the second time we're gonna read it milk hesitate for the second time he's going taste something special about this guy right here there's something special not about me I'm not special no because God makes him special God said can I hold withholding anything from Abraham being that he's the heir of this earth I will read it in just a second but Abraham didn't get the big head and even if he did get the big head about ten years later God's fixing to Humble him he's fixing to tell him whatever I gave you you gonna take and kill it so here we go let's go to chapter 18 all right now we know one thing's for sure chapter 17 we talked about the new birth right so we don't have to go back to that JEP chapter 17 was he gave him now listen let me read you a couple of things that brother Brown talks about just for a second about circumcision because in Ezekiel 36 in finishing the the scripture that we read he says I'll put my spirit within you so now we see that God is gonna put his spirit now he didn't he didn't give you his spirit of sanctification he gave you a spirit to deal with what's coming to deal with what's nice if you didn't see that in your journey that God changed you just a little bit so he could deal with you like he'd never dealt with you before but when you come to that part of the new birth he says in verse 27 don't go there I will put my spirit within you and call you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them arts because you've got his spirit inside of you then you've not got a different spirit or a familiar spirit or any you've got him and that's the new Burke and and to confirm Abraham's faith God gave him the sign of circumcision let's read this right here real quick let's go to number four if you don't mind switch back to that I need to read that before we go through hidden life in Christ 1956 there you go many times God said I'll give you a new spirit that wasn't his spirit that's your spirit then I'll put my spirit in you I'll give you a new spirit then I will put my spirit in you and many times you get the new spirit and think you've got the holy spirit that's why it's real hard for us to just sit back and say this feels good and not going with God and listen if you don't get it sealed up guess what there's that entrance right back again to where that unclean spirit will go right back in there take seven demons worse than he was before and make you a religious person not a worse worldly person because if you want to be religious listen Satan will get you religious Satan is a religious person he's not a boring game person but he's a religious person remember he was the anointed cherubim he knows all about the feelings of anointing and how to bend you and move you into trying to say hey everything's fine listen even though I brother Dale at 80 years old been a Christian for probably 60 years or longer he's I believe he's never come to a day to where he says I'm satisfied you should never come to a day where you said this is that I'm satisfied I'm done I don't have to do any more I'm finished this is that and see what's gonna happen is though if you start saying that this is what's gonna happen and you see that not so much in this church but it has happened to several you see them come in and they're all on fire for God and they're all gonna do this and they want to do that because they got that new spirit they feel good they feel good they get onto the atmosphere but when the word starts pounding and it has nothing to respond to everybody got that there's nothing to respond to that where do they go they have to leave they cannot sit here and listen I mean anywhere I'm not saying just here in this physical place you can't sit in the place and keep hearing the Word of God every day every hour every time you come to church you hear in the Word of God you're hearing somebody preaching the Word of God and you're saying a man and you're going man this is good but I'm just maybe I just not gonna I think I'll go fishing next Sunday go ahead because you'll go fishing the next Sunday and the next Sunday because you know what that fishing spirit that maybe with something else that made you fish on Saturday it's now saying well that's okay brother Dale preaches the same thing over and over again brother Wade he just reads the same quotes five or six Sundays in a row I think I'll gonna go fishing well you know what that ain't the Holy Ghost water because that inside of you that is his spirit of where he is that's where you need to be right it's just real simple you see him come in there on fire for God they've got this new spear and they got this new attitude and then all of a sudden you see them six months later and women's cut their hair and you know and they're ashamed of themself like you wouldn't believe would hide under a penny if they could but you know what happened was they got a new spirit but they didn't get the holy spirit they still was Abram which was journeying around and making mistakes and flip-flopping listen not saying they can't come back never let God close the door we don't I want this church full of them people that's on this wall right down here under my feet because some of them is mine hey man I'll clap myself [Applause] but that's what happened when you don't get the Holy Spirit you'll get a spirit alright you'll get a spear and you'll get a religious spirit but what happened Abram Abram just kept on walking kept on walking God you promised now I've come to a place now where God says I'm gonna change your name to Abraham because as Abram you were high father now you couldn't do anything with that name of the promise I was going to give you but as Abraham brother Graham said give him part of his name ham him Elohim ham give me part of his name and he said now you're a father of many nations now it didn't even look good at that point it was Abraham dried up and dead Sarah womb was not able to conceive even when she was 16 so there was something going on there all right God had to totally change their body and change the configuration of her bride does he not have to change the configuration of me and you to receive the promised seed that's what he had to do to Sarah he didn't just change her body she was at one time 18 years old and lived with Abraham Abram for all them years and never had no kids but they come to a point to where God just kept on going I mean Abram just kept on going and Abram got to a place to where God said I trust you now go that's what he's gonna tell him over there in when he gets ready to kill Isaac he's gonna tell him to die that's what brother Branham says he says oh I've got you this point he said I can trust even the Bible says and and you say well was that God trusted no God already knew what was going to happen he just wanted Abraham to know that I am whatever I told you I am I'm still going to keep that promise I'm on the scene more now than I was then if we ever get to that we're man I'll give you a new spirit then I'll put my spirit in you and many times you get the new spirit and think you've got the holy spirit and trusting upon emotions and signs and things see that's why God put Abram to sleep they went a signer I wonder when Abram was asleep my brother Bram said he's zeroed you out Abram you have nothing to do with this alright and trusting upon emotions and signs and things when your life doesn't PV up to that see that's just a little wrong but remember it's the truth alright let's finish the rest of that one let's go to I want to read number six number six if you'll pull up number six we'll skip number five and number six why some people can't keep the victory it's a pretty good that's a pretty good that's pretty good sermon why some people can't keep the victory maybe we ought to read that everyone's name now many times we try to make that thing say just well as soon as you get the new spirit you quit you're stealing quit your line see what I mean unclean spirit goes out things like that you say Oh hallelujah I got it and you find out the first time anyone crosses your path a little bit old mercy what a difference sure you blow up like a frog eating buckshot we've seen that happen just because a certain person didn't get a birthday party and they went and brother Dale people left left the church that's the truth and ain't been back since so see what I mean with the Holy Spirit though you can't do that you'll do this right here you'll be like a frog eating buckshot but let me tell you brother that's the reason you never got God's Spirit that's true oh he stepped on my toe I'll just not put up with that alright that shows what you got in you that's true I'll put a new spirit in you then I'll put my spirit in you now the heart is the center of the emotions of the human being not this heart but the center part of you alright is the center of the emotions of the human being your heart is the middle of you that's exactly right so God puts a new spirit in the middle of the old man sanctification then he puts a new spirit in the middle of the new spirit or heart and put his spirit in the middle of the new spirit takes out the stony heart then he puts in his spirit to get along with us then he puts his spirit in the center of that because you know what well you don't get the Holy Ghost on your spirit you don't get it on just on your body you get it in the center in the middle of the new spirit God puts that down now that's not three or four spirits running around it's the same Holy Spirit doing different words at different times everybody got that same man I don't want you to be confused on that we got all kind of spirits running around in us if you're not born again you do you ain't got you ain't got the Holy Spirit you got ever spare in the world running around inside of you but when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul that's one that's one that's the I am NOT the I was not the I'm gonna be not the I'm three or four I'm one amen you didn't receive the third person of the Trinity you received the only person of the Trinity the Lord Jesus Christ in spirit form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody know that I'm sure you do all right now look at number seven Israel in the church beautiful God took Christ at Calvary took him apart soul and body since the body upon his right hand and sent the Holy Spirit back to covenant with the people and you believe by faith like Abraham did and he was given the seal of circumcision for a confirmation of his faith okay for a confirmation of his faith and you believe and accept Jesus as your Savior then God gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your faith and you say you say you believe and haven't received the Holy Spirit something's wrong with your faith God circumcised is the heart the minute the believer really comes in full surrender amen say Amen say that folks surely must have done something I felt that even come back he felt he was like I said before he was amongst a bunch of Pentecostals who said I shouted I spoke in tongues so I must have the Holy Ghost so he's the seller right here when the believer firmly believes on the Lord Jesus Christ God's under obligation see when Abram started this journey and this person this I am that's going to do everything for him when he met Abram it wasn't a different person then he met over here like I said before it was the same person with the same characteristic so Abraham or Abram could identify who he was you and I must identify where God is in your journey why by knowing where you are in your journey then God gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your faith when the believer firmly believes on the Lord Jesus Christ God under his under obligation to give him the Holy Ghost confirmation of his face say what's the matter brother Branham just your faith that's all see he could feel it coming from them Pentecostals I needed to shout I need to speak in tongues I need to do this I need to do that and it that's not the promise the promise is an unconditional covenant the promise they're saying condition now they could do that afterwards they could do all that afterwards but he's got to it's just your faith that's all if you'd surely believed God's there to give it to you I was thinking about this yesterday the very reason that God could give listen to this the very reason God could give Luther the baptism of the Holy Ghost is that Luther believed that the just shall live by faith so God honored that faith and gave him the new birth now whatever he did after that he didn't have enough word to not know not to smoke or drink or no I mean yeah just smoking do that but right here I was reading this quote and I said man that's how God give the baptism of the Holy Ghost to Martin Luther who was a Trinitarian but he believed he has faith that's all if you'd surely believed God's there to give it to you and Martin Luther believed when he read that he said the just shall live by faith in Martin Luther said a man ain't God filled him with the baptism of the holy God hey man I love the Word of God it's good stuff good stuff number eight God's commissioning Moses three just real quick and then we'll get to because we got the circumcision lit it's not just a sign it's it's a sign of your faith he honored Abraham's faith by making an Abraham and then by that faith that Abraham now had God gave him a seal of circumcision and say okay I'm gonna give you a sign a physical sign now because I can't give you a spiritual sign I'm giving you a physical sign right now because I can't go inside of you because the blood of bulls and goats didn't clean Abram or Abraham enough inside so that God could dwell in him now it's just simple you can't get the new birth under bulls and goats it's just period you can't because remember it's only a covering it only pushes your sin to Calvary but by receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost I thought you don't have a sin show me what oh I did oh there you go but God gave him the seal of circumcision as a seal of his faith brethren when you get pure genuine faith in God God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a seal of the promise which is a seal that you have faith oh that you have faith listen I gotta have faith like I said it's telling you before I gotta have that same faith that justification I've got to believe that a man called Jesus Christ died for my sin heroes to justify the world but only certain ones some justify herself if Jesus Christ justifies me I'm okay and man because he's covered all my sin took my justification and that's why he said the just and the justifier it's the same person you and I are just as eternal is God if we have the new birth amen and now what the prophet tells us which is a seal that you have faith you might make some kind of impression or make people believe or you might say you got faith but when you really got genuine ultra underrated faith God will give you the baptismal Holy Ghost as a seal of the promise that's not skim milk now children but remember Paul goes on in Romans will not read it now but Paul goes on there in Romans you can read it later on if you want to and he goes on in Romans and tells us what does he tell us he said it's not physical circumcision anymore it's a circumcision of the heart it's a circumcision to wear when you walk you walk different you talk different your whole makeup is different everything you do is different why would you want to do the same thing you know what I was thinking this other day that the definition of insanity is what doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result that's insanity that is the true definition of insanity people that are insane do the same thing over and over again but expecting a different result something better something different but it's not that's the same thing with you and I if you're not born again you're insane because you're trying to do this you're trying to do that you're trying to and get the results that God wants to give you and you just you you don't have nothing in there but when you get God in there like I said before that's your spiritual rudder now you can pray for them people that are in borrow in bars you pray for the people that used to do what you used to do or that still does what you used to do listen but there was one thing for sure when you come to a place to where you get born again a lot of times for periods of time you have to walk alone just like Abraham did he had no friends right there until but remember lot had already moved to Sodom and Gomorrah all he had was him and his wife and his servants that's all he had he'd have nothing else he'd have a congregation but he's fixing the meet Melchizedek and when he meets Melchizedek there and we look in chapter 18 finally now you can pull up chapter 18 now let's read chapter 18 we may not get to 20 I don't want to get past about 8:30 and the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre appeared unto him and the plains of Mamre and he sat in the tent door at the heat of the day and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him now we know who brother Brown tells us that was that was God Almighty in human flesh and two angels that were going to go to Sodom now we know that the characteristics of that was all Roberts and Billy Graham they didn't stay with the elect by the branch then they went down to Sodom to do what blind the people right but I remember they weren't demons they were guarding human flesh - whoa Billy Graham or Roberts well they never come in a message Church they had a job to do they had a job to do I believe we'll see them there just as much and their whole crowd of people that they got saved under what they believed I don't believe they spoke to thousands of millions of people all their life and God's gonna come up to the end and say we didn't believe the Prophet no they believed who they were they believed they had message and they were identified by the messenger of the hour thank God that they were identified that they were to go to Sodom had a job to blind the people in Sodom and to call the lot group out so if they called the lakh group out they must have preached him some kind of truth or they wouldn't get in amen I just believe that you hear a lot of people in the message say that they can't believe that bro that Billy Graham had Holy Ghost and and didn't sit under brother Browns ministry he didn't have brother bountiful ministry he had his own ministry John G Lake all the different ones of Dwight Moody you can't say they weren't born again they were born-again believers Smith Wigglesworth all these different ones but brother Branham was the identified prophet in the Bible but you got to look into seeing the Bible there there's Billy Graham when Oral Roberts identified in the Bible as the two angels that went to Sodom to draw a lot out so let's read right here and three men stood by him and when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself toward the ground and he said my lord now I'm going to interpolate just a moment he said my lord good to see you again so that was Melchizedek then that was the same Melchizedek in verses in Chapter 15 or 13 right good to see you again Lord I know what you was then but I know what you are more now I know why you're coming I know why you're here we're fixing to we tried to fulfill the promise this way I made a mistake we tried to go over this way I made a mistake but no I'm going to meet you right here my lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away from my servant stay here in commune with him because I know more about you now than I did when I was well we're not when you were Melchizedek to give me to give me communion you were a man that I was probably tired that day we'd been we'd killed a bunch of people and slaughtered the kings and we had brought lot and I was really tired I just really didn't have time to really recognize said but all now I know who you are I know why you met me then and I sure know how I you met me now because you're the same person and he didn't lose his characteristic either and man I mean we we do we put a lot on milk katsudon we're brother Brown says he put a little 16 elements over his body and he had to do the same thing to meet him in Genesis chapter 13 or he wouldn't have seen him he gave him communion and Abraham paid the man ties you can't pay ties to a theophany right he's gotta have some flesh on it so Abram I recognized him said my lord now he didn't recognize him other truth right my lord he knew who was the important one let a little water I pray thee be fetched and wash your feet and rest yourself under the tree and I will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort in you your heart after that you shall pass on for therefore you come to your servant and you said so do as thou has done has said and remember what Abraham done told of verse 8 God ate a cow he had a state had corn bread had to be southern drank some milk could have been could have been buttermilk never know but he had butter you know you understand what I'm saying you understand what I'm saying about this this was not a as brother Dale says many times this was not a we're not supposed to shake hands but hey no cousin ain't well god bless you I've got a cow already cooked for you know the Bible says he told his servant go out there now how many of you he knows one of them we've seen slaughter we we've even you know by the time you I'm sorry sorry ladies you go to deer skin and skin a deer go to deer skin a deer core terima it took an hour right resting at least an hour now listen he had to make butter he had to churn he had to milk the cow somebody did milk the cow what am I saying he communed with him a long period of time long period of time hours this man said in front of that tent as Abraham by faith produced meat that was cooked not only that you got to have the meat there he had it cooked and he made hoecakes brother breakfast as in one quote again hoecakes which for those of you that are not from the south that would be cornbread and for those of you that are not from the south that's not with sugar in it either cornbread is made with cornmeal and God liked it because he eat it so there was a period of time you see what I'm saying Abraham says right here watch this right here verse 5 go back to verse 5 for therefore are you come to your servant remember I said cleaned and set aside for service but what is the baptism with Holy Ghost God puts you in service you become a servant and you know what God did God said God set there you know what all milk has it what had to done says milk butter cook filets cornbread right he's Almighty God but he let Abraham show his face he lets you show your face he sat down watched Abraham not a pretty sight had to kill the cow get it skin it got it quarter it cook it while Sarah was probably cooking the whole case what flour eggs forgive me sister's not flour cornmeal and whatever else you put in it and you know what how long does it take to cook cornbread even in a conviction conventional good oven that we have takes 30 minutes or longer now they were doing it over a fire they didn't go out ask go to Longhorns here's my point God was watching Abraham and he was saying you're learning son you're learning to be a servant I've give you the seal of circumcision and two four and five thousand years later they're gonna talk about what you did as you just thought you were doing me a favor by cooking me a meal but now we're down come to the close to the end time and we're able to put it in our to put it in our language or to put it in our life that God wants to see a servant God wants to see a servant somebody that he he wants to make sure that you know your servant Abraham therefore are you come to your servant and I'm fixing to serve you cuz I gotta kill this cow I got to cook this cow got to make the whole cake and if she made butter I don't know how it takes a long time to make butter out daddy saying I've never seen they churn it they take butter and something else and they do this right here in a little stick going up and down the panel to turn to make butter it takes hours so what am I saying is it went just like well hello Abraham how you doing we got to go down beside him I see you later that's not the way God is God communed with Abraham he commits he love there's no other place there's no other place he'd rather be than commune with you he would have been somewhere else cuz he's Almighty God nobody came to Abraham and said Abraham Here I am let's talk for a little while and you say Lord let me cook you something he says okay where the carcass is there's were the eagle to be gay what is the carcass we're not cooking cows and hoe cakes we're coming to church we're being servants we're reading our Bible we're study and we're praying and God's going just like your father Abraham you're just like you cuz we're the seed of Abraham for the seed of Abraham we got act like our seed and man so let's go a little bit further around here real quick and they did eat verse 9 then remembering you know they he says for Sarah you're the wife we're Sarah your wife he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee ah personally I'm not going to send up one of these two right here these two right here has got a job somewhere else these two angels that are eating and they're watching you and but their eyes if you'll notice their eyes was always turned to Sodom because they had a job to do down there they didn't have a job to do with Abraham because Abraham and had a name change and God was sitting there talking to him so they kept their mouth shut then alright I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son remember what happened Sarah just kind of now Abraham and Sarah will well stricking the age that were nineteen nineteen ninety I guess you might say and it seems to be with Sarah after the manner of women watch she dried up for woman dried up she had no more she couldn't produce a child if she wasn't that way that's why I said God's not God just change us he's got to change us from the inside out first they been okay with what I just said he had to change Sarah from the inside to the outside I like that he did he had to change her physical inside her womb not just make it young he had to change it so that she could receive the promised child same well with you now therefore Sarah left within ourselves and my wife sold it and I have pleasure shall I have pleasure my lord being old also she remembered when you know what she's saying if we were young again we might have pleasure but I I can't conceive that's why she kind of giggled and said man this guy was telling us we're gonna have a kid but you know what God said and the Lord said unto Abraham he never talked to Sarah he talked to the head of the house the Lord sent and Abraham wherefore did Sarah laugh saying I shall of surety bear child which I'm oh is anything too hard for the El capital lort huh there anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I am will return unto the according to the time well that's why Jesus could stand there and I love that scripture where they're yakking about and I say yeah Kim the Pharisees is always yakking about something kinda like the press the press does brother brother Trump you know just aggravates him to death and you know what they just full of lives and everything else but here's Sarah and all these different things and here's Abraham's going man the promise this to me he really believed that that promise was his he put everything out of the way everything out of the way and here stands Abraham and here stands Sarah alright at the time appointed I will now there was a Pharisees and what did I say Jesus Jesus said they said we'd be the seed of Abraham he said before Abraham was he was standing right there don't tell me that Jesus it wasn't standing on the shores of Galilee speaking that was not that same guy that stood right there that's wanka said before Abraham was I am and then those carnal Pharisees what next day well you don't even look 50 years old well they were that was really completely a little bit dumb that was like four thousand years ago right I mean they see you don't even look fifty years old well from the time he was standing there to this happening around here was about four thousand years or at least 2,000 years you know even fifty years old just that's the devil for you picks and picks and picks at the time appointed I will return in other words Abraham I'm going to handle it when you listen when you get the new birth you ought to be the most settled person inside you should be the most now you're gonna have turmoil with the outside guy and the middle guy and the bills and the wife and the kids and the husband the wife and you understand what I mean but inside of the inside brother dick didn't have a struggle with leaving this world hmm no no you should not have a struggle if you know that you know that you know listen Abraham didn't struggle at all because God is telling him look he's believing what this man God is telling him at the time of point I will return unto thee in other words I'm the one I'm gonna change your body you can't do it according to the time of life and Sarah she'll have a son then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid he said nay but thou did laugh in other words brother Branham said if it wasn't for Abraham God would have killed Sarah coach Sarah was calling God a liar and that's kind of hard you know that's our weakness we do that but you know what we've got headship we've got Jesus Christ our advocate we've got Jesus Christ our attorney we've got Jesus Christ our he's our judge he's our jury he he's our advocate our high priest to stand between when we make mistakes like that and Sarah denied and said I'll laugh not okay and the men rose up from this and looked toward Sodom see now they look towards Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide anything from Abraham that thing which I do look here's the scripture right here seeing that Abraham says surely become a great and mighty nation now he didn't promise he miss before he promised him he was going to give him that but he's telling him exactly not Abram Abraham seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him for I know him Wow for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon who Abraham that which he has spoken of him he was telling Abraham I am giving you this promise because you're gonna take this and you're going to not just tell your people you're gonna live it you're gonna live it you're gonna live it in front of your kids and your kids are gonna live it in front of their kids and their kids because there comes Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and and all the different ones coming out of Abraham right coming out of that lineage of Abraham and the Lord said because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which is coming to me and if not I will know and the men turned their faces from thence and went toward Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord in other words like brother Aaron said they went to Sodom but God stayed with Abraham the promised seed because he was going to stay there with the promise now not to say those are not promises down there in the world but this is his seat this is his lineage this is the lineage of God and man spiritually not naturally now not seeds as of many because there stands Christ telling Abraham I'm going you're gonna have a promise child and he's gonna be named izing you're gonna have these but what was he saying in the love letter in the love letter he was saying exactly what he said there in Romans through Paul or Ephesians that it's one seed which is me now cuz he would have said if if Abraham could have swallowed that he said look Abraham I got some kids on there aligned some spiritual children and they got to act like you you're a wonderful example in I know you're gonna take your example and you're gonna go through generation he said but also my spiritual seed he's gonna go through generation to generation to generation come down to the end time seven church ages one on the day of Pentecost 123,000 and he says I know my seed one seat not meaning one seat when 120 got born again they got born again by one seed they had faith let's here we go but look at Abraham let's just do this real quick we're not gonna get to chapter 20 so we'll just stop right here but watch what Abraham did now watch Abraham says look God if they's fifty righteous will you not destroy the city I love those people I love those people I don't think you know like say about this world there's thousands of people dying not just of this coronavirus but everything else because of diseases and Abraham said fifty you know what God said and he said okay if you find fine fifty I'll not go down there and destroy in other words Abraham was typing the same thing Moses was when Moses stood in the gap brother branham said for the people and said God if you kill them you gonna have to kill me first he said you got to kill me first you know what Moses was saying Moses was literally saying God if you're gonna get to them people you got to go through me first and Bret brother Brian said that what Moses that was the Spirit of Christ in Moses so there's the Spirit of Christ in Abraham that it's saying God if you find 50 he said okay that'd be far from thee to do after this manner to slay the righteous with the wicked now because remember a lot was the Bible says it makes his righteous soul brother Aaron said he was like to the foolish virgin and the different ones they would be given eternal life that the righteous should be as the wicked that be far from thee shall not the judge of all the earth do right now look the judge capital he's he's acknowledging that's God standing there shall not the judge of all the earth do right Omaha same thing Moses said you know what Moses said to God one time he said God if you kill all these people he said it's going to be known that you took him out of he's ain't gotten you that but he wanted Moses to know that God honored what he said cuz he said God if you do that said hey yeah that's great God and if you kill all them people they gonna talk about you Raja what he said right but God knew what he was gonna say and God was going that's my boy shall not the judge of all the earth do right and the Lord said if I find in Sodom 50 then I'll spare the whole place and Abram answered and said I better lower that number a little bit we all now I've taken upon me to speaking to the Lord look what he's saying which I am but dust and ashes he's not puffing his shoulders out and saying God you going to do what I said you need to listen to me no he said Lord I'm ashes just like them people down there at you pre adventure that's y'all act 5 of the 50 righteous will tout destroy all the city for lack of 5 he said if I find their 40 and 5 I will not destroy him he's speaking to him yet and said pre adventure there shall be 40 found there and he said I will do not for 40 thing and he sent him old let not the Lord be angry and I will speak pre adventure that she'll be 30 and he keeps going on but watch what he gets down to him it's a little bit he goes down to 20 now when he gets down to 32 and he says oh let not the Lord be angry and I will speak yet but this one's pre Adventure 10 she'll be found he said I'll not destroy it 14 and the Lord went his way as soon as he had left communing with Abram Abraham and Abraham returned into his place do you know how many you know do you know I believe if Abraham would have said four God want her destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah you explained it he kept going down from 50 to 40 to 30 to 20 if he had to say god if you'd find 4 because he found light his wife and the two daughters that was 4 but he didn't he didn't go that far Cody knew they were gonna have to be destroyed but then we know what the angels did let's stop right there y'all come on musicians we know what the two angels did they went to Sodom and they called out light and when light saw him he said my Lords he didn't have a revelation of one true and living God but Sunday we'll we'll get on the Genesis chapter 20 I hope you've kind of enjoyed this a little bit I've enjoyed it because even walking right walking through Abraham's life again but let's get into let's get in - lets get into Ruth a little bit let's see what Ruth Ruth is basically going through the same thing that Abram went through to Abraham because like brother Dale said it it really wasn't Ruth wasn't connected Ruth had no connection to what but to bow ass zero-zero she was a daughter-in-law of the sons that died but he was Ken - Naomi which is the old Jewish that's what he started with to bring them through Israel and to show us all the examples but when he got Ruth they had a promise son - just like Abraham and Sarah had a promise son so dear Ruth and Boaz have a promise son let's sing a song god bless you [Music] we still on the road and the voice I hear falling on my the Son of God discloses and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joy we should share like Abraham fish and mouth Cassidy wheeler 9r learn hi no listen to this he speaks and the sound of his voice paper him heard that sound they said my lord that's the same one he talks to me some 20 years behind me and the melody that he gave to me within my heart is ringing and he walks with me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joy we share as we turn none other has ever known oh I'd stay in the garden with him [Applause] the overnight around me be falling bunny bids me go through the voice song his voices to me is calling and he won't think about that me and he talks with me and he tells me I am his own and the joy we share as we tarry them no no has ever you know abraham really enjoyed that whole day of communion with milk hesitant and he may not have totally understood exactly everything but the next morning or the next before the next 28 days something happened they woke up and looked at each other and sitting kidness Sarah you gotta look this way in 80 years Abraham you haven't looked this way in 80 something here you know what Abraham said the promise Sarah the promise it's here it's here the promise is now ready to be fulfilled same way with you and I we're heading toward that body change we're coming to it coming to it coming to it we're realizing that God's ever closer to the promise that he promised us that we would take a body change promise that the dead Saints would walk back into the building those people that are downstairs and the ones that we've seen go on over in another dimension never to see them old again they went through that filter they went to that filter and left the old here and took the new over there on the other side never seen Mary hall in a hospital with a bad heart no not anymore where see a young girl with that poorly hair with a little with a little ribbons in it that's what we're looking forward to folks it's not a promise it's a reality because prop Abraham said God you brought you you promise promise promise promise when they woke up that next morning and they were both chains Abraham said this is a reality this is real stuff right here because I couldn't do this and Sarah you can't do that it had to be that man we met even back in justification that same one is going to change your body god bless you let's pray before we dismiss let's pray for both Jule just one more time family father we pray that you would send father again Lord as we ask you for our friend and our acquaintance and our brother in Christ brother Joel Forney that you'll touch him father and raise his body up supernaturally healed that thing Lord so there won't be any problems Lord Lord his journey cannot be over we need him here father
