each one as the word goes forth we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen so we go to first Peter we read this because that we're tying it in as one thing of being born again something has taken place now I wish we would I'll try to repeat it a little bit in a minute but see I believe what makes this message hard for people to follow is that it covers such a large area all right and it covers to Israel it covers to the bride it covers a large area and you get a tall reading it and mingle it together without having it you know understanding then it makes it confusing a lot of times when you read the Bible and you wonder we'll watch this or what's it talking about who's it talking to whatever and all and it may it confusing and see that way it has to be revealed so we break it down go see the Bible is written the Prophet said that all scripture and things are compound meaning and compound revelation see like he brought his son out of Egypt all right which was Israel coming out of Egypt then Jesus comes out of Egypt all right compound meaning with that way then by having a compound meaning if you don't get it applied to which way like for instance I remember like the second coming of Jesus Christ see you got it to the bride you got it to Israel you got it to the Millennium you've got a whole bunch of things that are related to the second coming of Jesus Christ and if you get those scriptures you know and read them and don't understand how they're placed then surely it is confusing to read the Bible and say well now what is this what is that let's see if you'll just go read the before and the after if you'll just simply sit down and look and see what it's a talking about then you'll have it in the correct order you know like we say that but run said to our English language the messed up with a word board you know you say come on board stand on board cause on board that's three different ways of looking at one word but if you take the before and the after to understand it you say come on board that means you're directing to come on board like a ship or something stand on this board you're specifically telling what the board is it's a plank guy and then it says because I'm bored with you now you understand by the before and the after of what it is well that's what it is with me and the Bible in see then I'll repeat this but I want this up here see this stature of a perfect man it's not just to try to tell us how to be born again it's the entire growth of the individual all the way through life and goes all the way to the chains of the body all right see then to take this over here and put it over here what have you doing and see I'm trying to lay it down to where that everything will stay in order and that way we can follow the line up all right see that's why I keep reading the same scriptures and things to where that we can get an understanding okay now we go to verse 18 the first Peter for as much as you know you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot Hoover Lee was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest in these last times to you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently once done being born again now what is the new birth the new birth is a birth of the word right now read it right now there is the thing you say well brother that why will you hammer so much that the new birth is a birth of the word because that's what it is Oh what I don't need you're not in not doing you're not listening you're wanting into something in your ways to do it I'm talking about what the Bible says so read it right there from the Bible being born again not of corruptible seed so now Nicodemus was right when he said it would it do any good for me to go to my mother's wound and come back out if you're telling me that was corrupt and I'd do it again how would it help me so listen to it being born to get not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible now what he explains what incorruptible is and what he's home by the Word of God which liveth and about us forever so what is the new birth it's not the corruptible things it's the Word of God that is uncorruptible you know our incorruptible ever how you want to bring the the thought all right and see your being born again which means something is taking place the child is growing up all right so then the whole thing of the Bible is to not to just tell us his weight is bringing out in the seals and it's not to just tell us that we need to be born again that's wonderful that's great that's where you start out but it tells you your whole life your journey and on into the change of the body see right in the very word of God the scriptures that we read now let's read from Ephesians then we'll go back to 2nd Peter so we're going to Ephesians 4 verse 8 wherefore said he when he ascended up on high and let that captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now he that ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower part of the earth so that's what Christ had to come and docume alright he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things now what did he say in verse 8 and gave gifts unto men now what gifts here's a before and after what gifts is he talking about what he's talking about tongues speaking at all shouting glory and Allah is that what he says here alright verse eight and he gave gifts unto me and it tells about him ascending and descending you know and look and he gave some apostles and some prophets and some evangelists some pastors and teachers what for for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ now Paul uses stature Paul uses coming to a measure do it but he's not talking about physically growing all right now he's talking about spiritually growing Peter doesn't use the word stature in all of his writings he doesn't use the word stature but that's what he's talking about right see Paul is saying the end - we all come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children see you want to grow up right why or you won't be children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word and you understand what I'm saying that the Bible is written not to just get us born again that's wonderful that's the beginning that's the point that we need to follow in it's trying to tell us how to be born again right but then the Bible is telling you about the growth development and how you grow up and how you do this and how everything happens it's explaining those things to the tea to us and like I said then Paul uses the word stature but a Branham uses the word stature in the statue of a perfect man and he uses he quotes the scripture but he doesn't take it and read it as a point and bring it out but he uses the word the scripture that I just read in the stature of a perfect man you may heard me the other day say Paul didn't you appeared in uses over here you know in his duties doesn't but he's telling you how to do it he's telling you how to come to the stature of a perfect man all right now in that Peter is laying down the way Paul tells you how we need to come to that we'll get to those later on adoption when he comes in to the child being a child and then tutored and and brought into the stature our growth development and look up that word stature it means Heights it means like growing it means like things like that but it also means maturity maturity is your greater understanding of the word stature it means maturity that have our sister with us glad it's gonna be with us today all right the stature then the height the growth development not of an individual it is Christ within us growing up that we may grow up in him and who is he he's the word as I said when we started there one the new birth what is it's the birth of the word you heard the word you accepted to work you you saw the work the word said for you to do the word said Nate when they ask him what must we do to be saved then they said repent every one of you baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right in - they answered it was scripturally all right because what is the birth being born again not of anything corruptible it wouldn't do no good Nicodemus knew that Nicodemus is a city with Jesus it ain't written out as - we read but yet they didn't have a five-minute conversation there was maybe hours of discussing the thing and Nicodemus knew what Peter I mean what Jesus was saying the Jew did you need to be born again so then he brings it up with would it do any good for me to go back to my mother's womb no because you're saying that I've born wrong because I need to be born again all right why would he tell him he need to be born again if he wouldn't tell him it's more wrong if he said you had born right your lineage is right everything's ok we're on our way to heaven no he didn't tell him that it's not written out we read the Bible as to understanding what God is bringing to us that way we take the before the after the entire word we bring it together and we can see where it fits together in a beautiful picture all right so as I said then I've been over and over it two or three times to the message and then we'll get back and try to put it together into one thing but Peter is telling you how to come to where he was at Paul is telling you what you would be when you get that Paul describes the full growth of a son and child of God adoption bringing it into being brings us to the stature of Jesus Christ because it's not the stature of me and you it's the statue of Jesus Christ in you and me that's what Peter is explaining to them alright so then in doing that it comes forth to be a beautiful picture of the entire Bible showing us that you know who you know you go to do a lot of places today in this world what do we need to know all of this about we just need to be saved I don't care about this or what I'm gonna have when I'm getting heaven I just want to get to heaven well how you gonna get to have them if you don't know how may I quote the Prophet did the Prophet I'll give you a quote here while back he said out what good would need about the Holy Ghost if you don't know what it is her phrasing it but it's close what good is it if we don't know what it is he said it's been so misunderstood so much the Holy Ghost has missed out until we don't even know how to place it all right what you see then if we take it to what he's trying to get us to say okay and we listen to it in the right way then we be able to follow what is being said right because you know but a random talks about well let's just go the way I said I'd go in my minds okay I had to change things around wala going in everything because you know I needed to express something through you so go ahead and our brothers and pull that up on on the second Peter I had this schedule to read before receipted but I wanted it to to be worth it you would think about it I wanted to emphasize each scripture to were you would think about what is being said and how far that we've come into what we're doing all right now remember the pole Paul is explaining the measure the height the stature that not how tall you are but what you are in Christ he goes into Romans and explaining adoption how a child is a charming Galatians and you know how the child is a child now that then like we talked about last Sunday there one a babies born with ever part normal baby born with ever part that'll ever how it's born with everything you'll ever need it just needs a growth development all right here comes brother Branham now look people in to match their quote I got a quote brother Branham that when I got born again I got everything I needed we don't want that's a direct quote that's exactly what he said verbatim word for work that sounds like a bad doctrine um once saved always saved got everything but that's right a babies got everything that it needs when it's more that's born with everything it needs what does it need to do eat what does a Christian need to do eat the Word of God and grow in that word until we become that word any problem we see it simple if we take it but I've got quote you can't tell me I'm born again but I'm not trying to I'm trying my best to tell you and me what we need to have it's up to you to find out whether you're right or not all right but listen let's look at the scripture we've been reading a lot and emphasized just a little bit on each part so he says in 2nd Peter now like I said 1st Peter he tells you you need to be you know you you're born here you need to be born again you need to come into Christ you need to grow development and being warned against a cut Peter he begins to tell you now who's he telling listen Simon Peter servant an apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior all right this is not written a prophet said it's in a message factual perfectly this is not written to the world this is written to those that are in Christ because unless you're in Christ you can't understand anything about the righteousness of Jesus Chrysler and whatever one because no man can call Jesus the Christ whaat except it be by an inward dwelling of the Holy Spirit just not so you're saying what somebody else says you're just reading the Bible Ariza all right but he says what now to them that have obtained like pressure in other words he said I've got this I've got this experience of salvation and I'm trying to tell you how to see that if you have that same experience then we have like precious faith see if you're born again we have like precious who is it written to all right who is the Bible written to to those that are in Christ Jesus how do we get into Christ Jesus by one spirit we're all baptized into one body all right so then were we a see to them he's not talking to the world he's talking to them that are already in Christ Jesus by the new birth you must first what the prophets say have faith and be born again all right now you're supposed to read the message okay now listen but watch what he goes to say Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord now like I said if he's not talking to people with the new birth why is he talking about the Grace and peace multiplied through the knowledge of God you just have human knowledge but if you got the baptism with a the ghosts you have the inside teacher right all right and that's who he's talking to so then what am I talking to today now listen won't say I'm talking to those that say they have the new birth to those that don't have the new birth the order is open that's all you can understand head knowledge you get it all blowed up and thought and you get and think you got everything but no man can call Jesus Christ unless he's got that new birth in his soul to tell him what it is all right then what now look hey he's going according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness we got everything glory we got all things amen but we need a growth development right according to His divine power given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue now brother what made a statement years ago and he never did preach it he said one of these days don't want to preach about glory and virtue well what does that mean glory and virtue now the word virtue here as a basic different meaning the word Verte than the Virts word virtue when the Prophet says add to your faith virtue because this virtue here means a Christian life to be lived and manifested outwardly whereas the one in the statue of a perfect man your prophet said it he said it means strength or power and that's the same thing is in Luke so you go over and Luke and Matthew where Jesus said stray has gone out of me in other words I've got weakened that means he got physically weak power had went out all right but look he's cut work hard now what's what I'm getting that only those that enter Christ only those that are in Christ sealed in the Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost can know and see the knowledge of God and follow him through the word because whether you're gonna say what somebody else says and that's all you're doing all right now then it comes down to showing His divine power he's making sure it's gonna work and what he's doing he's have called us to glory and virtue he realized now listen you realize that ever born-again believer is called to glory and virtue ever born-again believer is called to glory and virtue the glory to the fact of being in God and virture to the point of the Christian life being lived all right now are you listening ever born-again believer is called to glory and virtue right but that just starts you burn now when we drop on down to the virtue part in the statue of a perfect man you see it picks up because you see only those who can follow into the end time the message of the hour can understand what glory and virtue really is because else you're going to read words come on because in second Peter where it says virtue that definition is the same definition is it says when it says Adam to your faith virtue which means a Christian life now the Prophet said the word virtue when he's used it in the statute of a perfect man of coming on over to add to your faith virtue he said that's not a virgin life he said that's not what he's talking about he's telling you a different definition for the word than even the strongest concordance will give you a definition go Strong's Concordance will give you a definition of virtue that's virtually there in second Peter now listen I say that to make you stop long enough to think just a little bit but then you start running on out and miss what I'm talking about ever born-again believer is called to God's glory and God's virtue to live a virgin virtuous life a Christian life brother branham never had to come to tell us it was wrong to drink and run around with women and cuss and snort and do it all of those things once what they hope but brother brown told her he didn't have to tell it he didn't have to tell me that I had to put up the pastor fence when L could I let the cow get out but yet you read it said well I found out I should have put that since I didn't have no thoughts about putting the fence back up if that got tore down I put it up why because I was gonna get today life beat out of me when I got home and then I have to go put the cow up put the fence up but around them didn't have to tell me then it was wrong to lie cheat and steal and commit adultery and all I can but the people to this message just like they didn't know nothing until run around and told us run around told us run around told if you had Karl to glory in verse you buy the new birth there's no excuse to come along and say well brother bream told us we didn't need to do this not like I I think we need to quit doing that you mean it was all right to lying cheating stealing and all like that commit adultery and all before the Prophet came but then when he comes and reminded us of it we decided to quit and think it's he's it's God telling us more to quit it now the new birth like wage saying the seals is not to bring you a new birth the new birth is supposed to be the birth in Christ that's what I've been driving at hammering at for weeks now on one thing the new birth and what is it it's the person of the word we just read by the incorruptible Word and when you come to incorruptible Word and get a new birth you have a portion of those virtues dwelling within you just like a baby has a portion of its life within it it just has to grow up into being able to be used and dies right but listen everybody is called that's born again it's called the glory and virtue we should have known all along it was wrong to do the effort don't do it but a run said you don't have to tell people that's wrong to commit adultery yeah but we didn't know it was wrong to do this and I did so we went and done it now you're a liar is that strong enough your own conscience let you know it was wrong you just didn't have nothin to condemn you with one of these days I'll get around to preaching one of the law was given you know what was given to condemn you you know what the letter of this message does condemns you it kills you but we didn't have to have that well I didn't know it was wrong to cuss now come on folks I see people using little words you know a lot of times oh they don't cuss but they get so close to it until it's amazing until when I look up the word of the dictionary it spelled it saying well they don't bother me to say and I'll say it or that you'll know what I'm talking about because a lot of people are a lot of people claim they don't know I've heard a lot of you say burn when something would go wrong no I don't know how to even spell that do you are in or out it is I just know it's a bad word for me we wouldn't talk to use them kind of words right come on you hit your finger and you you blurt out little things but you don't oh no no no I didn't say I didn't I didn't cuss I got close I don't like to use that word D a.m. I know what it means downer to hold the water but I know what people use it for it's a slang word what do you need a slang word for you hit your finger while I wrap this say Oh best thing to do stick it in your mouth you know why cuz it's just a mouth up from saying them words and you suck on it a little bit and it'll quit hurting come on church talking about Christianity that we think we've had to wait til the Prophet come to tell us it was wrong we were already what was the word what word you used for in other words we had a TV and everything we come into message would you know what we'd already started telling the kids things they couldn't watch never heard of the Prophet never heard of it we'd already started programming our kids to those things oh yeah we had a Christmas tree oh yeah well we'd already started telling them what was wrong that was for we heard of the Prophet probably didn't have to come tell me not to cuss or to lie or to cheat is that what you think he came for now the new bird folks take care of those signs well because we're called of glory and virtue we're called to live a virtuous life but it don't bother me to do this act well then maybe you need to get a good salvation well you can't find word a prophet said it I remember one time I say this is kind of funny but he was coming along into the message part and I had an old flattop haircut you know brother mode he had here it was kind of round and it was already starting coming out you know so here's wasn't necessary that stand up flat top in somebody said something bad to preach the message you know about him them fellers for them flat top haircuts and brother mode he said one day he's you know out shirts and starts brother there he said I ain't found a thing brother Brennan said about a flattop I said I searched it all I said because this is the haircut I wore all my life I mean it I've had a flat top I said now I don't have the duck tail Elvis Presley you know or some of them I didn't I didn't have enough iron to do it all back and make a good duck tail we didn't worry them in our day but we just wore flat old flattop you know right well well we found where the Prophet said you don't need the Prophet to live a Christian life if you gotta have the Prophet to make you to live a Christian life you need to get born again that's as plain as I can say it we never miss church when we were in the Baptist ain't got a thing in the world about people going on vacations everybody needs something ain't saying a word about it you say you aren't I'll tell you you're a liar to your face will face god I never said a thing about people with their vacations but now when you get back in from your vote vacation on Friday evening and you too lazy to come Church on Sunday morning I mean Saturday evening and you can't make it a church on Sunday then you are lazy they something wrong with you you ought to be at church you come in early enough to get your you certainly ain't gonna come in Sunday and miss Monday because that's work day oh I didn't this was not meant to be okay alright I'll change in a second but let me get to thought off what does it mean to be called a glory and virtue ever born-again believer or to be called a glory and virtue ever born-again believer or to have an inward dwelling or have to have one to be a Christian and then we're dwelling of Jesus Christ and all like that that's the new birth that's the being born again because now start being born again with a 2-foot to four fold out what being born again the day you receive the baptism in the Holy Ghost you're being born again but then you start a growth development that goes through your Christian journey of being born again as you eat the word right we see we're all called to glory and virtue we're all called to live a Christian life okay look whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises they'll run said down by these promises these always emphasize that right that by these you might want be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now last Sunday we were preaching on the divine nature the Wrentham covers your divine nature I gave you a bunch I still have a bunch laying here if you want your divine nature is in a two-part thing when you're born again a babe in Christ you take his nature because that's the divine nature that comes in to drive out that unclean spirit right your new birth is the divine nature right it's the nature of God to come in to live and drive out all of the things that Satan had left in us but see then going into a growth development from that into a divine nature so then the profit gets over in the message he's talking about the divine nature we'll read these if you want them he's talking about how he's addressing this to the church those that are in Christ Jesus and that divine nature is the divine nature of you partaking of that divine nature these mortal body now that we can be protected he said these mortal bodies you know this outside don't act unless the inside tells it to their will to be concerned about that but look when he gets over to the message the position of a believer in Christ which is on the own adoption he said after coming into the body we are to be partakers of the divine nature do you understand what I was getting that last Sunday when you're born again that soul is as pure and clean and eternal as it ever will be you don't grow in eternity eternity pushes outward through the rest of us to bring into manifestation all right so when you're born again you're a partaker of his divine nature but then to compare that divine nature as a growth development you're like the sister was in the in the dream on blasphemous names that she didn't know the way brother branham was preaching it she didn't know whether she had to hold a ghost or not you remember that we'll get back to that message she didn't know she was concerned because she didn't know what because he's preaching the divine nature he's preaching through the statue of a perfect man a divine nature and speaking of the fact of a new birth the new birth is to bring you in either divine nature you can't have God coming and living in your soul and your old nature still dire the unclean spirit was driven out at sanctification when I talk about body and spirit we're talking about the soul the soul is where the new birth takes place it doesn't take place in your body in your spirit that isn't how it would work from the inside to come out and control the outside and it's the divine nature of Almighty God that's why brother Branham is so missed confused and misunderstood he's speaking of a divine nature and bringing it up here - a hot development of a growth development in Christ that means a Christian that has walked in Christ a long time and it's partaker of that divine nature but then he's explaining at the same time that there was the divine nature that come into you the day you was born again it made you a baby in Christ there's any problem with that but that's what makes the message confusing so I've got a quote you just killing yourself without those things coming together but when he gets over there in a position in Christ which is actually preached with for the statute of perfect man was positioning Christ preaching 55 he is already speaking of a divine nature that after you're born again go back to 1955 interval and listen to him talk about he said a living instrumentality of Christian God walking into feet in human beings he was already preaching that he was preaching that all the way down through there that's why the people couldn't understand him look the lady said I don't listen to you brother on him and it sounded exactly like brother branham preached in a lot of time that you don't have nothing right but then he's telling you that we're Christians being partakers of the divine nature he's one of us trying to go grow into I'm quoting from statue of perfect man how that we must be protectors of His divine nature now each one of us are trying to grow into the stature of God then that's where people don't understand him Godfrey's I'm saying that I didn't that's were in you hearing him expressing things and you hear him describing and it sounds like one time he's talking about the new birth next time he's talking about a group development in height than Christ and the human mind has trouble bringing those things together and see you talk about a divine nature and you talk about getting it to a place that you don't have no more troubles you know how troubles live in a Christian life and then you turn around said what brother Dale I'm having trouble it sounds like the Prophet says I'm not born again right sounds like he's saying it I'm not born again that was what was wrong with the sister she was so concerned she thought that maybe she wasn't even born in one because of the way that he was preaching it and we know that we have been told at least they taught it coming down through in some ways that the Christian life was to be controlling the individual the Christian life is cool controlling the individual until we even condemn ourselves for the least little thing you remember that let's see then we turn around on the other side of the scale and we talk about coming to temperance and read about them catch the temperance and he starts talking about how you still got a little too well you got one side telling you you ain't got nothing you got those that looks like you can just get by with anything that's why it's hard to preach a Christian life because of the way we've been taught it the way we've been taught all we need to do just come to our door and cried and accept Jesus Christ as our Savior and walk back off an in water try to live if we can then if we don't we don't make it you know what would come back we're you say something buddy you think you perfect you never had that throw do you phase and you start talking about Christianity and so much you think you perfect ain't none of us perfect we all have problems just a second or two before then they was as perfect as they could be right now that do you understand what I'm getting at we're all called of glory and virtue we're called to live a Christian life we're also called to a growth development in Christ that is to bring out the things and get rid of that other part of that nature of us see our nature is in our body our spirit and our soul as a sinner that nature is the nature of the devil called the Adamic nature of mankind right you get what I said when we're babies before you born again that nature that we have in our body is just a display of what our spirit is and the Spirit is a display of what's in our soul so we've got the whole nature to be dealing with right and salvation is us trying to explain Sunday what you repent of your sins why cause you're condemned for living wrong and doing wrong you repent that's justification that's taking out that thing of sin that was in our lives we say oh look said when when I when I got saved I felt so good I said now why do I feel so bad I always felt so wonderful there now I feel bad because justification only chops off you Pisceans it does nothing to the nature of mankind sanctification starts dealing in the nature of man and that's in his soul it's the soul that's part of repenting but we do a lot of Wrath in here oh you know they say the talk is cheap unless you hire a lawyer but you know it's cheap to say are easy to say I'm sorry we teach our children go tell them you're sorry well it's good I mean on well now I'm not going on tell you wrong now but I'm just telling you you tell the kid to go you go tell that person you're sorry come on you didn't do it yourself so don't look at me when you were told to go say I'm sorry you didn't mean it oh yes I did you didn't mean it you got caught you had to go apologize biggest portion of people's apology has no more meaning than a word I'm sorry I've always tried my best to teach you you know don't tell your children God don't want you to do them thing now you go apologize don't read it don't make God in between these tell them to go pologize cuz we dollar most bank you well how many kids run over and apologize because they know they're gonna get a whoopin if they didn't right okay we live human but see a lot of our repentance means nothing I like what the Bible says there's a repentance that need not to be repented of do you need that scripture that there's a repentance that need not to be repented of what does that mean a repentance that need not to be repented of it simply means you need to repent from something controlling you from the inside instead of I'm sorry now come on kids you know it and come on adults you live the same life and you know I'm telling the truth you wouldn't sincere when you apologized come on get over and let's live right and get straight you wouldn't apologize and you'd apologize cause you got cold you know that's the problem with a lot of people their apology comes because of getting caught how many of them apologizes for they get caught no I got a lot of that didn't you but see Christian life is were called a glory and virtue we're all called to live a Christian life just at your new birth you're called to live a Christian life let's say brother Branham didn't have to tell us it was wrong to commit adultery you know what he had to tell us about that now come on he had to come tell us him denomination and them people back there that told us about this that and the other about adultery was wrong right come on are you with me are you winning this then he didn't have to tell us it was wrong to do them things he told us we was wrong we listened to what others told us it was all right to do them right and it made us come - come on in Ruth let us come to a basis that we just live like the devil and put it up or I couldn't help it that was my nature it made me do that well some were in a line somewhere in man there's a way of getting rid of a nature and I thought we've called to do that we're called to be Christians was called to live for God that's what he wanted us to do was to live for him all right call the glory and virtue call to be a Christian the Neuberger calls us to this be this the new birth is to the born-again experience it calls us to be a Christian don't make an excuse that we can get by with things because it were called like I said you know our most of our repentance is cause we call them something right let's see in a Christian will not have to be told is wrong to do do you mean I've got to tell you it's wrong to commit adultery now there's something wrong but brother Dale after a job not ain't my job the Holy Spirit was supposed to took care of that one who got it yeah but we didn't know I was wrong oh we wouldn't talk so you're using excuse you're the same thing if you get one combi you're the same thing as the little boy go apologize I'm sorry is that the way we do we're found guilty we go before God we say I'm sorry just remember he knows whether you're or not okay now we're gettin to Christ because that justification just chops that seeing off I'm in future home come on it just chops off you Pisceans it does nothing to your nature I'm quoting brother Branham all it is Lord I'm sorry and it is really what we say come on now you gonna be honest enough to admit it we come before God when said god I'm sorry did Lord I'll try my best not to do it again that's a better answer than to tell him I won't do that no more Lord right best answer is just be honest with him Lord I'm sorry if you'll help me I'll try to get rid of that but I ain't gonna tell you ain't gonna do it again my brother to hell you're crazy you sure are fun the way you preach that I agree but a God likes it sometime cuz I believe it's the truth we'll see our apologies before God they're not worth anything unless they're meant from an inside and that's why the Bible says now listen the Bible says the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance and it speaks of a repentance that need not to be repented of that means it's taken away whatever it is so you see when the Prophet was covered in look how wonderful justification just jumps off that Piscean you're the same identical person you was you're just a repentant sinner right then God begins to deal from the inside of you not on the outside justification is chopping off for the sins of the soul is not chopping off the sins of the body in the spirit that's what we think it is it's got to be done from the inside the goodness of God leadeth thee to repentance LeBron says a human mortal ever mortal is made to serve God am i right ever mortal being that's why they serve they worship idols and totem poles and time we're made to worship God but then sanctification see starts cleansing that inside that nature you remember how we brought it out lye Sunday then what you start repenting and that nature if you just get in that word and live in that word that word will start taking out the desires of doing those time.if start letting you know that it's wrong to do that something's working on the inside then you're the seal still the same person in body and spirit but it starts dealing from the inside of you a moral obligation is the best definition I've ever been able to find in my study of the message about a moral obligation God knows we will turn our selves or to know that we will come into this world lost and doomed and on the way to hell will to know that without even a preacher to preach it - we were to understand that because this goodness is what's leading us what brought you to where you are what turns you around in Christ what started your journey in a different direction something from with the end what it didn't change the other people that was around you come on church I've tried to explain it without people listening to and say well who do you think you are I've told you over and over that as a sinner when I would do wrong they was something that was burdening me and I'd ask God to forgive me of course I went back and done the same thing again because I'm telling you then that was the only thing I could pray God do something about this man that I am cause one part of these wanting to do good the other part of me just can't find a way to do it now come on don't let's don't get in the Baptists with it you know the Baptist's believe that Paul had that burden in him when he said the things I do not I would not do it on evil would I do not he said it was the you've never been in the Baptist you the order to listen brother Brian I'll tell you them Baptists you better listen they'll tell you some word you know what the Badgers bleed about Paul Romans one two three four five six he was explaining how to get saved seven he started the condemnation to bring the words Christ and explaining what was happening in his life the eighth chapter there's no condemnation in Christ Jesus and how does it start 8:1 but I couldn't agree with it then because it didn't work I didn't know the words though when the Prophet said it a holiday men he said Paul was writing to the Christians he was explaining what was happening in his life after he got mourned again I mean if you read Romans wonder what he was talking about the things I would I do not the things I do I would not and then if it's not this me said then I followed by the outward man I followed the things of the flesh or in other words of the body he said but by the N word man I served the law of Christ he wasn't explaining how to get born again he's explaining how we are I do we get born again how do we get born again it's the inside that's living you're not born to get in your body you're not born to get in your spirit that's why you can be anointed on your spirit with a true Holy Spirit they did not save you because it's not the new birth that birth has to be with inside of you and it comes out early that's the goodness of God that leaders they were dependent he starts working on the inside of man to get contact I just didn't have nobody could explain it to me but I do that I did I do wrong and things and I thought I shouldn't do this you didn't go to church and sit in the pews and realize that preacher preaching at you right this one's yours I'm trying to get you to see something that's real to me and supposed to be real to each one of us in our heart that nuber starts on that inward man and works its way out it don't start on the outward man it starts on the inward man and works its way outward Li cleansing it driving out the unclean spirit out of this role where the Holy Ghost can come and dwell in the soul and give you a new birth the end that Holy Spirit that gives you that new birth begins to work out through your spirit now you got something on your side you ain't got this - I quit that didn't do it no more what I wanted to do it and I would have done it but right I know if I got caught how many of you ever lived in that state well I'm glad I didn't do that because I got caught okay come on but when you get truly born again you find out there's something on the inside living he's dealing with your nature they said Paul said Peter speaking of a divine nature and that soul becomes eternal the divine nature of God is living within it but then he starts dealing with in the outward and the Prophet said after coming into the body the adoption series 55 he said after coming into the body your protector of the divine nature right now every moment of our lives should be a desire in our hearts and lives to have the nature of God well Brunel I think I'm doing pretty good right there you just stumbled all over the biggest problem you got you you just exposed yourself when you think you're doing pretty good well I don't lie don't cheat don't steal well praise God so does the neighbor yeah but he don't believe the message like me no he believes more of it cuz he ain't using this as an excuse right no come on listen to be partakers of his divine nature wonder where we can become into a reflection of Jesus Christ to live in Christ so I pull it back up now and we'll finish this and we'll quit we'll get another few minutes go ahead and pull second Peter back up all right we're called a glory in virtue so you got that your new birth or to call every one of us to a Christian life because that's what that virtuous life means dark that means a virtuous clean sweet Christian life you want the definition I got him laying right over here from the Strong's in the time all right now look from that point on watch whereby are given unto us what he's give it to us all the way precious promises he might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge that's an entirely different word from that word I've got them laying here this word is the same identical one in the scripture but your prophet this one is a virgin lies to him this one is strength or power so it's got a growth development added to it when you're called to glory and virtue now listen you realize then now listen you're gonna think I've throwed a curve so listen every Christian is called to glory and virtue every Christian is called to live a virtuous life ever Christian is supposed to be living in Jesus Christ letting Christ live from the inside out to bring us to a life that is that becomes to work that he can guide us and direct us throughout our lives and we'll be Christians right but you know what if you're not in the truth of the hour how can you be being called a voter in virtue we just moved up a step now so listen how can you say your call to glory in virtue if you don't even know what glory and virtue is you realize the faith of the fathers has got to be into an individual before these virtues are worth anything I'm quoting brother Branham he said gifts without these virtues as a stumbling block Tumbo block is actually the correct word but listen Church get it let me see if I can find something to I wrote my notes we'll hold on a second there was a word that I wanted the definition of I'll get it later it stands in and in that but listen come on musicians come on listen Church there's got to be a growth development in the Christian life to grow up in Him who is the head because you know you'd have to admit where are we today now listen are you following where are we today in comparison to the Apostles you realize then that we've got to come to where they were yeah we can't never kind of worked ours where you're lying because you're taking your thoughts from what's been in your life before the Prophet said these things are required he said Lord you sent me I'm quoting from statute of perfect man he said Lord you sent me to bring these things or build a church into these things he said again the Lord filled me up with these virtues that I may teach other apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the edifying of the body of Christ you will all come to the unity of the faith you see then that's the job of the file for ministry now you're gonna flop this go ahead flop because you always have with me brother branham was not sent for the perfecting of the saints I want the scripture I want the scripture and I want the Prophet but I'll state it this way the fivefold ministry without this prophets message is not sin either nope but the fivefold ministry that sent them God to bring this message to the people after the Prophet left the scene is to bring us to these things and that's the group of people that's called to glory and virtue you realize you and I are called to a higher height than any of them down through any age any age you realize the Apostles in the faith of the fathers they're still in the ground waiting on you and me that's according to the Bible according to the Bible they without us cannot be made perfect so then what is the fivefold ministry to do preach what the Prophet probably we don't have a message of our own it's not made that way that's why it's done that away that's why I went to Ephesians we'll go back over it again and over and over because remember he gave gifts unto men what's the gifts that he sent unto the church you know that brother branham was predestinated as a prophet to bring the Word of God not him physically because that goes with it but his gift his life his doings was predestinated to bring us a message the fivefold ministry is predestinated to bring the message I didn't say it's your prophet said they'd break these things down I see we don't want a fivefold ministry we think we've got it just cause we've you're the Prophet but then somebody comes along and quote something and you don't even know what the Prophet said that's what I said people can tell you all about brother branham's message they can tell you all about the seals and the seventy weeks of Daniel and a lot of money even Network never read the book they can tell you all about it and you know what most of you will sit and listen to that when the first thing you were to ask him have you ever read the book well no brother ain't that read the book we'll just shut up they don't need listening to you shut up you don't never read the book you can tell me all about it and that what most people have done to the Bible they've never read the Bible but they can tell you all about it right let's Dan well we got really we've got to be become the very nature of Almighty God that's what's keeping us here after 50 years the prophets left the same it's because we're not listening to his word we're not following what he says and it's showing up you might have a need remember what I'm trying to break a Christians brow how the glory and virtue [Music] what about it do you believe it my father we send these first balls in the name of Jesus
