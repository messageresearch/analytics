========================================

am aren't you glad we're not under an American Spirit we're part of the kingdom of God that changes our nature well we're just going to continue studying through uh First Corinthians this morning the um the first chapter and and get to the end of the first chapter and just we're just taking some little uh thoughts from from from the different things that Paul said and this morning I just want to take a little thought from you um that where he said you you see your calling brethren and he's talking about how your um God takes the the base things and makes something out of it and uh and and and and he kind of runs that thought like that but let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we get into this Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word this morning I pray you gu guide us through your scriptures Lord make it a living reality to us this morning I pray God that you'll prepare our hearts Lord Jesus and bless our precious brother as she's preparing to bring us the word oh God and just be with us that that we'll be receptive and and and just uh Lord that you'll guide it Quicken it to us Lord we pray in your name amen but now to back up and and uh we were looking at the little thought that Paul was saying in verse 18 of 1 Corinthians chapter 1 where he was uh talking about the preaching of the Cross is the power of God so he said for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved it is the power of God and and you we were you know meditating on how that that's that's in the book of Acts Simon the Sorcerer uh was trying to attract all the attention to him and trying to uh put the focus on him and he was putting forth that he was the great power of God but the power of God is actually in his word not in a a particular you know Pulpit Ministry or a particular movement like that but it's the word it's the word of God and and when we say it's the power of God it's because the word of God will actually it's not just like a education or not just a Theology of some things that you pack in your head to to know but it's actually the word of God will actually express it will Express deity it will in other words it'll bring to reality the things that are laying here in the scripture and so that's the power the power of God will is it's the the it's it's it's the um the power of God in the word to to bring Liberty to change your life to change things to to express his deity in your life so it says for it is written I will d destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of the world now what what he's talking about here is that in your learning and your and all the Scholastic exercises all the theology there's no way that you can know anything about deity there's no way that you could get Liberty from the bondage that sin has placed in your life there's no way you can know God so he he's he's he's framing it up that all this wisdom that the world has it's it's not going to bring you any salvation it's not going to get you anywhere you know at the end of the road no matter if you've got as much money in the bank as Bill Gates or as much money in the bank as Elon Musk at the end of the road what's that going to do for you so where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified under the Jews a stumbling block and under the Greeks foolishness but under them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men now now he's framing it up that preaching and the word of God and you know him standing there in the in the in the Greek amphitheaters and laying out out to to these Greek people that knew all knew all these different languages and had all this wisdom of the world to them it seemed like a bunch of foolishness to the Jews it seemed like something to just stumble over and and so he's framing it up that you know the Jews were looking they they you're preaching about a crucified Messiah and you're saying all these things that stum they stumbled over because they were looking for things to come in a totally different way now so he's he's using this word a stumbling block which is used repeated throughout the scripture stumbling Stone all throughout the New Testament this this uh this phrase is used to repeat how the reaction that many people have to the preaching of the Gospel but that is how God uh brings about salvation it's through this this the simp the the simple foolishness uh is what people would say foolishness of the preaching of the Gospel in Isaiah Isaiah said he shall be a saint uary but for a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense to both the houses of Israel for a Jin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and many among them s shall stumble and fall and be broken and be snared and be taken and first Peter Echoes that where he says it's contained in the scripture behold I lay in Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be dis obedient the stone which the builders disallowed the same as made of the head of the corner the head of the corner and a stone of stumbling and a rock you you know you think I I just Illustrated here with a little picture of well we'll make it a a little triangular like a little pyramid Stone laying there on the ground that everybody would think it's nothing just a little simple would put it put it over in the New Testament terms in a Manger that everybody would oh he's in a little baby crying in the mang danger with the donkeys and all of those things around and that's the thing that they stumble over even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient but but now really to put it in the the right context this stone is it's like the foundation stone of a work of God it's the it's the starting point of your life as a Christian it's the starting point of the of the of the church everything is built upon this Stone and and what brother Brandon would frame it up as it's the Holy Ghost and and you know many people they they'll think well what is the Holy Ghost they well the Holy Ghost is running and shouting it's emotion and those kind of things but the Holy Ghost is a person it's actually that it's when Christ died on the cross he shed his life so that that P his deity could come back and live in the in the church and so what stumbles people is when they see when they see the uh you know he said my word is spirit my words are life that the word preached actually manifest deity in the lives of the Believers and it causes something that they they'll stumble at and so and and what this what the the the um New Testament is quoting from all these different individuals Peter and Paul and so forth they're quoting from in Psalm chapter 118 Verse 22 where it says the stone which the builders refuse is become The Headstone of the corner brother Brown would say in the building down here the next chapter that in this building there was one stone stone that was actually too odd to fool with so the builders rejected it so they just pitched it over in the corner said that stone is actually too odd to be used there's no such a place now remember it was the builders who should have know different Jesus spoke of it now you can follow that line of thought all the way through this in the in the uh when uh when John the Baptist began to speak it just threw them into that it was so different that they discarded what he was preaching and Jesus come on the scene and they discarded what he was preaching and all the way down till this age where they discard they they stumble over the revealed word of the hour being preached in power and demonstration and they discard it when it's the very thing that will finish the building he said but to come to find out they had built the building so high until they missed the stone and they didn't know where that stone was they might have searched all the ships they might have run through every Ox cart they might have sent messages up into japa and down say has another load come in or did you lose one on the road there's something wrong we just can't find that stone for this place and when they could not find it nowhere else come to find out it was right on the ground now a't that amazing how he lays that out in so such Simplicity where are you looking for it it's not it's not high up and some behind some stained glass windows or something but it's just right on the ground it was the Chief Cornerstone that the Builder is rejected and all of these scriptures in the new at Psalm 118 Isaiah 28 Matthew 21 where Jesus said didn't you read in the scriptures the stone which the builders rejected Ephesians 2:19 now therefore ye are no more strangers and followers but the F foreigners but fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone and whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an Holy Temple in the Lord and whom you also are builded together for in habitation of God through the spirit and first Peter quotes that we we just read a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense because the Jews would look at this they' look at Christ the person of Christ and they would they it would stumble and he said in the message dedication he said that's why the bride building of Christ is not ready for the bridegroom bringing it on over to today is because that the builders has rejected the Chief Cornerstone that was laid on the day of Pentecost which is the baptism of the Holy Spirit now what's the baptism of the Holy Spirit In this case it's the person the person of Jesus Christ the person is what people are rejecting and what what manifests the person in this day is the word of God it's been odd people act funny and they don't come into the order of our psychology of our educational our learning our Creeds that don't fit in there and they kicked it out because it was too odd too peculiar too disagreeable with the plans that we as men had ideas of what the church ought to be now now this is what Paul's framing up as it's a stumbling block to the Jews and to the Greeks it's a stumble something to stumble over now now Daniel talked about a stone and and and you know you could the way he Daniel framed it up there's a a stone that come out of hued out of a mountain bring it over into the modern day or to this day that we're living in and there's a a cloud that came out of the heavens and both of those things signify the same thing that God God uh by his God is manifesting himself in authority to take over the kingdoms of this of this world by that little stone that the world stumbles over by by that little Stone and what was the Holy Ghost given for it it just call out that it what was the Holy Ghost given for because that's what we're talking about the Holy Ghost is what stumbles people and in that sermon brother R was framing out that there's a stone cut out of the mountain without hands that rolled into the world and smashed it out and what Daniel was talking about is that image of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar's dream where the stone hued out of the mountain comes and Strikes strikes what the the world systems and in other words God's taken over he's taken over the world systems he's taking over the kingdoms of your your uh you know all the things that uh uh afflict you in your life he's taking over he's changing your nature he's changing your being until it it it's just a holy ghost takeover and so he said that let that stone the Christ Jesus that stumbling Stone to the world a stone of offense a laughing Stone a stumbling block to the church but a precious and a load Stone to the believer a stone of assurance a stone of rest I know that I pass from Death un life my soul is at rest Oh Come unto me all ye that labor and heavy laden and I'll give you rest to your soul a sign that's to be evil spoken of said the prophet to Mary it'll be a sign sure it will but it'll be an assurance it'll be a love uh it'll be a satisfaction it'll be something that you know you've passed from Death un life a stone like uh the Jesus said told Peter that I'll build my church upon this this rock this Stone the rock of the revelation of Jesus Christ and and even in this in this story of of the rock coming out of the mountain that Daniel saw that rock that stone would actually grow into a mountain and Daniel said in in Chapter 2 of Daniel then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together because it's a holy ghost takeover and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smoke the image become a great mountain and fill the whole earth I wonder what that mountain looked like and his you know if we could kind of it it must have maybe looked like this because when you get born again it's it God begins to take over your life he begins to grow until he just consumes everything this Stone the stone is what the the world has rejected and in the 70th week of Daniel he said this rejected Stone to the pyramid cut out of the mountain cut out without hands it wasn't something God did it I mean that the man did or not any denominational system but God sent it he said without hands God sent it the rejected one the rejected Stone is the head the Capstone and the Very one that they've rejected through this Gentile age is Christ and Christ was not cut and put in here as a Vicor or Son of God or some great dignitary in the church he's the Holy Spirit and the cap of the pyramid will be Christ coming do you see it and Jesus keeps all his appointments he said when Enoch and them in the early days built the pyramids down in Egypt they knew that the Cornerstone the Capstone will be rejected and you can see there there's the top of the Great Pyramid it doesn't have a Capstone on it and that pyramid is put so perfectly together till they don't need mortar it was so mechanically hued out until one stone fits against the other so tight you can't even put a razor blade between it and most of the casing stones on the Great Pyramid are gone but you can see there in the bottom left I got a little picture of the casing stones that are left and you can't put a razor between them that's how tight they are now just keep heaping up and now it's all honed off on top ready for the Capstone when it will come that's the way God has brought his church from justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit and now the ministry of the spirit which is what quickens the word that Ministry in the church will have to be just exactly like his now it's so simple and so different from the way the world expects that it stumbles over people so simple and that's where Paul we're getting to you you see your calling Brethren how God can take a simple word a and make it something that will will turn into a mount he can make just something as simple as a little baby in a manger and make it grow into something that will take over the world systems and take something as simple as where you come from in your own background a a sinner saved by grace and turn you into a child of God and change your life to make you different take something that's worth nothing and make it something that's got real true value now that's what he's saying in verse 6 for ye see your calling Brethren now see Paul Paul lays out these things to give us confidence that we're not here like like we were saying looking for the power of God in a man or in a system or in the church we go to but we're looking for the power our source of power comes from the word of God that we believe so when you look into a scripture like this and it says it ech goes back can do you see your calling do you see where you come from and what God has called you for for that there's a purpose in your life that you're here to fulfill for ye see your calling brother and how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God has chosen the weak things to confound the things which are Mighty and base things of the world and things which are despised at God chosen Y and things which are not to bring to not things that are what does that mean things which are not to bring to not things that are it it means that God can bring something that you can't even see like faith and make it manifest he can bring so it's it's something that you where are you going to put your finger on love or humility and and he can take those things which look like there's nothing to it and actually put it in a church where the church is filled with love and humility and faith and godliness and all those things things which you can't put your finger on but the is expressed and so that's what this is talking about that God can take take things that the world has no it looks like there's no value to it and and and manifest it to a place where it's just taking over everything so all all you look at all these scriptures of of that Echo just like just like our own lives you can look back through the scripture and identify you yourself with all these characters like Moses that had a speech impediment and Ruth a little moabit Widow and we could go on and on through all these Amos a shepherd and a fig farmer Elisha a little farmer who didn't even know really what he was doing you know plowing behind the cattle Samuel A Child serving in the temple jeffa the son of a prostitute rejected by his own family and God takes these people and through the word that the world has disregarded and just treated like something just to stumble over he takes these individuals and brings them to their predestinated calling what's your calling your calling is the purpose in your life that God had for you that he made you to fulfill that he knew you would fulfill from before the foundation of the world and brother Rand would say he said you know if you're called to be a musician you can you could somebody somebody that's not called to be a musician can take all the lessons and everything but if you're called to be a musician you'll be able to do it in a way that nobody else can do it if you're called to be a little a little homemaker that that's your purpose in life then there's something in you that it's your calling that when you hear the word of God and it brings you to a line with what God wants you to do it manifests in a way that the rest of the world can't do it and if you're called to be a preacher you can study if you're not called you can study and try and try to act like a preacher but you'll never be able to do it if you're unless in a way that somebody that's really called to do it called in other words it's what God thought that you thought and planned for you from for the foundation of the world so that's what he's trying to express to the Corinthians you see you see your calling Brethren where God took you and molded you and put you into a place to match up to align with go what he knew you would be from before the foundation of the world like like for example we'll look at little Gideon that that somebody just of a low social status weakest Clan and manasse the and the least in his family fearful hiding in a wine press to avoid the medidan no experience no background in leadership or Warfare all these doubts question God's presence and care for Israel uh and and super hesitant but God raised him up to go to battle and so that he would use him in a mighty way and now same thing with all of these people that we just read we're just looking at and and when you look at these it echoes the plan and purpose in your own life that's how you get your identification from the scripture not from a particular person not from a particular church that you're going to that's why I believe that the bride is moving away from Pulpit Ministries and special Ministries where we're looking as individuals but it's a bride body Ministry where the bride body as a whole is preaching the gospel to bring the bride collectively to a place where she knows what she's doing and why she's here so you see your calling your calling renates relates to God's unique plan for your life that leads to his glory and the benefit of his kingdom God will call you to Salvation like in Romans 8:30 moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also Justified and whom he justified them he also glorified so if you're predestinated you're called it could be a call to service in Ephesians 4:11 he gave some Apostles some prophets some some evangelists and some pastors and teachers so he calls to Ministry and you know I we we'll look at this closely but when God calls you it's not like he he didn't think about it and then all of a sudden he calls you it's it's from before the foundation of the world he knew you were going to come to it exactly a call to Holiness in 1 Peter 1:15 but as he which hath called you is Holy so be ye holy and all manner of conversation so God is calling us these predestinated believers that he knew what you would do with it before the foundation of the world and he had it waiting for you he's calling to Salvation then he's calling to service he's got different roles different thing different thing jobs for us to do that he calls you to and he's calling us to Holiness and probably a whole lot of other things that we could lay out here in the scripture so when God calls you to Salvation he's calling you to a holy life he has called you the one that's called us is Holy brother R would say in questions and answers he' say now you say brother brandom told me told me I ought to do that see and maybe what if something happened to brother brandom I get killed or die or or get away now see this is the danger of looking at an individual like we were looking at last Sunday putting all of your identity on an individual or a church or something like that or a movement he said then see your calling goes over then but but if Jesus calls you if you're relying solely on the word of God for your identity if Jesus calls you brother as long as there's an eternity it'll still be ringing out see and then you know where you're standing in Romans 11: 29 it says for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance so and that's going back to the idea that the that your calling is not something that happens here in time there's a point in time where you you come to realize your calling but your calling is from before the foundation of the world and we'll be closing here in just a moment I'm not trying to wear everybody out uh the Bible also says brother BR would say I I just got some quotes here of some things that he said about calling he said the Bible says gifts and callings are without repentance not what you are repenting not none of your righteousness like not gifts and callings are without repentance it's God's for knowledge and he said it's not what you try to work yourself up to it's what you're born to be another place he said Jesus Christ was the son of God from the Garden of Eden Moses was born in the world a prophet a right child John the Baptist 712 years before he was born was the voice of one crying in the wilderness Isaiah saw him God told Jeremiah before you was even formed in your mother's womb I knew you and S and Sanctified you and ordained you a prophet to the Nations but you see it's without repentance in otherwi in other words you're called before you ever repent it's without repentance before you repent you're already called he said now let me explain it one more time so that you'll thoroughly understand and we'll we'll stop on this and musicians can go ahead and come forward he said gifts and callings are without repentance do you know that you can never make something make yourself something that you're not you born in this world sovereignly by God with different things to do and in in the message why I'm praying for the sick he said I believe that gifts and callings are without repentance see there's no way at all for you to do anything I believe in the election of God that God does the electing God does the calling you taking thought could not add one cubit to your stature see but whatever God has determined to be it will be and you are called by election so if you're called to be a Christian Christian if you're called to be a housewife called to be a preacher God's got that laying there for you and the word will bring it to pass that you just step into it and accept what God's got that little role that special role that God's got laying there for you before we close let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful for your word to give us encouragement and the hour that we're living in Lord and to to place us correctly Lord Jesus to give us that little booster of Faith Lord Jesus to believe I believe this morning that we can see our calling laying there in the scripture Lord Jesus identified by by by the word Lord we can look uh steadfastly and boldly at the at these promises laying there and recognize our identification and see our calling I pray God that you'll just bless the remainder of the service today bless brother Tim as he's preparing I pray God that you'll just be with us now we pray in your name amen God bless you Saints [Applause] get
