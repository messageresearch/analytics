we're glad to have a visitor back there with us we always say to you when you come one time here you're visitor you come two times you're part of us so that's just a the way we we make it just make yourself to home and remember now Wade is in Oklahoma preaching and we'll be try back tomorrow and then also remember Aaron is down preaching brother Collins today so remember that and also remember these brothers that are out ministering the gospel you know unto the Lord right I don't know where brother Dean's ministering is he is he ministering today somewhere Brothers his brothers his brothers okay he's had his brothers on so so just remember these okay let's turn to Ephesians 1 one where we've been reading for quite a while and then John 15 cuz that's the ones we've used the last couple of messages to uh to try to bring it out now we're going to be using the uh screen this morning so you will be doing it and some have said well they couldn't see you know that was the ones their eyesight was bad not the basics that you can't see from the back because everybody can pretty well see and uh but I will make those who cannot see each week you know a copy of the the quotes and things but uh what I want to do until I finish this series of what we're on right now I'm going to continue to give you the quotes cuz I want you to read and see that that's what brother randam said cuz you take it up here you can read it and that's well and good all right but you'll forget it you know and you'll say well I don't know what that is so this is this is a very very important series to me it's very very uh valuable I believe and like I said the other day if it gets boring to you then you don't know what I'm talking about that's as plain as any way of making it not sarcastic just plan telling the truth if you get bored to hear me talk about chosen in him then you wouldn't chosen in him cuz I really love to hear about water baptism it tickles me to death to hear Brother random talking about it and he seemed it didn't bother he get the seals and you know on questions and answers he'd still be on water baptism so you know just you know take that from me but we will try to get the point across as much as we can I did try another few little points on my wife again uh yesterday to see how things were going and and uh you know to kind of telling her the the future points of what I'm talk going to be talking about but let's go to Ephesians 1 and John 15 father we thank you for for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for all things and we know you give them to us freely and we appreciate that and just bless and guide each one bless the minister brothers that are away today Wen Aaron and Brother Dean and way preaching we pray that you'd bless them and and be with them Lord and just let them bring forth Thy word unto the people and be with us here Lord as we speak about you come upon the seen in each one of our hearts and lives be in the speaker and the hearer that we may each one receive receive from you forgive our sins because we want to be cleansed Lord of all things all unrighteousness all thoughts and and meditations or anything that would be contrary to you we ask you to just cleanse them out of the way as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts guide us now and keep us Lord in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 and brother Joe's putting them up for you there so they work out good verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who ha blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now let's end there because we're staying remember in the thought back before the foundation of the world so if we go into predestination that's Destiny to determined down here so let's stop at that point now and go back to to uh John right John 15:15 henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but I have called you friends for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you you have not chosen me but I've have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it you you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now as I said we'll be using both so we will be giving you the quotes and things and uh you know I I want to express something to you that you know maybe will help us you know we think that I know people say brother Dale's deep and we get into things it's hard to understand well U I thought that's the way the Bible was because I didn't know we could understand it in our human carnality I thought it took a revelation to understand but I'd like to ask you a question just a simple ordinary question now we know the disciples were tutored for three and 1/2 years right we can understand but on the day of Pentecost they heard one sermon and people that had maybe never heard of spoke to had any thoughts of Jesus Christ they come to Salvation by hearing one sermon now my point is is this a way we say that you know I you need to make it simple I agree with you but I'm going to say it the right way now you take it the right way I try my best to make it simple to those that are born again because you're the ones that needs it made simple I'm letting you think that thought over all right you say yeah but but it needs to be made simple to everybody we then you know what I try to make it simple to everybody but I'm just making a point what great thing or what what was it that triggered on the day of Pentecost when all they heard was a story that about a man dying and him being the Fulfillment of the scriptures they didn't have a background right come on get with me what my thought they didn't have any background right they hadn't heard a whole bunch of sermons The Disciples had heard him and they talked to the Lord Jesus they didn't know about Jesus Christ and salvation but when they heard a sermon they were pricked in their heart now one day we'll understand why the prophet of God would make it an emphatic or however how you say it definite thing to say that the seed has to come through the body right amen the seed has to come through the body amen and faith has to come by hearing right hearing how by the word all right now if that be true and we claim we believe it then could not a person be born again under the deepest teaching of the seals plagues vs trumpets anything marriage and divorce or whatever and then you'll understand why my brother brandham kept going on in the message deeper and deeper and deeper into the word and people were being converted right okay now are you listening yes see and I click off your computer about all the quotes and the things and listen to what I'm saying I know that offend somebody because you don't like to be told what to do but are you listening yes yes sir what simple sermon did the disciples preach that brought 3,000 people to the Lord and they only heard one sermon right how was it the Ethiopian unic he did have a little bit of an advantage because he was reading the Bible and we assume then that probably the 3,000 uh back there was in one way or the other in a religious point of hearing of God and maybe had heard about Jesus in some form or other but never met with him and all I'm just asking you a simple question what is deep that's right well I just don't understand it is that deep or is it because we don't have the understander amen inside of us or not now listen the people that heard the one message on the day of Pentecost they gave you a key to what happened there they were pricked in their heart that the scripture that's right now we ought to be able to understand why Jesus would say no man can come unto me I'll get to that after a while unless the father draws in amen is that scripture we quote them but do we you know and read them but do we really understand yes my brother D we believe in Salvation right sure we do right we do it's a blanket it's for everybody yes but we also know that everybody won't receive it it's not the fact that they don't hear it those that don't hear the gospel will have a greater opportunity at the day of judgment than those who have heard the gospel right you agree right because they will not have the responsibility only of their lives and their doings and the prophet said then they there'll be a people will be given eternal life that you know know nothing about Jesus Christ that's right I'm just asking you it's a simple thing because I know people have made one brother he made a point here and he preached a sermon one time and you know I enjoyed always did enjoyed his sermons but you know I thought he's trying to say something but I don't know what it is but any kept saying feed my sheep feed my sheep and they rocked home for about probably 5 years maybe and we were discussing something one day that he was getting on to me about something of being sadique and he said that's why I preach that message M I said oh about to feed the sheep he said yeah he said I wanted you to get off them deep things and feed my family now this happened SOC but you know what I thought then just like I do now why didn't he teach his family right if I was deep why didn't he teach his family right he was a minister why wasn't he teaching his family right I've try to teach my family the gospel but I just want to get that a point to you I want you to think about it cuz you think in the Bible I want you to read the Bible and when you're reading it think about it if it had not been for God quickening those people's heart about what was said on the day of Pentecost you know the the sermon of Peter and him then they would have been no 3,000 converted right so we look at it you know I like what brother Ram said one time he said I like for God to work on both ends you remember that work on both ends you know working on the person working on the person then you can see people can be saved if you're preaching the seals the plagues the vows the trumpets as you call the Deep things I wish we would get that away from our understanding if God doesn't Quicken anything there's no way for you to be saved anyway if God never chose you then you're not going to be chosen you say that's predestination without a choice no I've been preaching it God gives you a choice that's right but I want you to think on that maybe you'll get away from thinking about deep things and get around to thinking about simple things you know what deep things are to me is the most simple things there are in the world that that's what's deep right how that we were chosen in him he said I can't understand that you know why you can't understand it because it hasn't been made alive to you right it hasn't been quickened to you it hasn't been revealed to you it's a good quote you remember a few weeks or so ago and I talking about the Bible says we're just by being in Jesus Christ we're just as righteous as God is but has that been revealed or is that just a quote if it's a quote it's deep things if it's revealed I thought we believe that God was hidden and revealed were simp in simplicity so then ask for God to reveal to you what I'm talking about when I'm speaking to you or anyone else right because he doesn't reveal it we won't get to [Music] point but you just think about it you go back go back to the prophet's message go back to all the other and look at the things that he would be preaching and people come to the altar to be saved I'm tried my best to tell you what the prophet said one day that a preacher has nothing but a gift to be able to break Satan's spell over your eyes that God may be speaking can speak to you that's sure he must preach it correctly he must bring it correctly Etc we know that all right but all that I do is try to break that spell say ain't no spell on my eyes with you the one that's got it right simple you're the one that's got the spell over your eyes cuz you're missing the whole point this message was not brought to be uh deck things quotes and show how much intelligence we have and how we can out quote everybody else and how we can use the Great swelling word theop is and all of this that logos and and just make everybody think we know all about what we're talking about it was made to be revealed and lived that's right that's what it's made for that's right to be revealed to us that we could live it that's Simplicity all right so think on that now so then maybe it'll take away from the thoughts of people's mind that you know you need to preach simple things to the children you'd be surprised that these children are understanding sometimes better than you are that's right that's you want to get upset with me for talking like that go right ahead but if you get upset with me for saying it then you know for sure that you're the one I'm talking about it's not because their mind is so sharp it's because that they believe it you know children will believe what you say so be careful what you say to them they will believe it why can't we believe it see Faith truly then comes by hearing and hearing by the word right amen so then it order bring us to a place of understanding okay now I just that's been on my mind for quite a while of thinking and and I wanted to just get it off to the basis of getting understanding to you that we call things deep when it means it's simply not been revealed right when you say that's deep that means it's not been revealed to you is that simple enough but that hurts your feelings doesn't it well I'm sorry but truth is trth as I say again what great what great thing read the read the the the the book of Acts there where that before the Holy Ghost fell on the 3000 read it to me and give me a simple sermon out of it here's a man telling people about somebody they know nothing about probably a lot of them knew nothing about Jesus right you know it's not that they heard three years like the others they heard nothing nothing about Jesus see what you're making it is that we're to take the people and sit down and train them to be able to believe now that would do away with God's calling that would not be the father calling that would be you calling them with words and see then you you get offended at me for saying but I try to make it as simple as I possibly can because we've been doing this for 40 something years and I've been preaching and go back with Brother Ray and ask him and sit down and he can tell you where I was preaching this 20 years ago that's right CU he's taking them off and put them into where that you have the ability and if you want to go back and do it and like I've always said I I'd make the takes for two purposes one for you to take home and listen to and one for us to keep it where you come up and you say brother Dale you said so and so you changed your Doctrine I said show me that's right well I heard you I told a brother one day he said you said so I said no I didn't I said if I did my mind was out of it I didn't mean it that way but I said I don't think I said it yes he did I said well let's go get the tape we'll play the tape and see whether I said it or not well you know what that that generally kills people they don't want to cuz they want to go away thinking well I still believe he said it but I'm just not going to argue with him anymore he's sarcastic arguing and hateful ain't arguing and hateful I well go listen to the T see if I said if I did I come to the church repent all right see that's what we ought to be well all right now let's get into what we're talking about today now we've been we covered the last message that you know we were The Offspring of God as Paul said The Offspring of God you remember that now what is an offspring an offspring is in the natural is you are an offspring of your mother and father you know that you come into the world but in the spiritual you're your mother is God and your father is God so you're not dealing with that form you're dealing with whether or not you're born again CU if you're born again then you prove what you was and remember now what we're trying to do we're trying to stay back up I haven't brought it down to earth yet when we get to earth we'll start dealing with predestination for knowledges and you choosing and and all cuz I believe in never been of that there's a couple of quotes in here that I gave you where brother R said see you chose you call you you you know you accepted it you got to see we we run that in the ground where we say well brother brandom said no man sought god well what do you mean well I mean nobody sought him would you didn't cry and pray and seek God you didn't repent of your sins come on you didn't repent of your sins then you're not saved simple amen plain language you're not saved right cuz if you don't repent of your sins how could you have eternal life come on see we we think we know what we're talking about but then when it's faced by the word that someone does know what they're talking about then well I'm not going to argue ain't no argument to it right takes two side to argue you ain't got one that's being sarcastic no been true amen if you had to repented God wouldn't give you the Holy Ghost come on Amen on that but see he knew your choice right he knew You' choose him we'll get to that on down into to where we call it over into time but now we're trying to stay back before the Earth before the world to see whatever was back there or what went on or or you know whatever we're doing I'll tell you when we drop down to earth you remember we were talking about that we were The Offspring of God and we've been dealing with that we were chosen the scripture says in him and we read where Jesus said there in the gospels John 14 uh John 1516 you didn't choose me I chose you that's right before the world Jeremiah I chose you to be a prophet right before the world well did Jeremiah have anything to do with life he did actually got here but I've got a quote in here that we'll get to it in a minute where the Prophet said this that we're talking about was billions of trillions of trillions and millions of years before the world ever begun he said then how could you choose now that's simple that's as simple as anything could be he said how could you choose that's right well now what it is he saw my choice well I've done covered that and I'll go back to it again if he saw your choice then you chose right okay but if it was billions of billions of years ago you wasn't there to make a choice as a human mortal or being or whatever you had to be part of that eternal life amen and if you was not not part of that eternal life you never will be part of that eternal life see that's as simple as we've been trying to make it see but now our study is back DIY but what we're trying to cover is what was our existed or whatever happened before the world now the Lord willing maybe Wednesday night we'll get into where the Morning Star saying together and the sons of God shouted for Joy but just remember if that was a not a reality it never will happen on Earth because listen I'm giving you the key the same scripture that said he was crucified before the world is the same scripture that said you shout it okay that's right see that's simple but see know you want to make one this way and one that way no simple if it says it it says it we'll get to that in a minute cuz that's the point of want you don't get anything out of the whole day of one thing I want to drive the point to you and I that God's word is eternal and that his thoughts are Eternal and he can never have another thought and we've got to be those attributes if we're not those attributes we never will be the attributes right right that's all I want to tell you so if you missed the whole sleep to or whatever you turn off your computer and get upset with me and just go on I can't help it cuz I can't can't control you right all right now this is before we start our Earthly journey of anything whatsoever so now let's start out let's see what the scriptures the scripture there the prophet gave I mean the scripture we read said we were chosen in him now you remember what I've been trying to make the point it's not that we were chosen by him right that comes on over into life we were not chosen you know by him or anything like that because if it was that that deals over here but we were chosen in him right see then if we can find where we were at diary remember I kept asking the question in one service about it who's the hym the Bible said we were chosen in him who's the himy all right so we know and for sure and see it's the Christ right and that's how that we would be in Jesus Christ to walk the shores of Galilee right not as little bitty identities running around in the body but it to be in that eternal life that he had within him all right so now we know who the HM is it's Christ now who done the choosing we're not trinitarians we don't believe in two Gods but we believe God can show himself in many forms or many ways he can make himself manifest and what people don't want to believe is in how that one form of God can communicate with another form of God that's that's the hardest thing seemingly here to get across to you cuz you just what do you mean if there's a God here and a god there that's two of them you know no that's not you ever talk to yourself oh who are you talk to come on you talk to yourself like one brother said said only the time that I can figure I'm caring on an intelligent conversations when I'm talking to myself now talking to yourself you ever answer your own questions oh we're getting down where we live now that's how simple the gospel is now let me give you another one and we'll break it on down a little further okay now brother collie you believe you have eternal life don't you okay brother dick you believe you have eternal life do you ever talk to brother colie or brother colie ever talked to you what do you mean both of you got the same eternal life but you know you don't have all of it right so you know that within the other person is part of God Amen so you can talk to each other right amen that simple illustrations we're talking about almighty God not a peanut brain outfit that you and I used to think he was we're talking about the great Eternal that never had another thought he cannot have another thought he cannot think another thought you know in any way that would change any thought he had he never changes his mind he doesn't do anything like that well we got no you got the message too he didn't change his mind that's right he gave the man 15 years he didn't change his mind he knew he was going to give him that for a man ever asked for it and the man died cuz that's what he was told sit your house in order you'll die right and he did die right right after the 15 years amen see that's simple see we going to be far enough in the message now to be able to talk about these things and I'm telling you that that it's 40 something years of me preaching and God is unveiling now things to me that I had questions about for 40 something years and would not dare try to express what I believed because I did not see the end of it if I don't see the end of something then I I can't preach it to you because that means I don't understand it so I'll just wait but once I start on it and see it then you know for sure we're going somewhere if I didn't know the answer to two or three questions in this message I would just call in somebody have to let them preach and forget it but the Lord keeps unfolding it to me now listen the thoughts of God are Eternal can never have a new thought that's right amen can't change his mind amen can't say he was wrong cuz he never was his thoughts are Eternal that's why you've always heard me say what what is one of my favorite saying I don't want to be in the mind of God because everybody is in the mind of God Judas is car was in the mind of God the Bible spoke of him coming and the things happening before he got here but that doesn't make Judas Eternal right I don't want to be in the mind of God I like to think that he thought of me that's all right you know but I want to be a part of his mind that's right amen so when we're dealing with thoughts now remember the Bible I didn't bring these with me because you surely you should know it but what is it in Isaiah where he said my thoughts are not your thoughts my ways are not your ways my thoughts are so much beyond your thoughts until your thoughts in other words paraphrasing what I'm saying they're not even in considered brother kie preached that years about 30 something years ago he thinks I can't remember but I do he used to call it Thro I remember that I'm not making fun of his words I'm just telling you I can remember but now listen what about those thoughts well brother Dale you don't understand predestination and things it's just that that we were just in God's mind and he just thought of us now how can you bring eternal life that way come on you you you can't bring ET eternal life to a mortal being by your concept of that point you going to have change somewhere of you're thinking because you would only be dealing with what you know well I'm sure I'm glad I done something or didn't do something and God saved me then where's Abraham's unconditional Covenant why you just don't understand God knew Abraham would believe him I know that too but I know he gave him an unconditional Covenant and I know that he gave all the Seed of Abraham that same unconditional Covenant amen well then I'll just go out and live like the devil well then go ahead cuz you prove you're not a Seed of Abraham cuz Abraham done what God God knew what Abraham would do right and Abraham done it but he had a choice in doing it that's why when we get there there there's things in this life if we don't correct them here we're going to have to answer for them there it won't be a decision of whether we're going to heaven or not no it be the decision upon the basis of of rewards we don't have to stand before the white Throne judgment we sit on the Judgment seat judging the others but the Bible also speaks of a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad we don't make right here we got to answer some word that's right amen he said well then how's it unconditional well it's unconditional cuz he ain't going to send you to hell cuz you done but you're going to give an account all right now listen to what your Prophet had to say this is Page 150 of the church age book which is really soar in church age and brother Joe tries to give you this what I I do and and everything but you read the whole thing is read I'm going to give them to you until I finish this God I want you to to know brother random said these things I don't mean to just put it up here and it be something that you read it and didn't understand I want you to have in your possession then you can't argue the point you can't say I didn't have an opportunity so look what brother around said he's talking about his substance and things you know from Psalms 139 15- 16 about my substance was not hid from thee when I was made in secret and ciously WR in the lower parts of the earth th eyes did see my substance yet being unperfect and in thy book were all my members written which in continuance was fashioned were fashioned when as yet there was none of them now watch it that as I said was not written about Adam another words it this wasn't written about Adam right it was written about the spiritual seed it was written about the the ones who would receive eternal life am so it wasn't just written about Adam but you use an Adam as an example all right watch it was not written about Adam but it gives you the idea and knowledge that the thought was Dire in his mind and that thought was eternal and had to be expressed it had to be expressed so when Adam was formed to the dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thought Express and those Eternal thoughts were now manifested was there any way to change the situation of Adam no now we get to it where that you you've got to consider what I'm saying Adam didn't have a choice when Adam took a choice he felled right agree but he didn't have a choice how he got here amen he didn't have a choice of being what he was that's right because God started you that way that's right right he had to start it perfect and Adam had eternal life in his soul but now his body and spirit was not Eternal that's right but see Adam wasn't given a choice he never had a choice of whether he was going to have Eve or not come on see the eternal life was not on the basis of anything Adam would be doing or not doing it was on impartation from God he never had a choice about his wife he didn't get to choose God gave him a wife of God's choosing but knowing see we'll have to come back to these later when we get over on this sidey but knowing that they would fall once he gave them a choice so we better deal with that choice one of these days right God knew if he ever put man here even giving eternal life in the soul that they would fall right now you can argue about Eve all you want too I just tell you what I believe I believe she was in Adam and theop because that's what brother random said in theop is a soul so I believe Eve had eternal life in her soul right so you want to make I know the point you want to make Adam with some great something but Eve just just garbage can you no Perfect Right perfect but God knew she'd make a choice and then Adam would follow her choice and the fall would take place we'll get back to that but remember Adam was was not Eternal in body his body was a creation yes he only had eternal life in his soul that's blasphemous names read the prophet his body was not Eternal there's where the problem was right had there not been a fall which we know could not be because God had attributes in him right but had there not been a fall then it wouldn't have been a devil okay you know if it was going to be that there wasn't going to be no fou it wasn't going to be no devil there wasn't going to be no problems it would have just been there it was been Adam and Eve and all they had to do would just go to the tree of life and eat the tree of life and their bodies would have been made Eternal simple simple language simple point and they would have brought us here you can argue all you want to up and down they do in the message whether that would be spoken word children or where it would be by sex that we were brought or whatever you just argue all you want to ain't concerned about I just know for certain we didn't come that way that's right but had God brought us that way they would have not been a fall you go along with it that been no fall it would have been no devil it would have been no curse wouldn't have been no problem but God could not have displayed all of his attributes you say well how would it been some way we would have come then we would have all went to the tree of life and our bodies would have been made Eternal and everything would have been okay now you tell me that's not exactly what's taking place I want you to sit down and discuss that with me sometime that's exactly what's taking place we fail we came here but we come to Jesus Christ in the soul to make the the soul Eternal and then we're going to the tree of life which is the word which will eventually change these bodies so the ultimate end of of the way God's doing it don't make no difference he's going to bring it the way he wants all right but you see Adam and Eve beautiful but yet they sinned don't you know that was God's thought now don't you think that God knew that if he allowed us to come we would fall now here's one thing I want to get across to you but I'm I want to make sure you understand it this is one of the things I was covered with my wife yesterday I want to make sure you understand understand this you know the way brother Dale lives and what he believes your children know that you know I don't believe in living like a garbage can you've been around me you know that but don't you ever get in your mind adults especially cuz the children won't even ever get it there don't you adults ever get into your mind that you can't do wrong just because you're born again don't you do it cuz you're right in the devil's trap when you think you can't do wrong cuz you got the new birth you are lost in out of the word of God is the best way for me to say it now that don't justify us doing wrong I said it while ago there's going to be a judgment of Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad if we don't repent of them here we're going to face things that in the world to come amen not a choice of eternal life I keep saying that but the fact that we won't repent on this Earth but you see we we want to make it you listen to the preachers preach and they say oh bless God when you get that Holy Ghost there just no way for you to do wrong now show me that in the Bible that's right well you just don't believe in the Holy Ghost being able to keep you you better think things over right it would sound like that I would be saying that it doesn't matter what you do no I didn't say that you kids these kids understand me they know I'm not talking like that so it's adults that I'm talking to right see we are capable of sinning oh that the seed cannot sin that's the seed that's inside of there that's the new birth it can't sin but this body and spirit that I'm dwelling in can still do wrong you better keep it under subjection to the Holy Spirit that's within you cuz not you'll be running out here and saying it don't it don't bother me I'll go down to the beard store and get me some beer I'll go down to The Honky TS and hang around cuz it don't bother me now you lying hypocrite of a devil how much stronger can I make it that's right that's right don't ever get the idea that you can get by with anything that's right amen you better keep the idea of repenting amen brother randam said they said he said do you sin brother Ram he said every day now this his words well he didn't really mean that well you argue with God about it I'm just trying to make a point don't ever think this because you have eternal life that you can't make a mistake and do wrong don't think that you can't do wrong with the new birth inside of you that's right now the new birth inside of you will make you then repent yes when you do the wrong if not then the Holy Ghost is not there simple enough but it doesn't keep us from doing wrong we're human Mortals living in a world of mortality as you want to call it whatever I'm just trying to be straight and honest see to keep us from falling off into the wrong thing to think about it and to see that God really chose us back there thank you Jesus follow that thought of what I'm talking about don't go out and just do wrong and say Well it don't matter I'm Christian now you're lost you remember the man in the Hebrew series had a guy to go out and there wanted somebody to go get him some beer as a preacher and he quit you know he said if I was a Christian and I wouldn't be preach I wouldn't be doing this but brother Brown said it was his child that's right but he said he took him home because he couldn't Mar his name the man wouldn't repent so he had to go home amen the Bible says some men sins go before them and some follow after if we repent they go before us and hit the blood and they're gone but if they follow after us we're going to have to give an account somewhere not a decision of eternal life no but now listen my Point's always been if we have eternal life why wouldn't we want to be right why wouldn't we want to repent I mean what's wrong why wouldn't we want to be right that's what the people of the world look at us and they see the garbage can of this message the polygamy and the hookies and all kind of things that in the Mage all around but yet and that's what's going to bring the the the things down on us but I don't blame the government for closing out it like I've always told you you let me find one of you guilty of of molesting a child or doing something like that I'll be the one that take you to court and I know the quotes from brother brownon he wouldn't turn in them people that was Crooks and things he said that's not my job that's up to the law you want that quote don't you think he knew what was going on but there are some things that man wouldn't have put up with and neither will I amen because we're try to do honest to be straight now forgive me lost 30 minutes to 45 talking to you all right but now listen now we know for assurity that God's thoughts are Eternal all right now I just want to read that and go down to a little bit with you and just remember now what he thinks of is not necessarily Eternal right he thought of Judas he thought of Hitler he thought of everybody he thought of the the whole world he thought of all of the people Etc what would be it doesn't make it Eternal you must receive eternal life to have eternal life but remember now and we'll try to get this point in heavily the prophet said it's not not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God 154 Church age book I didn't give you that one but you ought to remember it he said it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God he said it's the seed our word right now who was it when he was talking about Jeremiah that I knew you and ordained you to be a prophet before the world gifts and callings are without repentance that's right but you know you can have gifts you could have all of the nine spiritual gifts and be lost that's right that's another thing people don't like for you to talk about well look at so they have gifts why do that matter gifts some colge or without you can have all the gifts and still be lost but you can't have the giver and be lost I don't I want the giver with the giver comes the gift but gifts without the giver is just a g can that's right amen I was called to preach before the world ever begun cuz that's a gift now there was a day when the man here you're looking at didn't believe that call but then I see what a call to the ministry is and it's not a rooster up in a tree cow her mama calls daddy scent businesses right well I just feel like ought to preach go sit down and listen for a while and find out what you're going to preach when you do preach that's what I told Wade right that's right y I told him I said don't you run with it you you sat down and wait till God runs you and he can't you can't run no further than you get up and go preach but the prophet of God said a man had volunteers himself God can't use him right now he didn't say God couldn't use him to make speed and get other people converted he didn't say that he just can't use him to bring the word you see why I around the message then they're not bringing the word that's just as plain as can be that's all right with me I'm not trying to make nothing out of it just be truthful Jeremiah was a man the gift was the prophet right right so what did God order name before the world the gift to stand there and condemn Israel but before the world has for let him know that Jeremiah would be the man right amen I want to preach one of these days I tried it about 30 years ago and it didn't go over I want to preach on the real you amen if I ever get to enough time I will yes and I tried it years ago and everybody went haywire with me about it you just back off and try to move on believe it but listen to what brother R goes on to say in this quote that we're talking about that was number one is going down to number two it's a little point on the side there 15 2 down through the centuries we could go we find a Moses a Jeremiah that's two in the Old Testament one one in new now to bring him to to TI the 2 two together in the middle excuse me with John and John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thought expressed in its season each one of them was the word now I just got to explaining it so if you have trouble with it go back and listen to what I said Jeremiah was a man but the gift to speak out against Israel was God's word it dwelt in a man and made a man and the word one but it's after he got here yes see the gifts and callings are without repentance there was no way that there was not going to be a Malachi 4 take place in the last days but there had to be a man on Earth could accept that choice and make his own and for God to use it but look what he says then we come to Jesus the Loos he was the perfect and complete thought expressed and he became known as the word that is what he is and forever will be now it says that he has chosen Us in him Jesus before the foundation of the world that means that we were right there with him in the mind and thoughts of God before the foundation of the world that gives an eternal quality to the elect you can't get away from it right but now in case somebody clicks onto this one had heard the other one we don't believe in Eternal Sinners we don't believe you come into the world with eternal life that's right as they're teaching in the message around the country you must receive eternal life that's right am if not Jesus Christ died in vain and they wouldn't no day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell there wouldn't be anything so we don't believe that we believe you must receive eternal life but the eternal life that you receive never had a beginning and never had an ending that's right amen and if you receive it here then there's one thing about it you're part of it back there amen amen if you don't get it here you wouldn't have part of it back there you could be impartations you can do all kind of things you see that gives an ET Eternal quality to you and I makes us to realize that God did really love us desire us to walk with us amen because we were a part of him remember we kept stressing that point we were part of him now what does it mean to be an offspring you remember we covered that what does it mean to be an offspring that say want to go an offspring is God in another form we're not talking about Mom and Daddy having children an offspring of God is God in another form because how else you going to keep your truth about the the true Oneness of the Bible that's right well you're just a Oneness well okay let's see you bring it together I'll be glad to discuss it with you than that's open to anyone if there just one God if there is just one eternal life and that eternal life now dwells in you that eternal life was in God before the world so that's what he chose an offspring is God in another form Jesus we get the scripture Jesus was an I mean the quot the pro Jesus was an offspring of God what he was God in another form called a son who are we the life form of God to the Gentile dispensation is the Bride of Jesus Christ right we are his offspring we're his children yes and a child of God see we look at a child of God like we look at our own children it took me and my wife to get the kids here God didn't have no help to get to bring himself here that's why it's different right on the day of Pentecost he divided himself but see God is the only one that can divide himself and still still be completely God Amen there's no way a human mortal can comprehend that right brother Mo said you take and try to describe you know that the parts of and you take an apple and you cut it up you give it out you run out of apple but God on the day of Pentecost gave 120 eternal life that didn't make him no less God that's right he gave 3,000 at the next time that didn't make him no less God how many millions of him has been down through the time from the day Pentecost of 2,000 years that don't make him no less you know what that makes him greater the more he gives away the greater he gets like I've always told you eternal life is the only thing I want to give away you said give away your eternal life I wish I could I want to give somebody that eternal life that I have within me that's why I preach the gospel cuz the only way I can impart is not go out and lay hands on the only way I can impart is to preach the truth and let you see that truth as I was trying to say a while too and then you get converted you get pricked in your heart you get condemned in your heart and you go to God because you heard the word amen then the seed is really coming through the body but it gives an eternal quality to the elect look on down at the next one 284 which is still Church age book but this is already in church age he's talking about the record the book of eternal life for that is another book though contain in The Book of Life all right do you understand what he saying I put a word right here there's not two books there's not the book of life and the Book of eternal life it's one book but it's sections of that book now he explains this in the church age book and he explains it on the um inter Veil oh no excuse me do I'll get it in a minute it'll click but he explains it it's not two books it's two sections of one book invisible Union about of Christ see it's two sections you have a section of life there's actually four I ain't got time to cover there's four qualifications goes in there but there's a section in there that's just the book of life which is life right and all names will be placed in that book of life amen because when you come into the world your name was put in the book right but there's a difference between that and the Lamb's Book of Life section but the reason this one book is because when you started in the world you know where you started you started with your name in the book now go to the invisible Union see if I'm not right you started with your name in The Book of Life as a human mortal yes when you received the new birth your name is transferred the prophet said to the Lamb's Book of Life you say that's adding new words no that's just a record down here just a record down here are you following me yes see now you understand the book see it's the Bible this this is The Book of Life yes yes now in this Book of Life there a lot of Records about people that that lived in this world and they're going to be the records here of a lot of people going to die and go to hell because that their names were here and they were part of this and different things that's right but then in here is the bride of Christ amen which is eternal life that's right right here in this book which is the Bible that's what this was what was in the hand of the one sitting on the throne that's right the prophet are called in a book of names this is a book of names Peter James John Paul but it's also a record of their life all right you you you following with me now it's simple when you understand so look what he saying now this is the record God hath given us eternal life and this life is in his son he that hath the son hath life he puts Eternal par and he that hath not the son hath not life eternal in par and those who have that life were in him before the foundation of the world they were chosen in him him before the foundation of the world the great Royal seed Jesus Christ was planted Now where's he coming down to where he was at on Earth cuz we were in him he was planted he died and that life that was in him came up through the wheat plant which is the church ages all and is reproducing itself in multitudes of wheat seed having the same life in them and being like the original because by Spirit they are original by Spirit we're original by the new birth we're original that's the real you is the new birth amen but now follow me we were chosen in him not just chosen of him because of something you done not chosen by him because of him seeing that you would want it and he would choose you that way we're back before the world that's right we're back there when there's a lot of things going on that you and I before we heard this prophet's message we didn't know what was going on in Earth let alone what's going on in heaven you agree oh we thought we did sure we we believe you know we do the best we could do oh yeah but he come to expound the scriptures to open the scriptures to open our understanding of God's word right that God could reveal it so look that on the next one this is the message of Israel and the church which is part one or number one 19th 53 325 which is paragraph 56 now watch according amen now here it is I hope it really I'm going to let it soak in right real good cause cause it's so good it might go Plum into the bones you know according as he had chosen Us in him who did I heard it and I come now what' he say no no you never all right see he's before the world he's not down here where we're at he's before the world you remember a prophet is speaking the mind of God right he is not speaking a human mortal mind that's right he is telling us what's in God's mind cuz he's the only one can go back there and get it that's who did it I heard it and I come no no you never he hath chosen hath past tense has chosen us the church in him how long ago oh last week or when you heard the Revival no before the foundation of the world now can now you can ride on the cloud see he's done what he chose us in him Christ before the foundation of the world Amen all right questions and answers on Genesis 1953 7:29 paragraph 61 now the first man now he made the first man in His image and we're returning back to that image that's right to our first creation image now what is our first created image if we're returning it back it would have to be back there we're going to get into redeeming this when we we finally get to the point when God created me William Brown I was before the foundation of the world he made my being my spirit I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of but the I was dark oh I I don't believe you're getting it but now just a minute Jesus told the disciples that he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world now there were some part of me Arman Neville and the rest of you all that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever begun and here is to my analysis is of that it's all right where were we at we was in Christ now as I tried to explain it in many times and and expressing it and trying to get better words to do I I said I was trying these on my wife she gave me some better words to say so I try to use them but we know the first thing that come out of God was God in another form called a son what else you going to call it a son is Offspring a son is a product of his father Yes but in spiritual terms you would have a trinity if you wouldn't careful but in spiritual terms a Son of God is God in another form amen whether it be back there in Jesus or be in you right it's God in another form that's right all right but you see then we look back there and we see him and run around said a little Halo of light goes out comes over and said he begins to say Let There Be and he said who is that he said it's the Son of God even your Scholars called it that go back in your Bible and read it in Genesis cuz they knew my Lord if he seen anything what else would it be so would it be the man looking down in the fiery furnace and and Nebuchadnezzar wouldn't it whatever it was throw him in and said we we see we throw three in and said we look down in there fourth and said he's like the Son of God why because if he was protecting them every who was in there was protecting them from being burnt right so it had to be God and if it's God it had to be in another form if you could see it so then what are we talking about we're talking about the Simplicity of understanding that when he stepped over into that form the prophet will call it the word he'll call it the theophany he called it a part of God God in another form which is a part of God now there Earth where a human mind goes into gears and we need to click it off and listen see we say a part of God right well I no no no no that was all of God that's all God going to reveal right that's where people don't understand me and the way I preach that's why brother R could say on the River Jordan he became the fullness of the godhead bodily he didn't say he wasn't born God it was just part of God hadn't been made manifest right see when he stepped over into that form and begin to say Let There be all right now brother brand says if we wouldn't there then in him right then we'll never be there with eternal life cuz that's what stepped over there was eternal life it's just a story it's a way of expressing things right but brother randam then would say and I don't mind covering it with you he said who this meled he said see we byass the the offy and come over to human to to die and be a sinner how do we bypass it 285 goes around Atlanta you know that's good terms Ain it no we just never come that way cuz he stood there as part of God right called a son we wasn't standing all around there looking like him we wasin him we are part of God that was in him that was all of God for what he going to reveal that's right that's why people don't follow me I can look back and see God coming down condescending and still see my heavenly father setting up there in glory amen calling me that has eternal life down here that's where you don't understand the God here let me say something to you what are the attributes of God father son Holy Ghost right three attributes but we talk about attributes being savior healer Etc do you know that when he stepped over in that form that would be called a son that made him a father now listen to what I'm saying I didn't think I'd bring it but I got to get it now what is the attribute of a father what is the attribute called father you're automatically when you're you're you're dealing with attributes what is it healer savior Redeemer EXC Etc but where did Brother ROM ever cover the attribute of a father I want you to bring it CU you see he was already a father that's right father is one of his attributes right that's right when he created that logos theop what all those words are that part of God that form and stepped over he was a father could communicate back with him say let us brother around said father and son and you can do what you want to with it that's what he said he said word and spirit said let us make man in our image you know that when he created Adam in the Garden that made him father right and you see we're going a long ways but Adam and the garden never made him the father he wanted to be right I want you to Coast there a little bit made him father you remember the prophet saying that he was God but said he wasn't God he said cuz he was nothing to worship him he said he made angels and they worshiped him that made him God see we We Roll on that but now roll with me on father where is the attribute of father he created Adam and that made him a father that's right but that was not the father he wanted to be right he created a logos the form and stood there but that was that was the greatest of all and would ever be but that was not what he wanted to be got a long way to go I'm going to leave that cuz that way if you want to run off and just do all you want to with it then you can do it I'll come back to it but just remember Adam never made him the father he wanted to be right and brother brandom if he had made one statement you and I would be in terrible shape yes he said he's the son of man that's the only way he can be the father that's right okay we're going somewhere makes you more Curious maybe and thinking make you listen look go the next one the believer's position in Christ 55 uh 116a according as he has as he God has chosen us not my desire not your desire wasn't Paul's desire but he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world do you think of that he chose us in him before the foundation of the world that we why did you Cho us watch the rest of we Ain got no time to get to this we will eventually but that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love is what the rest of the scripture say that's why he chose us back there how would it do any good for him to choose down here and us be holy we're not holy right right right where's your Holiness but he chose us before the world that we may be holy says not cause I lived right because he chose me to be that way that's right he done it not it goes on continuing now now back there before the foundation of the world God chose you in Christ Jesus to appear holy at the end time all the way from the foundation of the world you see it all right let me find one in here I want to make sure and put it on this this message oh excuse me a minute okay flip over and get number 11 brother Joe it will be um he's got the numbers find he'll find it quicker than I can questions and answers 1959 1223 he done got it up there all right read all the way down to the positions you are and that God placed you and the IR filled people and in the coming down to bring you to a me bring you a message and all the things but then look at the scriptures according as he had chosen us and he hath he has chosen us now we didn't choose how could I choose him listen to it 400 billion million billion trillion years ago how could I have chose him right now he's asking a simple question how could I chose him but he chose me all right we're back up to there and covered this evening I just wanted to bring that one out cuz we got to quit here in a minute but listen let me get one more where you won't leave you danging let's go to uh let's let's go to number six the position of a believer in Christ 1955 227 a which is paragraph e44 all right come back friends come back to the love of God don't go after every wind of Doctrine and jumping here and there now listen and every time a little something flies up run away from the church and go over here and over here it's just Cults jumping up now you better read that off I don't like it I just go somewhere okay I don't say that they're they're wrong speaking but yet they're their hungry children hungry hearted children he wasn't throwing off on them right he said it Formed Cults and done this that and the other but he said they're hungry children you know he made a statement one day time is outstanding to me he said children would eat out of a garbage can he said he got to to live now youin talking about natural right right exactly right okay so what do we need all get to get together somewhere and come together and set in Heavenly places and get back to God then God will go to working with you watch sitting in Heavenly places according to third verse coming on this morning he chosen Us in him according as he has chosen Us in him our him choosing Us in him and read according as he ha chosen Us in him are him choosing Us in him who done the choosing God did you didn't I didn't God did you haven't chose me but I have chose you said Jesus look according as he has chosen Us in him how chosen us the elect now the ones that's in Christ Jesus he chose us in him when yesterday the day before listen the scripture before the foundation of the world I'm surely not reading that wrong that's the way it reads here in the King James version God CH you in Christ before the foundation of the world was ever laid then if God knew that what you scared about if God knew way back before the foundation of the world to choose you in Christ Jesus and you come in and accepted the call what you scared about what's the matter sisters he can heal he can say you come and accepted the call I this over here right so the prophet never left us dangling chosen in him just listen to that little tug in your heart right yeah but brother I have so many troubles I have so many problems I need to quit this I need to quit that I ain't never preached nothing like that and I never will I'll never preach you quit doing things wrong and God will save you cuz there is no scripture that is our Holy Ghost righteousness of our own we think I didn't drink I didn't do now like oh oh really so and so or sister so and so I I've been good all my life and God chose me now you are in a garbage can of Satan's delusion that's why it doesn't bother me to preach to people that'll come to me and tell me brother Dale I've been married before I've had all these problems I've been this I've been in adultery I've been in all kind of things I believe in Deliverance amen I don't believe in going on and doing it after you see the truth no but I believe in Deliverance I believe in Salvation amen but see we think we was just maybe and that's what a lot of people say they I'm just not good enough to be saved no sir I agree with you 100% that's there's never been a mortal in the world good enough to be saved there was Jesus Christ died in vain but why can't we accept what he done for us right and believe it why can't we look at it then and see that he chose me back there you said but Brother D I don't have that eternal life dwelling in me all right that's the thing you need that's right well how do I get it by believing God's word and you may do it in 5 minutes or you may do it in 5 years that's between you and God right but you see we got all of the things that we think that we were this and we were that I'm trying to tell you that eternal life the prophet was speaking of was a part of God and he imparts that to you and I and gives us eternal life then we're part of God we're an offspring of God we're a child of God which means we're God in another form right what El are you well don't Brother D I'm just a child of God you're making it too big I'm not making it big enough right he chose it this way he knew there was going to be a fall but he knew he was going to have children amen why because they were a part of it that's right you better think about what I said about father because healer savior Redeemer and all is just bringing you back that's right paying a price but if he wasn't my father why do you think brother random would make this statement I didn't give it to you now but he said Jesus never came to give me an inheritance you remember that he said he came to redeem me to my inheritance he said my inheritance was eternal life with the father before the world that's my inheritance eternal life well then you know maybe I was born with eternal life I don't believe that I don't even believe Adam was born with eternal life I've preached it to you Adam was standing in the garden living moving human being wrote around and said BL see his name and God breathed into his nostrils your breath of eternal life go read the book that's right amen why cuz if it had it would have been God standing there it wouldn't have been Adam that's right see Adam was created Body Spirit and soul of man right and then God breathe into him eternal life or else he would have been God standing there wouldn't have been Adam sech We Are The Offspring of God the prophet said that the full the the that godhead was not complete without you if you're a part of God how can God be complete without you come on Brothers think on these things eternal life a possession that we can have you said but if you could just make it simple enough I could get saved what else can I say then what the Bible says repent everyone and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost it didn't say you get it to minute is baptized it didn't make that statement it said ye shall that's right which could be years later but it don't have to be it can be that very minute if you believe it right if God is tugging at your heart don't turn down that Brother D I just feel condemned that's God tugging at your heart right then they say God forgive me come and save me yes and you know what this is what a lot of people don't like see then after you to be a Christian after you're filled with the Holy Ghost you're still have that longing in your heart and you still want to say God forgive me and help me and Lead me there's not a day passes that I don't pray God forgive me Lead Me Lord help me guide me give me what for the people let me walk in you back on next anybody have a need I all while I sing and at Jesus I am freest is Joy unable and full of GL love of GL you feeling T your heart oh if he ever get the word and he not Jing in my heart I'm worried it never stops I never stop because the eternal life that I now have part of God before the world is now as a part of God living in me making me a Son of God is not another person God made manifest in another form the least member of the body of Jesus Christ had within him the omnipotent almighty God the very person of almighty God that existed before the world before anything ever come now living in your heart and he can give everybody in the world today 7 billion people or more today he can give everybody the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then make him no less God and make him that much greater you can't explain that you know what every Born Again believer has quoting brother around the person of Jesus Christ Living in you the baptism of the Holy Ghost explain that can't be but I believe it I believe it I thank God for it brother oh his Jo and of Glory of that to one another servic and full of Glory Full Of Glory Full Of Glory it is Jo unspeakable and full of Glory over the half has never
