we'll have to change it cuz we'll be going the first one uh now remember they have announced too and I think they read the names off for the ones that's expected to be here this coming Saturday to put all that swing sets together and everything that we've got we want to get them together where the kids can start playing but just because your name wouldn't on there don't mean you can't come and help cuz you ought to or what we'll probably do is if you don't come and help we'll just have a little payment plan that you can you know put the money in the pot to pay for the dinners and the foods and the doings of the ones that does come and work we'll let you help that away if you want to do that okay all right Matthew 5:37 but let your conversation be yay yay nay nay for whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil you have heard that it ha been said an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth but I say unto you that you resist not evil but whosoever shall smite thee on the right cheek turn to him the other also and if any man will sue thee at the law and take away thy coat let him have thy cloak also and whosoever shall compel thee to go mile go with him Twain give to him that asketh thee and from him that would Bor of thee turn not thou away now remember the background behind this is the Beatitudes right blessed is he that this blessed is he that this blessed is he that this now you've turned to the what would be called a similitude or another words God's life he's explaining what he's his way of doing things all right the other was blessings now it's explaining his way of doing things that we ought to want to do and to follow after him all right you have heard that it has been said Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy but I say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh the son to rise on the evil and on the good and send us reain on the just and the unjust for if we love them which love for if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same M and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the Publican Soul be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect other words if we don't follow that lineup that he's giving of what we're reading then let's don't claim Perfection right or being perfect okay now we go to Colossians 1 we'll start reading verse 26 even the mystery which hath been hid from the ages and generation but now is made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that you may that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now I chose to give you the quotes this morning to go along with the reading because that way you can go home and you know read them and study these things and remember the background now I I didn't I told him not to place it within this series but of you know we were talking be therefore perfect where Jesus said it there Matthew 5:48 and a lot of people has argued with that you know that means this that means that that means that didn't mean this didn't mean that well what are you worried about it means just what it said whatever you want to clarify it to be it means just what it says be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect all right you say well it's impossible for a human being to be that I agree with you but now God required it so now what are you going to do whether you and I can argue or fuss over what what words mean is one thing but when God requires something it must be met and if it's not met then where are we see we can try to make this make excuses excuses won't be no good it takes the word and that's why I place in between here thought this past Wednesday of talking about how that God's word says it and if God says it in his word that's his promise amen we can take him at his word we can believe what he said and he will make it manifest because he's God all right now so let's get on back now to our thought that remember what we were covering before we left to go to Kansas hunting and we had a real good time out there with the with the brothers and sisters in the wit church and also in the Bartlesville Church bville Oklahoma and preaching for them and W preaching for them really really had a good time we had a good time hunting more less relaxed and and everything a little bit and I shot me a deer early and decided to take a few days off you know and relax a little so I was able to listen to tapes and walk and pray and do everything I wanted to do you know and that's a rare occasion for me so you know I didn't get much of a deer but I did go back and get some pictures then wait trying to find a one to get the pictures of you know so we had fun it was all right amen all those Saints out there send their love unto you but now remember what we were talking about they said we've been on the topic or titled be therefore Perfect all right now if God required that to be and that's what he said he didn't say maybe you can hopefully you can or whatever you can well there we're all just human we can't be perfect I agree with you no problems right but when God requires something he must make a way that's right for that to be fulfilled right now he didn't have any trouble as we've covered with you he didn't have any trouble in in Genesis 6 there verse 9 saying that Noah was perfect right I didn't have any trouble with saying that he didn't have any trouble there when we were talking about Job 1 which he actually does it three times in the Book of Job he said job was perfect amen he didn't have any trouble with saying it well no that's exactly what the three guys that came you know were job's comforters condemners instead of comforter they stayed with him probably looked like for days and days trying to as best to tell him he was a secret Sinner and see he kept saying I've made the atonement God said he was perfect he told Abraham there in Genesis 171 said walk before me and be thou perfect now that was into the Old Testament under the blood of Jesus Christ right now what would be the problem if God could say A man was perfect under the blood of of bulls and goats because he made the atonement right he offered what God Said God made a requirement he offered it and God said he was perfect all right now and like I told you every Israelite that took a lamb up throw it down walked off said sacrifice that to me I'll go do what I'm going to do now that wouldn't so I never have believed that now I know the whole covering of the original atonement that was made once a year would cover Israel as a whole as a nation yes I understand that but an individual making a sacrifice if it wasn't sincerity then God didn't accept his sacrifice and you better believe that if Aaron wasn't sincere I don't believe he'd went behind the veil to you when it meant death if he went there without a sincerity so it's not every little person everything that's done it was done on the basis of an honest and a contrite heart right sincerity of the individual and God would forgive the others he didn't have to forgive because they were not sincere all right now what's the difference in that in the blood of Jesus Christ I thought we had to believe that Jesus Christ died in our place but then not just go out and say Well it don't make no difference I just going to live like the devil because once saved always saved well I didn't believe that and I was in the badst I'm just honest where I talk I'm sorry I didn't believe it then don't believe it now I don't believe you go out and live like the devil if you live like the devil that's who you are brother boll's got a good point he said if you see a hole and you see a fox tail sticking out of the hole you know what it's a pretty good sign there a fox in there so if you go out and live like the devil that's a good sign you're the devil then we come up well I just can't help being what I am well maybe we need to do a lot more praying right it certainly is not God's fault well he made me this way no he didn't right amen we made ourselves that way right wasn't him all right so now we talk about what is it to be perfect and if I keep going over this in the message today you forgive me because this is what's on my heart if we don't sincerely believe that Jesus Christ died in our place that's right right then there's no need of talking about perfect imperfect what perfects that's right amen No need no need of talking about anything if you can't believe that Jesus Christ died for you that's right well I believe he died for everybody else like the Israelites would say well I've seen it I've seen him forgive that person but it just probably wouldn't forgiven me well you just don't believe it right God made the way we do what he said we're perfect that's right right see that's what we don't think about see but like I said I seen a sign one day said I'm not perfect but I'm forgiven well now according to my Bible that if God forgives you that's right it is placed into the sea of his forgetfulness never right to be remembered again right that's what I thought the Bible said amen so then you say well it's impossible right it's impossible for you and I can we do wrong every day that's why we must have the atonement right amen even though you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul they're still in atonement the Bible calls it an advocate right Jesus Christ the righteous who's making intercession Upon My Confession that's right amen so if I say that I'm saved I'm saved if I say that I'm lost what happened right he has to intercede upon what I say that's right if you said in the Old Testament you didn't believe that business about the lamb it didn't do you any good that's right but if you believed it he could take your place all right so now what are we basing upon now with that behind us to the point of what we've been trying to bring out you remember the last message I preached I asked the question I said what is the difference in the word perfect or the word Perfection now what's the difference in saying perfect or Perfection I'll let you think on that a while as I said even to the Old Testament people under the blood of Jesus Christ he would call him Perfect Right bam tried his best to curse Israel remember and God says I don't see it bam come back to B every which way it goes there and he says right I think curse him he said look at the hinder the worst part I can't see it right because God wouldn't let him see it right right he was a prophet even though he was false what he said is written in this Bible right Bam's prophecy right is written in the word of God but yet he couldn't curse Israel because he couldn't see the atonement that was made amen he could see what they were doing and couldn't comprehend why God wouldn't condem them but yet when he was looking at it he couldn't see what they were doing cuz he couldn't curse right now if they were that why are we concerned with about it today and even I showed you in the messages prior or tried to show you on the point that the word used for perfect in the Old Testament for Noah is the same word used in the New Testament which is a rarity because most of the time you will change between the old and the new right but the word perfect in the Old Testament holds the basic meaning of being complete a full age mature all right see then when you turn over to the New Testament of of Matthew 5:48 that we read you'll find there and we'll use some of them this afternoon you'll find there that that word is of the same basic meaning amen complete perfect bringing something to an end all right now so let's think about it if God said you make the atonement I'll take care of the situation yep as long as you meet the requirement with an honest and a sincere heart right emphasize that right right honest and a sincere heart make the atonement God took care of it right amen pushed all of that sin to Calvary where Christ could die once for all amen all right now why would we have any trouble believing it that under the New Testament form as we would call it or under the baptism of the Holy Ghost living in us why would we have trouble with saying that we're perfect see like I said we read a sign and said I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven the devil looks at you last y preachers look at that in glory I never thought of that well I never thought of that way you know why cuz if you're forgiven how can you use any word there that can be applied to you exactly amen right right that's right if you're forgiven right God can never remember anything you put under the blood than you know that even you're Prophet would stand there with discernment that's right and he couldn't bring out from under the blood something you'd put under the blood and tell tell that person about their lives that something had been put under the blood now that's the way he said it amen he said it was so covered it could not be brought out right why would we worry about it but you see that Old Testament person had to have faith that's it a revelation from God yes to his heart that he was forgiven and he went out and with a sincere heart and a humbleness thanking God for the Forgiveness y why would we even think about it if we believe we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth whatever you want to call it then how could sin be imputed to that new birth are you going to make God a sinner right Yen right right now I'm talking about the soul of the individual our human bodies we still have problems in our spirit we still have troubles but in the soul of an individual that is born again that is a higher state than the Old Testament Saint because the Old Testament Saint could not have the new birth right right amen that's right but if his faith in believing what God said to do and he went and done it with a sincere heart if that would make him perfect what about the blood of Jesus Christ that's right amen but see then we try to figure out all the words well it really means this it really means that we try to to satisfy our ego by bring some kind of a way and the people just sat there well I've never seen that that word perfect means complete well I'm going to ask you this over and over and over through that message today can you add anything to perfect right I just say again is there anything that can be added to perfect if there is it's not perfect that's right simple everybody said brother they preaching so deep we don't understand no I talk so simple until your brain won't comprehend what I'm talking about it takes a new birth right right but can anything be added to perfect but now we'll see this afternoon more that perfect can be added to Perfect Right amen that's right right if it's a same source which statue of perfect man you get to it we eventually we get there add to your faith bir knowledge God Etc right perfect can be added to perfect but it's got to be of the same s that's right right amen all right so I know I've been through these but I want to go back through them I want to make sure you understand what I'm saying it's up to God to reveal it to you see in God's eyes a perfect a person in God's eyes now that's what I'm saying job read the book of Job he had three guys that came and spent a whole time with him days condemning him condemning him condemning him saying he was a sinner he kept saying I made the atonement I've done what God required amen what else can I do well you're a secret sinner but listen in God's eyes job was perfect that's right that's right yes sir and you know what I don't give a hoot what anybody else thinks about right is that blunt enough whether it be the devil or you I don't care you think job cared what his comforter said the fourth man which was El you which is type of Christ come and he said now job you're right in what you said you offered your at but said you're just a tad bit self-righteous now that's the way you're Prophet had to say about job he said you're a tad bit self-righteous but said you're right what you said y see in God's eyes when they made that atonement God's eyes was cut off because the bumper blood of the Lamb was placed over the people y right all right now if we can have that much Faith as it said a moment ago in that blood of a blood of bulls and goat being a bumper what about the blood of Jesus Christ right amen until your Prophet would say there is no such thing as a sinner today he said well the world's full of them God don't see him right he can't see it cuz he have to kill a person that's right am that sensible so he doesn't see it because of the blood atonement that he made now in God's eyes see then you can be perfect right but everybody else remembers and you do too I do too we remember what we done and see we still start dealing with what we doing what we doing cuz that's what the devil keeps bringing up like I always tell you the Devil comes to tell you what you're done or even what you're doing NE way just remind of him of what's going to happen to him right right you tell him what's going to happen to himen you know what I don't mind telling him like this the devil I may die and go to hell with you but Bud you got problem because you're one a day going to be annihilated I don't mind talking like that to it remind him of what he's going to get that's right amen but see there's never been anybody perfect it's got to be in the eyes of the one who SE SE it right I was thinking the other day about it on the Statue of perfect man a little bit and it's just I know I think carnal I'm sorry but sometimes they're pretty good thoughts I like them but what I was thinking about you know that a child a child You' be the ugliest person in the world and little old baby just loves you right now come on I mean it doesn't matter if you got warts all over your face and Knots all over or whatever you are and no ha no teeth whatever it is and little grandkids would just love Grandma Grandpa you know why cuz they're not looking at what you are out here they're looking at your character children babies can read a char character and us adults only read faces right right we only look at what we see and condemned by what we see and a child you pick it up and spank it in just a few minutes It'll come to hug your neck you spank an adult they run out the door and slam it going out you know yeah right other words leave the church Plain language right you want to be corrected that's right mhm a child looks at character we look at natural things right we got our little feelings hurt and we sour up well one of these days that'll all be over with we have to worry about it it won't be no soured up in heaven that's right and I was thinking yesterday there won't be no coffee pots Brother Don won't be making us no coffee in heaven he used to come here and make the coffee for us and have it ready on Sunday morning you know we all laugh about it he ain't going to make us no coffee CU ain't going to be no coffee pots in heaven you ain't going to need no kick up there to get rid of your morning hangover headaches and stuff it just won't be there all right maybe we won't be there but all right now let's review a little bit and I know you'll say well you just go hatching over this well I'm hatching over it for a purpose amen because now this morning I'm trying to get the defition to you of perfect this afternoon we'll get the definition of perfection all right see then we'll see what it what what the the wording means all right now let's read a few the prophet had to say and I just gave them to you like I said you can take them back home most of these you've already had them but let's go back over them okay go ahead brother Joe with number one on the Lamb's Book of Life paragraph e35 and I give you these cuz I want you to know what your Prophet had to say andan I can get up here and run off a run you know boy bless God he told us what the prophet said and I might not have told you a thing he said so I like to read it to you then you can't argue with me I like to read you the Bible you can't argue with the Bible That's so let's just look at it you know how we do it a lot of times we don't read the whole thing CU you go back and read the whole part he's talking about how under the worshipper of the Old Testament came up under a shadow and all and watch could never be made perfect M he said well you just got through saying that all them people was perfect the prophet just said they could never be perfect they could never come to completion so you going to have to break down the word perfect this morning right now for years in the denominations you used it as saying that that word perfect in Matthew 5:48 does not mean a perfect life it means a growth development well if you don't have a perfect life as to perfect in Christ there cannot be a growth development is that straight enough right so now we're going to have to erase all all of our old thinking and it won't be done this morning I'll have to repeat it 50 times for it to be raised for most of you you know why cuz it has to be to me too well I don't understand what you're talking about now you don't want to understand what I'm talking about see what we thought the word meant we swore by it right right we swore by the Trinity it was in the Bible we swore by eternal hell it was in the Bible we swore that there's nobody perfect in the Bible see now we're going to have to lay down all that junk right right and I call it junk because it's what it is it's what we used to think cuz the Bible don't teach no Trinity no right amen teaches one true and living God am and not just God in three person Blessed Trinity that's Catholic Church as much as three literal gods or whatever you want to do with it that's right the Bible don't teach an eternal hell cuz it did then everybody would have to have eternal life to go to hell and live in hell eternally then that would be God's life in hell so that solves that problem right right you see where those doctrines we swore by you know what it took a long time to beat it out of us that's right now maybe we got some more that we've adopted on our own that we need to be beat out ofs well you ain't a preacher like these other preachers I like you to get up there and go with it but yeah when you get to you don't know what in the world of man say it right I'm not against that type of preaching right I'm just me first of years coming up what you another Pastor I'm just me see because I want you to see what the prophet said right then you can make your choice the Bible says you make a choice right well brother D I believe I'm perfect how do you believe you're perfect by being in Jesus Christ amen that's right amen but is that a revelation or a quote right which one is it do you know know that by being in Jesus Christ you're just as righteous as God is the Bible say but do we really believe that that's right do we really believe that right is that a revelation or quote quot kill Revelation set you free I thought that's what Paul said when he said the letter kill it y but the spirit gives life do we really believe that brother randam was the prophet sent from God right amen and what he said did not change the Bible cuz he'd be a false prophet if he changed the Bible we don't believe that amen that's right we don't believe brother around was God we don't believe none of the junk it's around Dimension that's right but we believe God according to Malachi 4 Luke 17:30 Revelations 10:7 and all those scriptures was to send in the end time a prophet Amen to speak to us the word not to interpret the word as saying that don't really mean that that means this it didn't he said it means exactly what it said but see our carnal mind has interpreted it so long to us right by mankind teaching our minds until we wound up self-interpreting the word putting our own thoughts to the word and it don't matter what anybody says that's what the pH with us when Jesus right you know that they could tell you they could take a scroll they say and roll it up and put a pen through you and they could tell whatever the letter it went that pen would go through because they read it so much but when the god of the word stood before them what did they do they crucified him that's right come on is that right right when he said before Abraham was I well you ain't even 50 years old yeah that's what Moses is our prophet he said Moses wrote a man amen that's right you think they believe that no but see Church let's just settle down and and think about what is being said to us yes Lord what does it mean to be perfect what does that word mean to you when perfect you cannot add anything to perfect that's right if you do it's not perfect see then you must add perfect to perfect see that's why we read that there where in Matthew where it says let your words be yay yay and nay nay called anything else beside that is what sin right well I think it means that's exactly what he said that's what got this thing started right well I don't have to depend on you you don't have to depend on nothing but you got to depend on God Amen and if God send us away you better follow the way if you don't then forget it if I was going to believe this prophet's message I'd just go join some of these Cults and forget it that's right come they be just good of one with the other one right as some of these brothers about this LOD you can go to and they'll take the lay out the statue of a perfect man that on the floor and teach you the seven steps of their staircase lecture right and if you don't qualify you don't move up the ranks is that right Brothers you don't move up the ranks do you qualify right well what about us listen what your Prophet said see the reason he said that and the scripture says that the worshipper could not be made perfect on the Old Testament why because there was no new birth right right he could be perfect in God's eyes cuz he was covered but there was no new birth to bring him to the position God wanted him at right right so he couldn't come to that back there see he had to wait until Jesus Christ came right haven't you heard many times the people say oh there's none perfect that's right you can't be the perfect in the S of your fellow men but you got to be perfect or you'll never go to heaven that's right come on the Bible said Jesus speaking in beatitude Matthew said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect then you got to be just as perfect as God is or you're lost amen now how are you going to do it see now one little mistake and you're lost one little flap of the eye and you're gone cuz nothing can enter in to those places but perfect now how are you going to do it you got to be perfect to go to heaven they started the doctrine years ago and that's what run us out of a church that you had to come up here to the top of this pyramid to be able to have the Holy Ghost and uh I said well how can you do that when the prophet preaches you got to be born again at Faith and you receive eternal life yeah but that ain't right I okay go believe it now watch look at the next one the Queen of Sheba paragraph E10 and there's only two faculties that can govern you that's either Faith or unbelief you cannot be halfway between there's no black white bird birds are drunk sober men sin or Saints you're either a Believer or not a Believer and the only sin that there is is unbelief now stop and explain something when you repent of your sins and you get them chopped off that does not give you eternal life that only makes you perfect from what you done right cuz it's gone y it don't make you perfect right you got to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth Amen to qualify to have eternal life amen okay right so what's the prophet saying you're believing unto salvation but you don't possess salvation so in God's eyes you don't possess it no how good no matter how good your life is you know people will be given eternal life one day because of the Deeds Done in their bodies and things like that foolish virgins Etc y but you know they have to be given eternal life cuz they do not have eternal life that's right am so then the prophets right they still right in with the scriptures you can't be a black bird or you know and a white bird right you got to be one or the other right now if you got to be that then God has to you know required it and then we'll go on down and read some things about how to do that the 10 virgins in 144,000 paragraph 37 now you remember we're going to deal on that sharply this morning you're either in that body or out of that body no halfway between it there's no pretty good Christians and there you're either Christian or you're not Christian there's no black white bird no drunk siner no drunk sober man you can't have it you're either a Christian or not a Christian you're either in Christ or out of Christ that's what your Prophet is saying well I believe it this way well then you ain't believing brother Brown was your Prophet then forget it I mean that shows up if I read this told you I didn't believe it I I would be telling you right up front I didn't believe what the prophet said amen but see what he says what the Bible says amen now the six seal paragraph 57 63 323 I forget to give the dates you're talking about you know the churches organizations and the Ops and the things and you remember the whole thing is based on two things and one an antichrist the other one a Christ so now we're either we're of one or the other right will the Antichrist we're either Antichrist or we're Jesus Christ amen that's right there is no gray area in God right no well I'm believing unto and I don't like it you telling me I'm lost that's what a man left here one time because that's what I told him I didn't tell him he's lost I told him a way you acting you're lost right he went on told everybody I said he's lost I didn't never say he's lost I said the way you're acting you're lost you know what the way he's acting want prove what he done that's no problem because I'm not one to be able to tell you whether you're lost or saved God is your judg that's right but hey if we go out and live like the devil then there's one thing for sure we must be the devil cuz God don't live that way true amen all right he said it's still the same thing today there's no Highway Christians there's no drunk sober man no black white birds no no no sinner Saints no you're either a sinner or a saint see there's just no in between you're either born again or you're not born again you're either filled with the Holy Spirit or you're not filled with the Holy Spirit no matter how many Sensations you had if you ain't filled with the Holy Spirit you're not filled with it see and if you had been filled with it your life shows it goes right up to it see nobody has to tell anybody about it they see it see because it's a seal that day on Calvary paragraphs 79 1969 205 and when he died at Calvary he made a way he gave up the spirit the holy spirit that sent it back to the Earth for you and I to live by that's what Calvary means to us to follow him first look into it and see what it did for us and then look what must we do in regards to it what must you and I do well you say well I appreciate that that's fine but you got to accept it and to accept it is to accept his person Christ in your heart right then we are free from sin therefore there's no sin shackles hanging on us at all God just like we had never sinned the perfect sacrifice made us perfect for Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect then there is no more to be done but we are made perfect in the presence of God right all right now I go back again to remind you if God would say a man under the Old Testament doing from a sincere heart and offering the sacrifices that that person in God's eyes was perfect right y right why would we worry then or be consider or try to figure out some kind of a way to make things work for our benefit when under the blood of Jesus Christ in your soul you're perfectly totally sinless y go God and the devil cannot be in your soul at the same time that's right right so forget it that's right say well I don't I don't I don't like it I've got my that's what's the problem we got our ideas but what is our ideas have to do with what the word of God says well who are you to think you can inter I'm not trying to interpret I'm trying to read it but it don't need to be interpreted God is the only interpreter of the word right L 45 Christ Ministry God reveal I'm pretty sure you'll find the Holy Ghost is the only interpreter brother brand wasn't an interpreter right it was a mouthpiece the Holy Spirit used to speak to you and I why can't we get that thing straight he saids then you can tell the difference between the man and the message part of it then you turn around but Brother D I got a quote for the man and the message is the same well that's right brother randman his message was one but brother BR was a human mortal amen that he said he sinned every day and had to have an atonement you argue with him that's right right we go on with it look what he says on the first seal 19 63-18 paragraph 79 he talking about the judgment and the bride don't go through the tribulation and things like that see how can God judge a man that's perfectly totally sinless you say there's no such a person every Born Again believer True Believer you know this his emphasis he's perfectly absolutely sinless before God he's not trusting in his works in the blood of Jesus that's his confessions dropped in see he's not now that put that in there correctly because you read that with one Junction and you'll mess up your mind he's not trusting in his Works see it look like he say he's not trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ he's saying he's not trusting in his Works he trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ right all right the Bible says though he that is born of God does not commit sin for he cannot sin how can you make a man a sinner when the bleach of the blood of Jesus Christ is between him and God that would scatter sin till there there be nothing left of it see how can that pure blood of Christ ever let a sin pass there he cannot Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect and how can you ever start the thought of being perfect but Jesus required it and if Jesus required it he's got to make a way for it and he has his own blood he's made a way to make us Perfect Right amen going on down debate on tongues paragraph E10 1960 807 there's no black white bird or drunk sober man see it's either right or it's wrong it it it you can't have error and Truth together listen you see that's I got my ideas I'm going to R the Bible don't give you a right to have your idea the Constitution does but not the Bible and they're fast taking away that from the Constitution so you know that but the Bible don't give you a right to think right right that's what he done she thought she did she messed up it don't give you that right see it's either truth or it's Error well I heard that brother and he was just so close to the truth so yeah well since when it's close done any good it might work in horseshoes but just be careful the last guy might ring the ringer cuz he's got the truth amen then all your closeness is not worth anything right it don't matter if it propped up all over the post they don't count if the ringer is made right amen what it say and you believe that don't you brother and certainly if if the scripture is right then let's say what the script which stay with the scripture if the church is right then that's what I said to them priests I said if the church is right stay with the church if the church is right stay with it if what you believe is right stay with it amen but if the word right let's get with the word all right let's get a good one the Lamb's Book of Life :36 that was :35 we go this 36 now you got to be perfect Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect now how are you going to be when you're continually sinning when you're continually doing what's wrong now this will kind of put a little kink in the legalist but notice it isn't what you do it's what God has done it's not what you do it's what he done see right you can't be perfect you can't be in yourself but in Christ you're perfected you're not trusting in your own good works or your own church you belong to but you're trusting in the shed blood of the Lord Jesus there you are that's what makes you perfect there's what anchors your faith the let's read all of these and then we'll preach a while revelation of Jesus Christ which is church age book page 34 consider this since it is the blood of God it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and bondage and defilement of sin then the loosing is perfect and complete there is now therefore no condemnation he goes reading that scripture talk about Del there it is his death gave us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation How can there be there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free Guiltless don't listen to man listen to listen to the word you are loosed by the blood that's it am well now I heard a man say that I can just go out and live like the devil now it doesn't matter cuz I the New Testament now show me that in the Bible show me that where your Prophet ever said that's show me that where any true minister of the Gospel ever said right show me where Paul ever said in something thing like that right but you see we still got all that we hanging on from back dire well I taught all my life brother Dale that that there was no sin imputed to me did it teach you the right way for that to be right you know that the church has power to forgive sin right well nowadays they just pass it out belief lless and you don't even have to come to church you can drive by the window get you what's the difference than that and pay in your what's the word for it is it noena what what is that word where you just pay for anything no okay and you know you can get a pay for Novena you can pay for something then go before you do it right you got a Catholic sit make her shaking their head you can pay before you go do it well then when you go do it you don't have to repent you don't repented for doing it before you done it now that never stopped in my brain some way some it just kept going I I can't figure that out now but that's what their priest told them and you know what they believe it y that's right and they can just go out and kill people and just I've done forgiven come on listen what he says in Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 I would ask you if you would to read the Hebrews chapter 5 and Hebrews chapter 6 of the church I mean of the Hebrew Book that the prophet word preached I would ask you to read that in your Hebrew Book especially for this afternoon's message Hebrews chapter 5 and 6 part 1 one paragraph 77 where we'll start reading and they say nobody can be perfect the Bible said there's none perfect and watch nurs your contradiction now what's he saying he says they're saying that nobody can be perfect he said there's your contradiction and what he explain it they're contradictory to the word of God cuz the word of God say you can be perfect that's so they making a contradiction when you say that's nonperfect you're making a contradiction out of the Bible yeah you take your own self interpretation and make contradiction cuz the Bible said if you are born again you're perfectly totally sinless that's right right well then no matter what I do well then that proves you're lost so of pra no cist nothing to be done no argument right go live like the devil we are the devil watch what he said you cannot be perfect in yourself if you're trusting in what you done you're lost be therefore perfect even as even just as perfect as god is perfect now there is one in the Hebrew Book where brother Brown said I would hate to think that I was born 5 minutes ago and had to depend upon something for being perfect mhm he said because I was born what could a five minute old baby do nothing but it's a product of sin I was born in sin psalmist David said shapen in iniquity and ESP spouse my mother's wound went forth a liar I'm going to say you know have teach them little kids to lie they're going to learn it yourself cookie in his hand all over his mouth you eat the cookie no no no no no no what about us adults with it slammed all over her face it don't matter what I do I'm a Christian I believe the prophet's message you lying hypocrite that tough enough that the prophet say be glad one of these days when he look you straight in the fa and say you're not saying what Paul said well all right preacher Saint whoever we claim to be if we claim that we don't sin the Bible says that we sin amen the prophet says we sin he said he sinned every day but he was perfect y why because he repented of his sin right that's why folks if we sin as a Christian we reap a tub fo right do that quote why because if we don't confess that we're going to have to confess it one day day there is a Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad that we stand before no matter how good a Christian you think you are there are two judgments in the Bible That's where preachers Don't Preach it correctly there's a white Throne judgment we sat on the throne with him to judge others but there's a judgment of the deed done in the body whether good or bad then all Christians will have to answer that judgment but if it's repented of it can't come up at that judgment that's right that's right Amen to those who repent there won't be a Jud right right we're not getting by well nobody didn't see it do was that what he thought well he said I died one day and I ain't died yet cuz do slept three days we say oh it was thousand years is day days okay that's fine but what was she thinking right brother R said say she still thinks she's right right the church right right still thinks they're right right let's go on oh getting night dinner's done ready I'll finish this afternoon about to look what he says the law having a shadow e 27 the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the thing those sacrifices which were offered year by year made never made the comer unto perfect I want you he didn't mind saying those things but yet he said it was perfect right y if the Bible said it was perfect he knew what he's talking about those sacrifices never made us the new never gave us eternal life right you can't do it just doing the sacrifice can't bring you eternal life sacrifice is a covering for your sins there was no ability for that lamb to come back upon them the believer in the Old Testament see so the prophet still right the Bible's right so Jesus in Matthew gospel said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect how are you going to do it how can you do it how can you be per be as perfect as god is perfect but that was a commission or a commandment by Jesus Christ to be as perfect as God is in heaven perfect there you say who can be saved hold it just a moment let's find out how that Perfection is made now God back there in the beginning when he foresaw down through the streak of time he knew they would have to have a remedy to save the those that were that which was Desiring to be saved those who hungered hungered to be up there in that realm he had to make a way to redeem those back again he did his own blood right law having a shadow PR 77 I hope you see it it isn't whether you're good enough to be a Christian or not it isn't whether you're he was it's whether he was good enough now let me read that again so you won't miss my wording it isn't whether you're good enough good enough to be a Christian or not it's whether he was good enough if God accepted him and his blood makes an atonement God don't see you he sees the lamb right he goes on to say I don't have any Perfection you're perfect by the vicarious sufferings of Jesus Christ now let me just say a few words about perfect we'll close out in just a minute you can't add anything to perfect can't be right you're perfect you're perfect can't add anything to it if you did it wouldn't be perfect now under the Old Testament you had to believe that that lamb died in your place and that God told you now look back in the Old Testament for a minute with me you see the children of Israel over here in one camp and they're taking up the lambs and the offerings and and they're bowing down before now listen but make sure you understand what I'm saying so please listen they're over here bowing down before Idols they're over here offering sacrifices is that true come on and you got another group of people over here and they're bwing down before totem poles you know or whatever God to make and they're in sincerity over here just as sincere as that group is over there cuz you ever heard the prophet say any of you want any of your women want to take your baby out and feed it to an alligator but you know a lot of people under those idols and worships and things sacrifice their children their wives your families yeah human sacrifices even today are still made to atonements under those things which one's right right that's it sincerity this group over here life and cutting up running around goofing off you think they were sincere down there when Moses came back down off the mountain and found them out there just dancing and drinking and carousing and all kind of adulteries and acts and everything taking place and Moses looks down at him and says God don't block them out if you don't block me out y That's Right sincerity you say sincerity is all it is no it's not you want to feed your baby to an alligator you want to go throw it down into a volcano to get the volcano to stop erupting people does it which is the sincerity right yes but brother they don't know the God we know brother R said they bow before an idol that they believe that their God has entered that Idol yeah and in some imaginary way he said they can even he voices have you read that much in the message that they can actually hear voices remember a lady one time she run over her husband she backed up run over him again asked her why she done it she said God told me to do it some probably did but see it's based on sincerity folks but it's not based on that form of sincerity that's right right it's sincerity of an honest heart but the truth that goes with that because if you're sincere over here what does that matter but if you've got the truth and then got sincerity you can go before God and offer things you remember in the Bible that time when the man told him said God you able me to Victory or something I won and he said I'm going to tell you Lord he said when I get back home he said the first thing that comes out of my house I'll offer it to you as a sacrifice you know probably what he had with a little old dog a lot of times back there they had sheep you know and different things you know that little dog probably run out there every time he come home or the lamb or the cat or whatever it was it was probably the first thing he probably had his mindset on that he said I love the dog I love the cat I love the animal what it is but said when it comes out I offer it to you as a sacrifice you know the story of what happened when he got there his daughter came out that's right he gave her time of fear for if ific ation getting ready and then he crucified her to keep his word don't make promises to God you won't keep he's going to hold you to your promise that's right right that's right he's going to hold you to your promise that's right don't make no deals with it don't tell him you do this and I'll do that don't make no deals with it cuz he's going to hold you to it that's right that's right when never to say I'll be at your house tomorrow right we're not to say that we're to say the Lord willing I will be at your house tomorrow I'm try to make any deals God don't deal but he will demand your word right if under the blood of bulls and goats they could believe they were forgiven and God counted it as David said the man who' went out and committed adultery and killed his best friend and all of these that and the other and then he went out and when he did honest and a contract heart yeah right right what about it what about all all of the things what about under the blood of Jesus Christ have you accepted him to be your savior that's good cuz that's what the world preaches accepting Jesus Christ but your Prophet said his has he ever accepted you right right he said there's the difference you see a world full of people accepting Jesus Christ right churches all over the world more more religious people today more we call it Christians today than ever before y but has God accepted them that's right if it's based upon them accepting him then all the world has to be saved not based on that it's based on an honest and a sincere heart and whether or not he accept you right why can't we and I've always told you I'd rather go through life believing I've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and every day seeking God for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and find out one day I got it then to go through life saying I've got it there ain't nothing you can say to me to convince me I don't have it well then you don't have it if that's what you think so you know what I'm saying to you I'd rather to go through life seeking God and find out I had him than go through life not seeking him and find out I didn't have him that's right because of what I've been told your Prophet I read it to you he said don't listen to man right right he said listen to God he said you're loosed if you can believe it right everything's based upon whether or not you believe everything in the Old Testament was based on whether or not they believed it same as it in the New Testament come on brother amen everything is based on whether or not we can believe it that's right did he pay the price am did he make the atonement and my thoughts is only in one thing the atonement the atonement was made for me it's still there the body is still lying there is a sacrifice on the throne what about it but do we believe it's for us or for somebody else right is our faith in a finished product of Calvary that you cannot humanly prove that God ever existed that's right you you come over here well that's argument of science you can't prove that Jesus Christ ever existed well man says that's man saying it remember the Bible says examine yourselves to see whether you're in the faith or not has he spoken to you well I don't believe he speaks to nobody the prophet so then they never speak to you cuz you just cut him off but if you believe that was the whole thing of what I tried to bring here this past Wednesday night the Bible says if you say not if I say unto this mountain be moved well that was only for brother brandom and the Lord Jesus well then we might as well all eat drink and be marry wa the train pulls up I believe somebody's going to catch it and speak it yes L Jesus because if you're healed you got to say it you're saved you got to say it right if you change you got to say it right but why can't you stand sometimes and just say things well I don't know where it was God or not I stood right here 30 something years ago and I said some of the people you think that have gone back into the world and are lost will before the end comes be back in this church Amen Brother Don G was the what I was talking about that's right 15 years ago or so he came back to God and started coming to church why can't you say it like that are you afraid see there was another sister I had in mind I told my wife who that was cuz see if you go ahead and say with another sister some of the sister jump up and say I'm it yeah no I ain't going to tell you a lie about it I told my wife who it was that would come back before the end you say it's impossible I believe in a God that does all things well that's right and I
