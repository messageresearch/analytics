13 Genesis chapter 8 uh sorry Genesis chapter 13 and I would like to read from U verse 8 a very familiar scripture but uh you know I was one day meditating on the word of God and God put it on my heart a little thought from this little passage and I want to place it before you tonight this morning verse eight Abra and Abraham said unto Lord let there be no strive I pray thee between me and thee and between my heard man and thy heard man for we be Brethren is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if thou Willl take the left hand then I will go to the right or if thou depart to the right hand then I will go to the left the and Lord bless and the Lord lifted up his I I'm sorry and Lord lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and gomorah even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto zorer then Lord chose him all the plain of Jordan and Lord journeyed East and they separated themselves from one from the other and Abraham dwelt in the land of Canaan and L dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent toward Sodom but the men of Sodom Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly I want uh you all to just notice verse 10 I would like to read it one more time if you don't mind and and lot lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plain of jardan that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and gomorah even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto zoer may the Lord bless the reading of his word thank you very much you all may be seated indeed a great privilege uh for me to be with you all in the house of the Lord this morning and um I would like to uh tell you that U uh by God's grace and um you know by the prayers of the Saints Around The World God has been good to us and uh you know we are able to take the word of God this message of the hour to the unreached and um the Lord has been good to us and I would like to thank God for that and I'm ever grateful to the Lord Almighty and also I would like to thank you all saints for the uh for the help for the support uh you Saints have been given to us throughout all these years amen and uh I have no words to thank you but I pray that God will bless you abundantly and uh I pray that God has a great reward for you Saints waiting on the other show amen amen and uh I bring greetings from the orphans the old age and the lepers uh who are under our care and uh uh you know it's it's good to see them growing in the Lord and uh being blessed and also uh I would like to I hope you all know um I lost my mother on March the 22nd and U it was kind of a a shock and um we know she was suffering she had many complications in her in her body because she was diabetic and she had you know heart enlargement and her hypertension and all kinds of uh um problems she had with health but that um she she was a real fighter she fought all through uh you know and uh she was uh keeping good but you know I believe it was the Lord uh it was uh January 2nd week I believe she started going low you know from there and um you know she became worse and worse and worse but um uh before she passed away one week before she was so gentle and so kind not not one word she spoke to anybody you know U you know no she was not angry with anything she was just sweet and tender and kind and she kept praying to the Lord and she did lot of things you know when we when we looked how the Lord took her away you know she called my wife and she said Hereafter you are the one who take care of this ministry and I put you know you need to take responsibility on your shoulders and you need to be courageous and she called those 10 little girls and he said from here she will be your mama you know and she will take care of you and we were all you know thinking why she was saying and doing all these things but uh you know after a week we all realize that she knew and uh and I believe and uh you know God chooses you predestinated you know predestines you you know he he gives you good time to prepare yourself so I saw in a closer quarter was uh since January 1 week I was with her beside her bed and taking care of her and you know I could do I did what I could do to help her but um on the second 22nd of March uh she went to be with the Lord and uh you know being beside her for so long and seen her suffering through all those days you know it really took uh toll on my mind and my body you know and U you know I was totally broken discouraged Ed and uh you know we we took courage after some time we tried to you know my wife and myself we moved in in the church and uh you know Daddy and myself and my wife my son we started being there take care of the you know things uh there in the church and with the orphans and uh it is tough you know you know uh she was a great personality nobody knew what she was carrying on her shoulder we boys only knew to bring the treasure in and you know and get whatever she wants but she was the one she was executing everything what you know she she had a great big burden on her life and I miss her a lot and and I never realize the burden she carried she she just left us you know after that we came to know he said oh my you know the burden the weight you know she carried upon her uh her life but um you know I was very much uh uh under stress and I was depressed and you know uh I came to United States and as soon as I came you know I was very sick I had fever cold and cough and I suffered almost 10 12 days and I had to preach for brother kinzer in Gil Virginia in his in his uh in his anniversary meetings but I did it even though I was sick I just prayed and and asked the Lord to help and then I came to brother Jo greens meeting and that was the 5th of August and I was in brother Ban's house and uh it was about you know about to Dawn I believe uh I didn't see the time but it was still dark outside and I woke up crying and I saw a dream and um and I saw my mother you know suffering you know uh from certain period of time and then I seen her gone through and we put her in the grave and you know we close and I began to cry I began to weep you know and um suddenly my mom started smiling at me she was just in front of me and I saw her as if uh you know I believe brother Wes is here and uh he's seen that picture you know uh in my house my dad and mom the day they got married and I saw her in that kind of a stature I never seen her old you know heavy you know uh sick but she had such a smile on her face and uh and I saw her she was a young woman there and I I began to I call Amma you know in my language Amma Amma that means mom mom and when I said uh mom mom she said you know he said Son you should not cry you shouldn't cry he said you stop worrying about me and she told me that uh you wouldn't imagine how happy I am here that's right amen that's right and when she told me that she was very happy there brother that took my burden away brother that made me so happy I'm so relaxed and since then I started you know that helped me in two ways one way I forgot the sorrow I forgot the the pain I was going through because I was missing her badly H she was my great mother and uh the other other help I got was you know it made me to walk more closer to God because I want to go there I want to be there and meet my loved ones not only that I want to see the prophet of God I want to see all the children of the Lord I want to see the old you know Old Testament Saints and and live through eternity and that has really blessed me my brothers and my sisters and uh you know I'm really happy and from then I never uh only once I cried when I was speaking to brother Lloyd walls you know how she was suffering and you know he asked me certain things and I began and and I I cried a little bit but you know after that that dream I saw I stopped worrying because I know she's in a better place and and uh she's in a in a best condition she you know she is in she ever could be you know and I believe she's better than me you know you know and and I was just talking to brother Lloyd and he was telling me that he was listening to a mess and and said brother Brandon was trying to explain you know uh about the things beyond the curtain of time and the way he said things and the way he began to express those things you know it felt it seems like you know brother brother Brandon wanted to go to that place and when I was listening to brother Lord I said brother Lord you know what even I feel it is better to leave this world as soon as possible and get to that place brother that place is so good and so wonderful and and I just listened to the to the message beyond the curtain of time and how you know there is no sorrow and there's no no pain in the body and you know all all of you know whatever we lost you know brother Brandon says everything that's deformed will be straightened so everything will be perfect everything every circumstances will be a perfect one there so what a time that would be you know and I'm looking forward for that yes so you know I'm I'm really happy to be with you Saints this morning and I would like to just if you want a title I would like to uh you know uh say it like this what are you looking at I want to base myself on verse 10 uh where lot he lifted up his eyes and he began to to see the the plain of Jordan and that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and gomorra even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest into Z and we see that was a beautiful place and and the scripture says it was like just like Garden of Aiden and and and it was compared like the like the land of Egypt it was such a beautiful place and and and Lord began to to look at that place and uh you know the story very well that uh when God came to Abraham and he said abrah you know you leave your father's house and you leave your kindreds and he said you go to a place where I'm going to take him and and and Abraham he took his father with him yeah we know brother brandham made a statement about his dad he said he was like a dead fly in the ointment and then you know after some time he he died and and Abraham buried him but Lo his brother's son was with him traveling with him and as the days and months you know as this journey begin to progress you know the Lord begin to bless these people you know I believe whatever the people when they walk with God and when they are in the perfect will of God and when they obey God's word I believe certainly God will bless them in all the ways and and you can we can read in the Bible they were blessed you know with all material things uh that's in the world and and they had gold silver you know livestock and you know uh people uh their servants and M and and the people begin to multiply and Their Blessings begin to multiply and you know there came a time you know Lord's uh her men and and Abraham's Herman had a problem and an argument or a misunderstanding you know it happens when when things begin to grow when God begin to bless people you know automatically people they they change you know their attitude and their mindset and the thinking and everything changes because you know they have been blessed so much it happens in our natural life also you know when we when we are in troubles and when we are in difficulties we see that you know we walk more closer to God but you know once God start blessing us you know we try to slowly lay down you know our prayer life and you know go back a little bit and go away a little bit from the church and you know we try to miss one one time and you know this month and the next month you know we try to miss you know two times you know things like that and we keep on you know laying off and laying off and you know that's how we go far away from the Lord but brother sister you know these people were so much blessed and and because of this uh uh Strife between the Herman of lot and and Abraham and when Abraham came to know about this you know he came to lot and he said lot you know we are Brethren then let there be no Strife between us and you know Abraham's heart was such a he was such a wonderful person you know we all know the story he said you know what if you go towards the left side he said I will take the right side yeah I will go towards the right hand side but if you go to the right hand side he said I will go to the left hand side but brother sister you know and lo uh had a first choice right you know Lord has the first choice and I I believe uh every Christian's attitude should be like this my brother is much better than me you know he's my brother my sister is is better than me you know if we can have this kind of attitude brother we can overcome many problems but you know when we want to become something when we want to become number one brother that's the problem and I could see here Lord wanted to become number one Lord's heard men was be they wanted to become top people Top Class people and that's where the problem started between the two groups but you know here comes the man of God the prophet of God and he said you know what let's not have strive he said we are brethren we are children of God we are serving a living God and you know we cannot fight we cannot have fussing we cannot have this misunder standing between us many times brother sister you know I I wonder you know uh I believe just yesterday Brother Sam and Mel we were talking in his in his living room and he said you know I don't understand he said brother Samuel Dale he said you know we got one one message and we got you know one Bible and one God and you know we got so many doctrinal issues and you know one church is not happy with the other and they doesn't want to fellowship with each other one preacher is against the other one and the one is against the other one and you know all kinds of things are happening but brother sister we preach and we talk about great mysteries of God you know we talk about this message is such a you know you know big uh uh you know in a greater measure he said but you know the theme of the message is Brotherly Love where that love has gone what has happened to the love the love of God what has happened to that you know this message is all about the love agape love of God GL this is unconditional love I would like to tell you something this morning even even though I'm a wicked man even though I am a you know I I'm not a good man or or anything you want to say about me but you know you need to still love me because if you love your soul and you want to go in the Rapture let not that jealousy or anger or Grudge right let it not come into our hearts no matter what somebody's doing against us just put them into the Lord's hand and the Lord will take care of him that's what I believe the Bible says love your enemy and I believe my brothers my sister Abraham was trying to project himself in a proper manner and he showed that he was a true Son of God he showed himself that he was a you know real man of God and you know and and when he made that statement and and lot and his wife you know they thought this is a golden opportunity to get rid of this old man Lord's wife wife might have told him he said he said Lord Lord listen to me he said you know I'm anyhow tired with this with this old man I'm tired about his preaching I'm tired about his prayer meetings I'm tired about his Holiness I'm tired about this I'm tired about going to church I'm tired about to hear him he's become so old he's got so many reputations he's been repeating things always and I'm tired and and I'm fed off with him it's said this a good chance you know what I can see that place Green Well watered what do you think think about that Lord and Lord said you know what that must be a good idea husband and wife they both are one if they are Christians they both are one if they are non-christians they both are one because they got married to each other and the Bible says they both are one and Lord and Lord said you know that must be a very good idea said we got two daughters you know and we must think about the future you know can you imagine traveling this uh with this old man Abraham you know you know all through the deserts and Wilderness and you know he doesn't go through the cities you know he is like a Countryman and he's like a like an you know she said I don't know what to say I'm so fed off with him it's better to leave him alone and take our journey and they made a plan they decided they came to an agreement the Bible said you know two people cannot walk together unless they be agreed so lot and his wife they agreed together and they took decision you know uh collective decision and they said let's go to the the Green Plains he said that place looks much better than this it's all stones and you know dry and it's hard it's tough on life it's better we go and build a nice house you know and get better class of people let us go to the best Church there brother Brandon makes a statement in the message the faith of Abraham you know uh he preached it in 1959 he said that's the way many did like L did he said there's many that did like L did just a few more dollars he said when he was looking at the well water well water planes he didn't see his wife turning to a pillar of salt he didn't see it he said he said he didn't see the fire that was going to destroy the city and and part of his children he didn't see the disgrace that his daughters were going to do because raising them up in a bunch of worldliness like they were raised in Lo didn't see the after effect of going to Sodom and gomorra it is very important for us Christians today when you look at something you need to see the proper you know the positive thing of it brother it's very dangerous when you look at something and you really cannot see the aftermath after effects of that issue right now when Lord began to see towards Sodom and Gomorrah it was well watered plane in Jord he said it was a beautiful land it was a fruitful land but you know he didn't see the Propet of God said he didn't see that his wife was to become a pillar of salt that very place that he chose to go will become a curse to him one day the Bible says the men of Sodom Sodom were wicked men they were evil men right y but he only saw the the goodness the green part of it he didn't see the wickedness in Sodom and gomorra he didn't see the the sins of of Sodom and Gomorrah he didn't see the the the evil that was existing in Sodom and gomorah many times we do things many times we we try to you know uh do something and we don't see properly what is going to bring it to us what will be the effect of that thing what we are doing in our lives you know brother Bram makes a statement he said you know that's what you know you look at today friends it depends on what you're looking at it depends what you're looking at and it depends how you're looking at I see a young man sitting before me two of them and there are some in the back let me tell you you got your iPads and you got your iPods and you you got your your computers and you got all kinds of stuff but you need to see you need to watch yourself what you're looking at exactly amen just remember this my brothers my sister you know I I deal I deal with these things in my church too I got my son I got all the young people in my church I got many of them and I got 60 orphant and I deal with children a lot nowadays and let me tell you David said I will not put any evil thing before me just think about the the smartphones we have today brother you don't have to even have iPads or you don't have to even have computers your smart phone is a smart thing you can ever have and it can make you so smart and brother Bram says when you become smart that will take you away from God the prophet of God also said he said you know what you just get down on the ground of the devil one time and just watch him what he's what he does that's right he said you just step in and you will see what he does you just watch him what he can do you know you don't have you don't have to step you don't have to you know give trouble to your body you can just sit down where you are and just one click right you're there right and you just watch that devil I don't believe we need you need to block you need to put a block something brother you need a block inside a person can put a block on the computer and a person can click it and take that block away but if you got that blocking thing in your heart I'm talking about that thing comes from Heaven that no man can give you no preacher can give you your dad and mom cannot give you your pastor cannot give you your visiting Minister cannot give you it is God who can give you that blocking thing and that's the Holy Ghost what we need today is the holy Holy Ghost friends thank you for agreeing with me amen there are many people they hardly speak about the Holy Ghost anymore yeah that's right but I believe if we need anything today it's the Holy Ghost more than anything that's in our life amen hallelujah we don't have jobs no problem you find it you'll get some job you don't have proper house to stay you struggle you earn money make whatever God gives you make an house yourself build an house for yourself you don't have proper food no problem you eat whatever God gives you no proper clothing whatever God gives you wear it but let me tell you you cannot compromise with the Holy Ghost nothing can be substituted there is no substitute for the Holy Ghost we need it brothers and sisters and I believe God becomes obligated when we repent our sins when we come and set our life right in the presence of God and repent and God will give us the Holy Ghost that's what we need today it's the holy ghost that will keep you live a holy life that will keep you from all unrighteousness that will keep you from all evil amen brother Bram says it depends on what you're looking right I'm not saying this to make you mad at me young people I love you all with all my heart right that's sometimes I'm I'm like this but you help me preach I would like to just obey the Holy Ghost this morning I just want to say what the Lord want me to Amen Brother Sam asked me this morning did you sleep well and even sister asked me I said I did Hallelujah but Frankly Speaking I li to them I got up at 1:23 a.m. this morning and I couldn't sleep after that I kept praying asking God I said Lord I don't know why I'm awake you know but Lord you help me right I need your guidance Lord I Need I want you to lead me because I'll be standing before your people and I don't know what's their need and what's the desires but you know it Lord so I give up give myself to you I know that I recognize I'm dust and Ash Lord I'm nothing but you can take the lump of clay and you can use it for your glory amen and I believe I'm yielding myself to the Holy Ghost this morning my brothers and my sisters it depends on what you're looking at right you cannot understand brother brandom or the Lord Jesus Christ by just reading the Bible or reading the message book it will take the power of the Holy Ghost it will take God to reveal himself to us than Lord so brother sister I will I will say like this when you look at the circumstances that is existing now in the present time you know you you see what is happening in the internet world you know it is an Internet that means it is a inside net once you get in you are not coming out unless God pulls you out of that net it's a terrible thing that we have in this world today brother you talk about that it's everywhere all over the world the devil has used his technology his wisdom all over the world exactly we had a revolution in India about the cell phones there is a family in India named by ambanis there are two brothers their father died their father's dream was to you know every person in India must have a mobile phone he passed the way but his sons have fulfilled that dream you get cell phones for nothing today yeah in India think about that and I'm not saying this because I have to say but I have seen many rack Pickers in dumpsters waiting there somebody called them and they're on the telephone yeah right in the dumpster yeah they have a phone yeah so we see this changing trend of the world today yeah so when you look at something the question is what you looking at just few minutes before I made a statement you cannot understand Jesus Christ or God Almighty but just reading the Bible or just reading the message you will never understand it will not take the intellectual power or knowledge to understand God it will take the revelation of God it will take the revealing of the word to our hearts and unless that happens and that's why we see all these things happening because they try to learn they try to educate themselves by a textbook brother bam says it cannot happen so it depends on what you're looking at right right when you look at something just like an example here brother Bram says Lord didn't see the after effects of going into Sodom and Gomorrah now it may look green it may look wonderful it may we may look at it just like a garden of hiden oh yeah right but when you step into that see the effect it's bring on your life right just see when you got on the ground of the devil and you watch him what he's trying to do track your eyes it track your mind it track your heart and brother you lost right and see the effect that's that's coming on your brain exactly people think it's it's a good thing you know to to play on a on a on a on a on a video game on computer you know they have two things and and children sit there and and they press buttons and and you know the press the more they press the more faster the car goes the race car go on the screen and you know when when they do you know they doesn't realize that screen that's that the car that is running fast so speed is affecting their minds right right we parents talk about people children becoming hyper well you don't doubt about it you have a video game in your in your computer at home and they're sitting always and sitting on the computer and trying to drive that car so speed that's what making them crazy right [Applause] when you look at something be careful what are you looking because that is going to affect your life right that affected Lord's life that affected Lord's wife's life that affected his two daughter's life see the disgrace they brought right Lord's wife become a pillar of salt right Lord he became the mayor of the town the city and he began to sit at the Gate of the city he be to look and you know you know try to help people in their family matters in their family issues he forgot his own family back at home the Bible says his righteous Soul his spiritual life was degrading now he's away from the pastor he's away from the from the church people he's away from prayer life he's away from the Christians right think about it brother Brenham says we look at the Unseen praise the lord we are looking at the Unseen things right the book of colation says the things which we see with our eyes are temporal the things which we don't see with our eyes are Eternal we Christian we children of God we are looking at the things unseen right brother brandham says in a message called God has a provided lamb speaking on the life of bermes and and trying to tell his story and the prophet of God says he said you know you know blindness is a horrible thing he says he said when I see a man blind my heart goes out for him but yet I know of a blindness that's worse spiritual blindness he said how God Made Me to visualize him and they can do it right amen God made man to visualize him to visual visualize means to form a picture of someone right to visualize means to see right God made man right when we were in the school they had a little saying God made man man made money ma money made man rich but God made us right so that we could see him that's right and the prophet of God said it is pity it is sorrowful that he cannot do it why because he has put his eyes on something else that's right but what you see with your eyes is All Temporary no matter how beautiful it is no matter how attracting it is no matter how it is affecting your your heart and making you Merry and happy just now I heard something you know recently that your country or some of the states have already made it legal to take marijuana oh they say it is better than better than smoking cigarettes when I came to when I came to you know uh my wife's aunt in New Jersey you know and and uh we were just talking at the at the time of breakfast and and she began to talk about you know uh taking drinks and and she began to make a statement and and she said you know you know it's nothing wrong to take a social drink sometimes and you know his son her son and and another her brother's son and we both were both were traveling and and they said he said what do you think brother Sam about taking social drink I said Brothers if you steal a dime or a $100 bill or $1,000 he stealing exactly exactly right whether you steal a dime or a nickel whether you steal a dollar or $10 or $1,000 is still a robbery it's stealing whether it is a social or a nonsocial right right amen thank you sister people are I don't know what to say soal yeah and we we are so-called Christians oh so-called Christian country I'm sorry to make this statement but I'm sorry it is so much hypocrisy that's right thank you brother word thank you it is so much hypocrisy right yes sir brother I've seen that in the message ranks too right I'm sorry to say this exactly but the truth is truth always we were made to see God we are not made to see the glamour of this world or what the devil has to give it to us we have divorced him he was our first Kinsmen but we have given a divorcement we have left him we got nothing to do when a when a man and a woman are divorced the law says the country the law of your country says he said the man should not come in the place where the his ex-wife is yeah he should not come in our vicinity or she should not come in our vicinity if you all agree with that law in this country and if you say Amen to that law how much more we could say Amen right because we divorced our first as husband brother you cannot go where he is and he cannot come where you are if you agree say Amen to that because we got nothing to do with him we are not interested what he wants to give it to us we are interested in God and the things of God and and we want to only be you know interested in his things am that's right that's what we are made for that's amen and it is it is so bad it is so pitiful that a man who is made to visualize God and he cannot do it right yeah so you know brother Bram goes further he says Lord Journeys himself and take down to Hollywood or some big place you know a bigger Church where there are little more classical people you know just a little little better educated preachers and so forth he said oh he felt he had be all right he had just gone down there he felt he was all right if you go there that's what the problem there's no there's no problem it doesn't matter you know to have a social drink it doesn't matter to speak one little lie it doesn't matter to do to steal you know a little bit it doesn't matter to to to give false witness it doesn't matter it doesn't matter to do this and do that and brother once you get in you're finished yeah right you will never realize that's what happened in the in the in the life of Job and he said he was on his road backsliding right then he said get away from Divine Healing and the baptism of the Holy Spirit he said there's no better class than Jesus Christ there's no better person there's no better god brother I come from a country they got 33 millions in gods and goddesses but I can tell you I have found one amen right there nothing can match him nothing can come equal to him he's our Lord Jesus Christ my brothers my sisters he said he was already on a road to backslide you know in the message called Abraham brother randam speaks he said Lo already was already backsliding in his heart and he went to towards Sodom if he went to Sodom if he chose Sodom it was not that he was backslid after he went to Sodom but he was already backslid that's why he chose s he was already black backs sladen and then you know what the hand of him but Abraham as soon as he had done what God told him to do to separate himself from his Kindred and everything he said what about Sarah here him and Sarah's W you and your wife are one amen because she's in Covenant with him because is his wife but notice when he separated himself from lot and Lot's wife I imagine Mrs lot wanted to belong to all the lotteries and everything going along through the country you know she was a hindrance to him the Bible says let us lay aside every weight and sin that easily beset us when we are in this kind of a journey let's run this race with patience that set before us us looking unto the author and the finisher of our faith our eyes must be put on Jesus Christ which is the author and the finisher of our faith praise the Lord just think about that prodigal son this morning he took all his father's money his inheritance and he said I will go I'm grown up I know what is right and what is wrong so let me go and let me live my life so dad said okay son have your own way and he went he went to a far away country when he went he didn't see what he was looking for actually he was looking for a trouble and the prophet of God says he said you know his money was all spent his friends left him then he went to a citizen there and he said sir I have lost all my money he said I was in a very good position one time but today I'm with nothing I have no friends I need a job can you help me and that man he said you know what I will give you two buckets and you can go to the pig pan and brother Bram speaks about he used a word he said he joined with a citizen and he gave him two slob buckets to go slob the Haw and the prophet of God said think about a Hebrew being in the pig pen he was raised in a Hebrew family he was raised to live a holy life he was raised to be a spiritual person he was raised to be a person who will love the Lord he was raised to follow the Commandments of God but now he has left his father mother his family he has come to a far away country you know can you imagine he's in the pig pen what a place for a Hebrew to be in yeah right a terrible place a terrible situation he said as soon as you get from under the influence of the Holy Spirit he said that's what happened to you we cannot get away from the influence of the Holy Ghost right amen that's why we need Holy Ghost every second of our Liv it's not just seeking the Holy Ghost when we come to Church of for the prayer meeting we need Holy Ghost every day we need a refilling of fresh every day just like David says Lord my cup is filled and it is running over we need to be filled every day with a fresh you know spirit of God with a fresh blessing with a fresh as his compassion is new Every Morning towards us brother he can if you ask him Lord I need the Holy Ghost for today he will give it to you people are afraid to receive the Holy Ghost they're afraid they're even afraid to call Holy Ghost to make things easy they will say holy spirit sometimes we people have good spirit but it's not the Holy Ghost exactly have a good spirit is not a holy spirit sometimes we people have good spirit you know everything looks good and good spirit you know we are in High Spirits sometime but that's not the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is is word made flesh that's right the Holy Ghost is God himself right the Holy Ghost is God himself living in the people praise the Lord hallelujah I want you to look at Joshua and calib when those they went to you know look into that land to spy that place and Joshua and calb they had you know the evidence from that land praise the Lord but there were 10 others the problem with you know this kind of issues the majority is all negatives only two came with a positive report and brother sister Joshua and calb said you know what you know this is the evidence of the land and he said we are more than able we can make it but the other 10 said you know what don't listen to their report something is wrong with their minds said man when we stepped into that land we saw giants there we saw sons of anoch and we saw seven kinds of different you know uh races of people there man they're terrible and when we looked at ourselves we look like a grass opers in our side and in their side man they will just put our feet and we are finished we are smashed he said don't hear to their report their report is wrong he said that's not correct come on and it's more easy to listen to a false report than to listen to the truth it's very hard to listen to the truth right amen the the false has got such a mesmerizing power you just go and put William brandom and see what pops up first yeah and when people click that and get into it all negatives all negatives all wrong reports yeah think about that come on my precious brothers and sisters he said don't you hear their report that's something wrong this court was wrong this court was wrong that is wrong with the cloud that is wrong with this even was not there at that day he he did this and he shouldn't have done this he shouldn't have that way or this way what you're looking at it depends on what you're looking that's right it will take the Holy Ghost to reveal that's right himself to you amen we cannot just read the messages we cannot just read the Bible and put the knowledge what we have read into our data in our brains and act like a Christian brother what you are inside it will show up one day and that's what has happened it has showed up it it needs a time for a perfect timing when that timing comes it will chop it will chop whether you are a true Christian or not we know that this message is Vindicated right we know that Jesus Christ is pro one is God Almighty not only he proved himself 2014 years back but he proved in this age and I'm telling you he's proing today now yes sir there were many places I preached before I came here many times brothers and sisters they come and they said you know what brother God spoke to me right he said you didn't know what you were saying you didn't know what I was going through but God spoke to me that proves that he's is the yesterday today and forever Hebrew 39 is still real thank God persons like this person like brother samale thank God for these elderly people thank God for the seniors I pray that God will keep them you know for a good reason because when that happened all these young youngsters they were not there they were not not there when God told them the prophet to turn the cloud picture to right where were they come on brother amen where were they when God spoke to the prophet and said you take that picture and turn right where were they when the Lord came on the scene and he began to discern the lives of the people where were there yeah I know it's too strong but it's the truth amen but brother Joshua and Cal they had the evidence and brother when you have the evidence in your life there's nothing in this world that can prove it is wrong amen the problem is people don't have the evidence in their Liv if we have the evidence of the Holy Ghost brother there is no power that will shake you or move you nothing can touch you because you got the evidence in your life you know what you're talking you know what you're believing you know where you're going you know where you're heading right amen Joshua calb said hey we are not looking at those giants we looking in the promise of God his promise said I will give you the land amen and you shall possess that land he said we looking at the promise of God my brothers my sisters this morning I want to ask you question where are you looking at at what you're looking at are you looking at the promise are you discouraged in your life You' have been hearing about the coming of the Lord the prophet preached the Bible has preached you know so many apostles have preached he's coming soon Paul has written in several places he's coming soon he's coming soon I have been hearing since 44 years on right he's coming soon maybe some body is discouraged here today on my friends my brothers and sister our clocks or watches doesn't work like him no sir that's right we need to work according to the watch or clock of God and we need to we need to be patient we need to wait for God Amen if you're discouraged in in this way today said oh I've been hearing all these things don't be discouraged that because the promise is true amen yes sir amena This Promise will never fail Jesus said you believe in God he said believe also in me and he said in my father's house there are many mentions if there were not I would have told you he's not a liar he's not a bluffer right like the other one the Devil he's not a cheat he's not a devil he's not a liar he's not a deceiver he said I would tell you if there were no nothing like that I would have told you come on but he said in my father's house there are many manions he said I go to prepare a place he said I will come and take you brother we are waiting on that promise no matter another 30 years 20 years no matter how long brother we need to wait patiently because we know the promise is true amen and the one who made the promise is able that's it and the Bible says you are healed by the strives he had on Calvary you take that word and exercise your faith on that word I'm Healed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I'm Healed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you claim that healing no matter today you have symptoms keep claiming it keep thanking God tomorrow you have same symptoms just don't look at symptoms just keep thanking God if this week just keep thanking God yes sir exactly that's what we need to do a true attitude of a child of God be positive amen Abraham was positive for how long 25 years sir and the Bible says he never staggered at the promise of God it's very important brother sister what you're looking at today yes it's very important the prophet of God he says but this little mortal perverted thing that you live is called life you can take that when so desired but to show that that isn't life how miserable it becomes he said this what we call life now is only a shadow or a negative right that's right the life we living today which we call this is a perverted life brother brandom says and he says the life which we living is a shadow or a negative to make a positive it will take death brother brandham said right and he said we all like to Rejoice but we can Rejoice over right thing that shows that we are hooked up with a real thing when we Rejoice over the right thing but when we Rejoice over the wrong thing it shows we are hooked up with the wrong thing so our life can tell right now what we are which way our emotions are running do you see that right are you with me brothers and sisters he said if we are rejoicing over the world and the evil things our minds and our souls are inspired by below right and he speaks about Boogie Woogie dances heartaches drinking all of the things that we run after it's from below but he said but if you rejoice in the spirit amen if you're happy to come to church yeah when somebody tells you he said let's go for a prayer meeting praise the Lord Brother let's go when you rejoice in that when you rejoice to be in the company of godly people he said when you rejoice in the spirit that we have eternal life and we raise our emotions to God and praise him then we have joy am he said but not full of perverted life but full of eternal life that comes from above he said so you you can see it depends on what you to look at glory I pray that God will help us today to look at the right thing to look at the author and the finisher of our faith that's right amen praise the Lord our life will tell us many times people being a pastor I got 300 Now by God's grace this year God blessed us with 26 new Souls right in our church amen I'm so happy for that and we baptized about 105 people amen this year till I left my place 105 people all together so I'm thankful to God for the saving of souls you know I believe we are all looking for that last one to come in brother what a time it will be to go home but it it it it is only you know what you look at right the way you look at right our life will Express will tell us what we are right as a pastor I was telling just few minutes ago as a pastor I've got 300 and many people think you know they sit before the pastor when he preaches meeting after meeting and they think that Pastor doesn't know nothing but you know let me tell you SS this morning he said the Pastor is such a person if he's connected to the Living God right oh brother you will not imagine God what God will reveal it to him about your lives he's the one who knows everything of everybody he knows everything and when the man of God comes behind this Pulpit brother you will not imagine what God shows him exactly and sometimes you think you know our pastor doesn't know nothing you be careful yeah you be very careful you're just looking at a pastor you need to have an eye a spiritual eye that will go beyond the ve called flesh and look into his heart there is the Lord Jesus inside and brother when the pastor stands before you the Lord Jesus is standing before you and his eyes are right on your life he knows what you're thinking now he knows what you want to do after this service he knows what you did before this service he knows what you did yesterday he knows every thought that came to your mind exactly I can tell you stories from my own church how the Lord speaks yeah more than three four times I can tell you amen God knows everything right he knows what's inside our hearts and that's why it's always think before what you're looking at don't be Hasty don't be Hasty in talking don't be Hasty in thinking stop and see what you're looking at right it's very important I like to just put a little story before you if you don't mind brother Brandon was called one day to pray for a little boy his dad and mom old people he said and he was called to the hospital when he went to the hospital you know the doctor caught him right at the door and he said uh you cannot go in to pray because that boy has got deia he said you are a father you are a married man and you will pack that you know deia and you will take it to your children and brother Brandon began to talk to him and he said no he said I want to go and lay my hands on that little boy he said no sir you cannot go and by the way he was talking brother brandham found out that he was a Catholic man and he asked him he said you know what if the Catholic priest comes to give him a last ride would you allow him he said you know that's that thing is different because Catholic priest is not married you are a married man you got children you cannot go in but brother brandham said he talked it over and you know finally they dressed him with a hoodie you know and they covered his whole body and he had to wash his hands and he had to put gloves and and all kinds of things and he said he couldn't hardly see where he was walking but you know they finally took him into the room and he saw father and mother beside the boys's you know s bedside and as soon as brother brandom went in he began to you know pray for that little lad and brother brandom says while he was praying there was no vision God never gave him any sign or he never spoke to him anything he just prayed he said Lord he's got a good home to be raised good Godly Christian father and mother why you want to take his life Lord have mercy on this little one and save him father and he finished and as soon as brother Bram finished his prayer you know the father mother begin to cry and the tears begin to roll upon their cheeks and you know they begin to you know hug each other and and and the husband and the father of the boys said you know it is all well now he said you know our son is all right and and he will be well he's healed you know and they begin to worship God and and thank him and there was a little nurse in that room and he said how you people can act funny like that and then they and she took them to the machine he said see when this line runs low like this he said in few hours this boy will be dead he said you cannot act like this you cannot say like this you cannot feel like this and that old man he put his hand around that little nurse and she said child you are looking at the machines there you only learn to to see those line and you know what that means but he said child I'm looking at the promise of [Applause] God I'm looking at the promise of God and they begin to father and mother they begin to thank God said Thank you Lord for healing my child and the prophet of God said that that boy was grown up married had children right exactly amen amen it depends on what you're looking at right amen now I would like to tell my own experience my mother passed away and I was kind discouraged depressed you know always crying when I whenever I was alone I was just crying like a baby I loved my mom amen and I was missing her and that is a great burden to you know hold upon my shoulder and my wife's shoulder and brother when that dream came to me all my burdens rolled away yes sir right it depends the way you look at things amen till August the 5th I was looking the death of my brother in a different way right I thought it was a loss I thought it was a grief even though I have studied the message I have preached brother Brenham says death for a Christian is not the end it's a beginning I have preached myself right but being in flesh losing Mom right that's true but I was looking at her death in a different way but fifth of August the Lord came and and he cleared the whole scenario right and now I look in other way thank you Lord and that does that doesn't make me feel sorrowful that makes me happy because she's in a better place it depends on on the way you look at things this may be very simple to you friends but this has really blessed me and this thing has really was on my heart at 1:23 a.m. this morning and I don't wanted to change it I got a big bunch of papers like this carrying with me wherever I'm traveling but you know it's not good to have so many messages in your in your bag if God is Not There I want him I want him on the scene and if it doesn't bless anybody here and one person that's it that's where I'm looking for I just recently preached a service in Smithville Tennessee and I felt that day I said oh my I'm a flop today the way people responded you know and the things I seen when I was preaching I said man I'm a plop it's utter failure today but you know the brother called for the prayer and there one man in the corner he got up and he came and he shook my hand he said you pray that God has spoken to me this night amen said I needed it God spoke to me said God touch my life Brother s will you pray for me and ask God's help and I pray with you I said we both pray together right that brother he began to pray and I began to pray I thank God later on I said Lord I thought I was a failure but you know God put Abraham before us no matter how you how you see things and circumstances no matter how you feel about things just be positive amen just keep believing God glory amen praise the Lord he stayed positive with God you know brother brandham says he said he says you know that's the way Abraham was doing he stayed right with the Positive no matter if people said say you know that old fellow so joining with us up here he's about half crazy his wife is old feeble woman so look how old he is and the gray whiskers and the hair hanging down to his waistline almost and then he says they are going to have a baby did you ever hear of anything such a kind have you ever heard this yeah he said he's off crazy oh yeah he was I believe he was crazy for his God he believed him so much he knew it would happen one day and no matter people call call us a cult today amen that's right it's it's it's so shocking to say people who preached this message called it a cult M I'm not a good internet man I'm an illiterate actually but this news I get from my young people in the church he said oh they called us a cult I said okay they called Jesus amen Belo they called him of the de he was of the devil they called him illegitimate child that that didn't affect him right so this thing will not affect us right amen praise the Lord because we got the evidence amen we have taken the sides of positive brother Bram says he said it depends on how much Statics you tune tune out yeah it's unbelief right he said how much unbelief you take out of your life how much you inject faith in you right brother Bram says I'm looking at Faith and that faith cannot be perished so what we looking at today today amen right at perishable world or the perishable things or the unish perishable Faith amen it depends on what you look at may God help us today to look you know the way God wanted us to love amen praise the Lord I got many things to say but I don't want to wear you out but I would like to let let you know a few things when Isaiah saw him he saw counselor Prince of Peace Mighty God Amen Everlasting father he saw him the Messiah amen when is when Daniel saw he said he saw us a stone that was heed out of the mountain without hands and crushed the Gentile Nations you know when Ezekiel Saw he said he saw a wheel in a wheel praise the Lord you know when Nebuchadnezzar saw he just thought that he was increasing the fire but he he saw the four man come down from heaven praise the Lord you know we need to just see how the how the prophets and the prophets of the old saw we need to see the way our prophets are amen you know Jesus when he was on this Earth he challenged those people they couldn't see him NE sorry Nicodemus couldn't see the new birth right everywhere he went and preached the same thing but some people understand you know even in the even in the ranks you see you know his own own uh disciples you know there who whom do you think what do you call what do you think about me they said you are Elias or you know you're you're one of the prophets but Peter with the right Revelation he said no you are the son of a living God that's right the word Christ and he said on this rock I will build my church and I believe God is doing that today he's building his Church on the Rock called the Revelation think about that when you think about John the Baptist he was the only one that saw the Lamb of God right there were thousands of people around him he was the only one that saw the D he was the only one that heard the voice this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased right it depends on the way you look at right Hallelujah I like to read the last quote looking unto Jesus brother brandham paragraph 12 and you say I have done that it depends on what you looked at determines what you look at right is where what you look for him now for what you're looking for what what are you looking at what purpose do you have in looking at him that's right it only depends on what you look for that's what you will find what you're looking for you will find may God may God help us today to see things right right let us see things through the eye of Jesus Christ let us see things through faith we don't walk by sight we walk by faith Amen Let The Eyes of Faith be open today may God help us today Hallelujah I love you all God bless you I turn this service to the man of [Applause] God can you say amen amen that's true isn't it yes sir amen hallelujah let's give our brother a good hand thank we believe it believe it it's true you know what a lot of people think a lot of things about saying a cult or anything you ever looked it up to see what it means something different from days you ever looked up the definition of a cult and then I scream amen I'm a cop right amen but you're thinking it's bad you know what it means look it up anything contrary to accepted practice absolutely look it up that's what it mean anything contrary something contrary to accepted practice right well I'm contrary to accepted practice because the world accepted this they accept the Trinity they accept all of these doctrines and all I don't accept that I'm glad to to be called a cult what do you think about it go ahead brother what we got number anybody have a need now the altar is open come
