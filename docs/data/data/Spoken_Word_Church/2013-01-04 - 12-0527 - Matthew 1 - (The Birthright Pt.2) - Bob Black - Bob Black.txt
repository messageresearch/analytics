========================================

turn to Matthew chapter 1 cuz that's really in the context of what we've been talking about is is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ brother we we're at Matthew chapter 1 verse one the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham we'll just read a few verses Abraham begat Isaac and Isaac begat Jacob and Jacob begat Judas and his Brethren and Judas begat FZ and Zarah of Tamor and farz be ezam and ezam be Aram and Aram beat aminadab and aminadab be and they S Salon and a lot of people over the years have put um I was reading about St Augustine put devoted pretty much his entire life to rectifying what seems like problems between this genealogy and Luke's genealogy there's people missing there's people that um and the names seem to be different between Matthew and Luke but it's all there's a story here that's absolutely perfect that goes down from uh starting at Abraham and we were talking about the birthright and and kind of witnesses to the this coming son of David and how the birthright is going to be manifested in n in the natural people and a spiritual people and um when uh in Matthew it talks about the son of David the son of Abraham a son means to the Jews it meant it could mean grandson or um so that you could in Matthew it skips a few Generations here and there and I will go into that more more detail later but um what we were talking talking about in in last time was the birthright with Abraham so just to kind of uh this is a little bit confusing if you don't see where we're going um but just to kind of give an overview of how the birth right goes down through generations it starts at Abraham with the promise Covenant goes to Isaac and get gets every step it gets magnified more promises are uh the promises are magnified to Jacob and then uh you know what's really interesting is that each generation the the birthright is supposed to go to the firstborn but none of these are the firstborn uh if if you look at Isaac it should have been if you just look at the firstborn it should have been Israel Jacob should have been Esau uh Judah should have been Reuben and uh when you get to Jacob and and uh Reuben the first part was taken from Reuben and given not to Judah which is the genealogy but it's given to Joseph and eph and then uh further down the genealogy go through the children of Israel in the wilderness the um 40 years in the wilderness get down to Solomon so you got Solomon then the uh genealogies get split the riol which was the son of Solomon and Jobo and it's important to remember two of these major key points of the birth right is that there's a promise of of kings that we will become spiritual kings that we will Reign Over The World the Flesh the uh problems of that the devil brings against us and uh that is testified in rabol in judah's lineage because he's the he get we'll look at the scripture where it says that the scepter given to Judah but the birth right to Joseph and the birth right the other the other component of the birth right is that uh is the promise of many nations and as we follow it down Joseph and Ephraim uh eventually they'll get uh they go into captivity in Assyria and U they go they the 10 lost tribes that get dispersed amongst the world dispersed to all the many nations that's a natural type a natural the natural part of the promise but the spiritual part of the promise is that we by taking on the Seed of Abraham the spiritual seed we can stand next to these and say we have Abraham to our father too not by a natural genealogy but by spiritual genealogy because just like uh Christ had uh the birth right was given to the son so the birth right was given to from Abraham to Isaac Isaac to Jacob but Jesus when he came he didn't have a natural father neither did he have a natural son he had to give an air to us the air was to the spiritual seed and uh his spiritual father was was God um so let's uh let's go back and look at let's see we're just kind of looking at what the birthright is I got in trouble years ago for uh I was uh telling a little Bible story to this Ministry brothers that was visiting my family and I was telling about how the birthright is the I was telling the story of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and I said the birth right is uh the promise of the Holy Ghost cuz that's really what all the the birthright promises are looking forward to Jesus one day coming so um you'd be surprised how many people um and not knocking off anybody or anything it it's just something a little truth that um just keep in mind as as we go through this and here's what brother Rand said about the birthright and hearing recognizing acting on the word of God and I I read this last time I just to re redo it now anyone knows that the Seal of God is the birthright the baptism of the Holy Ghost Ephesians 4:30 says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby your seal till the day of your Redemption when they were born again they were filled with the Holy Spirit the holy spirit is the new birth we know that you're begotten of the spirit I'll admit that and then uh hearing receiving and acting in 1960 he says and the birthright let me see he's talking about Jacob um the birthright been nothing to Esau frankly he despised it and I say this with all reverence his children still does that's right he despises it and the birthright is the holy spirit we already know that and the carnal believer despises that oh he said them days are pass there's no such a thing as receiving the Holy Ghost anymore that was back in the apostles time in the in the church age book he said when Ahab married Jezebel for political reasons he sold his Birthright he join up you join up with an organization and you sell your Birthright brother whether you want to believe it or not every Protestant group that ever came out and then went back sold their Birthright and when you sell your Birthright you're just like Esau you can cry and repent all you want but it won't do you any good there's only one thing you can do and that is come out of her my people and stop partaking of her sins now if you don't think I am right just answer this one question can any man living tell me what church or what move of God ever had Revival and came back after she went into organization and became a denomination read your history you can't find one not even one so uh all of these Birthright blessings speak of the coming of the blessings that are part of the new birth and the first one we want to look at is um Deuteronomy 21 verse 15 through 17 if a man have two wives one beloved and another hated and they have born in children both the Beloved and the hated and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated then it shall be when he maketh his sons to inherit that which he hath that he may not make the son of the Beloved firstborn before the son of the hated which is indeed the firstborn but he shall acknowledge the son of the Hat the firstborn by giving him a double portion of all that he hath for he is the beginning of his strength the ride of the firstborn is his so the the firstborn or the the the right of the birth right of the firstborn is to get a double portion and you know brother bandam talked about the double portion being a type of Christ in the church that Christ uh like just like Elijah went to glory and uh a double portion of his Spirit was put back on the church to do Greater Works to you know Jesus was in one place but now the bride is spread around all all around the world so um more Works can be done just like uh just like the double portion that came back on Elijah so the double portion is all through scripture that the promise and um another thing to note is the firstborn is supposed to get the birth right but the birth right just like the Holy Ghost is transferable if you don't if you don't accept it uh you know just like uh Esau or ishma well is Esau um Turned down the birthright it was even to Jacob Reuben because of his actions he slept with his father's uh conbine I think and uh it was given to Judah or Joseph so you got to um you got to accept it um Another Blessing was Genesis 27 29 Genesis 27 oh let's see Genesis 27 let start at verse 26 this is Isaac blessing Jas Jacob and his father Isaac said unto him come near now and kiss kiss me my son and he came near and kissed him and he smelled the smell of his rment and blessed him and said see the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the Lord has blessed now everybody everybody pins Jacob down as being such a Shyer and a little uh kind of a naughty boy but how much worse was it what Esau did that he bued the birthright the promises of God he valued it so little that he would trade it for a just a little piece of cenal soup that always think about that when I'm in the grocery store and see the lenel that's what Esau traded his Birthright for therefore God give thee of the Dew of Heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine let people serve thee and Nations bow down to thee be Lord over thy Brethren and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee cursed be everyone that curseth thee and blessed be the be he that blessed thee so he gives them a promise of of natural plenty that he'll be blessed with the fatness of the land and plenty of corn and wine everything he has need of because God is Jehovah J our provider uh people will let people serve thee Nations will bow down before him um he'll be Lord over his Brethren and um everyone that curses them will be cursed and everyone that blesses them will be blessed and that's some good promises to lay cl to um so we got this promise of a many nations that uh Kings will come out of them we've also got another promise of a priesthood because the um the first born until the Levites were the first born was the the priest of the home he was um he led the family in sacrifice he taught his family the way of forgiveness was through the shed blood that there was a covering for sin and uh he was the uh I guess the the word was revealed to the the one with the firstborn so that he could impart it to you know Isaac the word came to him when he when he blessed Jacob after he blessed him he said and he will be blessed because he knew that it was it was something that God gave him um so he was the communicator of the Divine secret now think about this in the context of your Holy Ghost experience that God's word is revealed to you if you're born of the Holy Ghost just like the birthright the firstborn birth orite in the Old Testament was the communicator of the divine secrets to his family and taught his family the way to live the firstborn was supposed to live a consecrated life to live a holy life for his family and and the world and to make intercession for his family and let's look at for an example and make an intercession let's look at Genesis 25 oh I might have rot the wrong one now second well this is when uh Rebecca was I'm sorry I can't find it but I I'll just tell you what it is Rebecca uh was bar and it's the scripture where it says um oh here it is verse 2521 let's start at verse 20 and Isaac was 40 years old when he took Rebecca to wife the daughter of Bethel the Syrian of PanAm the sister to laan the Syrian and Isaac entreated the Lord for his wife because she was bued and the Lord was intreated of him and Rebecca his wife conceived so Isaac had the birthright and he uh interceded for his family and that's uh I think that's an important part to remember if if you fill with the Holy Ghost you can you definitely have the right to intercede for your family if I I remember many times through my marriage my wife will wake up in the middle of the night and say I'm hurting somewhere or whatever you just leave lay your hand on her and pray for her in the middle of the night and everything will be all right and it um it bothers me if if that doesn't happen if you you know you pray for somebody and something your prayer is not answered it should bother all of us because this is a Birthright blessing to us that we have a right to intercede and to call on God for the things we have need of um let's look at Exodus 22 verse 29 God took he was going to take the firstborn and then later on he took the Levis instead and we'll go through how that came about Thou shalt not delay to offer the first of thy right fruits and of thy Liquors the firstborn of thy son shalt thou give unto me so the first born was always pecul peculiar know the firstborn was always always consecrated to God I'm not going to try to say that word um and they were next in honor to their parents let's go to Genesis 49 verses 3 and four this is where Jacob called all his sons together and he's telling that Reuben you were the first born but you're not going to get the birth right verse three uh let's start at verse two gather yourselves together and hear ye sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel your father Reuben Thou Art my first born my might the beginning of my strength the Excellency of dignity and the Excellency of power unstable as water Thou shalt not Excel because thou wentest up to thy father's bed then defiles thou it he went up to my couch so uh even though Ruben didn't get it this is still an example of how the the firstborn is is is the uh they're next after their father their parents because they're in line to receive the blessings of the birthright in Deuteronomy 21 it talked about the double portion and then uh second Chron I'll just read it 2 Chronicles 21:3 uh uh the the uh this is where Jehosaphat is um jeor succeeded Jehoshaphat and he said and their father gave them great gifts of silver and of gold and of precious things with fent cities in Judah but the kingdom gave he to jehoram because he was the first born and um let's see what we going next until the uh Tabernacle and Temple the firstborn had the right of conducting the service of god let's go to numbers 8 verse 14 16 so until uh you know when the children of Israel were uh in were drawn out of or C out of Egypt then God took the first born that night before they left by um the firstborn of the non-israelites that unless you had that blood over the L of your door the first born was going to die cuz he's going to take the first born then they took the uh the Levites uh instead of taking the firstborn of all Israel he took the Le the first he took the Levites as the first born so verse 14 Thou shalt th sht thou separate the Levites from among the children of Israel and the Levites shall be mine and after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of the Tabernacle of the congregation and thou shall cleanse them and offer them for an offering let's see so just to review that the birth right is um a double portion it's a a symbol of the power and dignity it's both spiritual and temporal because there's a a natural lineage of the birth right that goes through Judah and and many to Joseph and ephra and uh there's also a spiritual birth right that we get by being part of Christ part of his seed he is the seed um and the birthright comes with the privilege of being uh uh the communicator of the divine secrets and this is where you know in this Modern Age that if you say that God talks to you then you're just branded as a uh uh uh just a lunatic um the foolishness of the world you know was wisdom to God um but that's that was part of the mark of of having the birthright that God spoke to Abraham and revealed to him his word and the same thing with Isaac and Jacob and Joseph and uh it's a link in the line of descent through which the Messiah would be born and it represents Kings many nations and the priesthood and we'll see as we get down through here that um uh when the reabo J were separated Levi stayed with uh they went with jeroboam and then later on part of the Levites came back to rabo because jeroboam set up an altar in in Dan and Beth and uh wouldn't let them come back to Jerusalem to worship so the Levites later on they went back to riol um so this was this ended up being Judah uh the tribe of Judah Benjamin and some of the Levites so that's why uh down through history that uh the Jews are called These are these are called Jews these are called Israelites uh but we'll get into that more in detail as we go along so let's start looking at the Kings the uh the Royal Line lineage let's look at Genesis 49 verse 10 so we already read how Jacob got all his sons around and he gathered them together and said Ruben you're not going to get the birth right cuz you uh slept with your father's um why for concubine and verse 10 of chap 49 the septer shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until Shiloh come and unto him shall the Gathering of the people be now this is an important scripture because you know the Jews uh to this day they say Christ was not the Messiah but this scripture testifies this is one of the key scriptures in the Bible of who the Messiah is because it says uh the she scepter shall not depart from Judah so Judah is got the the scepter all down through the if you look at the genealogy of Judah is father to son father to son unbroken unlike uh jar b b's lineage that has eight different Generations they you know a father might have a son and then he gets killed and another generation another gen uh uh another group of people come in and take over the kingdom but that's different with Judah it's unbroken all the way down to uh Christ and then shallows come so there's no more there's nobody else on the throne because Christ takes over so that's that's a testimony that uh who's who's uh you can't say if you look at uh Jerusalem now and say who's sitting on the on the throne there's nobody there because uh Shiloh has come so this is a testimony that that the Messiah has definitely come does that make sense um let's see and then I'll just read this next one 1st Chronicles 51-2 um I already read that sons of Reuben the firstborn of J he gathered his no I didn't read that I'm sorry now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel for he was the firstborn for as much as he defiled his father's bed his birth birth right was given un the sons of Joseph the son of Israel and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the birthright for Judah prevailed above his Brethren and of him came the chief ruler but the birthright was Joseph's so the geneology ghost of Judah to the Messiah the birthright is Joseph's and um and this is I know brother Wes talked about in in when you get to Revelations the uh first chapter and he has made us Kings and Priests unto God and his father to him a glory and Dominion forever and ever he has made us Kings and Priests just like in the Old Testament he made natural Kings and Priests through Judah and even through Jobo and in in the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ brother R said he ha made us oh there are certain truths we need to emphasize this is one of them he hath made us salvation is his doing salvation is of the Lord all of Grace he redeemed us for a purpose he brought us for a purpose we are Kings spiritual Kings or we are going to be Kings upon the Earth with him when he sits on his throne but now we are spiritual Kings and we Reign Over a spiritual Kingdom it says in Romans 5:17 for by one man's offense death reain by one much more they which receive abundance of Grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ and in Colossians 13 who ha delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom reign of his dear son right now we reign with Christ having dominion over sin the World the Flesh and the devil showing forth his praise and glory showing forth himself for it is Christ in US willing and doing of his good pleasure yes indeed even now we are seated in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus to the promises that were that were made at the the very beginning to Abraham to have many nations and to have Kings come out of him are made uh are just opened up in the seals and uh because we're part of part of this plan part of that Birthright and God being misunderstood he said does not Paul say that he dares any of us to take a matter to the court to the unjust magistrate when know you not that the Saints shall judge the Earth we will sit with Christ and judge Kings and Priests and judge these people that we preach to and told them about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they refused ref to receive it think of it and then uh priests CU being a priest of your a lead a spiritual leader of of the family was a part of the birth right so now we're going to talk about the history of the levitical priesthood and how it started from the first born and we have just a few more minutes so I'll kind of get started with that uh in Revelations 26 it says blessed and holy is he that hath par in the first resurrection on such the second death hath no power but they shall be Priests of God and of Christ and shall reign with him a thousand years so as preach in this in this new kingdom that the son of David came to manifest we uh in the in the temple the priests would um the altar the of incense represented prayer we alter up by praise and thanksgiving and brother Brown talked about that we can now uh the veil has been rented so we can go behind the veil for tape and um actually this this is probably a good place to stop before we get into that so let's go ahead and stop in
