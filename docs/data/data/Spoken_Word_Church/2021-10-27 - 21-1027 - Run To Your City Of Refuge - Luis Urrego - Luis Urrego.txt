you just expect that it's going to be boring and it's going to be then that's what you'll get but if you expect god is going to do something for me god's going to speak to me through his word amen god's going to use the lips of that of that man up there amen who's who's spitting all over that pulpit and he amen i believe that i'm gonna get something from that amen if you come with that attitude god will be able to bless you amen praise the lord so let's read about this tonight in joshua chapter 20. it says here the lord also spake unto joshua saying speak to the children of israel saying a point out for you cities of refuge where if i spake unto you by the hand of moses that the slayer that killeth any person unawares and unwittingly may flee thither and they shall be your refuge from the avenger of blood now we'll break this down here in just a little bit amen if you don't know if you're not understanding right now and when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall stand at the entering of the gate of the city and shall declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city they shall take him into the city unto them and give him a place that he may dwell among them and if the avenger of blood pursue after him then they shall not deliver the slayer up into his hand because he smote his neighbor unwittingly and hated him not before time and he shall dwell in that city until he stand before the congregation for judgment and until the death of the high priest that shall be in those days then shall the slayer return and come unto his own city and unto his own house unto the city from whence he fled and they appointed kiddish in galilee in mount neptali and shechem in mount ephraim and kurdish tharbha which is hebron in the mountain of judah and on the other side jordan by jericho eastward deyassan biezer in the wilderness upon the plane out of the tribe of reuben the the bible here is naming each one of these cities right here uh out of the travel reuben and raymond and gilead out of the tribe of god and golan and basian out of the tribe of manasseh these were the cities appointed for all the children of israel watch this for all the children of israel and for the stranger that sojourneth among them that whosoever killeth any person that unawares might flee thither and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood until he stood before the congregation amen may the lord have a blessing to read the word amen let's just bow our heads before we sit down our heavenly father we just thank you once again lord for the opportunity that we have lord to speak father god to the not just any regular people lord but it's your purchase of your blood lord jesus and father we just thank you lord for uh allowing us to be able to even even open back the pages of your word lord and and lord thank you for bringing us here we ask that you were just anoint the hear lord their their ears and anoint the lips father they will speak tonight i'm insufficient within myself but lord god i know that i can do all things through christ who strengthens me and so lord help us to get something father that would help us lord in our christian walk that would make us better christians that would make us better sons and daughters lord we ask you that you'd be in our midst and speak to our hearts and and continue to be with those that those requests heal the ones that need healing amongst us and we ask these things now in the mighty name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated tonight praise god amen i haven't i haven't started i had to take my coat off praise god amen so like i said i want to title this run to your city of refuge amen run to your city of refuge and and i i worded it this way your city of refuge because that's how the the bible here you can read about this city of refuge in in in different places in the word amen uh it's lo you can read it in the book of deuteronomy uh chapter 4 and also in the book of deuteronomy chapter 19 as well as numbers chapter 35 and numbers chapter 35 is a more detailed look at the cities of refuge now maybe you've heard this uh you know what this is this is about but maybe some people don't know maybe some young people don't know about the cities of refuge and and it's so interesting that god amen no matter what law he puts into place he always has some some form of grace some form of mercy amen for some form of escape for each and every one of us amen there is a place tonight saying that you don't have to be sitting there wallowing in your sin you don't have to be sitting there wallowing in your condemnation you don't have to be sitting there wallering in what you did yesterday or what you did last week amen god has made a way for you to go and escape amen the slayer that's after you and we know who the slayer is spiritually amen our slayer is satan and and and and and really when we come into this world he has claims on you brother branham even brought it so far that is he is actually you're married to satan when you're when you don't have christ you're actually married to satan when you are not a christian amen you are married to him so he has full claims of you amen he has full claims on you and he is after you to destroy you he's not after you to help you he's not after you to give you a good job he's not after you to give you i mean if he will give you a good job if if it's going to make you stay out of church oh he'll give you a good job then oh this is a blessing this is a blessing you might say or you might think but the satan knows exactly what you do to hinder you in your christian walk he is out there to destroy the bible says he's there to destroy kill he's like a royal lion seeking who he he may uh eat with you know have lunch with have a picnic with no seeking who he may devour you are his lunch amen you are his dinner praise god and so he has full claims on us now and so in looking at at this city of refuge here praise god uh you know in today's news you know we hear a lot about the refugees you know refugees uh coming into into different countries we got a lot of them coming in right now matter of fact i'm even rethinking about doing mission trip now they're all coming here borders are just wide open like nothing's happening but but you know brother bam did say that you know the united states is going to end up being one of the most countries that's going to end up being one needs more missionaries and maybe that's that's where that gets fulfilled amen but um so a lot of refugees and what a refugee is is they're coming to cu to to they're they're going to another country to seek refuge or protection from the country that they're leaving from let's say they're leaving mexico and they come to the united states amen they're coming for a protection amen if something if their life is in danger their family's life is in danger you see and so that's what the the word refugee means now the word refuge amen the word refuge means a shelter a protection a safety a security an asylum a sanctuary a preservation safe keeping praise god now doesn't that sound like what our lord jesus christ is amen he is our shelter praise god he he is our protection i don't know of any better protection amen than our lord jesus christ praise god he is our safety he is our security amen he's got more security than your than your house alarm will ever have praise god he's got more security than your car alarm will ever have praise god more security than even the police out here could ever give you amen he is the security of securities amen now i don't know about asylum because asylum does have a negative connotation to it amen but he is our sanctuary praise god a sanctuary or a place where you you know a lot of people today they want to create their sanctuary and and they're there doing you know uh you know meditating and and burning candles and burning you know essential oils and that's their sanctuary you know you know and doing all this all this stuff you know whatever that's a sanctuary they're at peace see he is our peace we don't need to be doing that you know we just need to live and talk with him and read his word amen praise god we just need to we just need to abide with him amen and he abide with us praise god and he is our preservation he is our safe keeping another another uh uh definition is a condition of refuge a condition of being safe or sheltered from pursuit danger or trouble praise god a condition of being safe or shelter from pursuit danger or trouble praise the lord how many have been have been chased by a dog before oh yeah brother wade he knows what being chased by a dog is he's a mailman well i've i've had several times when i've been chased by a dog and let me tell you it's not fun it doesn't matter how big or small the dog is if the dog is showing his teeth and barking at you something i mean you get scared especially when you're younger now you know it gets to a point where you know what you just you know kick them and they'll calm down but a lot of animal activists wouldn't like that i remember one time i was going down uh minding my own business back in south carolina and here i was just walking down the street getting ready to go home and here and all of a sudden this dog just jumps out from this house it was loose it was about mid-sized dog and he starts barking and so as i'm walking i just stop i'm just there i mean i can go i can go this way or i can go that way but the barking of a mad dog i mean it it it it freezes you you see and he's just there barking and i knew when he was showing those teeth oh my and so the only thing i could do was take off i took off and here i see the dog market behind me and i got home i knew that if i get to my shelter amen to my place of refuge i'd be safe from the dog amen luckily the dog he got tired of chasing me i can't believe i was out running the dog amen i outran the dog you don't know what you can do when you got adrenaline amen just going all over uh you know adrenaline gets very high i mean you're a superman praise god but i ran the dog and when i got home i was safe i was safe from the dog i was safe from anything else amen that is a refuge praise the lord there was another time when uh there was a bully that we used to live with in a and we used to live in an apartment complex there in south carolina and there was a bully in the apartment complex and i would we would hang out together but then sometimes he'd just hit all of a sudden he'd be cool sometimes and then sometimes he'd just like he'd just want to bully you you know so he got up in my face one time we were playing and i was like he just got up all in my face and he's like you know what you gonna do and i was just sitting there i was only like maybe like fourth grade something like that i was just sitting there i was just kind of backing up next thing i know i just threw a punch pow and i took off running i wasn't gonna sit there because i knew what he was getting ready to do i took out running i knew that about in a minute i'd get to my house and sir i got to my house he was running after me too he was running after i got to my house and here he come but i knew if i got to my house my dad was there yeah and he was going to come out and he took care of it but bully said i'll be back that's what satan does amen that's what he did to jesus amen jesus he said he the bible said that when he tempted jesus amen he fled for a season he came back but jesus by jesus being the word amen there was no match for him amen there was no match for the avenger praise god see satan thought that he had claims on jesus amen and he was talking to his creator yeah he was talking to his creator right there praise god amen so that is what a refuge means amen a place of safety praise god and so when looking here at this at this book of the book of joshua and like i said you can read this in detail in numbers chapter 35 and and and what it was it was in the law in the law of moses amen god's commandments god if some if a man was going to take took the life of another man or killed another man or murdered another man intentionally or with hate amen or or or did it you know did it intentionally that man's life was supposed to be taken as well by the others by by others so it was an eye for an eye tooth for a tooth you see and that was that was the law of god you see you might ask why is it that god allowed that that way it was because life was so precious to god amen the life was so precious to god that if you took another man's life and it was in so much that even if an animal would take a man's life that animal was supposed to be die it was to die as well amen animal activists wouldn't like that either but that's what god said [Music] but now god made a way that if a man unintentionally took the life of another man or accidentally killed another man and it wasn't his intention to do it there was a way that god made made a way of escape for that man to not be killed as well and brother brandon brought it this way he said that let's pretend that there was two men that they were they were in the woods and they were chopping wood and they had their their axes and they were chopping wood and all of a sudden the axe head comes off of the of one of their axe and hits the other man in the head and kills him you see now nobody saw what had happened only he knew what had happened and he knew that he did not do it intentionally he did not kill that man intentionally but what but according to the law he knew that that person's father or that or that person's son or that person's uncle or the they had the rights to kill that man whether he did it intentionally or not unless he ran to a city of refuge unless he ran to the closest city of refuge praise god and so the best thing that that man could do at that moment was take and run to the closest city of refuge because as soon as the family would find out that their father was dead that they didn't have their their brother was dead or or the hu or husband was dead or a wife was dead or whatever amen they were after that person because according to the law they had the rights to go do that an eye for a knife tooth for a tooth amen and so what would happen is that this man would go and man he'd start running to the city of refuge as fast as he could and he would get there and the people of the city amen they would take him and then they were and he would he would explain their case to him and say listen i i shed innocent blood i didn't intentionally kill this man and they're after me and they would let him in but they would pl they would also they they were levites in there and they were they were man of wisdom that they would look at his case and they would judge righteously whether he unintentionally or intentionally killed that man or not and so it's interesting that it was levites they were in those cities because in all 48 of the cities and you can go back and read all of this in those cities there were levites those cities belong to levites and so levite priests and so that man was safe and that man could stay there no and no matter if that if the if the if the avenger would come hey give me that man he's he he killed my my husband or he killed my brother or whatever he could not do anything to him because he was in safety amen he was in that city of refuge there was nothing that could be done praise god and so you could just look at this saints and it's just it it it types christ perfectly saints it types christ amen because some of us sometimes say and it and this has happened to me amen sometimes instead of us going amen to where we need to go amen if we falter if we fail and we run and we need to run is to christ amen not back to the world not back to the things that led you to do what you need what you did amen but run to christ run to the one that can lead you amen that can that can safely shelter you that can forgive your sins amen that can give you peace in the midst of your condemnation amen but what do we do sometimes amen we waller in our sin i'm like well i might as well just keep going amen and that'll never work you know what's going to happen you're going to die what if the man that stayed right there amen that accidentally killed that man if he said well i'll just wait just a little bit longer you know he was going gonna die he was gonna die well i mean what if he said what if he said well i mean you know uh i don't like that city over there i think i'll just go over here you know uh he was gonna die he was going to die because that wasn't the word of god that was his city of refuge that was where he was supposed to go to be protected amen well if he said if he said well i i you know i'll i'll just go i'll just go later or or or i'll just uh you know just make some sort of excuse amen or i'll run to the baptist church or i'll run to the pentecostal church well i'll just go to church amen i'll just i'll be a good christian and you have not run to that city of refuge amen or i'll just i'll just be a good brother and sister i'll shake the brothers hands at church the sisters hands i'll smile at them i'll i'll look like a christian and you have not run to the refuge amen you're going to die because our refuge and our shelter is in christ amen it's not in anything else it's not in another church it's not in another system brother wade is not your refuge brother dell can't be your refuge i can't be your refuge no ministers here can be a refuge the only refuge is in christ jesus amen your mom and dad can't be a refuge amen nobody else can rep amen sometimes some people even had our last president as their refuge and you see how that went and some people even have our current president as their refuge and you see how that's going yeah the bible says that cursed is the man who trusts in man you can't trust anything else outside of christ you can't trust anything else outside of this word amen praise god i don't know where i could find peace like the peace that i find in christ i don't know where i can find joy like the joy that i find in christ i don't know where i can find amen have a good time like the good time that i can have in christ praise god that is the best time i've ever had when i thought i was having a good time when i was out in the world hey man the next day i was i was sick throwing up i thought i was having a good time i was then i'm told the next day throwing up and oh god headache that's not a good time young people so if if your heart is long longing for things like that i hope it's not let me just be real with you if your heart is longing for oh my if i could just if i knew what it was like to be in a club and not oh my and and just do all that stuff you know and and wear my my shorts all the way up to here and show off my body and and and guys you know just uh you know what they do you see it all in you you even see it out in the people out here i'm gonna tell you that looks all tantalizing and it looks good and it looks very not but let me tell you that it comes with consequences everything has consequences everything has consequences so you think oh my alcohol is great one beer is good amen but then it'll turn into two beers then it'll turn into three next thing you know you're you're slapped drunk amen and a man is right there waiting to rape you if you're not careful you see what it leads to because i've seen it i've seen it in the world that i lived in so it's nothing it's nothing pretty like the picture like the like what the slayer satan would portray it to you it's not that it's not that way amen it's not pretty praise god my goodness i got off the house somebody made needed amen but aren't you thankful that there is a place that you can run for safety amen you don't need to go back you know when when we were depressed out in the world what happened amen those of us who lived out in the country and and here in the south what did they do they'd go listen to country music i lost my my dog i lost my wife my truck done died and and and uh and you're there with that same spirit you know just feeding off the same spirit and it's all over you i don't lost my dog i don't lost my wife there's a tear in my beard cause i'm crying for you dear [Laughter] i know you see it's the same spirit i remember i remember and even those who you know i used to listen to hip-hop and all that and when you wanted to feel like you were you were you know you were powerful and you you know you had the upper hand over people and all that kind of stuff what do you do you listen to hip-hop you listen to rap you listen to all that all that kind of stuff that makes you feel like or where you want to have a upper hand over women you listen to hip-hop you listen to rap because that's the that's the spirit behind that music i remember a brother one time he was telling me that he was getting ready to mug a a man or or he was going to commit some sort of crime this was before he became a christian and he said brother i remember i was in the car i was planning everything out and i was in my car and i was i was there i was listening to gangster rap i was just prepping myself amen prepping my mind so that i can go ahead and do that you those things prep your mind so that you can go do what you think that you're not so that's why we have to be careful with the music that we hear you think you think it's just nagging at you but let me tell you we've been through that each and every one of us we've we've been through that i know what it's like i know what i've been through all kinds of music and and and let me tell you if you're not careful it will cause you to do things that you think that you would never do because why satan is the satan was this was the second uh created this next to god most important next to god and what he was the the one who was directing the choir up in heaven he was the song leader so he knows all about music so anything that is outside of of good godly music that makes you think about god if it's outside of that it's not of god it's of the slayer of satan anything that's causing you a man to to cheat on your wife anything that's causing you a man to think lustful thoughts to do smoke weed to do all that stuff do you think it comes from god it can't it's not of god amen it's of satan it's of the slayer and so and so if you run back to those things amen instead of you running to christ praise god that's right you're just going to be wallering in there and you're going to die because you're not under your city or refuge amen praise god amen so these cities are refuge amen we're for everyone the bible says there in numbers chapter 35 verse 15 these six cities shall be a refuge both for the children of israel and for the stranger and for the sojourner among them that everyone that killeth any person unawares that they didn't know may flee theater so it's just not just for the for the message believer it's not just for it's not just for for you amen it's for everyone the bible says whosoever will amen let him run amen the bible says in john chapter 3 verse 16 that for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever shall believeth on him should not perish but have everlasting life you might think oh my i can't live up to that to the life of of of brother so and so or sister so and so but let me tell you he's saying whosoever will anybody could run to the city of refuge anybody didn't have to be an israelite didn't have to be a message believer anybody could run to the city of to to that city of refuge and christ was right there with open arms the people were right there with open arms ready to receive because that's what that city was made for that's why christ is there he's not there gonna he's not gonna be there to condemn you he's not gonna be there to add more more more hindrance to your life than you what you already have amen he is right there to give you exactly what you need praise god amen now jesus he he he treats everyone the same amen amen you know in this in this day then time that we live and amen everybody feels there's people out there they're they're saying i you know i don't feel equal you know and i don't feel you know that uh it doesn't matter to him amen no matter what the color no matter what the gender amen to god everybody's the same that's right amen and he will receive him just the same praise god the only thing is is that you need to run to him praise the lord you need to run to him matthew 11 28 tells us amen jesus said come unto me all that are weary and heavy laden and i will give you rest amen you can't find rest anywhere else but in christ amen in our city of refuge praise the lord amen you know we're just getting i'm just getting uh uh uh i'm getting uh uh uh started already on my trip to central america now you know with the heat now [Laughter] i'm just gonna that's fine just just practicing getting things getting things going but uh it's okay no worries it'll be it'll be ten times harder down there no acs either now let's look at these cities of refuge here for just a moment amen there was three cities the bible says there were three cities uh within canaan within canaan and then three cities outside of canaan now here are the city names we were reading them the kadesh and kadus if you if you look at what kadesh means kadesh means a holy place amen shechem shechem was another city and it means back or shoulder praise the lord amen and the bible says that the shoulder will be upon his the government will be upon his shoulder amen hebron amen means association amen he wants to associate with you amen amen if you associate if you want to associate with him he wants to associate with you amen but you if you if you're if you're afraid of of of of you you dissociate dissociate or uh with anybody that that that is a christian or anything like that then that that just shows you don't want to associate with christ amen and then another city was beazer and beezer means a gold ore amen and we know gold is a pure metal and he is gold amen and raymeth and gilead rameth means heights and gilead means rocky region and so it was it was it was heights and he is our rock he is he is our rock praise god and then golan golan it means their captivity or they're rejoicing he's god and we rejoice when we're under that refuge amen praise god when you have when you've when you've done wrong when you've made a mistake young people amen don't don't go looking for anything else re you find rejoicing in his word you find rejoicing in in in his ways in his shelter in his in his tower amen under his rock praise god under his wings that's where you find rejoicing amen amen now these cities they were set in high places they were set on high they were not secret they were they were not anything secret anybody could see them from far off as a matter of fact they even say uh if i was reading that they even they say that there is even uh signs they were put to the to these cities and and and the y and the and the uh the roads to the cities were very wide they were very wide so there was no way for you not to get to this city there there was there there were they were they were high and you could see them and and and and they were not hidden amen see god has not done anything under a rock everything that he's done amen it's been public it's well known amen even in this hard day praise god it's been public amen amen it's just people don't see it but it's there but it's public amen he doesn't do things under a rock he's there and he's waiting amen for you to see it for you to know that you need him amen and run to his shelter amen run under his wings praise god amen none of this has done been been is done in secret amen none of this is done and say it's not hidden it's not hard to find it's not hard to find the best thing that you can do young people amen if you falter if you fail god amen go back go to his word amen repent amen that that's we all hear that we all see that but that's the least thing that we want to do is repent because some because satan is right there with that condemnation oh if you just tell them that you forg you you feel bad and you amen he won't hear you he's not going to listen to you you have to crawl and do eight hail marys and you have to do all these kind of things he wanted to make you think that it's difficult to reach that city and in reality all you got to do is run to it all you got to do is run to it there's nothing else that you have to do but run to it and i think all of us can run amen right yeah amen and the same thing i think all of us can repent yeah amen all right praise god amen not just for our young people man even adults amen because we sometimes we waller in their condemnation and we don't want to confess that we did wrong we don't want to do amen but all you got to do is repent praise god now here's some things that the bible says in regards to god being our refuge in proverbs chapter 18 verse 10 the bible says the name of the lord is the strong tower amen the righteous run to it and are safe praise god amen second samuel chapter 22 verse 3 my god is my rock in whom i take refuge my shield and the horn of my salvation amen my stronghold my refuge and my savior you save me from violence amen you saved me from the slayer that wants to kill me that wants to devour me with his music with his pop culture with his movies with his with his worldly uh fashion he wants to destroy me with all of those things amen but you are my refuge you are my shelter you are my shield amen psalm 61 3 for you have been my refuge this is david speaking for you have been my refuge a tower of strength against the enemy psalms 91 2 i will say to the lord you are my refuge and my fortress my god in whom i trust amen amen praise god psalms 144 2 he is my steadfast love and my fortress my stronghold and my deliverer he is my shield in whom i take refuge who subdues peoples under me amen amen praise the lord so david he saw god as his refuge i didn't see a pop singer as his refuge he didn't see a movie star as his refuge he didn't see a president as his refuge amen he saw god as his refuge and he didn't have the holy ghost how much more us who have the holy ghost amen instead of looking out here to the world look to god look to the word look to who really is our refuge and then he'll be able to shelter you from the enemy sometimes we wonder why is my life going this way why is this happening in my life why can't i correct this in my life amen who are you running to for shelter amen are you going to the world for shelter because they can't shelter you they got only temporary shelter god has eternal shelter that roof never breaks amen those windows never break amen that door never amen it's all perfect praise god amen and the people there are people of confidence if they have the holy ghost in that city these people who you can trust if they have the holy ghost because there could be people in the city and may maybe not be people of confidence amen but there are people there there were people there in that city who were supposed to be judges they were supposed to be people of confidence amen praise god amen it would be he'll be young young people sometimes amen to ask some some of some of these adults you know you want to learn some wisdom you want to you want to ask the ones that are older than you don't go to your friend who's having the same problem that you have why is he going to help you yeah he's got the same problem you have go to the one who defeated pornography go to the one who defeated uh uh hip-hop music go to the one who who who who's been able to defeat things of the world who's who's been an overcomer and see what they did get their counsel praise god that just makes sense it makes sense don't don't be scared about coming to somebody that can help you first and foremost go to god amen go but but these brothers can help you brother dale can help you brother wade can help you amen your mom and dad can help you if you let them help you they can help you amen amen praise god amen now in here looking a little bit further at these cities amen these cities they were like i said earlier they were part of the 48 cities that were given to the levite priests now it's interesting that it was levite priests that lived there and hebrews 5 6 tells us that jesus christ is a priest forever amen amen what after the order of melchizedek praise god so there was these levi priests who were judged righteously amen there about the matter about the man who was running to that city and saying i didn't kill this man i didn't kill this woman i didn't i didn't do this amen they would be able to judge righteously because they had contact with god amen they had contact with god they were called by god how much more in this hour saints amen you run to our lord jesus christ amen you run to him you run to his word for help praise god and he's been able to help you amen but he can't help nobody doesn't run to him he's not going to force you amen you come we you have to go choose to come amen praise god amen brother brown says here in the in the message letting off the pressure i'm inside of a tower i don't have no desires to even look out he that puts his hands to the plow and even turns to look back is not worthy of the plowing amen he that looks back when he's supposed to run to the city of refuge and looks back amen he is going to be killed what what a place to come yes outside you die but inside you're safe amen just come in and let off the pressure that's the thing to do and christ is our tower yes god's provided place of safety joshua built those houses in those cities of refuge and god built us a city of refuge that's in his son christ jesus amen the name of the lord is the mighty tower the righteous run into it and are safe praise the lord they're safe how would you think that you're not saving christ how would you think that you're not safe amen when you're in when you're in his word amen how do you how do you think that you're not in his will when you're when you're when you're reading his word when you're praying when you're meditating on him when you're coming to church when you're doing what you're supposed to do how do you feel unsafe there's no way for you to feel unsafe amen you're doing your part and he will do his i just that's why i love amen james chapter 4. james chapter 4 says i forget which verse but it says one of the verses and there said james says draw nigh unto god and he will draw nigh unto you and you might have seen this example before amen but if you draw an eye onto god brother wade stand right there amen you're god amen amen and as i'm drawing to you he says and he will draw nigh unto you as well come together right amen amen is my city of rest amen [Laughter] draw nigh unto god and he will draw an eye onto you it's not that god sits there by you know and waits for you to come to him it's that he's doing his part when you do your part amen amen but if you're not doing your part he what's he gonna do is he gonna force you come on and serve me zach come on that's not how can god do that and you do it you know with a good heart and a good and a good there's no way he doesn't do that but he says come unto me all you that labor and weary and i will give you rest amen and draw nigh unto me and i will draw an eye unto you do your part and he will do his amen praise god amen two plus two equals four is that simple it's that simple amen praise god but some some people you know maybe that man that might have killed accidentally killed that man maybe he might be saying well you know i live too far from that city of refuge i can't i can't uh i can't make it but you know what's going to happen he's going to die that's right amen i live too far from church i don't think i can make it i don't know you're going to die spiritually you're going to die spiritually i just can't make it to church you're gonna die spiritually it's just it's just two plus two equals four amen especially in the in the era that we're living now where people have used the pandemic as an excuse to stay away from church if you're more scared of going to church and dying physically than dying spiritually then something's wrong with you something's wrong with you that's not god amen that is satan amen working in you amen talking to you and telling you to come stay don't run to the city of refuge now i'm not saying the church here is the city of refuge and christ is the city of refuge amen praise god but but you come here amen you have more opportunity to find christ than any than than than at your house amen amen or they are at walmart or at taco bell you know we're not scared to go there and we'll go inside too we don't go through the drive-through we go inside but we're scared to come to church oh my yeah i'm afraid i'm afraid i'm not going to come out alive i'm going to say it again if you were scared of coming to church amen you're more scared of dying physically than dying spiritually something's wrong with you something's wrong amen praise god amen well the word is too strict you know those those those preachers over there they're just too strict and and they're too demanding and i don't understand anything they say what if that man that killed that you know accidentally killed that man what if he said i don't understand those people that live in that city i i don't think i'm going to run over there you know i don't understand them you know we got people like that today you know i don't understand i'll just stay home you know you're going to die you're going to die you're going to get killed by the by the man slayer the one that's after you you're going to die yeah that's that's just that's just it amen praise god you cannot live amen under your own terms you've got to live under god's terms amen it's his word it's his way or it's no way amen there's no no no your opinion does not count amen when it has to do with the word of god praise god amen it's his way or it's no way that's right i don't want my way because my way gets in my way [Laughter] my way gets in my way my own thinking my own opinions get in my way of god working in me amen of me getting to that refuge city amen it gets in my way amen praise god amen praise the lord and then if if you continue reading and i'm going to finish up here in just a moment if you continue reading if you read with me in numbers chapter 35 verse 25 i believe i gave the brothers this but if not just you can turn with me there numbers 35 verse 25 it says and the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the revenger of blood in other words and so that city was to take in that man that was that went to that city looking seeking refuge and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge you see the city of his refuge that's his city of his refuge amen is is christ your christ is jesus christ you're jesus hey man is he do you have a personal walk with him is it is he personal to you or is he just the second person of the trinity or is he just somebody far off that i can't really reach uh you know no he's got to be personal to you young people he's got to be personal he's got to be more than just a bible story he's got to be more than just going to church and i'm just doing what my mom and dad tell me to do i mean he's got to be more than that to you amen he's got to be a revelation to you when something is a revelation to you then there's no there's no way amen that you can deny it that you can doubt it amen when i met brother zach amen i know now it was revealed to me that is zach black because i see him and i know when he comes through the door i know who that is that's zach black amen he looks just like his dad and he walks almost just like his dad [Laughter] it was revealed to me that that is zach black and i have no doubt that it's zach black and that's the same thing with you young people amen when christ is revealed to you you know and there's no doubt and no shadow in your mind anymore when christ is on the scene amen you know amen when when you're when you start teetering amen in the things of the world you know that that's not what was revealed to you about christ amen when thing oh things start getting a little rocky amen with music and with things of the world movies and all these do you know that's not what christ revealed to you true brother that's this man that's the man's slayer that's satan behind you trying to defeat you amen so we continue reading him the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge whether he was fled and he shall abide in it wait until when unto the death of the high priest amen which was anointed with the holy oil now who is our high priest after the order of melchizedek who is it amen amen amen praise god see it's only until after he died after he made the sacrifice that he made that we can actually go free praise god that we can actually be free amen but anything else outside of christ is not freedom it's slavery praise god anything outside of christ is not freedom amen but if the slayer shall at any time verse 26 but if the slayer shall at any time in other words the man that accidentally killed the other man if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge whether he was fled in other words if he left that city of refuge if he got out just a little bit yeah i just want to go out here you know and just just walk down look at that girl down there look at that guy oh man just a little bit just a little bit it just takes just a little bit all right guess what this was going to happen watch what it says verse 27 and the revenger of blood find him in other words the man that was trying to kill him to avenge his his his blood his his family member's blood and the revenge of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge and the revenger of blood kill the slayer he shall not be guilty of blood in other words the one that was trying to kill him and if he finds him outside of the city according to the law he had the right to continue so it does not matter how long you've been in church saints it does not matter how long you've been under the protection of your parents it does not matter how long you've been amen if you get outside of christ amen you're going to get killed spiritually it doesn't matter how much you go to church doesn't matter if you teach sunday school it doesn't matter if you preach if you get outside of christ amen satan is a satan has the right to take you that's right because you're outside of god's protection you're outside of his refuge amen praise god so that man could come back and kill that man verse 28 because watch he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession amen you stay where christ is don't get outside of christ amen amen young and old amen stay in christ especially more at this hour that we're living in we got we're living in a crazy world out here today amen where up is down and down is up where a man is a woman and a woman is a man and whatever more in between they don't even know anymore saw one yesterday my wife were out eating you know it was her birthday yesterday and we were out eating and walked out of the restaurant and i looked over there i told her you know i couldn't tell that i was a man or a woman but i knew something was funny first first first thing i thought was that's a man and i told my wife i said you know what i think the first inkling that that you get about a person whether you don't know if it's a man or a woman amen that's probably what they are because i mean the human you know we were created i mean god created us in a are we're perfect in the way he created us our instincts and and the things amen and we have that first instinct something is wrong that's probably you that's probably what it is you're not sure if it's a man or a woman but your first instinct that's a man it probably is a man all right let me get off of that maybe we might get shut down by youtube they're just shutting everything down now you say anything about things like this or all kinds of i mean you get you get your channel shut off all right praise god but because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest amen stay in christ saints amen you say you might say well i've never taken a life you know i've never killed anybody i never murdered anybody amen i've never done those things amen but how do you talk about your brother how do you talk about your sister what are the thoughts that go through your mind about your brothers and your sisters how do you how do you talk to how do you talk about them because the way you talk about them either hurts or helps their influence and when you're hurting somebody's influence amen you're killing them that's what brother branham said amen so we've all been guilty the bible says that all of us like sheep have gone astray we're all sinners we have we have sinned we've done wrong amen we've all done wrong whether you think you did or not we've all lied we've all stole something we've all cheated we've all we have all done something wrong to sin against our lord jesus christ amen and every time listen to me young people every time that you just continue in wallowing into your sin and just stay there and don't come and run to your city of refuge it's just like you just sitting there continuing pounding those nails in jesus's hands just keep nailing him to the cross you say i never nailed jesus to the cross but what put jesus on the cross was our sins and our iniquities so if you continue to stay in your wallering of sin and in your in your life and in in what you're doing instead of doing what you're supposed to do running to christ running to him amen you are sitting there continually nailing him on the cross nailing his feet on the cross you're putting him into an open shame again praise god amen so we don't want to do that because it's our it's been our lives it's been our lusts it's been our our our those things amen it's those little foxes that spoil the vine the bible says it's not a murder i know none of us have murdered anybody here i hope not but there's no big sin or little sin before god the murderer physical murderer gets just as much punishment as the one that kills verbally if they don't repent amen yeah to god it's that way amen amen we look at the uh i'll finish with this with this example these two examples we see when the children of israel were running amen from the from the slayers of the egypt egyptians amen when they were in god's will amen they were following his will they were running towards the where they were supposed to run following their prophet amen obeying the word amen guess what god did to the man slayer to the to the to the ones that were chasing him those egyptians he killed him the bible the bible says that this day you will see these egyptians no more amen amen praise god when you are in god's will you when you are in god's will you will not see that temptation in your life anymore you will not see that i mean the temptation will come the temptation will come but you won't easily fall into it amen you'll have something to fight with you're not alone you won't easily succumb to the temptation praise god amen that's right and and i'm i'm thinking about lots a lot in his his family when god told him when the angels told him to flee sodom amen they were supposed to flee and not look back but his wife amen she liked her sewing parties too much she liked her her her you know coach purses too much she liked her all you know her shoes and her and her trips to the mall and amazon too much she just liked it too much she liked all that stuff too much and she couldn't give it up amen and when she turned around i just can't give i can't i cannot give up my pandora account yeah i could not give up my spotify account i just can't she died she died her spotify account got her to be killed yeah yeah it's just as easy as that it's whatever kills you constantly amen whatever you can't give up easily amen that's what's killing you amen whatever whatever it is let's get rid of it i'm just being real with you guys amen amen my netflix account my amazon prime account whatever it is if it's outside of the word of god amen and if it's freezing you instead of you running to the way the angel told you to go amen run into the city of refuge if you're just sitting there oh you're going to die spiritually amen you're going to die spiritually praise god amen we remember remember the woman that was caught on in adultery amen and jesus and the the pharisees brought her to jesus and said this woman amen she was caught in the very act in the very act of committing adultery what do you say we should do and all jesus did amen he said you who don't have not committed sin throw the first stone and he just kept riding on the on the on the on the ground amen just kept riding and that was that was true because all of them have committed sin all of them had committed sin right none of them i mean they were they seemed like they were righteous but they had all committed sin they could not condemn this woman now according to the law they were supposed to stone her according to the law but the law was standing right there before them amen jesus christ was standing right there and he said okay yeah the law says this but i am the law and this is what i say and that woman amen and he jesus the the each one they dropped their stones and they they left and see the woman was standing there just with jesus himself jesus didn't walk away from her amen he sat right there and he said woman where are then accusers and she said i have none they're gone amen and he said well i don't accuse you either go and sin no more he said go and sin no more amen and that's what i tell you tonight saints young people amen as you're preparing your mind for the for for for a good weekend amen go and sin no more amen don't disbelieve his word amen prep yourself amen to receive more of his word so that you can become more like that word amen don't think oh my goodness so you know or if you're or if you're struggling or may you know just think i'm going to receive more of god because i want more of god amen and lord if i don't if you don't have that wanting in you lord i want put that in me lord right amen make me run to you draw me as the song goes draw me lord and i'll come running after you amen amen but it's not it's not time amen that that man who killed that man unintentionally amen he couldn't walk to the city of refuge amen he had to get there quick as quick as possible run amen run there's a time to run it's not time to take it easy now time to put it on cruise control it's time to run to the city of refuge it's the violent that will take amen praise god hebrews 6 17 through 20 says wearing god willing more abundantly to show unto the heirs of promise the immutability of his counsel confirmed them by an oath that by two immutable things in which it was impossible for god to lie we might have a strong consolation who have fled for refuge to lay hold upon the hopes set before us which hope we have as an anchor of the soul both sure and amen steadfast this ain't talking about your spotify account either and which entereth into that within the veil whether the forerunner is for us entered even jesus made in high priest forever after the order of melchizedek amen amen and brother brown says here now if you want to do right i'm so glad tonight to tell you that there is a city of refuge amen that's jesus christ if you don't want to do wrong the enemy is after you then then there is a way of escape and that escape is jesus christ amen there is a place where you can come and let off the steam but if you're but if you love to sin and you don't want god then the enemy is going to overtake you somewhere you have you you can't come to christ because you don't want to amen but he's got the roads open remember the roads to the city of refuge they're open they're wide they're clean they even have signs everything's ready all you got to do is get to it you don't have to die in your sin you don't have to die in your condemnation you don't have to die in your lifestyle seek christ while he still may be found amen

a mistake when i do wrong amen that city of that city is drawing me amen that city on top of the hill is drawing me amen it's there it's ready it's it's got everything that i need amen i don't have to
