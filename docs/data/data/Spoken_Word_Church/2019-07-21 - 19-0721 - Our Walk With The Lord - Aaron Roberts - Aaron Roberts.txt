========================================

[Music] from the chapter 24 yes [Music] well that's Richard by the life drug can I started versatile [Music] when you hear important Mar I made 24 last chapter of the Boogaloo first verse yes [Music] so Luke chapter 24 verse one says now upon the first day of the week very early in the morning they came under the Sepulcher bringing the spices which they had prepared and certain others with meal and they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre and they entered him he found out the body of the Lord Jesus and it came to pass as they were much perplexed thereabout the whole three men stood by them in shining garments and as they were afraid and bowed down their faces to the earth they said unto them why seek to you the living among the dead he is not here but it's risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee saying the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men and be crucified and the third day rise again and they remember his words and returned from the Sepulcher and come all these things done to the eleven and to all the rest so that just were we're finished in them later on we'll probably bring some more of this chapter this is a one of my one of my favorite scriptures in the in the Bible first verse thinkness is and they remembered his words I've always always found that fascinating in in our life especially my Christian journey I'm finding myself in the same position but the thing reality and as you go through this this host scripture because this chapter right here later on we'll get to it later on in this chapter is the two going on the road to Emmaus and you know it always always amazes me that you know here's a group of people that that walk with Jesus you know for three and a half years and all the things that they have been through and all the things that they had solved and you know the Angels come and tell them that Jesus : said you know destroy this temple in three days I'll race it here and he tells him what he come to do you know because he come I come to seek and save those which were lost and he knew they told me said he'll I'll be turned over into the hands of sinful men but you I will rise again you know he kept telling what he came from when he comes to do over and over he and they kept seeing all the things that you know in it every time that Steven when he was challenged by the Pharisees and the Sadducees he took them back to the scripture and say search the scriptures are these not the things that the prophets wrote about that I would do they said I'm not doing he said if if I don't do these things then you can come me over but if I don't then you're supposed to believe what the scripture says and I've come to do that and you know it's so amazing is because many times in our lives we seek things happen and we see and God moves them on the scene and you know what we still have our thing brother em says in one place he says you know we're supposed to purge our thinking and one of the one of the reasons why I wanted to get into this today was I was listening I know brother Joe was was in that was in the Army and he came probably tell us a lot more about it than I can but how's this another young man give us give this testimony about being in the military and the different things of the event three but it one thing you tell about this you know in basic training the one thing that they want you to do is get away from your way of thinking and one of the things that you have to change is the way you talk he said the first thing you do is you don't say me you don't say i you don't say my you don't say mine you don't own nothing they owe you and you know the thing gives us you know and what struggling with shoes listening to them well you know we are we're supposed to be an invincible army well you know what we're we don't own our singers I'm not my own not belong to Jesus he purchased me I'm obvious as the song goes so we've been bought with a price well you know we shouldn't have our own thing well this young man was talking about you know the first time that they were you know you have to do certain things and you know becoming their first thing he said was mild you know and then all of a sudden he said the drill sergeant was in his face and started screaming at him and he kept making him say this recruit this recruit this recruit he keeps saying that over and over and over why because he had to get away from saying I me my mine had to be this recruit and you know one of the other things that he talked about was that when we when you go in you know everybody it's one group it's a it's a it's a platoon a squad a company whatever it is you know there's a there's a group of people that are together and you all win and you all lose together and it was when one soldier he wanted to do his own thing and you know he's able to show off and then try to be his own and the first thing that drill started talking oh you want to be an individual you want to be an individual and you know there's a there's a movie that was made many years ago and some of you might have seen it but never heard of it but it's called Full Metal Jacket and there's a scene in there where this again one of the young men and the Marines think it's called a food and you know one of the rules about eating is you eat when they Kennedy you don't eat any other time of your food does not mix you go for food three of them the cafeteria or wherever a nudey are you even in the field and when you get done when they say you're done there's no more food you don't carry and they get scuffle and it's conclude this footlocker well you know the one thing that happens is the rest of the guys in the group are down there doing exercises and push-ups and everything and the drill sergeant gives the guy that had the doughnut gives him the doughnut and says well you know they're paying for it you eat it and he has to stand there in front of everybody and all the other guys are on the floor doing push-ups and he's sitting there eating that doughnut and you're one of these he was so much you know we win and loose together and you know we're nobodies enough out of nobody's father say to me how if we think we do this by yourself but really no but you know I'm singing about you know if we overcome we overcome because it is an overcoming as a personal overcoming but you know what it's a it's brother branham said that if if we just believe if we do something wrong so we can call the church to fail and you know so yeah it is a personal overcoming because when you go through the army or whatever you're doing for the joke you think you know it's you have to do it all by yourself because you don't nobody else is on the firing range when you're firing your weapon to qualify that's you you have to qualify and you know but ever but you have to think about you know I'm doing this not just for myself but I'm doing this for everybody everybody's included in this and you know and so you know if we if we look at it it all has to all has to come back to be a personal but it has to be then we're doing this as a group you know that was riding down the road that was thinking you know [Music] you know I could count the number of times that people's come on my heart and you just pray for somebody and it may be a quick prayer sometimes somebody's on your mind the whole day and you pray about if you pray over somebody you don't even know what they're going for you don't know situation sometimes you find out there is a situation that they're going through sometimes you pray for and then somebody comes back and says you know I've been dealing with this or whatever you know years ago I had a business many years ago his young sister she was on my heart and for some reason I woke up and she was on my mind I was praying I prayed all day long and it was just I just could never get rid of this feeling that I had you know it was just a real burden well then after I come back from work Betty I called her on the phone and I asked her I said are you okay or what's going on and she told me about some personal things that she had been going through and she said she didn't know what to do that she was really trying to seek God for an answer on what to do and I was like you know I just want you know I've been praying and she was so amazed that God had cut somebody and but somebody was on the other end thinking of her that somebody was killed many times we think we were so by ourselves and you know sometimes it's so amazing that somebody comes along and they think hey I've been prayin for you and sometimes you know we don't we could sit down and look into this other room and see how many times we've been prayed for about other people [Music] you know I always tell everybody that where I am where I am today because I had a friend grandmother that she really kept us before God and you know I'd make dogs for them because it really you know all the know that I do and all that I'm able to accomplish I always say to put health of her prayer and if I have less than anybody will it goes back to her because she she was wanted stood behind us to bring us to this place hey brother I'm talked about you know all the ones that went before us you know payment away you know you know we're walking the trails that they think blazed that they think you know so you know it's not anybody being by their self or or any you know you don't accomplish it all by yourself because lots of times you said well you know what I get load is there's somebody praying for me you know brother Dale talks about many times where he talks about you know waking up the middle the night praying for everybody in the church and you know it's it's amazing that but you know because somebody is praying on your behalf and somebody is uplifting you and you know sometimes we think what we're doing all by ourselves and we you know it's nobody but nobody's in our and you know become even even when you're by yourself and and you feel like you're you're fighting this battle all alone but you know there's one that said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake he said I'll be we even eating you to the end of the you're not you're never alone you're never you never fight the battle by your seat many times sometimes what happens this is we want to do things and try to accomplish things and we think we can figure it out on our own and lots of times the Lord standing there waiting on us to expend our wheels enough do we get aggravated and tired of what we're doing and then he's like would you like for me the hill it's like get a week save ourselves a lot of heartache in trouble that we just go that way than begin with but sometimes we we have this thinking so that we can accomplish them and you know here in the here in the scripture you know they hear hear these people are walking with Jesus and Jesus walk with them all of this way thanks and expounding the scriptures this whole way here sometimes we don't kiss because I don't but I don't think no matter what Jesus tried to tell them about the truth you know I don't you know we don't know their their thought process this is just kind of my thinking but you know they probably sing crucifixions before because it was a Roman penalty so it's probably something they sing before but you know when it's somebody that you love it is something different but no matter what Jesus trying to tell them what was going to take place and maybe they didn't maybe they just never caught the grasp of that you know you're like in you know you go through terrible things and you're in shock and you're in this minute here in this topsy-turvy world and you're trying to figure things out and Jesus don't say this is gonna happen to me but on race in three days you know and here's the same one thing you know that kept telling me you when you see this this man uh who've done all these great miracles you know there never was a funeral procession that he didn't ranks the data he took he took a boy's lunch and he fed 5,000 he walked on the water all the great miracles that this man had done and you know what if he could do that then it couldn't he couldn't be raised from the dead well that's what the Old Testament prophets said he would do that's what was testified in the Old Testament and then they come and testify to the same thing and yet here they come on the third date which is the day that he has folks to raise and they go to the sepulchre with their spices and with during all of their instruments and and elder spices and in bowls or whatever the linen whatever leaders I go then you know annoying the body preparing for death and they're so amazed that when he comes to he says ycq little of what angels come and say ycq the living among the dead why are you why are you here they did not tell you that he would do these things you know there's people time you know I've had times in my life you know we pray over things a week God to move in and when he does you know we were shocked that he moved well that's why if you pray for something to hurt for God to hit you when you do then you're taking back that it happened why because if you he said it the law he set up in the law of this word that if you believe and ask that he would do it well it's just like you know just like the law of gravity you throw something up it falls down well if you have the faith to believe in what he said you've confessed him bleep he's obligated to bring it to pass then it's not something that we have to you know we get worked up you know shocked at God healed me or God met my needs why because he said he would [Music] see it's our thinking that you know you know where we're trying to hedge our bets sometimes we think well you know what what's my second playing go me that God's not going to make the first well you know money if you are all sold out on the first one you would have to worry about trying to make the back-up plan why because there isn't a back-up plan with you I wouldn't you know I would much rather have all my hold my eggs and all my hoax in him did then try to come up with something else you know that that sister that was in the the message letting off the pressure you know brother-n-law thoughts about how she was such an older lady but she looks Tanya and he asked her sister woods what's your secret and what is it that makes you look so young and she had grown children he said you could believe could believe that she was that old it was like well when I first become a Christian it's like I knew I put all my hooks in him and he said he'd take care of me and said if he can take care of it I certainly can't so I'm not gonna worry but I just I got nothing to worry about why because when I give it all name and it's the same way with us that we don't have to worry about there's no thirst shouldn't be any worry we shouldn't have to try to figure things that one because he's someone this guy that I think you're back we just need to rest in him but as as these two and see the women went to to the Sepulcher and they found these two these two angels at the Sepulcher and they and they totally so why seeking the living among the dead he's not here but remember what he said it says and they remembered his words you know that's the reason that we only keep her always stay in the work I always state what the word says confess the word always have your mind on in the world because if we stay with that then we can't as brother have said we've heard earthly you know what if we think what he thinks if we think the word and work then we purge our father's we overcome our thoughts with this stuff we replace our thoughts will get stars and it's so amazing that that they go down this road and all of a sudden it's like oh yeah he said he'd raised today in England Ernie said well his body's not here so he's risen from the dead because the Angels have told us he's not here he's risen from the dead and all of a sudden here they go back to testify that he's risen from the dead and as he go how they go to tell the ulema ninh and them as he's risen from the dead and this is into all the rest at verse verse 10 says that it was Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and other women that were there with him which told these things unto the Apostles and their words seemed to be as Bible tales and they believed them up then a roast Peter and rent under the sepulchre and stooping down people held the linen clothes laid by themselves and departed wondering in himself at that which was come to pass so we know that when they heard it they didn't believe what then what was told because here though they come back and said jesus said I'll race from the dead that he had risen from the dead because the angels are here they told us and they didn't believe it and Peter and John runs back to the simple courtesy to find out if it was really true because they'd already heard the testimony that he was there he was he was gone he was risen it's empty but they had to go see for themselves and they ran back to see it now because they didn't believe what was said in this system and behold two of them went out that same day to a village called Emmaus which was from Jerusalem about three score furlongs and they talked together of all these things which had happened and it came to pass that well they commute together and reason Jesus himself drew near and went with them since with their house were holding that they should not know him [Music] and it's then he said that to them what manner of communications are these that he should not that you should have one to another as you won't in our set and the one of the old who's nameless Cleophus answering set at him bar though only a stranger in Jerusalem the past number known the things which are come to pass the pass there in these days and he said unto them what things and they said unto Him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people in how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified Him but we trusted that it had been he which would have redeemed Israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things were done yay and certain women also of our company made us astonished which were early at the sepulchre and when they found not his body they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels which said that he was alive and certain of them which were whipped us men to the sepulchre and found it even so as the women had said that him they saw not [Applause] so it was pretty amazing that you know of all the things that they have been through and solved and then the women went to the sepulchre and came back and told him that he had risen that it was him and then Cleophus and his friend they tell Jesus that there were others with us that went to the sepulchre and found it and came back so not only did we have the first group of witnesses but we had the second group of witnesses to tell us the same thing that he was risen from the dead and they came back and he's gone done it and found it just the way they said and yet here these are deciding to walk away and Jesus says why are you saying he said here you are you've heard everything that I've said but Jesus told you all the way through and you've seen these things and now you're standing you're walking away and they're in this kind of condition and [Music] Jesus speaks to them and tells them and verse 25 and he said unto them both fools of slow heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken follow not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he expounded unto them all the Scriptures the things concerning himself and they drew not unto the village where if they went and he made us no people would have gone further but they constrained him saying abide with us for it is toward evening and the day is far spent and he went in to tarry Whitfield and it came to pass as he said it meet with him he took bread and blessed it and brake and gave to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our hearts burn within us while they talked with us by the way and while he opened to us the scriptures you know so it's so amazing them you know many times we wonder about people [Music] [Applause] see God do miracles you know they there's people that talk about you know oh I wish we could see the book of Acts take place er you know all these great things and you know what you're a miracle in yourself because you know many people they don't see that you are a walking there and you know here they hear they hear these men are all the things that they had seen it all that they had heard and yet they walk the way and here's Jesus speaking to me you know he it takes him back to the scripture and shows him all the things that they had seen and all that they had heard and yet and yet they couldn't believe what a place and then here Jesus began to expound and then when you know they pretended that he would that he would go on and they wanted him to stay with them and so you know he stayed and he and he broke the bread and they realized who that was you know it's the same way with you and I there's many times in our lives it you know we would look we were to see certain things that you know it's like oh how great everything was in the Bible Basin and in the book of Acts and everything but you know what you and I are mirrors and you know you and I we work miracles God works through us Amin times we don't realize what God is what God is used us to do because there's Thompson in my life and I know everybody probably had the same thing is you know some of there's been a question or there's been a situation that's come up in your life and you have spoke because there's there's been times where people people have asked me questions or certain things come up and you know I'm amazed at what things that come out of my mouth because of you know I have to stop they call that was good and you know what that was God speaking and we don't realize you know God can speak through you say wow I wish God would speak this well you know what sometimes we overlook the things when God actually uses us to do things because we don't actually put the thought into Gorillaz you know that was not speaking to us God is using me because you know if somebody is out or somebody is sick you know just like when brother Colley and the different ones that have been a have been out you know what it's a when you come to church and and people are not here you know what if it if it doesn't there's something wrong me but you know what if it bears on your heart and you know what it was so glad to see one brother colleague made it back and there's so many other ones but you know that are babbling things and you know what if you know because it's us as a body we have to be the ones to hold them up in prayer but you know it's it's that we can God can use us and God uses us when you have children and you know there's many times when you're raising children you know we don't always go about it the correct way or at least I don't because you know sometimes I don't know how you are but lots of times I feel like I do I know you know lately the bowel says lay hands suddenly aluminum you know thank you know there's sometimes you know you you honestly you wish that there was a way that you could beat sensing and you know and I honestly thank you in my lifetime I think my death thought that he could and I think he tried in certain times in our lives to try to beat sense Intimus I don't know if it really worked or not but you know you're you're what's so amazing is when you look back and you think you know you try to do the best that you can but you know what you're human then you fail and you know we don't always handle every situation correctly but you know what's so amazing is when your kids when they look at you and they say things about you to other people and they can tell when people come back and tell you what your kids said about you it's so amazing because you know we look at ourselves and as failures and how could you know what our kids don't see and you know sometimes we look at ourselves as failures but you know what argon doesn't see it like our Heavenly Father because you know he seeks a bigger picture many times we think well you know I I don't do this I can't do this and hinder that you know what it's what you do have being faithful to what the little pork God gives you to do that's the main thing are you faithful and what God's given you there's no matter how big there's a little bit is are we thankful in that here because it's you know not everybody's come to do the same thing we all can't do the same thing and that you know honestly there's a lot of things I wouldn't want to do I have I have the highest honor for pastors but I honestly me that's just not my calling and I think the Lord that that's not my calling but you know what that's a that's a harder for somebody to be a pastor and I think we've got one of the greatest pastors ever walk Shula but you know the thing is is that's a position that God because you have to be God makes a man for that position and you know you come to that place where you can you can be in the that place you know it doesn't matter you know we've always want to be the high positions but you don't think is it's you know if we are prayer warriors to pray the Bible says here to pray without ceasing you know it doesn't take I know some people can pray long times and and everything like that and not really the type person to do that but you know the thing is this to be to have communion with God give my my prayer comes in the truck up I get in the truck and there's nothing me and me and the and you know I I'm listening to either brother ran over there so you know somebody you're listening to music or something and you know and that's it's an atmosphere that I can commune with God and yep you know there's been times that God has spoke to me and you know it's to me it's nice to get out and go and just be by yourself and you know you have to set that time and do that and let God speak to you but you know thing is this Airways as well I don't I don't have a lot of money I can't do this but you know what you can pray and you know I want one time i sat down it and I just started listening because you know you people will pray say will you pray for me and you know you and you say yeah I'll pray for you and then you forget and then just like the Lord who wasn't that said what they wanted prayer and then you think look we and I just started writin down even people that didn't even ask for prayer I just started listening people that I knew that had needs and you just start listing and you know and then it's something that just he start putting because you know these are verbs and Lord these people need a touch from you and you start thinking of them and you keep praying over these things too you know it doesn't take a long time it's just something that you set them and set a second time to do that and you never in you'd be amazed at what God can do through people just by taking that little bit of time to pray for somebody and you know to have a have a work to say to somebody you know uh at work everybody asks me how I'm doing it you know because you you find people that they don't have the Lord and you know whatever situations they they go through their life you know some people are just looking for a kind word somebody's looking for an encouraging word you know you know I always try to speak to everybody and I think with brother dr. Atkins I think he said hello to everybody the first BP 100 people or whatever we'd always try to greet everybody and you know there's a lot of people that that you know that first they wouldn't talk to me and they're there some people work they're still comforting but they don't talk to nobody so I don't feel bad unless it's something nice they actually have to say to somebody they don't see so they don't say it good morning hello you know get out of my leg they don't say nothing unless they need something but but you know I try to talk to everybody and try to speak to everybody and ask everybody doing and you know people only know how I'm doing a lot doing great you don't feel you know always and I've got people that work they laugh at because I have a set of things that I that I say I'm gonna go Mondays we help like this is marvelous Monday and this terrific Tuesday this wonderful Wednesday this thrilling Thursday and fantastic fabulous Fridays and I get off and everybody thinks are you serious like yeah and you know some people something you blood people's money you get up so you know what the Lord got me out of bed this moment I got here you know why there's a lot of people to get out of bed this morning you know and you start to look at it and everybody comes about you know you have problems than ever everybody's got problems you know you go to work you know like they say work is a four-letter word so you know everybody has problems and things that go on and work but you don't think yes it's not it's not how you know what the problem is it's how you handle the problem how you react to it is the thing that makes it better or worse because you there's some people that you know I honestly I got people or I can extend beer I don't will be around I don't listen to me and people ask me why do you have a problem it why because there's something get it I mean I'd rather I'd rather have somebody go ahead and meet with a wire brush I'm just got them down my back then have to listen to me you know you want to stick your fingers in the air and run away from one because they're so making but you know thing is is God has blessed us and given us everything that we haven't either everything that pertains to life and godliness and everything that you have Nina has been given to you in this earthly journey you know we're so blessed that we get up this morning but do we walk and just pass by and Jesus is talking to it's just like the two on the road to Emmaus her and just completely blind to what's going home are we are revolting just like Jesus speaking to them and telling them what was going to take place and then they just go on and write about their business and not realizing that God has called you and blessed you to a place that you know there are certain things in your life that never gonna change but you know what I'm not I'm not worried about that I always tell a little story about the man who had their great big motoring God told him to push the boulder and he set out there and he kept pushing the mower and Boulder you know I just kept pushing on it pushing on it we're gonna laughter years of fishing on that he realized that you know what I'd never moved that mower and he thought you know he was a failure and he kept telling others like look I've been fishing on this site for years and I never move and done why don't why am I going through this didn't is just I have I'm just a failure there's nothing accomplished in all this and the Lord told him said listen said I never told you to move it I told you to push they said no look at yourself they said look at the muscles that you feel look at the changes taking place in you not moving the bone he said I've never told you the movement he said I told you to push and he said the more you push the more the change took place in me and many times things happen in our lives where we can't change we're not going to be able to change but you know look the change takes place in us as the song says sometimes he calms the storm sometimes he calls me you know that's the way is are we mindful to seek things the way God has made that God has blessed us and coming up I just want to be mindful that if they got every day and to see the supernatural working of God in our lives you know as given here for this later brother Devils filled up you know we were talking about the nine spiritual gifts and you know many times people act like you know the gifts aren't working we don't seek the gifts well you know what if we actually open our eyes and actually read what the scripture says then you know what we realize God is working we do see the nine spiritual gifts working it's just not tongues of interpretation but you know it's gifts of healing it's the wisdom knowledge the working of miracles the different things that take the place that's right those two were the least but you know we see those things working you know sometimes if we open our eyes Lord let me open my eyes then let me see what's going on what you're doing around us because you sometimes it's I don't know about you but sometimes we'll really Dale preaches and you know he says long with you to catch this well you know what I don't catch you I know I mean sometimes it's like you know you know he'll he'll be preaching on something and they want you to catch something and I'm like well or not my kitchen then it takes a while but you know I think the Lord allows that to happen sometimes we both are you going to how do you want to react to because sometimes it's you're digging a little bit more you're having to pursue this a little more for God to come speak to so do you do we have that to look and then follow that and do what God has us to do what God has laid before us you know you know was like when God tell brother branham to create the squirrel and you know he said to speak to the squirrels he spoke this world into existence and they were there were three that he spoke into existence and you know ground was able to shoot them and he found them but the four of them there was one time that he couldn't find one of you know he spoke it and then and then the brother was praying like Lord if if brother branham's correct let him finding that four foot well you know brother Adam saw that fourth one and he saw him come into existence and he shot it but you know he had to
