stone meant confession and what we're gonna and with help the lord we're gonna look in things tonight and you know what your confession means a lot you go as far as your confession what you believe and what you can say yeah that's where you go so let's just all bow our heads tonight and certainly remember sister johnny's request here remember the people in the ukraine and the believers there we just want to plead the blood for them you know if you've never been there you know it's kind of hard to sometimes fathom what what it's like to be in a situation like that but you know god knows all things he knows all situations and you know there's there's there's no thing that's difficult for him you know one thing's not any bigger than than something else it's it's all just the same to him and he can take care of all of it so let's just all bow our heads tonight we'll just pray over the the reading of the word and and also remember the people in ukraine and the and the ones that are

lord lord that we just believe that lord the holy spirit will go and cover those people lord that you'll be a protection to them lord we've seen what you've already done and we just continue to believe that you're going to be there that you'll come on the scene and lord you'll be a protection to them lord that they'll see more of the of the workings of the holy spirit in their in their midst lord that that because you are the same yesterday today and forever lord lord your hand's not been too short lord you've not got tired or weary like we do lord jesus because we know that you're the

you said that for us to ask lord that that you could come on the scene and lord to make our fulfill our joy lord so we just commit them to you and believe lord that you're on the scene and that you'll just take care because you make all things right all things well and lord we just commit it to you tonight in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen we're going to look uh joshua chapter four begin verse uh one through nine i really like these screens this is nice i'm just kind of getting used to no not this this is my first time with all this so all the other brothers have got to do this before so it is nice but anyway praise the lord uh and it says joshua 4 verse 1 says and it came to pass when all the people were clinging past over jordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying take you 12 men out of the people out of every tribe a man and command you them saying take you hence out of the midst of jordan out of the place where the priests feet stood firm twelve stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where ye shall lodge this night then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe of man and joshua said unto them pass over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan so there's they're they're doing two things so they're taking one set of stones and they're putting it where they're going to reside but they're going back in where the priests are get back into the back into the jordan it says and you take every man you a stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then you shall answer them that the waters of jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord that's the reason i sung that song because you know when he comes in he'll cut him off the swelling of jordan he cut the waters off parted the waters it says they were cut off before the ark of the covenant lord when it passed over jordan and the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be a memorial unto the children of israel forever and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up 12 stones out of the midst of jordan as the lord spake unto joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried them over with he just ran out of we're down with them under the place where they lodged and laid them down there and joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of jordan in the place where the feet of the priests which bear the ark of the covenant stood and there they are unto this day and then we're going to continue down verse 19. pick up verse 19 and say just reading the whole chapter but i just want to read this and it says and the people came up out of jordan on the 10th day of the first month and encamped in gilgal in the east borden border of jericho and these 12 stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitch in gilgal and he spake unto the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers and time to come see now they're asking about the the first stones that's in the water and now he's talking about the others they're sending another memorial up and he said when they asked their fathers and time to come said what mean these stones then you shall say let your children know saying israel came up came over this jordan on dry land for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until you were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea when he dried up from before us until we were gone over that all the people of the earth might know that the hand of the might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye might fear the lord your god forever amen god bless you tonight you can be seated and it's quite interesting reading when you when you start to read this because when when he's speaking of the children of israel coming and then when you when he's speaking there's two sets of stones that they're set up and one's in the water and one's outside the water it's in there it's in their lodging and then he says that he departed the jordan when they come over into the promised land as the red sea was parted for those that came out of egypt so they so you know they all because you know those the young ones as brother wade was preaching on sunday those young ones when they they were born in the journey they were born in the way so they there's a lot of them they didn't know the crossing of the red sea but they heard of the crossing they knew what took place because they had heard what what was taking place in in the journey and so you know here here's here's a young group that that heard all these things but you know they didn't have an experience of their own but here they are this this group as they come up and god gives them an experience just like he gave the children that their fathers when they came up they had they had us just the same kind of experience that they had to go through and you know there's several different things that you just you when you look at this tonight because you know when you see that god he was so real and he was he was so present before the people that when he began to speak and he began to do and he it was there and you know and and and here you know when they were in the in the in egypt when they were in bondage you know god come and spoke to them to bring them out you know he didn't he didn't forget about him but he came and you know and every time that when he when he started to bring them out everything that they came up against he had an answer for and he showed himself present and he showed himself real and he showed himself faithful to the people so that every time anything happened there was not anything that god failed at to give them give them an answer because here they are in bondage to to the greatest nation that's on the face of the earth and here they are here they are living in bondage and they begin to cry out to god because they god didn't forget who they were sometimes they forgot who they were but god didn't forget who they were and he never forgot his covenant with those people and here they are when that when he comes to him in egypt to bring them out within everything that was uh was a hindrance to them that was that was strong and mighty he destroyed you know when you when you go back and you when you begin to read in the old testament when you begin to read each one of the plagues that came what was what was the answer for one of the plagues each plague what was it it was attacking a deity a god that egypt had they worshipped they worshipped the god of the nile well guess what they they couldn't keep it from turning into blood so when you when you began to see all of the things there was each time they had a deity or a god well then god raised up and said you know what your god has no power your deity has no power so you know what i'm going to send fleas and flies and the frogs and everything else and i'm gonna make it so i'm gonna make it so dark that the darkness is failed and here and here and each one of things and you know and then he took and uh slave slayed the first the firstborn of man and beast why because he showed each one of their gods that the egyptians had all of their faith that had all their confidence in who was binding them who had them under bondage but you know what they they had all of their confidence in all this and god went in there and destroyed every one of them he been every one of them i was listening to brother trevor iman some time back and brother trevor was i didn't i didn't know this i thought it was quite interesting that uh the egyptians actually thought that frogs were um very important they were some kind of in their deity you know it was it was a a sin to kill a frog so you know what they had all them frogs and they couldn't get rid of them so you know it's one more night with the frogs but they were there was no way getting rid of them but you know what each one of those things was done to prove to the children of israel that god was present that god was faithful that god was powerful that he had the power to lead them so that everything they went through he gave them an answer to then when he told him he set him in order and he told him he said take the lamb he said he said take take this lamb he said roast it with fire he said no water it has to be roasted with fire all of its intros has to be it's a full lamp now you know when you when you think about that sometimes you know that might not miss most uh appetizing smell when you're racing that whole thing by itself but you know that's what they were supposed to eat they had to have their shoes on their feet their staff in their hand eating that unleavened bread why because he was telling listen now it's time because of what you've seen what i've done what i what i have promised now it's going to come to pass and now it's time for you to leave now it's time for you to we're going to eat this and then we're going to leave and so he give them all everything that they had needed for the journey set them in order and then and then he brought them out but the first time that he brought them out when he brought them out of egypt the first time they have a problem then they then they want to murder moses and aaron they want to murmur and complain why because but they've not seen what god has done up to that point they've not had confidence in what god has done up to that point so when they come to the red sea then all of a sudden here they are it's like what's going to happen you know you just brought us out here to get killed well no god god has set everything in order he's brought you this far know it's for it's further than they would it went on their own it was it was further than they could they could do by themselves and he's already brought them out he he showed that the egyptians were powerless and he brought them out there and then they want to complain well i don't know what are you going to do now and so how ungrateful people can be because of what but god's faithful and he didn't he didn't give up on them they want to give up on god and so here they are when he brings them out and they come to the red sea then he tells moses speak the word and go forward why are you crying to me and so he speaks the word he split then the word the waters part and they cross over and then every time and then you know they were only a few days journey from where they from where they were supposed to be yet yet and all all of the things that god done for them they never were satisfied they never could believe what god done for them that god was going to carry them over then then we see when that when so you know they had all all of those people that didn't believe moses come to a place and tell them that listen you're all gonna die your carcasses will rot in the wilderness the book of numbers tells us he said he said he said your children which you said shall be of a prey will go in and take the land but your carcasses will rot in the wilderness so he made a promise to those people that they would go into that land when when he carried the all all of them all of that way and brought him up to the place and showed everything was faithful what is the scripture tells us when when he come and when he made the ark of the covenant or the ark of the testimony as the scripture tells us he calls it the ark of the testimony what was it it was a testimony of god's faithfulness to the people and showed it was a rebuke to them when he made the tables of stone and he put it in the ark was a testimony against them because moses had went into the mountain to get the word that god had wrote with his finger on the tablet and god had spoken to moses to bring them to that place when god wanted to have fellowship with them one that wanted to have fellowship with each one of them and they were and they could not come to that place oh we don't don't don't let god speak to us moses you go get it we don't want to have we don't want to have to have that fellowship we don't want to have we don't want to have a a kind of relationship like that oh no no no no no we're going to let you do that but see so here here was what what were they doing when moses went into the mountain for for god to give moses the the law give him the word what were they doing they were down there committing idolatry what they do go down there and build a golden calf and here they are in the midst of golden cat well you know what here because you know what they couldn't wait they couldn't wait on god well moses must be gone you know we're all here by ourselves you know so and then you know then all of a sudden it's like hey well um aaron we want you to give us some gods we need something well then then aaron aaron's like well you just you know just give me your gold your earrings and we'll uh then he told moses hey we just threw it in the fire that just come out as a golden calf can you imagine that it was a miracle no the miracle was when god came down and he wrote on a tablet and gave it and moses smashed the tablet but see the the second set that that he was given went into the art well see that was that was a test a testimony that was a rebuke to them because of what god had done when god was was giving them the word and trying trying to have a relationship with him trying to have communication with them wanting to have communion and what they want to do no we just we just want to live like let's just like the egyptians did we just want to have we just want to have just like everybody else and out there and around us you know we just want to have just uh same kind of uh relaxed kind of life and just you know do whatever kind of be religious or whatever but we don't want to actually have to actually be christians we don't actually have to be followers of the word but we're just going to do our own kind of thing and so here they are and and then you know they wanted to murmur and complain this whole time and god's faithful to him and then he has aaron write his put his name on the on the the rod and he put it in the before the tabernacle and you know and it budded say hey you know what y'all y'all want to believe who's in charge with it let me show you what's going to happen and when the rod budded then did he put it in there as a testimony against them it was a rebuke to the people the manna that fell failed all those years that the manna failed for those people every single day they get out you don't have to work you don't have to you don't have to tow you don't have to shovel you don't have to dig holes or pull weeds or nothing like that it just comes out of the sky and all you gotta do is pick it up if you're not too lazy to do that but i mean it was it was it was but it was a supernatural thing that took place every day and you know what they could say we loathe this stuff we can't stand this stuff we can't stand what the fivefold ministry is preaching we're getting sick of this but it was a supernatural thing that god done and he took up an armor of this and he put it in the ark of the testimony and what was it it was a rebuke to the people that god had been faithful to him the whole time and they didn't believe him and it's the same way with you and i we can get to the place where you know god is doing so much has done so much things for us but you know what sometimes we can't have faith to believe that god is on the scene that god is real and when you know when you come up for prayer or you have a need or you have wayward loved ones and we can't trust god to come on the scene and do his work then you know what it's it's a you know it's a slap in the face of god it's a rebuke to us that we can't believe that that god has done so much for us and we can't believe that he can that he's still the same you know just like them all the things that god done he was there on the scene and you know he he was so real and he met every one of their needs and all the supernatural things where they didn't get sick their clothes didn't wear out all the things that they went through and you know what they couldn't be they couldn't believe that god could get them to the next stop every time they come to every time they come you know whatever it was you know they what are we going to do now moses we got to murmur and complain and even even when when he came and you know when when cora and them came and you know they they wanted to rise up and say you know you know you're not the only one that's uh anointed around here you know you're not the only one who knows the mind of god you're not you're not the only one that can do all these things moses we are too and then moses is like well we'll find out well you know if these people have just live a natural life and anything nothing supernatural happens to them then you know what they're of god but you know if something happens to these people then you're going to see that the hand of god is against those people and when the earth opened up swallowed all them and all their belongings and everything and the next day you know they ran from moses and oh and then they stay there out there you killed the you killed the people of god no you just heard moses just told you that god was going to be supernatural and destroying these people and they still don't believe it and so when all these things took place here all the way through god was leading them but you know there's a young group there was a young group that was there that saw all those things you know can you imagine you you go to church and you hear moses preach and moses telling you these things and your mom and dad's like well moses he's just got you know one foot in the grave and one on the banana peel and you know he don't know what he spent too long in the sun and you know he's just you know his mind's a little baked and you know or whatever you know they have all these things where they just want to look at moses and say well moses ain't all that he thinks he is but you know he has you know but there was a group that saw those things but you know what every time they come up to see these hardships and these problems there was a group that was there that actually believed and saw what god would do they saw the faithfulness of god in their midst and you know and they had they had two witnesses out of 12 that that actually actually went into the promised land and came back now can you imagine you know you see all these people and these and these spies are coming back and they're having to carry this great big cluster of grapes and all these things and they're telling you man guess what that land is just like god said it was gonna be it's everything that's in that land is flowing with milk and honey everything and and even god said that we that belonged to us that was our inheritance but you know what we look like grasshoppers compared to them there's no way we can go in there and take it well you know it one thing isn't is it greater to god than anything else and he's brought them all that way and all the miracles that that's that's taken place and he's standing there and he's like well i don't i don't know if i can do that or not but those young people were standing there and they heard two men joshua and caleb and they heard the testimony of two men well maybe that maybe they were on the fence sometimes maybe maybe the young people were there and you know sometimes sometimes they were like well you know daddy says this but you know when you hear joshua boy it's so so strong you know it's so real it's so you know it's like boy you know i think i think i i feel like i could do it and it's like you know well mama says this and it's like you know i i don't i don't know you know i i i've started to get a little a little concerned a little scared because when mama talks about you know i don't know if we're gonna make it or not but you know i can hear caleb and caleb is stirring something inside of me so you know then there there's that battle that they have to go through these young people but you know what every single one of those old fighters those men of war the scripture says they died you know what mama died and then daddy died and you older brother and everybody else everybody else is passing on then all of a sudden you know they start to grow up and it's like you know what hey um we get into the place where we may have to do this and it's like i got to make this decision for myself i can i can look at the i can look at the figures of my parents of my grandparents but brothers and sisters then it becomes to us it's like what is are we going to have the same failures you know you know our parents have done the best that they could for us but you know lots of people have seen the the faults and failures of their parents and some people you know that's what's held them back and then other people you know they've seen the they've seen the thoughts and failures of their parents they've seen the shortcomings but you know what that didn't stop them well praise god you know if mama only got so far that's that was mama's that was mama's experience but that's not my experience i've got to have my own experience and if and if daddy could only get so far well praise god that was daddy's experience but he can only get so far but i've got i've got to come to a place where i believe that i can have an experience of my own that i've got to over that i can overcome because i've heard the word that i've heard the word of joshua i've heard the word of jesus the savior i've heard his word the one that's going to lead us over i've heard the word amen now it didn't happen overnight but you know what they began to walk in that word they began to grow and they they began to take a hold of what was what was being preached to them he's like well i don't understand all this i don't underst i don't understand the seals i don't underst i don't understand 70 weeks of daniel i don't understand these things but you know what i still believe it i don't you know maybe i don't understand the oneness of the godhead and i don't understand these things but you know that you know it's still there's something that that draws me you know what they hold on to that he's like well you know they have parents that you know that's walked in the walked in the message and they've turned and walked out and said well i don't know i don't know if this is right or if this is true or get it whatever but you know they still got young people they still holding on they still because they're going to make a decision for themselves and all the way they came through that through that wilderness journey and they seen all the death and destruction and all the ones falling away but you know what there was something that god had spoken to them and it stirred inside of them that that was for me that's mine so when they came to this experience when they came to the waters of jordan and joshua had rose up and and moses came to the end of his ministry and then when he when he come to the end of it then he went to cross over that the lord took him and he raised up joshua and he told joshua you carry the people in well then the scripture tells us that he magnified joshua in the eyes of the people that they understood that joshua was going to carry them over that joshua god had commissioned him and had enabled him to carry them over that that he was anointed to bring them to that place and so when they came to that place then they had the anointing to cross over and so here they are when they're coming to this jordan experience you know what they saw the ark of the covenant go forth the word but went forth and the priests had stepped into the water and the swelling of jordan brother branham said you know it would be the most crazy time the most unscientific time to pick to go cross over jordan who would who would want to cross over jordan at this time because it's so swollen so it's the worst time to try to cross over with all of that water that's coming out of the mountains is such a force and all of a sudden joshua tells the priest you carry the word forth no wonder what the circumstances look like the word goes first make the word the preeminent part [Applause] and as they begin to bring the wa the the ark into the water as they begin to step in then the waters begin to part and as they begin to walk then all of a sudden the priests are beginning to stand the priests are standing in the midst of the jordan and it has spread apart and it's dry land now the priests are still standing there holding the ark in the water and then joshua tells in terms of the people and tells them listen y'all cross over now and what's so amazing about that is if you can't see the necessity of the fifo ministry what is going to bring you over what's going to bring you into the overcoming if you can't see that it takes the fivefold ministry to bring you to that place that i i think you're blind and so many people are spiritually blind it's the necessity because the the word has to be set in order and it takes the fivefold ministry to do that because god spoke through the brother branham the prophet and the prophet gave us the word to set a five-fold ministry in order well you know what he never done away with that it was still paul wrote about it it's all throughout the scripture and so when they set it in order then it takes it takes it's not us but it took the word and the and the and the those priests when they stepped out what was it they were following the word of the prophet they were joshua was the one that was anointed to speak and he spoke them into position and they walked into the water so it's not it's not brother wade it's not me it's not brother louise there nobody like that but it's god speaking through the prophet to us so it's not our message it's not our thought but it's the word of god that we can set things in order that's how we overcome it because if you don't i mean it's so amazing it's so real to understand what we need in this hour what god has called in this hour and people miss it to bring over go over now the waters have parted now cross over cross over this death you know so wherever you are in your christian journey wherever god brought you from wherever it is the word is here the word is here for you to continue on continue to go forward god has set the the ministry in place for you to help you to minister to you now the waters have parted no and it's for us to go forward so they began to walk over into the promised land that's when joshua told him he said every man a tribe from every tribe there was a man that come and he took us the stones and he when he picked it up out of that dry land they carried it and put it in their lodging place they put it in the promised land they laid it up in gilgal there was going to be a testimony to what god had done and so when then they went back into the water and he said you set this set of stones here at their at the where the priest stood in the water and so when when they and then when when all of them crossed over and they set up the joshua set the stones and they had the stones in their in their in gilgal when when the priests came up out of the water then the waters came together and washed over the top of that you know then it as when you read you know when it shows the placing of those stones it showed that the sacrifice that the our our redemption laid there it was christ that took our place he took our place in judgment but you know what he brought us into the promised land and so when he set those stones up in their in their res the residing place when they set up those stones then that was a testimony that was a memorial to those people of what god had done but it was a testimony it was a memorial for what they had all seen because when they crossed over the red sea they failed when god done the miracles before they failed to go on but when he come into this place then it was a it was a it was a memorial to them that god brought them here they didn't do it their sales it wasn't god bringing you over or it wasn't you bringing yourself over it wasn't somebody else it was god that brought you over it was god that brought you into this place and when they came in when they came into this land then it was a then it was a a memorial or or a different term a better term maybe is a landmark and we know we know in the scripture it talks about having a landmark you know and here's here's a few scriptures in in deuteronomy 19 14 it says thou shalt not remove thy neighbor's landmark which they of old time have set in thy inheritance which thou shalt inherit in the land that the lord thy god giveth thee to possess deuteronomy 27 17 said cursed be he that removeth his neighbor's landmark and all the people shall say amen proverbs 28 or sorry 22 28 says remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have set so when he was referring back to those and and the the uh definition of a landmark is a place or a thing that carries religious cultural or historical significance so when they set this up it was it was a reminder to them of what god had done for them and he said you always bring back to your children what does the scripture tell he said he said tell your children and your children children and another generation so we continue to tell our children when they ask what does it mean by these stones well you know what we overcame it we took the it was the it was the word of god it was god's grace to us that we overcome this we overcame this when we come through this jordan the swelling of jordan and god brought us into this land this land of promise is ours because he promised it to us and he made every provision that we had need of he brought us to this place we got no signal praise lord we tied into a different signal but we see when when they begin to bring these things when he brought them into the land and he showed them this then they set that up and that was always going to be a position for them to look at to remember where they came from so they came into this land and so when we began to speak of this the first first samuel chapter 10 and it says and and said he said unto the children of israel that saith the lord god of israel i brought up israel out of egypt and delivered you into the hand out of the hands of the egyptians and out of the hands of all kingdoms and of them that oppressed you he said and ye have this day rejected your god this is samuel speaking well i'll get to that in a second he said but he rejected your god who himself saved you out of your adversaries and your tribulations and you have said unto him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands so when they came into the land and then and here they are they they come into this land and then you know how they the the children of israel they came in and they began to take their positions and we know that uh joshua took a took a 12-part uh seven-part book and laid out the the uh inheritance to each tribe and told them and they went forth to take their land but you know we know that they didn't take all their land they couldn't get rid of all of them so when they didn't get rid of all of the uh all the ices the highlights and the jebusites and all the other problem heights that are that are in the land you know when all the ites that got in their way when they didn't get out of that when they didn't overcome them when god told them to then guess what they began to take on the spirit and the actions of the people that lived in the land so then they began to act like everybody else and here they are in the land that god give them and so when you when here in the in the scripture is is samuel speaking to the people when when they want a king and and samuel tells them he says has has have i done anything to cheat you he said if i ever told you anything in the name of the lord it didn't come to pass he said have i ever done you wrong no no no no we love you everything's great samuel but we still want to we still want a king they come into this land and you're supposed to be a separate people be separate saith the lord because you know i have a covenant with you and you're not supposed to be like everybody else but the thing is is if you run everybody out of your possession then you know what it's not a problem because they're not there but then all of a sudden when they get into the land and and god tells them to utterly destroy it and get rid of all these people then it's like well you know what we're not going to get rid of them you know what we'll do we'll just have them pay us tribute we're going to live with them but what do they do the longer they stay around these people the more they become a thorn in their flesh the more time they become a problem why because they begin to act like them because they begin to see what everybody else has got and they began well i don't i you know i i i kind of like that i kind of like that it catches my eye but you know what it's singing oh sin looks great but you know that's that's the problem it's sin and what it what is the cost in the long run what's it going to cost you in the end and when samuel began to tell them all after all this time they they they began to live and mingle and intermarry and just all the different things that they had you know they had all these problems living around these people when god told them to stay separate you need to stay away from all these people if you run them out you know what you got to be you don't have to worry about when you got hivites and jebusites and and all the amalekites and all when they're dead you know what they're not a problem but you know what when you try to bring them together and you try to work a deal you can't make a deal with the devil you can't you can't work a deal with with satan you know you're not you're not going to be halfway in the world and halfway out you're going to lose it why because he's going to oh you're going to be overcome and you know and he told and when when samuel come to that place and he and he began to cry to god that they wanted a king here they are they got into this land god's brought them all this way he's done all these great things for him well you know what we want to be like everybody else well you know what it it just it just hurts sometimes it's just it's just a little bit uncomfortable to be a little separate from ever to be a little different than everybody else you know what it just it just me it just makes me uncomfortable that to have to tell people that i'm not i'm not a trinitarian it makes you uncomfortable tell somebody that you know what women don't cut their hair it makes people uncomfortable tell them you know what because that's what the scripture says well you know i don't you know acts 2 38 we don't believe in matthew 28 19 the way y'all believe it when when the holy spirit came down and landed on 120 in the upper room and they came out and you know what they were full of the holy ghost and and jesus gave the keys to the apostle peter and peter began out with the 12 and they began to preach under the holy ghost anointing when the word had been quickened inside of them and the holy ghost the the life of christ that took up residence inside of them and they began to preach and the first thing is he tells them to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ we're not going to touch that can't touch that well that's the holy that's that that's the word that was the holy ghost speaking through people that was speaking through the 120 because that's what jesus promised them to take place and he said he said you will be my witnesses into in jerusalem judea and the almost other post parts of the earth but you know what you got the wrong formula you're going to be my witnesses but you're toting the wrong message okay whatever i'll sell you the brooklyn bridge but i mean but that was the truth that's what he done and so when when samuel comes up there and he begins to cry out to god for what what the people have done he said don't worry about it samuel i want you to understand something he said they didn't reject you they rejected me he said they rejected me from being their leader and he said now they're going to have somebody that's going to be just like just like the world we don't we're going we're going to just look like the joneses we're going to act like the joneses we're going to talk like the joneses we're going to go and we're going to have all the problems that the joneses have but we don't see it that way why because this this is what we've done so when when samuel walks up to him and he begins to speak this day he says and you have this day rejected your god because that's exactly what god told samuel they rejected they rejected me he said you rejected your god and him saying saved you out of all your adversities and your tribulations and you have said unto him nay but set a king over us now therefore present yourselves before the lord by your tribes and by your thousands so when he begins to tell them this and he says well guess what y'all line up and then he begins to call each trump and he calls the tribe of benjamin and then he goes to through and he calls the family and as he goes through then he calls saul and he brings salt lip the soul's got a good resume head and shoulders above everybody else nobody as goodly as as as saul he was a great man he was a great big tall man but you know what the bible says that he was little in his own sight he had the heart had his heart in the right place but you know samuel told him said listen he said no you've come into this land but you know what now you're going now you're going the wrong way but you want a king you're going to have one but he said let me tell you what's going to happen all your possessions are going to go to the king your daughters are going to work for the king your sons are going to be servants of the king all your best possessions are going to the king you're going you because hey we're going we're going to live like we're going to live like the world and you're going to pay like the world but they didn't see it that way no no we're going well it's going it's going to take the rebuke off us it's going it's going to take this stigma off us because we don't have a king and so they begin to go forward and he sets up he sets up a king and then when it when set you know when samuel speaks to saul and he tells him he said go to gilgal that's the reason i read that scripture earlier where were they at when when they set up this memorial they were in gilgal now where are they going to get their king gilgal they're going right back to the place they started well because it was a memorial god brought them over god was their leader but no they're going to have their own leader they're going to follow their own plan so they come to come to gilgal first samuel 11 15 says and the people went to gilgal and there they made saul king before the lord and gilgal and there they sacrificed sacrifices of peace offerings before the lord and their saul and all the men of israel rejoice greatly so here here's they they got their king they got their wish but you know it doesn't take long before saul has a problem and the people have a problem too no no we got this thing solved we got this this way we want it this is this what that's what we want right here well then we know later on in just a couple of chapters later we know that saul has a problem those people that he was supposed to run out of the land that they were supposed to run out of the land by the name of the philistines now they've come back and they started making problems and now they are getting surrounded they're getting outnumbered and they're getting pressured by the philistines and the scripture tells us that saul it says in all israel this is psalms uh first samuel 13 verse 4 says and all israel heard say that saul had spent in a garrison of the philistines in that israel also was had an abomination with the philistines and the people were called together after saul and gilgal and the philistines gathered together together themselves together to fight with israel thirty thousand chariots and six thousand horsemen and people as the sand which is on the seashore in multitude now they didn't have a little problem they had a big problem but see that's that's the whole thing see when you when you allow the devil to have his way that's what you end up with you don't look you know it looks fine until all of a sudden you get you're getting a bad place you give a place you give place to the devil and that's what you end up with he takes it all and he said and they came up and pitched in mitch mash eastward and beth haven when the men of israel saw that they were in a strait for the people were distressed then the people did hide themselves in caves and tickets and rocks in high places and pits and some of the hebrews went over jordan to the land of gad and gilead as for saul he was yet in gilgal and all the people followed him trembling sounds like they got a good got a good leader there he didn't he didn't uh build any confidence in them they didn't have a lot of confidence in him either he said and he tarried seven days according to the set time that samuel had appointed but samuel came not to gilgal and the people were scattered from him and saul said bring hither a burnt offering to me and peace offerings and he offered to burn offering and it came to pass it as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering behold samuel came and saul went out to meet him that he might salute him and samuel said what has thou done and saul said because i saw that the people were scattered from me that and that thou come us not within the days appointed and that the philistines gathered themselves together at mitch mash therefore said i the philistines will come down now upon me to gilgal and i have not made supplication unto the lord see now he's out of place i force myself therefore and offer to bear barren offering that wasn't his that wasn't his job that was not his position as we were talking about last time that's not his ministry that wasn't what god called him to and samuel said to saul thou has done foolishly thou hast not kept the commandment of the lord thy god which he commanded thee for now would the lord have established thy kingdom upon israel forever but now thy kingdom shall not continue the lord has sought him a man after his own heart and the lord hath commanded him to be captain over his people because thou hast not kept that which the lord commanded thee so when when everything went wrong and he didn't it didn't work out the way he planned it he didn't see samuel there he didn't he didn't just wait on samuel because that was the prophet and samuel said and he just got a little bit ahead of himself and soon and then all of a sudden as soon as he finished offering the sacrifice then samuel shows up and all of a sudden then he's in trouble because he's he's already broken the law he's already broken he's already and so then god said listen i rejected you you're done and i've given it i've given the kingdom over to one who's worthy of the kingdom i've been after my own heart now here so here they are and and the place where the where they set up and they crossed over and they set up this memorial and the people come back to that place and all of a sudden he does the same thing they turn the word down they leave the word there's there's the memorial there was the landmark that was set up for them in that place don't leave this don't leave this place now brother branham says and and why little bethlehem when he was talking about all the cities that uh jesus jesus could have born it been born in all these he said then there was gilgal another great spiritual place of worship so there was a so gilgal was a great place to have worship and then we know that a few chapters later in chapter 15 of first samuel we know that later on that samuel comes we go and the lord begins to speak to samuel and samuel tells him to go tell saul to go and smite the king ag and all of the people and uh the uh the amalekites and so in chapter 15 it says and then the lord then came the word of the lord unto samuel saying it repenteth me that i have set up saul to be king for he turned back from following me and hath not repent not perform my commandments and he grieved samuel and he cried unto the lord all night now listen that's that's that's the heart of a pastor right there when you see people not doing what they ought to be doing and they cry out that that that's that's a person that stands in the midst and intercedes for people and we don't we don't appreciate it i'm that's that's just that's just the truth people people don't don't know the the heartache with being being a minister being a pastor all the struggle and you know we we've had we've got one of the best in the world and i appreciate him and and we we don't sometimes sometimes we we don't we don't pay we just don't we just don't honor the position that and the man that we we've had that god's blessed us with but but he said he said he cried unto the lord all night then samuel rose early to meet saul in the morning and he told samuel saying saul came to carmel and behold he set him up a place and has gone about and passed on and gone down to gilgal and samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i have performed the commandment of the lord now when i read the what brother aram said about kyogle being a place of worship because you know when we begin to here in a minute you know then he says we have we've done the commandment of the lord then samuel came to saul and saul said unto him blessed be thou of the lord i performed the commandment of the lord and samuel said what meaneth then this bleeding of the sheep and mine ears and the lowing of the oxen which i hear uh saul uh we can't hear your testimony for your testimony your testimony's behind you and they're making all that noise back there that's that's your that's the testimony oh no we've done what the lord told us to do i i don't want to be in his shoes he said and saul said they have brought them from the amalekites now the the commission that was given to them the commandment that was given to them was to utterly destroy the amalekites don't bring anything back everything is utterly destroyed kill everything men women children everything that moves and breathes slay it burn it and get rid of it oh no we we've got a we got a better plan now look look he said for the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and the rest we have utterly destroyed well god didn't want that god didn't didn't ask for that then samuel said unto saul stay and i will tell thee what the lord hath said to me this night and he said in him say on and samuel said when thou was little and not on sight was thou not made the head of the tribes of israel and the lord anointed thee to be the king over israel and the lord sent thee on a journey and said go and utterly destroy the sinners of the amalekites and fight against them until they be consumed wherefore did then this thou not obey the voice of the lord when this but did fly upon the spool and it's evil in the sight of the lord and saul said unto samuel yeah i have obeyed the voice of the lord and have gone have gone the way which the king sent me and have utterly destroyed and have brought which the lord sent me and have brought again the king of amalek and have utterly destroyed the amalekites well that's that's one of them that you didn't that you didn't kill you're supposed to destroy all of them see if you don't destroy all of it you ain't finished the job because that's the one that's going to be your problem but the king took this but the people took of the spool sheep and oxen chief of the things which should have been utterly destroyed to sacrifice unto the lord thy god and gilgal see there's a sacrifice hey we got we're going to worship that's not the scripture tells us we we're supposed to worship in spirit and in truth follow the follow the word follow the truth of the word all the word and the samuel said hath the lord has great delight and burnt offerings and sacrifice as in obeying the voice of the lord behold to obey the is better than sacrifice and a hearken than the fat of rams for rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as the iniquity as iniquity and idolatry because thou has rejected the word of the lord he has also rejected thee from being king which is a repeat of what happened previously when he offered when they were fighting the philistines and he went in there and made a sacrifice and god rejected him and now he's now he went right back to the same place went right back to gilgal where samuel rebuked him previously as brother ernie villanueva would say somebody stuck in dumb stuck in stupid but he stuck there but you know he just couldn't he just couldn't get out of that i wouldn't i wasn't going to say that word but he said it but i i was not supposed to use that word i guess anyway uh sucking stupid but anyway um for rebellion is a sin as the sin of witchcraft and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry because thou hast rejected the word of the lord he hath also rejected thee from being king and saul said and to say well i have sinned for i have transgressed the commandment of the lord and thy words because i feared the people and obeyed their voice now therefore i pray thee pardon my sin and turn again with me that i may worship the lord and samuel said unto saul i will not return with thee because see god had rejected saul so samuel was like listen i can't have anything else to do with you i can go so far but now you're done for thou hast rejected the word of the lord and the lord hath rejected thee from being king of israel and as samuel turned about to go he laid hold of the skirt of his mantle and it ran and samuel said unto him the lord hath rent the kingdom of israel from thee this day and hath given it unto a neighbor of thine that is better than they'll so samuel and saul here they come right back to gilgal where they had set up a memorial to come to the word god was god brought them this far god's going to bring you further but yeah you have to have as brother graham said you have to have a tie post this is this is this is this is this marker this landmark this memorial where you're coming to and this is where you're going to stay because you know when when when the scripture tells us don't move the don't move those landmarks don't move your neighbor's landmark why because that's his possession and and that's what god give him because if you move the landmark then you're then you're a thief you're taking what somebody's unbelievable because it belongs to somebody else but you know that's a boundary i think brother brother louise preached on that some time back to talking about having boundaries god set up a boundary well that's what those landmarks were for was a boundary where you're supposed to be and here is well i just hearken to i just heard you know i just hearken to the voice of the people because the people that's what they want to do they they want to worship god they want to offer sacrifices well you know what it didn't mean anything to god it was a stench in his nostrils because if you want to please god then you obey the word of god then you have faith in what he said because he said without faith it's impossible to please god so you take what god said and then that's what he was supposed to do he was supposed to go and follow what what they were supposed to do they were supposed to follow the word but they didn't and so when you when you come back to gilgal when they when they come to this place and they receive the word that they were supposed to come and follow now i'm gonna finish up here in a minute but uh i'm gonna try to do this a little a little quick tonight but you know there was another man that came to gilgal and there was a there was a prophet came and spoke to a man and told him to follow him and laid his mantle on him and that was elijah elijah came and they were at gilgal and he laid his mantle on elisha and he told him to come and when god called him when he called elisha elisha's in the field elisha's in the field and he's plowing well you know what he didn't he didn't sit and and make a lot of excuses well i should but you know he said uh pardon me just a minute and he went out there and killed some ox and then bowled it and and fed the people and he birthed the the uh yoke and everything like that and he was like okay let's go why because he wrote god call god called and the man of god has called him said you know what elisha didn't sit around and wait and him hauled nothing like he got rid of all of it i got nothing to go back to i burned i burned all that stuff behind me i got nothing else to go back to and so you know what he started he began to walk with with elijah and so as as we know that brother ram talks about you know he says that he began to walk with him and and and the message god called man you know brother i'm talking about him bringing him into training he wanted he wanted to bring the he wanted to train elisha and give him some training and then he continues on you can scroll up brother throw up there it is so save some of the the reading but you can read it later but um you know he he had this thing that he left all that and he came he said now god's god's got to give him some training he's he's been training him how to keep his eyes on the furrow with twelve yoke of ox and and one man playing with him he taught him some patience and how to be patient and train those ox to walk straight in the line and he had to train some men afterwards he said keep them on the bible on the word lined up with the word stay straight in the line and then even god had to school him a little bit he said now terry you hear and he said i got to go to guild all the lord has called me so elijah has been called but elisha says and the prophet after he had felt that power upon him in the robe of elijah he said as the lord liveth and your soul liveth he said i'll not leave you he said went on to gilgal which is the place of christian confession and baptism and then he said just stay right here this is good enough you've made confession in baptism this is good enough he said i'm going to bethel which means the house of god but you know then then he he said he was going beyond that and so when when he come to the place of the house of god and then he says no he said as your soul lived as the lord lives he said i'm gonna follow you so he goes to the next place and then he continues on from there and he goes to the in the next place and and what's so amazing is is when you when you see that when they cross over in joshua chapter five when the children of israel cross over they cross over jordan they're in the midst of gilgal and they feed the passover in the plains of jericho and when elisha is following elijah they're in gilgal which brother brown types is justification so they come to gilgal then he says he said but the lord has called me to jericho to where the prophets are where the school of the prophets are and he said he said has the thou so lived the lord's liveth he said he said i'm not staying here he said i'm going on he said you're going to jericho i'm going to jericho and so he follows him into jericho where the school of the prophets are and they prophesied to him he said do you not realize that your master is going to be taken from you he said well i know that but he said i'm still following him he said he said he said i've got a desire because god has laid his mantle upon me and he said he's called me to do something so i'm going to follow this and i'm going to continue and then when he comes to that place then then when elijah asked elisha he said he said what do you want from me what is it that you desire he said i want a double portion he said i've seen what you've done i've seen i've seen the power that you have he said i want a double portion he said i want he said i want what you've got he said i want he said it but i want a double portion of that he said you've asked a hard thing he said but if you see me when i go he said you'll receive that he had late he'd laid elijah had laid his mantle upon elisha in the field when he called him but you know what come back upon elisha when elijah left when they left jericho they went to the jordan they began to walk to the jordan and they took that and he smote the waters and they parted and then we crossed over then elijah left but what came back upon elisha was that mantle he received the mantle and brother around top he said it's a type of christ and the church as a type of of the of the bride receiving it and so you know when you when you see that how how this took place and then he received that then he crawled he smote the waters he said where is the lord where is the god of elijah and he crossed back over the waters and the people began to see that he said the spirit of elijah rest upon elisha they began to see what was taking place why because elijah was still in their midst the spirit of elijah had was resting upon him and so it's the same way with the bride when you when when you see what god has called you to it's it's up to you but you know you god called you in the beginning he he brought them over jordan he brought them through the wilderness and he brought them into the land which is a type of the baptism of the holy ghost the new birth they came in but here's elijah the bride in christ and here they are and they start rotting so you know when when they say well praise god you know you know you've got the new birth and that's it no that's the beginning of your next journey your journey ain't finished why because you're in gilgal and you know you're in the place of worship of instruction of rebuke each one of those things took place in google one because that's where god brought them to when you start hearing in justification so when when you've come into the new birth you've not left justification you've not finished that's where you're starting and then you come to jericho you're walking toward jordan to overcome and it's a continuation all the way through every step of the way and so here they are when they come so god is bringing you to that same place bringing you to overcoming and so you know how far how far will you go just like elisha i'm gonna follow you all the way he's calling you up the statue of a perfect man he said add to your faith virtue and divert you knowledge into knowledge temperance well if he's calling you to that then how far are you gonna how far are you going well i'm going to go all the way lord you call me then i'm going to continue to go i'm going to go down and continue to go one because i'm leading it and it takes us all the way back back to georgia all the way to jordan you got to cross over why because there's a death another death just just just as as in the beginning when you cross over and you there's been an overcoming and you've received the holy ghost but you know what then brother branham says you know when you come all this way he said you see you've not received the holy ghost why because there's another death that's going to take place why because i must decrease that he might increase well because there's another place one because it's not it's not just him speaking but he said he said the bride has got to come into rapturing conditions she's got to come into speaking condition so she's got to come back to that place that the mantle that was upon elijah will rest upon elisha the same spirit that anointed him anoints us we have the same ministry that he had she is him so when he comes back today that we have the same ministry that he has we come back to the same place then you know what if we realize that we continue to walk in this journey then our word is just as good as the father's because we are not speaking our own word but we begin to speak what he once spoke do we know what he wants done with the word that it's him speaking it's not i but it's him i only i do know what's of myself but what i see the father do with the son do it likewise till we see those taking place how far are you going to go you come to gilgal to a place of rebuke and a place of of sacrifice a place of worship that you come to god and god's showing you where he's brought you to and he's laid these foundations he's laid these memorials in your life he's shown you how far he's brought you to he lays a tie post down and told you you've come through justification you've come through sanctification and you've come to the you've come to an overcoming you've come into the land well then you know what then every time he said brother man said you can know where you are with god at any point in time he's going to show you the top host where you're tied to but how far you and i are going to plan on going we can go all the way however wherever you go i'm going also i'm not going to allow myself to be held back but i want to go as far as you lead me lord wherever you lead me to that's how far i'm going to go well because you promised the body changes there's somebody coming to a body james well then brothers and sisters that's what god has called us to then that's what he requires of us but he's made the way he's made the way all the way to a body change but you've got to see that but it's got to be your belief it's got to be your confession that stone that was there in that memorial is their confession that's your confession what do you confess i'm an overcomer god has called me he didn't he didn't call me just just to live the same message you know just to come and be a be a child of god he called me into a place that he can use me that i can come into my full ministry as we spoke on last time to understand god's called us into a ministry that god called you to a place and he wants you to become mature christians that you become just like him that people can see him in you that's he can see him and me and that we can do the greater works that we can do what god wants us to do that's what god has called us to then when we when brother wait speaking of uh the son of man who is this son of man well we're not looking back 2 000 years ago we're not look we're not looking to see brother branham we're starting to see this this god this life that was given in human flesh in human flesh god has called us to believe it's a great thing to understand what god has called us but it's a great responsibility that god has given us we're so blessed but we don't realize sometimes we don't see what god has blessed us with god has called us to this how how wonderful to understand what god has called us to i i you know i i i i that that's my that's my desire i want i want to be just at what what god shows us in the word that's what i want us i want i want to be just that i want to be so sold out i don't want nothing of the world i don't want to have nothing holding me back i can i can see what god's called us to and it and it's our it's our day to fulfill his word amen god bless you not let's stand we'll have the musicians coming i want i want to live the way he wants me to live i want i want to do whatever he calls me i don't want to have my own thought i don't i don't need to
