is here that made it the brave the ever how 110th of answers nice we got maybe that much but we want to try to make sure we're all safe so so good to be here if you got your Bibles turn to the Book of Revelations and we'll get started like said good to be here had a wonderful time in the Bible study last night and had some good questions and good answer so we had a had a wonderful time so you ought

be first seal part 5 and we will now I hope you enjoyed last idea on the mystery of iniquity because it really showed showed a lot of things that that time we'll get into it in a minute we'll recount but I hope you saw one thing's for sure that the mystery of iniquity is now history brother Branham said the mystery is now have become history that mystery of iniquity has been open it back in the first part of the church ages it was hid now it's fully open fully revealed we know just like what we know where we come from what we're doing here where we're going we know now where the man of sin come from what he's doing right now and where he's going to end up some to me that's what the seals are tells us where we come from what we're doing here where we're going that's the simplest way to show the plan of redemption where we came from where we're going I mean what we're doing here where we're going so I just keep selling you prayers well it's 38 degrees I checked on the Weather Channel so everything's gone all the ice done some just wet weather and that's all there is so don't worry about it we'll we could put in two services in one so guess what I'm gonna take my time revelation see verse one let's bow our heads before we get started gently father we thank you today for giving us a time to come and fellowship Lord under this building this warm and comfortable father and we know there's people in the world Lord as we were thinking not long ago there's people in the world that would be out in this weather walking to church and being in the cold and being in the hot being in the wet but Lord one day when we get to the other side they're not gonna be cold anymore they're not gonna be hot not gonna be rainy it's all gonna be wonderful because they can't they they overcame I love the many times you said in your Bible about he that overcometh so we all got to overcome something Lord I prayed that now we'll overcome the things of the world just for a little while as we sit down and hear from you Lord you do the speaking you'd be the one that does the manifestation the revelation and Lord just be with the ones truly that are homesick Hjelm family and all those that are there not feeling well we pray this you just touch them we know the flu bugs going around everywhere even taking lives of some people father we just plead the blood that you would just cover us all keep us safe Lord we have a job to do here until we're finished with the job Lord keep us all healthy keep us all strong just bless each one forgive us of our sins in our many mistakes bless the missionaries on the foreign fields Lord give them fruit for their labor take care of us now to further them in the service in Jesus name we pray amen our revelation 6 verse 1 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see man I got some new contacts and I can see better now and this is good and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer you may be seated in the Lord has blessed wasn't gonna use a chart today but I think we'll that's all I got I appreciate brother Danny always won't try to help but sometimes get into all this narrow stuff one person is about enough time we just run all over each other so I tell you to turn around shake somebody's hand Bettina not enough of you here to do that soon but that's alright Lord brother Guardian and and that's gonna say sister Guardi brother guardian and his sister made in here is this John you made it here and that's good always like to see their smile of faith you're talking about been here for a while now brother Daugherty Holly's not here I'd give him a rose but brother dart he's been here since I was just a child and I'm 58 years old so that tells you how old he is but it also gives him accolades that he's been here for a long time and he don't look my age either and younger sometimes you hate people with godly jealousy you know y'all excuse me I have an old beekeeper that's on the YouTube and he's from Mississippi and he was getting from the camera he said excuse my backside so excuse my backside alright so now the way we started Bob was if from what you had is this fresh this is not what you know ken but if you'll notice Bob brought his own his own brand up here the other day so so I wasn't afraid to drink it I just want to make sure it wasn't real warm so as we get started now let's pull up the next one and show we've got to keep saying this this scratching or anything that's okay a little bit sometimes I like these sweaters now I think they look good but it keeps your thumb and pull the coat off but sometimes it gets caught so now remember we still got to remember Redemption now let's get started by wait now okay yo show the slipper you don't you to slip another hour or two something maybe three but the breaking of the seals is not necessarily hey I like those a little thing for their soul because the soul is redeemed by the new birth all right because we're going to talk today about justification which is number one it's a work of the holy ghost right all right the bowel right say man cuz I'm gonna take my time today we don't have nothing else to do I'm gonna take my time alright if you're hungry eat it home to Bible fast but it will we're gonna eat right here I'm gonna have you in the front row but it will bring full fellowship into manifestation now what we're talking about is there was a time when when Adam and guard fellowship together right no problem he could walk up the guard guard to walk up to him and in the cool of the day and they could just converse talk about whatever but there was a time when that thing separated I ma'am so now what is that was the fall so now what we got to do is is get back into full fellowship what we got to get out of our mind is though I think about this other day what we got to get out of our mind is is that in the Millennium this is going to happen in the future home this is gonna happen no no no Adams full fellowship with God was we're in heaven right here on earth walking on the Saint listen this is the same earth that Adam walked on before the fall and then and what fell was Adam fell and then it took this ball we call earth with it alright so the full fellowship listen God can't even fully fellowship with the earth like he gives to a man same way with that with you and I he can't fellowship with us like he really wants to like I said many times before he's waited so patient for this bride to come into maturity enough to where he can come back into fellowship man it's like it's like you know Jim gonna be gone for six months or something and and then here I come back or here she comes back man I'd you know I'd go crazy before that time gods waited thousands of years for you and I to come to a place that he can talk to us and I was reading and I may have brought it but may not that we're brother Branham was talking about that you and I are the justification of God I did bring it I do I just came to my memory I did bring you and I are the justification of God because the Bible said that he raised for our justification and then and then in turn the reason he raised is that you and I can come into the same place that he was standing on the earth in a glorified body talking to people eating fellowship and for 30 to 40 days and then he disappeared into another dimension all right so that's what's gonna happen to you and I is there any different no he just did it first so that you and I can follow behind a man he did all this first he's always like I said he's the originator Satan is not the originator of anything because what's going to happen when we leave here what's going to happen Satan's going to come and incarnate a man just like God incarnate as bride go that man the Pope whatever you want to call it is going to be in full control of Satan he is going to be Satan standing on the earth and then now Satan was standing in the earth and a beast back in the garden he's gonna be standing on the Beast a man when we leave this place all right that all right but see thank God we're not gonna be here to see it because he could almost deceive the very elect in the position he's in right now much less he's going to deceive Bobby's going to see the whole world the whole world is gonna fall at his feet Muslim Islam Christian Catholics Jews they're all going to fall for this one man amen but now we know who he is we know his tribal from you talked about the trail of the serpent well my brother but I didn't have to preach it he preached it the whole time he he he told us the whole trail he gave it to us all the way to his destruction in coming to the future home amen because remember he's going to the lake of fire before even why throne judgment he a man the false prophet right what the Bible says that's what we got to get back to and see that I want you to sense why we've stayed in the Bible last Sunday and I think we'll stay in the Bible something that's done you because out of the Bible comes everything we need the love letter that we have we need to start reading it a little bit more intimate not so much as more not so much as moral we need to read the Bible more but I'd sit there and read the Bible twenty-five times and not get anything but to read a scripture and then see that it connects with what we're talking about and to see that it connects on there was one here that you know and I only just plant this little seed remember brother Branham told us about just justification the first form of justification chopped off your past sin you can't find that in a dictionary it's not in the dictionary you can't find it anywhere but in the Bible and it's so clear you read it you go man where'd that come from you want talking about when when the word opens up it's been there all along it's been there and since since the 1500s when they put everything together but man has read it and read it with all different kind of glasses but now you and I we are going to see as we were talking about going up the statue a perfect man to be more it's just it's more it's adding to add to your faith virtue knowledge never add to your faith remember faiths not an add face something you get it the new birth all right so we'll get into that in just a second because we're gonna have to go through the three types of justification is that that's all right just to kind of get everything set the way it's supposed to be but let's read first and let's get this mystery of iniquity just as a background of what we had last Sunday it's gonna be some of the same quotes and some of the same scriptures but I think we need to read it to recap just a little bit because look the mystery of iniquity is done it's not a mystery to us anymore amen all right so look number one brother Brown talks about Revelation chapter 5 I want to keep this I want you to keep in your mind he is preaching Redemption where do you look at the white horse riders or you look at the bows in the air no arrows and that is all showing us something about the plan of redemption he said hold that word Redemption the prophets in Revelation chapter 5 see what it's doing it's the seals opening up just begin to reveal the plan of redemption alright how he did it it's all over now just about just about finishing up now he said that in 1961 we're 50 years plus past that amen it's not three minutes to midnight anymore like Bob said or whoever it was couple Sundays ago it's two minutes to midnight they put the clock to two minutes to midnight now all right because the nuclear you know what's going on in North Korean something so we're now two minutes to midnight we're at the end time so that's why the things are being revealed because he told us it would be revealed when in the evening time all right this is it so you can we're an evening time but don't you file any time it talks about the evening sacrifice for the evening happening or what happens in the evening it's talking directly to me and you got all rights amen all right so now let's go and read the mystery of iniquity but let's read what we read last Sunday and test solonius for the mystery of iniquity that's already works he nights already working Paul said grievious wolves have come among you amen and has already started what taking the word apart two thousand years ago during Paul's time all right which this was written when what's daesil onehans it would be close to about eighty fifty so somewhere in so you see that it's already begun the day of Pentecost is 80 30 20 years later they've already started but if submit and it's becoming you know why it was a mystery because that people accepted it we got to cover that people accepted it now when you come to the first three ages they didn't accept it they fought against it all right because they had the pure word to work with all right but then you come any other Church ages and they start accepting that there's your mystery that the whole time God never put in a father son Holy Ghost baptism so that had to be that mystery man God accepted it though he winked at he said hey you know there's coming a time today there's coming a time but I'll accept that the way it is now you gonna have to ask God why he accepted it I just believe that he did because he he he put them people in Calamba Luther with the Trinitarian Wesley with the Trinitarian so God accepted that sealed him away but like brother Dale said that was what potentially potentially now not but they didn't have the Holy Ghost but he wasn't the fullness it wasn't the it wasn't the apex of what God wanted but he was what he was pleased to dwell during that time so what happened that mystery of iniquity he just hid itself right in the church not in the world he hid it in the church Satan I'm saying Satan Satan hid it in the church Constantine look at that the history's totally false totally false brother branham come and said he wasn't no Christian he wasn't a Christian I was the devil working through Constantine to put church and state together and decide that they're gonna start putting G take Jupiter down and put Paul or whoever it was Peter now to me that's deception - it's high school almost now now is that time but that you see how it's grown it grew up and grew up and grew up down through the church ages to a time to where it was just accepted practice right so when it comes to we're taught it's accepted practice what then everybody just says well that's just the way it is God said Father Son Holy Ghost God talked about a Trinity that's what was that's what he said right well the god of the evil a the evil ages the one that told him that God never told them that but they accepted it as doctrine and God just let it go on right because you know what they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and they were safe whether that must have won they believed he was a second or third person of a Trinity God winked at that ignorance but now see you and I can't try that because that mystery of iniquity has now been open that's why in 63 brother Brown said I wondered why was all that he preached why I'm against organized religion in 1959 but in 63 he said now I know why I hated that thing why because that was where the the mystery man was act he was in those denominations working hey he comes to church then people that bring those doctrines they work to get them doctors here amen so let's read here for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now letteth will let my brother Graham said that he was God who now letteth will let till he who the bride you and I be taken out of the way so in other words what Paul said this thing's gonna work the mystery of iniquity has already worked only he who now letteth will let until he be taken away and then shall that wicked be revealed what he'll be revealed to the world when you and I are gone you and I are the very reason that Satan can incarnated whoever you want to say you know you say Pope yeah it's a person all right so he can't incarnate that person because we're in the way all right that's what we want to do we want to get out of the way let this world do what they want to do because look it's promised to happen the seals reveal that that wild horse rider is the Antichrist the opening of the seal and he rides all the way through but now underneath that there's got to be something for you and I not just sure we know where he's at he's exposed he's been exposed that's why Satan hates it he hates this message in its purity I don't say the message he hates his message in its purity coming into what a revelation that no one else has had before amen then shall that wicked be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even him whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders remember he's going to have power when we leave they're gonna think he's God it's going to be them into profits and they're gonna be there you talking about a battle there's gonna be a battle and with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the love of the truth not just a truth the love of the truth that they might be saved so God will save them feel what love the truth and for this cause God shall send them strong delusion that they should believe a lie now that's what God sent them in that church eight four churches he sent him a strong delusion and they believed it they believed the Father Son Holy Ghost baptism they believed in the Trinitarian doctrine they believed there was a eternal hell and God let him believe it that's what the Bible says all right all right let's go to Isaiah 53 now we know that if we ever talk about Redemption you've got to add Jesus Christ he's the only one who can redeem he's the only one who can justify you he's the only one that can sanctify you William Branham can't the blood of Jesus I've had to sanctify him justify him but he did come to a place where God could use him as a conduit to get it to me and you a man so he got it to us to open it to us not hide the secret to open the secret ma'am thank God brother Brown couldn't keep a secret he said one time he said I can't keep secrets and I said thank God he can't keep a secret hey man my brother Claude said one time I really liked that he said you know what I think God brother Brown can't keep a secret what he took his grave was for him but what we needed he told us that's it he told us and we got it it's here and what we gotta do now is just put it in what in action isaiah 53:4 surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows yet he did esteem him stricken smitten of God and afflicted who told my not Jesus Christ but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquity remember we were born in sin shapen in iniquity chastisement of our peace was upon him and with His stripes we are healed all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way that's where it is that's what it was and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all that all rights amen Titus 2:14 who gave himself for us that he might redeem us and they looked at word redeem us from all iniquity now remember like last Sunday here's our out here's our whap the mystery of iniquity has locked people in for centuries but now that that thing's been made known we can come out from that remember the wild horse rider rides away that man is on that horse rides away there's a separation god is absolutely as segregation as he is a separatist shun the appearance of evil separate yourself and he says in the Bible I have separated you I have made you a peculiar people who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity not just a little bit and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good words that's you and I Michael 7:18 who is a God like them to leave that pardon if iniquity and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retained if not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy he will turn again he will have compassion upon us now this is Micah talking about Israel but you and I spiritual Israel he's talking to you and me he retained it not Xavier forever because he delighteth in mercy he will turn again he will have compassion upon us that's why it said a prophet a man he had compassion on us go this is the worst day it wasn't it was a deceiving time in Paul's time but now it's more closed than it was then and then he will turn again he went compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea and then Psalm 32:1 a psalm of David blessed of the hues transgression is forgiven whose sin is covered blessed is the man to whom the lord imputeth not iniquity in other words counteth not iniquity and in whose spirit there is no God proverbs 16:6 this is how you take care of the whole problem by mercy and truth iniquity is purged you don't have to read anymore and by the fear of the Lord men depart from evil Jeremiah 33 7 and I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return and will build them as it was the first and I will cleanse them from all their iniquity whereby they have sinned against me and I will pardon all their iniquities whereby they have sinned and whereby they have transgressed against me Jeremiah 50 20 in those days and then that time said the Lord the iniquity of Israel shall be sought for and there shall be none in the sins of Judah and they shall not be found for I will pardon them who I reserved now look that's done away with that the Bible tells us that it's done away with we just got to be able to take these things and apply to ourselves amen not apply to Israel hallelujah is was gonna be renamed how long Israel's iniquities gonna be purged but what am i - all they've got to be purged first before they get there hey man sir you and I are standing in the way we are we're standing in the way of Israel all right so now the mystery of iniquity is now become history we know where it's at we know where it come from where it's what is doing here and where it's going we should start to know now where we come from what we're doing here and where we're going it's always in those threes all right so now let's look again at the first seal symbols because we're gonna have to open this up a little bit more now remember don't see if I do this good cuz I think Bob asked a question about this and I'm gonna try to clarify it a little bit now this is the church ages right everybody got that this is one two three four five six seven all right now all right the wild horse rider started in the first Street Church ages riding now right okay this is in now this is tight because you got to pull it back to me and you we got to see this just like we did the onion peel because remember and I think I preached it a long time ago about the the three stages of of grace before you get to the pyramid and then whoops sorry and then three stages here and then three stages here just like now we're gonna read a quote we listen if you listen to the tape why are my people some tossed about this justification this justification and this justification are the same but different that's stages all right this one right here doesn't get you redeemed can you see that the bottom one the one before you get up to faith it doesn't redeem you if I got that saying man if you don't say Oh me okay but that's what we're going to talk about because look we got it we got to type this whole thing out now watch I'm over here all right look we got church age one two three four five six seven all right we got seal number one two three four five six seven all right now you because that's this is where you got it's really confusing but if you'll listen it should bring some clarity to what we're talking about because this one tops the first church this first three ages top to first seal all right this would be the second seal all right this would be the third and this would be the the fourth in talking because look on the fourth seal we take a rapture we take a rapture here we don't take it in the 4th church age but now but now wait a minute back up here to the Latin again because the rapture takes place around here on the fourth seal anybody got that everybody if you say ma'am a man okay but do you understand that really we topped the four that we talked to seals and I said that wrong but you have to take it right first seal first you come back the first horse rider one two three four because remember five six and seven is totally to Israel but we get the spiritual application one through four one two three four the rapture takes place on the fourth on the fourth seal but we're in the seven churches that's where people get confused no don't be confused just follow just for a minute because look we got to look at justification sanctification now not in the church age here we got it look no wait holy ghost and the word now this is to me and you not the Church ages me and you remember four deaf messengers eat it down for life messengers have to bring it back which is justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and the word okay there by God then say Amen that's why the rapture brother Bram to the rapture to the plates on the fourth silk up there's no more combat beef come and see come and see come and see come and see I looked right come and see come and see come and see anything John said I looked and saw a group I'm paraphrasing but we'll get into it I saw a group but if the rapture takes place obviously it's going to take place out of the seven churches not in the fourth fourth Church ages over but the four seals when the rapture takes place so I explained this downstairs so you just kind of have to listen for a minute because then we'll start in the we're gonna take the three stages cuz you got you got justification safety cage Baptist hold off in the word then we come right back out to the court and do the same thing justification sanctification and the Holy Ghost and then we go up in a rapture that okay I know some of you looking across ah but that's okay we'll explain now I'm trying to I'm getting ahead but I want to show you them when we talk about justification today we're going to be talking about three different types done all right three different types of justification y'all have heard this since 1982 so don't be surprised okay if you're surprised you didn't listen then sorry I mean they'll preach this 30-something years ago all right so look now let's go back to where we started because look when brother Brown is on why my people so talked about he takes him into the inner court now we're gonna read it I saw something yesterday reading he took him into the Holy of Holies brought him back out now brother Del's already said that I want you to watch where brother Brown said yes they already have eternal life puts them right back in the out of court okay that's what we're gonna talk about here it's the three stages you got justification I don't know what spell it then you got justification number two number one and number three done all right and I'm going to read it to you in another couple hours in the invisible Union rather Bram covers the whole thing covers every bit of indivisible Union brings it all out because see this justification puts you what it Trump's off your past sin right does nothing for your nature now you can't apply that to this one because your nature's already been changed your old man's already dead you're going through a justified condition that's taken in this outside man the the spiritual party of the memories and conscience section imagination remember there's only faith in doubt in the soul faithful that you either born-again E or not there's no heading toward something unless you're truly justified tell this to work of the Holy Ghost is like we were talking about last night listen if you're justified it had to be God do it you can't justify yourself he had to be the one that justified you but now remember if you continue on in that condition that same root of evil is still there and you're just as black as everything brother Graham says sure if you die you'll go to heaven he'd say his bride and he didn't say five years later you still drinking smoking gambling and running around women either you lost something somewhere but God was just that's why it's called justification God is just to chop off this blackness back that way never to remember that no more makes a lot of people walking around in a justified condition that God has truly forgive them of their past forgive them of their past it's done guys not gonna ever bring that back up but now the next day you start he's going to bring that back up because that's going to be a recorder I didn't see that till I was reading because remember God gives us a schoolmaster to bring us to Christ but after that school masters finished we'll read it they'll be ok with that so this justification will not get you in the body it chops off your past sins if you die hey listen glod himself hanging on the cross he had to instantly forgive a thief a liar he could have been a murderer forgive him of every bit of his past there was no way he's gonna come off the cross and do anything else but he said you'll be with me in paradise now only God can do that because he walked her white we're talking about white we're trying to get to white righteous because for them to have a white horse in that first church age of the first seal was a white horse and an imposter there had to be a mirror image of a white righteous church on earth because Satan cannot originate he has to impersonate alright so there had to be a white righteous church in those first three Church ages that's why I like what brother Dale said the other day and I never even thought about it Adam didn't have to go through just okay thanks again he had nothing in this package to him part of the Holy Ghost to it but after that iniquity came on the scene a record keeper started the law recorded everything they did he said all the Lord it know the law happened when God said you need to make a sacrifice and Adam I believe Adam instituted all that he got it from God I believe God quit talking to Adam after he'd after the fall do you do you I don't know I don't think God quit talking to Adam he just couldn't talk to him face to face and then got it so gone so out of my losses guardship of the earth but he didn't lose his guard ship and then the Bible still tells you in the Book of Luke that Adam was the Sun God you can't deny that he was a son of God but he lost his inheritance of bringing me and you here with no sin he lost the spoken word he couldn't speak to the tree and it move he couldn't speak to this but when the second Adam come I gotta quit okay go preach about this alright but when it's not gonna have him come what do you do he brought him biking and now in the end of time he's bringing it all where you and I are now born by the spoken word of God so the first justification in this time today do you understand me because remember that first form of justification the Bible says the just shall live by faith Martin Luther took that brother Brown said he preached it but remember when he went off the scene the Lutheran's took it and went into a denomination with it Luther never did you got that but that put him in the body but remember that was all we had to work with the just shall live by faith because we won't cover something in a little while where Paul it looks like Paul stands up and says one thing and James stands up about justification and then James comes up and he says something looks like totally opposite now you can't put both of them and the eternal Word of God and be different that's one of them where you have to go that can't happen in you move it out of the way and you got to get a revelation of what's going on because Paul said Abraham was justified by faith James says you're justified by your works it's very simple Paul's talking about being justified by faith James is talking about being justified by your work he was preaching on the statue of a perfect man he just didn't know how to name it that a man took it that way then you put it right then this justification is right but not today this justification is what here we'll talk about that and then there's a justification up here where you have to know that the real you didn't do it you have to know that and that you didn't come from Charles and Ella Brandenburg Samuel Peggy Dale and then so there's your three stages of justification the real you need it you know you did you were there you get condensed ill-gotten condemned listen and then when you bring it to God don't ever bring a pie sin to God if you've already been asked forgiveness lung why cuz he's gonna go he's gonna go I always says that she's got white slate right there what sins are you talking about now listen if you're truly justified and went on to the baptism of the Holy Ghost now that's what I'm talking about now alright cuz that's this justification you're already being in the inner court I mean you've already been in the Holy of Holies but God brings you right back out to the outer court because remember in type when you go into the Holy of Holies remember the the thing drops down and it's the light of God you're in the Shekinah glory there's no daylight there's no dark there's no gloom you eat the manna and it stays in there stays fresh remember there's manna outside but they had to swap it every day I read it brother bran was talking about the other day I believe was in travail where he said yeah you can eat that bread on the outside same shoe brand a man eats on the inside but if you let this stay if we get wiggle tails got you a perfect man but you go into the Holy of Holies everything drops but now remember did all your problems go away come on people let's be honest today in the mid all your problems go away when you got the new birth no cuz you know why God picked you up and put you right back out in the outer Court and you gonna have sunny days you're gonna have rainy days you're gonna have gloomy days but he's gonna show you how to handle it that's the whole thing until I told you my love day I said coming to church will not prevent your problems but it will teach you how to solve and how to handle them we must have each other to get my hey man but he brings you back out and yeah look that's what things are for hey look at that that's after you're born again you need temperance for what that day when somebody thought you're towing you don't move it real quick right alright so that's what we're going to talk about today we're not going to talk about baby for me justification because see if you're if we're get into the revealing of the sales brother L told you the other day we get into the revealing of the seals you if you're not born again you you you're not you're you're not even in the ballgame okay you're just an observer you're just an observer you're just observing that's what the problem out of people out there just observers well that looks good what I said about in some of the other day we were talking about it look he that overcometh you those things in our life that we don't we wonder what in the world is here for it's for you to overcome coming to churches and overcoming victory it is actually three times a week amen so baby form justification chopped off your past sin now when we read these scriptures I want you to think about these three stages now this justification will talk about way later on because remember when you come over to the fifth seal God justified a group of people that never even knew he existed never knew he existed a fifth seal Jew that denied him actually never live the life for him but he justified them because they held one testimony go over and asking you today who are you I'm a Jew I'm God's people God said this about me now they're Old Testament they've already messed know they've already missed the justifier when he was on earth and coming back in their soul but he still said I'll never forget Israel a fifth sealed you that cared nothing about it this it gives nothing about God this is contrary in every way to the way you should have come totally country this is not it but he's going to use this to bring it right back through flesh we fell through flesh we're gonna come back our problem is wish all this old pest house and I know that's true I've got quotes but something's got to keep this inside man together and you know what something's got to justify God raising from the dead in a body that was going to corrupt that all right so he was raised for our justification those who he has justified he is already glorified that's number three those who he is justified he's already going bud here is your glorified condition right here he's going to change something that should have never come here to start with amen he's going to give the eternal life in the fifth seal for a group that he should never care one thing about because they cared nothing for him right a fifth seal Jew it's not safe Jew I want y'all that we're going to get to that but a fifth sealed you it's not a saved person right the field you is not a saved person denied Jesus Christ you'd think now look don't buy the justification you think the Bible says you turned me down I'm gonna turn you turn me down you deny me on this earth I'll deny you in heaven you think man they're judged but the righteous judge blinding the eyes so that you and I could come in he's the only one that can do that and he don't have to look in a rulebook he made the rule but it is in continuity with the way is that all rights a man all right to feel any charge the garden elect is he who what justify we're gonna read that so let's read something about justification is that Alright so the first seal let's go back we're still in the first seal so we got a blind horse rider we got a bow so remember look all he done when he went to Nicaea is he took that pretense of religion to those people at Nicaea and he said isn't this pretty I got the prettiest bow and man I believe it's accurate but they didn't check to see what power he had behind it because he had no power behind it what'd he do he got in this in the saying we were talking like last Sunday it was a saying one out it started to say anything good to you well yeah sound good to me never didn't have nothing go on right that sounds good to me let you know if Jesus was talking to the Father they must have been at least two then he said he was gonna sin he said he was gonna send a comforter he's gonna send a hog well there's three amen I mean that's how I got started cuz you sit in it for years those of you that were in denominations you sat in it for years you accepted it as absolute gospel come from heaven truth right you didn't think you're getting for the devil did you you know go the Baptist Church and say well I think that's coming from the devil they'll throw you out but it did God never brought these doctrines that our fault god can't bring a false doctrine so it had to be that writer with a bow and power was given why through the people to start eating the word down none all right let's read this now the first time the word just is ever used in the Bible it talks about Noah watch these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generation now look he wouldn't be perfect in this generation he died a drunk but he was a just man in his generation see how God placed it got place that he was just in his generation all right and Noah walked with God now look let's look at the Hebrew lexicon and just read some of these but look what pops up most of the time I look at the words it pops up over and over again righteous righteous righteous righteous right correct lawful as justified and vindicated by God now see you can't justify yourself but God can justify you and it's the finished work because it was a finished work to Martin Luther in his time because look we can read go back to them to the scripture before these are the generations of Martin Luther Martin Luther was a just man and perfect in his generation right yeah Wesley you put anybody in there okay so that's why I was thinking the other day who was it said Oh Bob said Wednesday night I go back to that quote where brother Raymond anybody ever shot a roman candle so this is the way God works he tells brother branham he says tell the people that are revelations like a roman candle but you got to remember a roman candle has eight balls when one goes out it goes off and gives off eight more well those eight give off eight more well those eight give off eight more and if you were mathematician you'd be up into the millions before you knew it or the way one pops and blows up and now remember it only it only explodes what powers behind it but when you got the eternal Word of God that's why it's eternal when you see this and you go well that was just no one know you put it put put Martin Luther because he was just imperfect in his generation but he's not perfect in this generation right all right so now let's go to the let's go to the lexicon again this is the next one to be just to be righteous to have a just cause to be in the right to be justified to be just of God to be right just a righteous and conduct curtain to look that's why brother Branham said he said in the statue of a perfect man that some people have these qualities and they're not born again well you can you can be a there's a lot of people that are adjustment just that are just people good people righteous take somebody that goes into a monastery he's never let simply this way he's never had carnality in his mind of a woman or of any understand he's just pure as he can be he's just but he's only just in his own eyes he's just in what there's one here somewhere where it says in the law it may been bite before but that's fine you can be just in the law you can never get a speeding ticket never get a you know other words never been in a courtroom and you gonna die and go to hell if you don't know Jesus Christ as your Savior right but you're a just man in your ways or in the law of the land but in the law of God that brings in more cuz you got to accept him as your Savior you got to accept what he done all right now right there it is in a minute to do to bring justice in administering law to declare righteous and you keep going through that so everybody should know that justification means that it's ripeness okay right this being right it's at least you're going in the right direction okay because remember those who is justified is already glorified because baby form justification are number one justification you can't rule it out it's a work of God if not then it is done by man and you have no justification except for what the law said because remember keep this point in mind when you go to revelations whenever it is 20 when everybody when the books are open and what are they done they are what they are judged by their works please don't ever let me be judged by my work I stand just in him and I'm gonna let him declare my justification then all right see where these things you can take one single just tie the Bible together and you can talk about anything in the world the listener you turn the Word of God all right keep going to 666 for the next one look around here this is what I want you to see it's actually one of God's after being right see that it's actually one of God's after being right it's to justify if he if he raised with no justification that was his attribute he came to justify you so it was an attribute of God the saving attribute of God and I like this one deliverance of God as a covenant-keeping in Redemption of people enjoying salvation hey man you heard that word salvation somebody been preaching on it a little bit yeah potentially but of people enjoying salvation I like that when I was there v 45 21 tell you and bring them there yeah yay let them take counsel together who have declared this from ancient time who have told it from that time have not I the Lord and there is no God else beside me now look we're gonna layer this again and we're gonna see how that first seal shows one true and living God but we're not gonna get that to today we're gonna stay on justification but look there's no God else beside me ain't just God and the savior there is none beside me because remember that's one thing that Israel you won't ever take Israel it's a Trinity the children of Israel the good Orthodox Jew you can't cut him up brother man I'm told he met that he met that Rebbe on that robot says you can't go God up into three pieces and give it to a Jew at least they have that part correct maybe that's what God's gonna justify do they believe in one God well we all the whole world believes in the Trinity there's none besides me look unto me and be saved all the ends of the earth where I am God and there is none else all right I was at 53 11 he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity so I brother Brent said don't ever forget Calvary don't ever forget Calvary Calvary is where all this was done because who is that he that he's gone in human flesh Jesus Christ he what he sees the travail the soul and shall be satisfied in other words what he done to be to pass justice means to satisfy listen live to pass justice means to satisfy the law he's all word under the law come on people we read the book okay it's a love letter to us right but it's a law it's written but it's what does you do when a when a judge says case closed what that do that satisfies right that satisfies the law it's you and you know what even in an even in the laws of this land you can't bring that back up again so it's put in the cell forgetfulness never be remembered or brought up again listen God will never bring your sins by good if anybody brings your sins by compass the devil because he seems to not have amnesia like that but that's his job you know why cause he was there helping you do it but by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquity in the look that man bore the iniquity of us all right we just got accepted right acts 13 let's get into the book of Acts and then we're gonna get into Romans and land Romans is where Paul nails it acts 13 being on to you therefore many brothers that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins and by him all that believe are justified from all things from which you could not be justified by the law of Moses because the law of Moses like brother Dale said the law of Moses you you gonna commit a sin right are you and have taken lamb left there you didn't just look offensive well here's a lamb I ain't done anything this year no when you went up and put that lamb up a you you said free stuff you know I had a brother uh I stole if this I committed adultery I did this I did this so what that covered it it didn't do away with it it covered it so that wasn't justified because they did it and there was a record of him doing it so you couldn't be justified by the law of Moses but by him all that believer justified from all things when he died at Calvary it was all done there we know that right Romans 1 verse 16 where I'm not ashamed of the gospel of Christ where this is the power of God 1 unto salvation to everyone that believeth so remember this even this whole series we're gonna do you're gonna have to have faith in what God's already said amen you gotta have faith you gotta believe that it's for you oh that was for the Prophet they might have been some things for him but that Bible wasn't written just for him it become a brand-new book to us when it opened amen didn't it not did it not how many times he be like I said how many times you read in the book or you've written are you listened to tape so you've written even read the Bible and said well I just read that last week it wasn't in their lifetime well I'm gonna read you this in Romans 3:19 and this is exactly where brother Branham gets that justification chops off you'll pay saying cuz you didn't see it on any of that I showed you the whole definition because just means to be right is that word about chopping off your pace in but the Prophet told us that's what that form of justification was right Romans 1 verse 16 for I am not ashamed of the gospel for the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believeth to the Jew first and then also to the Greek for therein is the righteousness of God what revealed from faith to faith and is written the just shall live by faith listen that's why the first stage of justification you've got to solely believe that God cut your sins off because you won't the next day you're going to remember the same thing you did three days ago but he's just to forgive your past sin you got to believe it and then go on coz think some people won't believe it in what they just fall right back out right ball right back out of the court don't even go into next ones brother grandma I think I got in here we said man are going they're out of court and he just won't go any further that's what people are same way when you get into the second stage of justification go as far as you want tune in stop you will listen to this one brother Brian said justification chopped off your past sin right now that's a quote several quotes man 25 quotes or 30 or morally said that verbatim justification chops off your past sin but the root of evil are the one that made you do it is still there all right so let's read here romans 3:19 now we know that what thing soever the law saith now you're gonna have to fall upon it says to them who are under the law that every mouth may be stopped and all the world may become guilty before God what does the law do makes you guilty a man you being born in sin shaping in iniquity is passing about your bored guilty I was guilty with nothing but I'm used to saying it something with nothing to say I was guilty I don't want to get this to where I was born with us always eternal thing I've born dead that's why they call it a new birth guilty now look justify justification or just our our a justifier has to look to a law to a degree you understand he's got to look to something to judge you by so we're all judged guilty before God and what's Paul but now what I love Paul because he'll put you in Hell nin and take you back out I mean he'll plea up say look we're guilty we're done for but listen therefore by the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified any sight now he's absolutely correct for by the law is the knowledge of sin but now the righteousness of God without the law now look look that word up without I didn't think I was gonna take you know I thought I had second service and I don't take about a nine but now I got a couple hours so we're gonna explain this look up that word without that doesn't mean going away with without that means outside of because look but the righteousness of God outside the law is manifested being witnessed by the law and the prophets so it's not saying without the law don't you know do away with without know that's being without on the outside right cuz I looked it up I just didn't bring it even the righteousness of God which is by faith no here we go by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all them that believe for there's no difference for we have all sinned and have there seen in us and we're all eternal my new contacts are much better than that we're all have sinned and come short of the glory of God Paul you push back in jail being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus he's bringing it right back whom God has set forth to be a perpetuation through faith in his blood look to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins that are past there's your answer that's where brother brown pulls it out from I guarantee he read that scripture right there he didn't read it in the book you don't ever hear him read this scripture but like brother Dale said he's quote scripture 90% of what he's talking about the scripture and the enhancement of that but look to declare his righteousness for the remission of sins their past God chopped off your what past sin pretty simple I don't think they had that in there I think that just came I sent another Bible I got any vial I got any Bible say I'm just kidding it was always there through the forbearance of God to declare I say you know watch this he's not finished yet therefore I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him that believeth in Jesus that's you justifier of him us which believeth in Jesus where is boasting then it is excluded what I did this I'm just in my own eyes by what law of works nay but by the law of faith and there is a law of faith if you believe this it'll happen therefore we conclude that here's here's Paul summation I conclude we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law alright cuz remember we're gonna read it in a minute where Paul tells us the laws of schoolmaster to bring us to Christ but what is he the god of the Jews only is he not also of the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also seeing it is one God he got to get to one God in there seeing is one God we shall justify the circumcision by faith that's the circumcision that's the Jew and us through faith because we didn't believe we were not believers we weren't born believers I don't believe you going to believer but through faith the uncircumcision through faith we're all going to see the same thing seeing these one God we shall justify the circumcision by faith and the uncircumcision through faith do we then make void the law through faith God forbid he's not nothing you know he's not doing that the clicking let's do that well buy that that better give me a phone sorry god forbid yeah we established the law so we can't get away from the law there's a law everywhere you go man we were born under the law jesus christ is born under the law but when we receive him we remembered Christ didn't come do away with the law he come to give us what he was the lawgiver he gave us a law of life to live by not a law of do's and don'ts I think Paul said of carnal comparisons and all these things I'm quoting scripture but right there the sins that are past I love that that's where I believe brother Branham got that so remember let's go to Romans 8:29 remember justice was served at Calvary the just died for the unjust which made all of us just that exception not the whole world so we're going to read it right here not the whole world Paul continues when Romans 8:29 for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also caught he got called first and whom he called them you justified that's not what he says them he justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we say then to these things if God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified amen it is God that justified let's read first Corinthians 6 verse 9 hey all right hey man we doing all right no you're not that they're unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God be not deceived now watch this I love this scripture be not deceived because somewhere in here we're all in this everybody sitting in this building be not deceived neither fornicators nor idolaters nor adulterers nor effeminate nor abusers of themselves with mankind nor thieves nor covetous nor drunkards nor revilers nor extortioners extortioners shall inherit the kingdom of God we're gone we're done we're finished right we're done I didn't put myself in one of them and you put yourself in one of them and we just might as well close the doors and go the house and such were some of you but ye are washed but ye are sanctified but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God there's your out give us a way out get us out of here Galatians 333 3:23 but before faith came we were kept under the law shut up unto the faith which should be after which should afterwards be revealed so remember look faith is a new birth but after faith has come we still got a revelation that's got to unfold wherefore the law was our schoolmaster to bring us to Christ that we might be justified by faith all right right here new birth justified by faith but now it's Paul stop no he says but after that faith is come we are no longer under a schoolmaster now that doesn't mean it's done away with it but we're not under that first part of being justified we're going on to perfection but after that faith has come we are no longer under school master for we're all the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus now that's right here we become children sons and daughters of God at faith at the bottom of the pyramid needs a new birth then we're going to read some quotes in a minute just what I said brother Brown it then says well now God just takes you out and puts you back out here and you start again because like I said before don't kid me don't kid you and please don't kid God my problems really began when I got born again the Waring Paul had a Waring and his members you and I have a Waring sure listen and brother branham I didn't bring him but that was three or four quotes for brother and says what are we worried about we're at rest your soul is at rest with God and it is but you know what we got to get to believe is that contrary part of us that part that wasn't so it's now attached to the one it is so that all right because remember we'll read it in a minute where brother mom explains it your old husband's dead he's dead he dies he leaves now not nothing not in baby form justification now not in this justification here he doesn't leave the old route of evil or the road root of bitterness the older damning nature still there right but now he's not when you go here cuz you're already you're dead the old man is dead but to be justified it's not in God that you did it and now you didn't cuz if you ever cease you're seeing one you're a goner right let me just put it in straight language you're a goner if you ever sees one saying you're nothing right that's why that those who he has justified lorry he's already glorified amen but now if you try to justify yourself and come to church and be a good person listen Judas was sanctified well we don't have time to cover that Judas was sanctified he lived in a justified and sanctified condition until you know what got chopped his past sins off but watch what he done he'd done the ultimate sin by not going on into the Holy of Holies our Pentecost not all right but after faith has come we're no longer on this coming you don't do away with him know that when you get into twelfth grade you don't do away with that my second grade teacher miss and I just remember because she helped me a lot but you know what I didn't drag her to the third grade I didn't say come on Miss and I need you in high school I need you in college miss ain't no you build on what she gave me so you build on what gave you that schoolmaster to bring you to Christ it's not that you do away with it you build on top of it that's why that foundation whines so so big of a foundation and then it gets more narrow more narrow more narrow all right well yeah we'll have to quit wearing these things I think right now okay okay now look remember the scripture we read and we'll look again let's not go back to them we'll just let's just leave read this enough quote number here because watch brother Brown Satan at my word 1953 now see now Paul was justifying Abraham by faith all right James justified him by works Paul said Abraham was justified Romans four by faith so James comes over and says that he was justified by work now both of them one confirmed the other now Paul was speaking what God saw comes remember those who is already just he's justified he's already only God can know whether you're gonna stop or not look he's not gonna glorify somebody he can't glorify you if you don't go all the way okay he can't he can't he he's just you know what he's just to do that but remember he's gonna pass justice at the white throne right he's gonna pass justice he is a just God hey man but if you get rid of it here man know what now Paul was speaking what God saw it's fake hail Abraham's faith James is speaking what man saw now watch man gonna see man is gonna see every one of these right that there is a work that was done but man is never going to see your baby form justification next up gone if you guys pass this chopped off yet he's still smoking drinking cussing doing right he's not showing an outward work but he's believing on - Abraham was believing on - but James is what man saw he's going right up the statue of a perfect man in 1955 go James is speaking what man saw what the outward appearance right I got faith in God and afraid to put your faith to work yeah then it won't do no good you got a launch out all right now let's go to number two now watch here's where one of my people so talks about 1956 now I think brother Dale read this but we're gonna read again we put in the context cuz remember the first seal the first thing we must see that we're justifying we're completely sinless in front of God if you're truly just about this form of justification how the first form you not even you know you're not your own you just barely in the building right right you barely in the building but now this watch here watch I want you to notice another thing about this the peculiar of the light the believer walks in when he's in Christ now watch when he's in Christ now the three courts the justified man out here he walks by daylight some day he has gloomy days you get it oh I hope you see this god bless you some days are gloomy some days you don't know whether it's really worthwhile to serve God or not now most of you have thought that even after your morning here most of you thought that this morning when you got up so we haven't got that part done away with yet hello someday I hope you see this god bless you some days are gloomy some days you don't know whether you're is really worth trying to serve God or not you're walking in the outer Court now watch sure you're eating manna sure you are a believer sure you have eternal life sure if you die you go to heaven truly but what kind of a life are you living it's pretty simple what kind of life are you living now who are you living that you live in that life so others can see look when you go back in that holy of holies that's you and God so you you've got to come back out it's only I guess the deductive reasoning it would be great to stay in that holy of holies the whole time but remember the priest one in there one time of year with the blood and then he had to go right back out hey man so if we stay in that holy of holies then you know what we won't be able to show the world nothing right come on people we won't be able to show the world nothing because remember the world couldn't see it before Jesus Christ but when Jesus came he was the holy of holies walking in from Sun screen walking in front of people right they knew he had brought down holy of holies right out I was walking yes that all right say man so that's what it is what kind of life are you living every day you get out of here now watch this oh I got my dandruff up today I told him about it I cussed him out I couldn't help it God forgive me sure he will certainly he will your child but what kind of life are you living now that temperance is in in the second form of justification that temperance is what you got to know the tech temperance is done away with look here's the key you're not justified in doing this wait a minute come on down this one um where I can point to that nope there you go you're not justified in doing that now you're justified under the Christian part you are you just fought under God but not can you fellow man remember brother Brown said you sinned against your wife he said you got to go to your wife God didn't do that you did it you gotta go to your wife or whoever it is God forgive me for for saying something bad about mark that's okay but I gotta go to mark and say brother mark see that ties that justified state where you know what cuz when he forgives me he can't ever bring it up again amen and if he's a true Christian he'll never let it bothering I'm telling you he'll never let it bothering now Satan may bother him with it but he won't bother him him I'm telling him that all right you guys I can see that okay I don't mind don't you hate to live that kind of life no one be up and down the trouble in that pool day and night back slid back the church back slid back the church this back apologize into this over here this other fellas just blooming right along nothing see what kind of light he's walking in according to the weather he's got him right back out cuz remember if you open if you remember the courts everybody knows what the court you saw it outside if you look outside you got your court you got you out of court there's no covering you got your inner court here and the Holy of Holies is totally sealed off no light at all except the Shekinah glory of God then you got your candlesticks here which brother bottom even says all can go out in those candlesticks he can get dim even in that we're not him in that court but we're out here where if it's raining you're wet if it's hot I mean for sunshine in your heart if it's snowing you get snowed on you understand what I'm saying so that's what he's talking about but if you stayed here like I said before you stay right here the whole time how can you let your light shine you got to bring that kind of the rent with you but when you bring it out you're out here you're out there with the heathen because that's what not to heat them but you're out there with the onion generate regenerated you they can't go back into the holy moley okay thereby okay with that so that's why brother Darrell brought that and and that I decided to incorporate it because it should be fresh on your mind if you stay in the Holy of Holies sure that's what we have we have to believe I believe this is our soul is sealed total white if you're born again you are nothing but the light of God and you're sorry but you've come back out to let that light shine but to do that you got to get back out here in this court you got to get back in this Court amen because we're heading toward up here where's the perfection of God because it was that you say oh I can't get to that Romans 8 says we're heirs and join heir right with who Jesus Christ and this man right here Jesus Christ walked on this earth the headstone in a body that was not eternal he didn't become the headstone when he come out of the grave come on but he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily he was the headstone the head of the church he just proved it when he came out of the grave right may have a brother and said there's no proof if he didn't never come out the proof was he come and said Here I am and they were doing that coming out of the grave he did what he justified he would have the Bible says he raised for our justification right you can't justify God and stay in this that's why and God forgive me if I if I hurt somebody's feeling but you know you see people that you know they carry the Bible this way and they're mink and humble and that's okay what are you putting on are you putting on you think you started like this holier-than-thou person that did know we live a lot Jesus lived a life he was God Almighty in human flesh and most people didn't know who he was now he didn't that wrong no no he didn't that wrong he distinct act according to the world thought he ought to work well that's what's gonna get me in you in trouble cuz their Christian Christian but they do the things of the world yeah you understand what I'm saying but when they come to us and they say well what's the difference enough me and you yeah so they'll kill you over Trinitarian doctrine I call because that is the absolute foundation of all of denominational faith in the print and dr. right every one of them and you go against that then they say you are what you are anti-crime they told Jesus they call him an antichrist you are of your father the devil he told them but they said work you're above the bug Wow are they gonna say the same thing you now let's go to number three hey alright look I look in this justification you've got to have a white righteous person gotta have that not in yourself but by going to Fleck statue of a perfect man hey man that's what brother Ram said I'm just reading what he said now number three this is another good one you need to close it kind of goes right in with the interval and one of my people so cost about yeah it actually was preached a month after the other one and he's still you'll watch brother branham if you'll watch his sermon he'll carry on about three or four weeks he'll carry the same thought he may turn it just a little bit he may call it a little bit something different but he carries the same file front for a couple weeks remember a watch remember many people today claiming the baptism of the Holy Spirit which they do have you see that which they do have but it's your position where you're keeping up yourself hmm it's what's causing your meal cramps that you're getting if you don't eat breakfast you're probably getting them about right now is one o'clock that's the natural but what about the spiritual you're a natural human being that makes you hungry when you don't eat right being a Christian you should be hungry if you don't eat you should be hungry all right all right but look it's your position where you're keeping yourself now what is your position here's our position if you're born again your position is you're born again you have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in Soul yours eternal like I said this kind of glory that light that tube of light is right inside of you and then it's what's causing your meal cramps that you're getting I believe that's what's wrong with a lot of people in the message they're not getting enough food listen they're born again they're born again they just not get enough food cuz you gotta feed the baby what's the baby gets here you gotta beat it many people you find them a man that's out here now what's he's caught out here justified come in and believe on the Lord sure only the Holy Spirit alone can bring conviction any man justification is a work of the Holy Spirit not wait a minute but roll it up so they can see it in the back but it depends on where you're eating where you're getting your supply from people today even regenerate it people even regenerated people in other words they've been redeemed they got the new birth many times go to God and they love God and they praise God and they do to the service and they enjoy the service and when they leave the service the next morning they're just as lean as they was when they went out that night hmm now that can happen here here here a the three forms of justification that can happen under Amen number four putting on the whole armor of God and now when all that he anointed prophets sexual born men but it wouldn't work now they will profits now brother branham was a sexual born man every we all are they ain't a wine it what they're for Jesus Christ now one now one time then God became man and Jesus was that man and he was the expressed image of the Father see in other words all this great purity of love great purity of power all this great thing was manifested in him now therefore he went down to the grave and died for us for our sanctification and justification and then brings back the Holy Spirit see for us this is one I caught that isn't I've never seen this before but watch what he says now therefore we are the justified Christ was the sanctification of God we are the justification read that again we are the justification Christ the sanctification and the father the head that's a good one I like that quote and we stand justified in Christ before him because he can't pass judgment listen if we are the justified if we are the justification we haven't just been justified come home people we haven't just been justified we are the justification that's why you and I would judge angels and the earth right because we're just God made us just hey if he's a righteous judge and we have him inside of okay because watch that's what he said we are the justification Christ the sanctification and the father the head I love that might push it all right together now see that's not baby form justification but you got to go through that to get to that hey man you can't skip a step and we stand justified in Christ before him he cannot pass judgment he's already judged that body you and I are the body in which I am a part of what how am i part of here it is it's in me right if you abide in me and my words abide in you then what you say ask the Father anything in my name it'll be done because it's there justified glory to God amen we are the justification of God cuz you know what he could destroy this whole world but he can't do it with you in it right he can't do it with you in it he'd have to wipe you off too and he can't go past you right now love that that's a wonderful quote number five crosses the mystery Garberville we'll be done here in just a few minutes there by all right nobody sleepy today much those of you there sleep this is round two all right Christ is the mystery of God revealed oh if you can get the world to see that why there you are there is the body of Christ living standing redeemed redeemed now what we talked about was how about Redemption but we got to start with this first seal that first seals got to open to show a white righteous church on the earth justified in his side why are you justified this goes right back to the same quote we're the justification because we're his victory if he raised for our justification whose victory was it sure he had victory but who did he give it to he giving to us and and that includes the body change if he would have come out of the grave see he could have come out like Lazarus hello he could have come out like Lazarus would still having a corrupt body don't Lazarus not again this man is alive forevermore so he raised like no one else had raised before but that wasn't his total victory because if he didn't give it to somebody we are his victory the church is his victory we come forth in this last days with this glorious gospel showing his victory he died for that purpose and we are proof of his victory when we see him coming down and living him on the church that's his victory now he comes down and gets them on the church what has he made us not just a while he's made us that white righteous person what sins you talking about right oh well yeah I said yesterday you asked forgiveness no forgiveness no forgiveness go watch shows that he couldn't keep him in the grave neither can they keep he broke that seal when he broke that seal he was a white righteous man he was not a righteous man he would be righteous man but he brought all of us with him neither can they keep us that's right we're already there's that word potentially we had to use that word in a long time potentially arise because we've raised from dead unbelief in his word now that's that guy inside got to an eternal word of the eternal God which is him himself working through us manifesting himself that he is the same yesterday today and forever all right let's get to this last of invisible union we're gonna have a few quotes there we should be fine now watch this now I wanna I'm gonna bring this in and explain this because it had been explained in a while brother they'll explain T years ago when you preach on marriage and divorce and things like that you have to bring this in so you get the natural aspect to get the spiritual aspect okay that all right okay same ad where am I there we go hallelujah thank you brother dirty boy he don't ever sleep he's probably close to oldest one of them room right now and he you know whatever go sleep maybe because she was cast over in that side now what is he's talking about marriage in divorce he's talk about a woman now watch she also has also been given a sacred charge from God for redemption now think about the bride you and I the redemption of God is through the bride God doesn't need redemption he never failed you and I need redeeming right okay for redemption she's now she you talk about the church the bride she now he's done by the natural woman but watching how it ties in and I thought this was really good to bring in at this time because you got to remember well listen she's got characters that she must not define if she would Mar them she is defiled for a lifetime no matter how much she is forgiven she can't be justified now hold on a minute he said all women that defile their body they never be justified that's not what he's saying justified as Christian justification all right then I got that all right but if a woman goes out and loses her virginity or gives herself to a man and it be out of wedlock she can't ever go back in and say well I want to marry so-and-so and I'm a virgin she can be forgiven of that but she can't be justified in telling that man she's a virgin amen but now that's what Israel went whoring against God she was defiled he divorced her right to marry me and you but now remember me and you listen me and you had a husband hey man now let's let the probably explain she can be forgiven for her defilement but she cannot be justified in this life right okay so listen don't think you can listen to any of your sisters even your brother we tell my sisters all the time being defiled man do the same thing man has the virginity also you know that doesn't mean you're lost and going on the way to hell no that don't mean that that means you can never go back because you know what he's dealing with he's dealing with Catholics that are sitting in his congregation saying that they can change the virginity back in the woman so she can marry no well that's what the Roman Catholic Church says they can do restore virginity he and that's what he's dealing with me is also telling us that we can't be justified in this life in this life this life it's always with her because remember sisters brothers you were there when it happened now are we not going back to what worked on my justification baby for him justification you got you chopped sins chopped off but she didn't forget it notice now she's been given this she may be forgiven but not justified right all right now that's not the justification we're talking about in the in this nobody got that she can't be justified in saying she's a virgin ever again okay that's in this life but remember this life is got to be changed and man this is where now now now let's get into something now let's go to quote number seven which is the invisible union that was paragraph 78 he continues preaching the sermon but now what is he doing he's bringing it out of the natural and putting it right into the spiritual all right everybody got that same am so now this is spiritual now your whole book is gone with your old union now you're naming your old and your has been transferred now say do you mean to tell me that my old book God put it in the sea of his forgetfulness you stay and perfectly before God now your name is now in the new book not the book of life but the Lamb's Book of Life what the lamb redeemed their revelations 5 we're still in the we're still in the seals revelations 5 was the opening of the seals when the what the lamb took the he didn't just take the book of life that wasn't the book of life only the redeemed part hey man because there's a book of life that everybody's in ok not the old book of your natural union cuz look in it in it some actuality you can never get away from that you were born from your mom and daddy you you you're not gonna ever get away from that in this form until we go on up a little higher okay because what your carnal minds know I'm gonna let you that's why you have a carnal mind your mind tells you you were born in sin shaping the Knik which bathroom mother's womb coming forth the liar you understand one's name know what the mind of Christ didn't tell you that the mind of Christ never told you that the mind of Christ told you never done it we just gotta what believe is that how it is yeah not the old book of your natural union but your new right hallelujah your new life is in the Lamb's Book of Life your marriage certificate hallelujah where your true eternal germ what are you talking about not one time for mom and daddy you're what you're looking at now that germ comes from mama Nettie but that eternal germ from the beginning takes hold now you're not only forgiven but you're justified glory justified Romans 5:1 said yeah Romans 5:1 says therefore being justified by what faith right now look up the word the word don't mean forgiven it means righteous all the things that we read down through there the word means the word don't mean forgiven the word means justified it don't mean you're forgiven now we got to step up a little higher because remember the baby form justification is you getting forgiven number one justification you've got to know that God forgave you your sins because you did them there was a record of you doing them right but in that Lamb's Book of Life folks there's not a list of things you've done right hello there's not a list of anything you've done look up the word the word don't mean forgiven word means justified it don't mean you're forgiven for instance you heard I got drunk and done some evil things and everything then you come around say to me you found out I didn't do them then you come around and say brother branham I forgive you forgive me I didn't do it right at the first place see now if I did do it I'm guilty but you could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty right that's your first step you got it that's number one I wrote that that's number one if you did do it you're guilty but you could forgive me and I wouldn't be guilty but yet I'm not justified because I actually done it so remember baby for them justification doesn't give you a new birth right he just walks off your past sins then what you got continued on is your problem because I actually done it but the word justified is though you never done it number two got it number two up that statue of a perfect man what's it doing it's getting rid of that old nature oh no my nature not yeah I know you nature died in your soul but you still got the old nature use born with please sorry yours born the five senses memories and conservation imagination that's a problem right but you got to even see in that condition that when virtue comes knowledge comes temperance comes it overcomes all that he that overcometh it's a fight like brother Dale said the other night it's a fight when they got in the promised land with just about isn't the Holy Ghost sure they came into a rest because that was their land but they found every right in the world keep them off the land and still couldn't get them all dead I just kept coming in but in god that can't happen once you kill it it's dead we'll watch this it's not even regarded at all how is it done in God's book of the sea of forgetfulness your old book and married is divorced and dead you don't just divorced and dead it's not even in the memories of God you are justified therefore being justified it was accused you was accused you never done in the first place the old union is in the sea of god's forgetfulness you wasn't married to it to begin with now oh-ho brother branham wait a minute we were married to the devil and always don't man exactly because look you wasn't married to it to get he the bridegroom boy your shame now when you make him your bridegroom that's what takes all their way he took your place for you were predestinated for him to be his bride before the foundation of the world the Bible said so you are the predestinated seed now let's continue reading all right let's go to the next one all right now look this is 262 though it's 228 I've cut a little bit of it out to get a point he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by what by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you imagine hey just a look look it looks contrary but it's not your first husband that you were married to the world the world the anointed bridegroom which for Danes you has washed you by the washing of the word by the church congregation says no I didn't sound right does it you might find that in an almanac but not in God's Bible by the washing of the water by the word in the word you are standing completely justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now thanks for talking to me in you this is my message it says though you never did it at the beginning as you start shedding that stuff off remember the water remember the dream sister Sheppard's dream the water was going in and what what was coming out not pure water trash she was worried about being born again yeah you're born again another round of wants all this trash it's that what it's all that stuff this right in the spirit realm in the spirit realm as we go off the air just in a minute now watch he's gonna he's gonna jump it up a little bit in just a few minutes watch this you are standing as you're standing if you're standing on God's Word and with God's Word every a man every jot every tittle where you standing right I'm trying to tell you pull away from them shucks get out there in the week where you can get right before the Sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete justified like you never did it in the first place he said that two or three times talk a lot of Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of you are the pure virtuous endless bride of the Son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the Spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect when we gonna start believing that now listen to the last one he goes on down to the next about paragraph 268 now watch him you're standing complete now he's never said this right here before he said as if you never did it as if you never did it as if you never did you never sinned in the first place that's way up there folks that's way up there that's way that's that's up there in that capstone of love comes remember there's only one man that ever walked on this earth that was sinless right the headstone Christ Himself was totally sinless and that's what's he saying right here you never sinned at the first place God don't even know it's in the sea of forgetfulness you never did it you were accused of it by the accuser but really from the beginning you were predestinated by to be a son and daughter of God you're standing there washing your whole book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of the existence even in the mind of God so why do we struggle down here when it filters through into God's mind and he owns it and we didn't do it because remember one marker sinned against us and we don't we don't go anywhere we stop amen you are the virtuous Bride of Christ washed in the blood of Christ precious virtuous sinless son of God standing with a pure unadulterated bride word that he washed by the water of his own blood that became flesh and manifested that he might take you which were predestinated into the bosom of the Father before the beginning the same as he was he was that great attribute of God called love so if his attribute is love then our attribute is love and it's not just filial love that's the agape love of God that's the love of God that's going to take us out of here that's gonna change our body that's gonna make all things right and listen it's already made things right those who he has justified he is all ready glorified our problem is our carnal mind is keeping us from believing that because we're back out here in the outer court and let's be honest with ourselves sometimes we go God where are you I'm getting dumped on out here right man well it just happens amazing no I get soaked right he said okay he said look you gotta keep walking I'm gonna take you right back in there again hey man I'm gonna take you back in there again then I'm gonna take you back in there again he loved Lord so then the first sale when it opens it gives you it shows you a justification that's just if you never did it because you're not white righteous if you did it right right you're not if you did it you're not righteous but now you know you did it in that first form when you were crying out to God saying God forgive me of all that junk I did he's a little cow forgive you but you're gonna keep walking because we got to go to the next one cuz justification that there's the white white Rochester you got to start walking in right anybody else won't say it again you got to start right why then right and then cuz you can't start you said oh no yeah you were black you were black you were smutty you were you were as black as this but not in here you were black but he want that black out right he says come on let's start and let's start a journey because the next thing I'm gonna do I'm gonna send the next horse out and that horse is gonna be red and red always means sanctification always read through red is white hey man you know I didn't notice that too we play the game one time and it was a red sheet of paper all messed up and you couldn't see nothing hardly under it and then there was a red sheet on the outside of when you slid that card to it the word popped out because it was in white red through red password that's what it was thank you I was trying to think of it just at Rudy's plate she's played password before but if you push you down through there you don't see a word at all you push it read through read that white word comes out that's what God done he put that in the sea of God's forgetfulness you and I gotta realize that cuz he's going to work on a sanctified person that's not just cleaned and set aside for service you're already in service when he puts you in service that's faith you don't lose all that and start again no you build higher you get to start believing that you didn't do this it's not your fault it was your fault to begin with but it's not your fault now and then we're gonna realize one day now what did Jesus say he said who can convince me of sin convinced me now you may say I'm a sinner but can you convict me for being one that's the problem I said many times like brother Dale said can can we go can we go into our workplace or can we go to our friends and the friends can can can they give us enough evidence to convict us to still be a center or to be a Christian right that's the outside God's brought you back out here where you got to live with them again and you got a shine that's your kind of glory out but you know what that's hid your hidden Christ but being hidden Christ doesn't mean he's gonna put you in a monastery somewhere and close the door no no his victory is is walking in Satan's eating a glorified group of people left stand our feet see that's what the first seal the first seal has to show everything right because we're heading on a journey here we're heading we're heading toward something we're right we're and just as much as he's riding amen we come back riding on wild horses how do you think we got him if he's got one I got one hey man he's got a wild horse I got a wild horse I don't I don't wanna be riding on a black winner of or a pale one deal I want to ride why one cuz my my husband's gonna be on the white line and we don't want any thing to hinder us that's our problem but like brother Brahim said you follow what God said you follow the word washing of the water by the word not walking through the water by whatever Washington the water bout but now don't go so crazy like brother Brown said don't wind yourself away don't try to say like brother Dale said like last night you know you got to get in front of picture and you know see that's Catholicism when they start doing that and they start burning candles and and you know you you watch them you see them and they're standing there and they're counting their beads and their problem you don't have to do that pray without ceasing means all day all day right and yet oh I got to keep my mind on God well no you got to be a human - all right there's a lot of times I don't know about you but there's a lot of times God revealed things demand it look like it I shouldn't be in a position that he did why because but you've made yourself available right you've made yourself available somebody wants to talk to you they can come and talk to you about something but I have many times you know you you sometimes you would think that God would really come down in and you know just to anoint you and give you 50 revelations and and while you're you know quiet and you know got a tape playing but sometimes this when you're driving a lawnmower run where I'm driving a lawn mower sometimes you know it's all that loud noise and I've got headphones on and I've got the Christian station on playing music God's still talking right hey that don't bother him he can still talk to you because was he talking to he's not talking to these ears up here he's talking to the ears right here let's bow our head the only father thank you for today Lord we appreciate the time we have to come and worship you know Lord we pray that you just touch us heal the sick you said you sent your word and healed us Lord by the washing of the water of the word were not just being healed of our everyday sicknesses but we're being healed of that sin that was in our life and and you forgive us totally justified us or we stand complete in you now you said that's what you say it as Abraham just stood one day and said somebody may have said Abraham how you gonna have the baby I don't know God said I was gonna have it so we got to just believe what you've already said it's not some extra book or tape or extra 25th chapter of revelations we're looking for no it's still written around here in the word that we've got to see it then we'll see it we believe it and then it becomes part of us Lord just be with us take care of us and the further man the service from Jesus name we pray amen amen you want to sing anybody need a want prayer it's 1:30 we can we can pray for the sick or we can just pray right here right where you stand it but thank you for thank you for coming on a day like this not so bad it's about 85 degrees up here so this won't be too bad outside but the Lord bless you can go with you take care of you hopefully shed something that'll that'll help you in and just remember one thing just remember one thing as we go through this it's all about Redemption it's all about bringing us back to where we had there not been a fall back to we were still going to walk in flesh I believe we were still gonna have five senses in our spirit we obviously going to have five senses in our body because he walked over my brother Brandon went across the curtain of time they talked to him told him what he did they had memory but the problem was they didn't have all the memory they had wiped out the part that God he forgot that he can't bring it back up Lord that's why brother Graham said why would I want to leave this place he was sitting in a place of perfect love you know that is the Shekinah glory he was he was in that Shekinah glory he said I gotta go back down there and then you know what the angel said said yeah you got to go back down there in other words you got to go witness some more you got to get you got some more people that needs to be in this dimension and you're preaching the message prophet william branham that's gonna change some people it's going to get us out of this sixth dimension hey man I don't know where they told him at or not but you know what that's exactly what it is his message they said no you got to go back in other words he wasn't finished right that was only one 1960 I think when he went across the curtain of time yet any breach the seals yet hadn't even started his message yet and they knew that that you know you gotta go back me go back yeah you gotta go back and preach in other words you got
