brother Joe puts that out there for us to kind of practice on them so I was sitting there this morning meditating and listening to him and singing along with it some anybody lost keys we still got these keys up here obviously one thing's for sure it's not important coach for three weeks it's been up here yeah there's been no cars in the parking lot there's mental biases I can't get in my house so we're gonna throw it in the trash can there's no need for it to be in here what is it Aaron after seven days or after seven months if you don't if you haven't used it you don't need it I like that all right remember brother Joe will be here Wednesday and sister Jimmy and myself are leaving next Sunday we're going to brother clogs for the week Josh Indiana are flying to New York Sunday and they're gonna be gone for a week so remember them and I'll be going also the next following Sunday - I'll be out of brother claws we're gonna go to Branson Missouri for a few days I've never been

Royale sorry Arnold be here and you allow the 29th brother Keith Reed we'll be here so just remember those coming up at the end of July so keep saying your prayers so let's get started we're going to finish up on the third seal I've kind of redone this and you should have a copy terrorists you have enough you had enough okay if you don't have enough then everybody I kind of made one so you can see it because sometimes you can't see the board up here so I made you one for you can have for personal reasons and to follow along as we try to come to a place I want to come to a place today and speak on a position because we have to come to a position there's a position that but brother Dale is preaching on now the position of a believer in Christ brother Brown preach the sermon position of a believer in Christ and that's what we're here for we're here to we're here to come to a position all others have come to a place and they went by the grave we've got to come to a position and take a body change amen so that's just that's just that's just our position and there's no other position that's our position has come to a body change amen if not we'll go by the grave and have to come up but somebody it's going to stand and be the voice of the resurrection right amen not just one person my brother branham coming back no no sorry it's the body of believers it's the believers position in Christ not one person right so we but we all got to come to that place I mean so let's bow our heads before we get started dear lord thank you for this day that you give us this church that we have that we call home and the church would be nothing but a building and without the people inside Lord we've got a building full today Lord may you just come and fill us up teach us something today Lord let it be you doing the speaking Lord let it be you doing the hearing and only you can be the revealer of your word so father if something's revealed we know one thing's for sure you did it so Lord we give you praise you deserve all of it thank you for all the things you've done for us the things that Lord that we've had impossible things happen in all of our lives but we know that it was you Lord that majors in the impossible father just be with us now take care of the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us people the ones on the highways be with all of us that are taking a little vacation Lord next week and or the next week after and and other ones that will be gone from the from the congregation sister Rachel and some of the kids and all them will be traveling to Lord just bless them and be with them forgive us of our sins bless this day and take care of us give us our daily bread now just for a few moments as we talk about you in Jesus name we pray amen revelations chapter 5 chapter 6 verse 5 and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine you may be seated in the Lord add his blessing to reading the word really enjoyed that what brother Aaron had Wednesday night hey man that was good job but there is good job that wasn't you so I'm not giving you the good job in the Lord it was it but it had to come through a vessel the tabernacle that yielded itself the garden and we appreciate that all the all the brothers and all the teachers and all the ones that yield ourselves to God so that God can speak to us man that's the way he ordained it I was telling the church the Sunday School class you know this message in this Bible is a road map and then it's a road map now what did you use to have to do with the road map you folded it up right I mean you had to tape map fold in 101 to get that sucker back together again right brother John now you just open your phone up and go hey this is where I'm going but we used to have to fold it well that's what God give us he gave us a five fold ministry to open that mouth up amen to open that map up he gave us a five fold ministry to open that map up and say here is what I'm saying to you so there's only got to come to a five fold ministry to tell us where we're going but I like to like brother Dale said I want to know what we're here now the position of a believer in Christ is okay to do that we're going to be here and that where we were there but what about right now what's your position now in God what is the position that you are holding and under this third seal showing that this is a position that we must come to it's not just a seal of a black course and I put all this back up here again and you've got it so you can read it but this is what we're coming to because look when we get back and start on the fourth seal listen brothers and sisters the fourth seal is the word manifested amen it's the culmination of everything if the if the rapture takes place on the fourth seal you've got the body change you've got the resurrection you've got full revelation in manifestation in a group of people in this age right here that we're living in and it's the Eagle Age and we're getting to that I'm just prepping you for them for the fourth seal because the fourth seal really if you read the fourth seal it is kind of pale it's just kind of vanilla it's not anything really on the wool but you got a lot though because they named death hell follows but listen if all those things come to pass that means that somebody has already come to a position or a revelation of the rapture amen somebody's already come to that not going to has already come to it but here we are still in the third seal though because remember we're talking about Redemption Redemption Redemption justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and the word made manifest are you can go back to the for combat baseline arts man and eagle just reviewing through this for a minute line arts man and eagle those are the four combat beasts that is the Holy Ghost in the seven churches in man we're going to talk about in just a minute because there is a throne position change coming up in this fourth seal there's a throne position change I'll talk about in just a minute codes will short cuz remember last week we talked about the Father's throne and we talked about Jesus and I only do that what the father tells me and the father is the one doing the work and I come in my father's name and he keeps talking about a father and Phillip says where's your daddy where's your father jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father now easily was lying if he wasn't telling the truth and man so that was the father made manifest in the son and that was the son of man but now remember he wasn't manifested son of man through the church ages he was manifested as the son of God all right so we'll talk about that in just a minute but these are the things that we need to see because coming up to the fourth seal when that fourth seal ends we take a rapture in the position of paralleling with the church ages everybody got that say man all right so now let's put it up here and let's look at Redemption Redemption Redemption break you the seals not necessarily for the soul you ought to be able to quote these okay let them quote it but let's put it up here so we can talk about it for a minute okay Redemption Redemption Redemption the breaking of the seals are not necessarily for the soul because what they didn't have that revelation down here the revelation of the Son of God is that Jesus Christ died for your sins and that son of God spirit God came back into you burn out the old nature we've been talking about this burn out the old nature and put glad himself in there and man spirit God inside in your soul you and God in there's persons God working in you and through you and then that was the son of God revelation down to the church ages but now read it in just a minute we're brother Branham said but just for a moment the Son of man has got to come back into power till the Son of God you don't resurrect the Son of God he spirit God he's eternal he is the resurrection but the son of man had to have a resurrection and like a downstairs you got to remember listen we were not connected listen to me a minute we were not perfected in jesus's flesh his flesh was perfected amen his flesh was perfect in him by him inheriting eternal life in his flesh you and I can inherit eternal life in the flesh but our eternal life that brother Brown said Jesus come to bring internal life no no no he ain't come to bring us eternal life he come to make a way for us to get back to eternal life amen but in the body he had to be made eternal therefore we can in the resurrection be made eternal in the flesh but in the soul of Jesus Christ was Almighty God and in the soul of Jesus Christ was me and you now we're still talking about the new birth we're talking about the Holy Ghost something dying but we're talking about full fellowship that see this is full fellowship the words sure listen the word was manifested in every church age in a portion small portion but it was enough to get them born-again get them in the body they loved the Lord they did the things that they were supposed to do and they died and went by the grave believing that what they had in their soul was going to bring them back up that's kind of the vanilla the whole thing right but now the Bible doesn't talk about everybody being that way the Bible talks about an endtime group of people it's going to stand on the earth and say we which are alive and remain we which are alive and remain can only be made manifest here now Paul spoke it here Paul spoken in the first church age and then but it's not made manifest until this church and then it's made manifest for me in you we which are alive and remain will look none of these are alive and we're way over we're well we're way like right here right now we're standing in this church age right here and then at the end of the age getting ready to go into what eternal life so we're kind of it's all done for these manifestations have all been done but what's going to happen is all this manifestation of the white horse red horse black horse is going to culminate in the pale horse all the line ox man and eagle is going to culminate in what right at the end time we're all going to have to come to a place our position that God can use us more than he's ever used anybody before and then and that position is our position it's not something it's not something that we hope for think about maybe it's going to happen while we're in the message kind of like downstairs you know the Jews walked up to Jesus the Jews walked up to Jesus and said we're circumcised we're circumcised PAH what are you talking about circumcision don't make no difference we built our whole faith on circumcision the problem is they didn't build their faith on Abraham's faith because Abraham didn't build his position on the circumcision the circumcision was an aftereffect right God in Romans three fuel reading Romans 3:4 we've been reading this morning Paul says God accepted Abraham's faith then he was circumcised he was not circumcised first because the Bible says the faith of Abraham not the circumcision of Abraham so at least what am I telling you what are we talking about it's not the message of the hour that's gonna save us it's the faith in the word that's been brought in the message of the hour amen if listen I'm gonna tell you something if David we were we were reading it this morning David blessed is a man who God will not impute sin he wrote through all bringing it down and tell him bless it is look at him it was a murderer you know what he was a brother John he was a capital murderer he would have went to federal prison because he premeditated that murder amen his best friend he told him he said y'all back up a little bit when the battle gets hot and said you know they're not Lords they're gonna kill him he knew that that's what he wanted he wanted that guy out of the way so he could have his wife because he had already committed adultery and already had pregnant her so he had to get his friend out of the way but what happened when the Prophet came on the scene and told David the parable talking about David think about the Prophet in the end time bringing the parable bring in the parable of the man and the sheep and stole one and had a bunch and he stole one and David said kill the man that's the judgment we would pass kill the man David said David said kill the man get rid of him and Nathan said David thou art the man but I have prayed for you you weak thing all this you know brother Branham was a great man that's right but you know he prayed for us that prophetic gift that he had he prayed for me in you because he brought a message that we've already proved that he brought a message that wasn't for them people back there it was not for them it was for us oh sure the the soul is redeemed now that was millions of people brought to the new birth by William Reynolds ministry no doubt disclude all the healings in the miracles the new birth the people that were brought to Christ but that wasn't his all of this message Dwight Moody brought me into Christ Jack's Shuler keep naming them keep naming them it wasn't just William branham's load on his shoulder to bring everybody to Jesus Christ no but that was part of his ministry and it brought up to a place though and he finally said that was not my message it was debate on the hook well what was the bait the bait was the healing campaign the hook was the message of the hour the real message last I don't say real message I don't say real message because the other was followed but the real reason he came the real ministry that he came was was to get a bride that would go up that statue of a perfect man and come to a position to be waiting for the revelation of the rapture I'll read you the quote in just a few minutes out of the rapture medicine a man waiting for the revelation of the rapture so we have to come to a place and we're sitting there like you know like you're sitting like if you've watched the dragsters them dragsters elf sit there they keep the brakes on but that motor is shaking the whole thing's shaking but buddy when he lets off that guy I mean off that brake you know 300 miles an hour and that's what we're gonna do we're sitting there and we're waiting and we're waiting and we're waiting you're like a like a dog you've ever seen the dog point that dog is and you're holding him around hearing that dogs and when you say go or when you say get him well that's the way you and I are gonna have to be but you know what the dog knows what he's waiting on I just got that okay the dog was what the dog knew when he was getting he got dog knew what he was going to do the engine of that motor knew what it's going to do it's going to go straight down that road but it was held by something and that's the problem is we hold these things back we are our own problem amen but full manifestation is coming down to even when we look at the the four deaf messengers that eat the bug down you got four we got four live messengers bring it back brother Brown says even water blood life and then you got to feed the baby the baby's gotta come to word manifestation babies are beautiful but you gotta feed them you got to feed them that's what we've had for 50 years we've been fed obviously some of us has not been good food you know there's a difference in food and good food the other night we had good food hey man we had good food but you know there sometimes you eat something that's like well it's just filling the hole right and then they just filled the hole up you know right Kaitlyn I saw you looking he's got a big hole to fill Stearns a big old boy I'm telling you baby you got a big ol hole to filled but sometimes you just fill it up that's the way we've been but we want to fill it up with good food we'll fill it up with something that will sustain us because like I was telling them in the Sunday School class and I see this in all of our life we got to come to a place which we have tried for years excuse me we have tried for years to figure out how this thing's gonna end Abraham now Abraham tried a little bit to figure out what God was doing amen Abraham said okay I'm fit enough I'll go to Hagar and I'll try to produce a child will you see what he's doing then he tried to give his life away to to save his own skin so he could stay alive for a little while longer and that didn't work and then he got to a place to where he was so dead he was so dead till he couldn't produce Sarah couldn't produce and there's no vitamin there's no vitamin or anything he could eat more he just said God I'm dead if you if you're gonna bring that child through me you're gonna have to do it you know what God said finally finally Abraham you're getting what but I remember he started in that faith in Genesis chapter 12 by getting up and walking out he didn't have a quote book he didn't have a prophet to tell him to get up he heard a voice how many of us have heard voice just told us to do things they're not the good voices right right didn't think so right all the time but he got up and walked and I said there's my man right there he's believing me and you know what he done he kept going Genesis 12 Genesis 13 Genesis 14 15 16 and then it culminated in his faith he just said I'm I'm done Lord and I'm done I'm done I can't do nothing you're gonna have to do it for me and that's the same way with you and I we can't like I was telling them back in the 70s while we come into message and then everybody's talking about the squeeze and I saw about 77 well we you know we got kind of caught up in it and dad bought 55 gallons of gas I'm telling you he bought 55 gallons of gas and put it in a metal building at 90 something degrees in the summertime it's a wonder we were not blown off the map but the problem with that is gasoline evaporates so it started going down we never used to drop of it it just starts collectors started evaporating we took and hit 22 shells up in the woods we can't even find them now right we've tried I took the metal detector we tried to find we buried in those military cases we buried 22 shells because man we might not be able to make it you know we we see that was just that was our mentality but now we've come to the time where we gonna have to trust in God technology has been so now to where you can't go anywhere they can go through your house and they can put a hit put a heat sensor on your house tell you where you sitting how many's in the house how much money you got in the house so it ain't gonna matter about that so what God's done gods let the devil just work right into his plan Tory says hey Satan do all this that's fine do it get all this information you want but I'm gonna protect my people I'm gonna protect my people I'm gonna show them what positions they're in are coming to and what they have to do is is just believe in me Satan that's something you've never done amen I something the devil's never done he's never believed a thing God said he's always been contrary to God so we come to a place of position that we got to look at that's why I said the third seal is very important because if you don't know that you've got the new birth you you're kind of behind the eight-ball there's got to come a time when it's settled now listen Satan is going to always throw stuff up at you you know that I mean always like every minute of the day but remember like brother Ernie says when his mouth movement he's lying when Satan's mouth but even if he tells you the truth he's lying because he's using it to twist it amen so we must come to a position though to where we've at least settled one thing that in our soul God is residing there and he is like brother Dale come up this morning he's working his way out it's an inside job it's an inside job Satan loves to put all on the outside make you look pretty and all God works on the inside and it sometimes it's so simple and sometimes like these cells these cells to me folks even me being going through this again it has become more simple than it ever has been right we were talking about this other become more simple because it's what it takes that five fold map to break you down to show you that it's not some great something why would God break something it's like the Bible says wine with a father if a child asks for bread and you give him a rock what God's not going to give us something we can't understand he can't give us something we can't understand because you know what we can do we can say God you made it too hard no God is gonna say son I made it too simple so simple remember that it hide it that it hides from the wise and prudent sometimes we try to figure it out but if we'll see that the seals though was given absolutely sure there's white horse rider red horse rider black horse rider pale horse rider that's for the world that's for the world but underneath that or inside that the inside working is God working on a group of people a bride to come to a position for us to get out of here I don't want to do funerals I don't like to do amen well then let's strive and see you can't just you can't just go and say well I'm gonna believe so much so I'm just gonna sit in my house and don't like a God told me one time he said I'm just gonna set on my couch and wait for God to bring me a job I said you will starve to death God is not gonna come to your door and go I got you a job that's not a good daddy a good daddy lets you go out there and find and seek the will of the Lord and all the things that we do we should what seek you first the kingdom because if we seek the kingdom see that's the full manifestation we're coming to because remember tonight we were talking about Thrones a little bit last Sunday we're talking about a little more this Sunday to be a throne there has to be a Dominion to have a throne I mean you know put a throne out there in the middle of the pasture well it's powerless but a throne with a kingdom jesus said that kingdom come Thy will be done I don't have a kingdom here you know why I'll read it to you well something I wrote when Jesus was here he didn't have no subjects he was telling the truth when he told Pilate he said if if I had subjects here they would find he had no subject in his kingdom he was the kingdom but he hadn't released a life for his kingdom his kingdom is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and it was in no one when Jesus was on earth but he had to be the first he had to be the one that opened up the door for us to get into that Kingdom and let him sit on the throne of our heart now you know we want his if he by the new birth he is on the throne in our soul that's right son of God the Son of God come into your heart sets on the throne and takes dominion over your soul because if you're still alive you can't have too that's why I said you gotta be dead you got to be dead your old husband that's what we're talking about last Sunday your old husband let's read it let's keep going let's go past everybody knows the symbols of the seal but remember there was no power given third seal is extremely important bring up that one it was protected by the lamb just grow past quote number one Aaron did a good job telling you what to order the wine was Wednesday night so we'll wait back there this ain't helping my flow no power given keep going next next one there ya go alright so the third sealed extremely important it's protected by the lamp I will restore now what look if the lamb comes remember keep the senior back your head the lamb is the son of man the lamb the son of man when he gave his life for us son of God can't give his life he's eternal easy he's when it comes in yeah it sure he's one it's all connected but the son of man is who we have to believe in we have to believe that God came in human flesh right died to release the life to come back in the menu alright so we have to that's what we have to believe that we have to believe that okay so he's going to restore not reform so we come up here then this is not this is not Reformation it starts in Reformation but it comes into ref to restoration because it restores because watch it was the Holy Ghost like we're talking about here in the seal number three it was the Holy Ghost in these ages through the Luther and Wesley but now remember right in between here what did God do he brought Pennock a Pentecostal experience then to ha restore the gifts to restore the Holy Ghost back into the church now you say what no it wasn't that it wasn't in here but it come to a position for it to work 1906 Azusa Street that Pentecostal experience had to come that way it had to come right here to restore the gifts to build a platform so that God could come into this age and restore all things restore everything bring everything back amen all right so look now remember we must be dead all right nobody got that we must be dead because you can't be on you can't have Satan sitting on your throne and God sitting on your throne he's a god there's not room for two that's why we don't need to be Tunis we need to be one that's true one that's that God sitting on the throne and you know brother Graham said it's guarding us in there's person that's okay but I want to be so xed out to where it's God it's God now he works back through my spirit into my body and works his way out but Satan works from there back in and tries to stop us but if that old man's dead Romans 7 verse 1 I know I'm beating a dead horse but listen I want us to be dead I wants to be dead you said well I'm born again Peter said being born again I wanted to when we come today I want to kill something I want something to die amen it's not either liveth can you say that it's not I've been living but Christ liveth in me for a woman which has a husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as she live it you're married to Satan when you're born right you're married to the devil through your union of your mom and daddy bringing you into the world and God giving you a soul but Satan attaches our nature to that soul that's wrong you listen you didn't come right I'm sorry that's why Jesus said you must be born again born from where above that things got to come into you and burn that old nature out not just divorce it are not just hide it amen not hide it it's got to be dead for the man which I have the husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of her husband in other words when you accept Christ let him kill Satan you can't let him kill that old nature you know it's like people says we always want always was eternal now I talked to a guy that said that we had eternal life when we were born as a baby in our soul now that's wrong that's contrary to the Bible that's contrary to the prophets message that's contrary to even the way I'm thinking I can't place that I listen I don't glory that I'm lost that I was lost but I thank God that I was lost because you know what there's not a person that's going to be sitting at that marriage supper that what not one person sister and not one there's not one prophet priest king whoever that whatever came here with eternal life except one man and that's Jesus Christ and then because the Bible says the unclean spirit goes out of a man where was it God don't dwell and unclean vessels so how is God an unclean spirit gonna be in the same place Kait the unclean spirit goes out of a man remember we use that with that was I'm sorry son it was the unclean spirit but remember if you if you don't fill it out with something fill it up with God that what cause he's still alive you gotta let God kill it when that thing comes back let God kill it so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man she's you've called an adulteress that's what denominational ideas what it is now they think they're married to Christ but yet they're married to Satan I'm sorry that's just what it is all right people be what they be but that's exactly what the denominational system is it's the seven women taking hold of one man saying let us have your name but don't tell us how to dress don't tell us how to do things drove by Baptist Church Sunday last week and the guy walks in the church walks right in the church for the pair shorts a pair of shorts at a Baptist Church on Sunday I mean I don't like it on Wednesday night but you Sunday morning but you see what I mean though they don't preach on it so they've they push that out of the way you know let us take the name Baptist but don't tell us how to dress don't tell us how tight we'll see that's the way that's the spirit it's not a person it's a spirit on that person amen but if her husband be dead she is free from that law what is the law if you're married to another man and he's still alive you can't marry again amen that's quiet you can't what the Bible says so we can't go and marry another we can't divorce we divorce Satan and go marry somebody else we can't divorce God for sure that's my brother branham in marriage and divorce he said he can but she can't right he can if my wife commits adultery on me I can put her away and marry another she's dead to that degree to that degree because that's what the Bible says but now if I do it to her I'm sorry but she can't go marry again because of the law that God's put in place because if she does she becomes an adulteress that's what's happened with the churches the churches have become adulterers I'm not I'm just telling you what the Bible says harlot harlot is an adulterer okay but if her husband be dead she's free she's free from that law so she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead know who is that Christ amen that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the MOE sins of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit Sun to death now I like that because that tells me I was dead man how you going to get into the law to the law of Redemption if you always was explain to me how you going to realize you is lost if you never was well then now wait a minute brother wait you said a couple months ago the real you didn't that's correct but that's God that didn't do it and you and I have got to have faith that he's come and lived inside of you and that you're xed out like I said you're dead and it's Christ that gets judged if he gets judged I get judged he don't get judged I don't get judged that's what I like judge my husband right and you know what Christ said bring it on bring it on judge me that's what he said in the Bible who are you say I sin what's your problem well if I'm tied up in him if I'm tied up in Christ if I'm dead in Christ there's no law that's going to condemn me a man I love that but now we are delivered from the law that being dead where when were in we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldest of the ladder why Paul because the letter killeth the letter is only going to condemn us but the Spirit is what giveth life the spirit of the letters that all right say man all right let's go to Romans 6 verse 6 knowing this that our old man is crucified with him now whose old man that's the old nature that you were born with that old man that attached itself to you because of the carnal lap between your mom and daddy you wasn't supposed to come that way so that's all contrary that's why we have to have a new birth jesus never told Nicodemus in Nicodemus me and you need a new birth no he said ye must be born again hey man so you know what if I put myself back on him that's the right birth Christ had to write birth that's why you didn't say Nicky they must we both need to be born again no he said Nicodemus you need to be born again because you'd born wrong I was born right the first time and I'm coming to right this wrong and you're not getting it you're going back carnal again that's our problem we go back carnal again knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be what destroyed destroyed when you destroy something it don't come back amen destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is freed from sin now in the natural aspect like brother Dale said you his father's been dead for 70 something years now if somebody robbed the bank two days ago and said Sam Dale robbed a bank number one they're lying and number two how you going to accuse his daddy of doing it why he's dead he's dead you can't accuse a dead person of anything amen that's why I like that song about the blind man that's the blind man he saw it all I like that song you saying that Aaron you're not song no sing it one time see twice if you want to write but that same way you know how are you dead after that person if we're dead in Christ ask me how I got dead amen ask me how I died I'll tell you how I died God kill the old a tried a man for he that is dead is freed from sin you ought to put that on your refrigerator now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him amen because remember like I said before the dead in Christ shall rise first those people are not dead in Christ like we think they're not dead in the grave man they're more alive than they ever have been they just got detached from their body and put into an other dimension waiting for me and you hello wave for me and you to come to a position and once we come to a position we read about it in a minute all right now look if we be dead with Christ we believe we also shall live with him now watch right here because we've been talking about the black horse rider and black meaning death but remember when you become a newborn babe in Christ a lot of times you can't explain things right I mean ask a baby how to drive a car they may want to but they don't they can't say get the keys and but you don't say I'm saying but they're a baby and then even a baby in Christ can explain certain things but you got to grow up in mature you got a mature to a level that we be dead in Christ we do believe it while shall live him he don't want a bunch of dead people laying dead but if you're dead in Christ you're alive you're more alive now than you ever have been if you're born again doesn't matter if it's taking us toward 80 years old or to the grave what does that matter that's just the shell that you live in amen if you're born again you're just as eternal as God is that's the position we got to realize that but what's going to happen when we come to here watch when we come to the fourth seal it names that person death it's been dead all along it's been death since it started here but it comes to a manifestation to where if the devil's manifested so much you know what he is and you know his name and the hell follows him that's a position all right you and I have to be the word manifested in a position to know when you come to church and a preacher preacher something to you you know how to name it you know how to name it that came from God or that came from the devil same way in your personal life I was telling the church this morning downstairs we told Mike the third pull we've been trying to make you the third push we've been trying to push people into it brother Kali why are you giggling about we've been making a third push because we've been trying to push people into stuff no it's the pull of God let God pull if you ever tried to push a rope really have you ever tried to push a rope you cannot get it to go where you want it to go no way you push it like this and it's like a snake it'll go over this way but you pull it guess where you pull it straight so the pull is God pulling us to be dead but to be dead we're to be more alive than we ever were amen so we're heading toward death but we're more alive than we ever have been what a paradox but when we become completely dead will manifest God and listen there is a place that you and I have to really know when we come and sit down and listen to somebody or when we listen to a preacher when we listen to something something rings inside of us that's true or that's not true and if it's never happened to you it will you'll have an aha moment aha right be sitting in a group of people of six hundred people and they're all shouting and praising God over a false doctrine and a whole row of being brother Dale and sister Dale in June and a couple other ministers that I won't name and that we're just sitting there we didn't shout in glory hallelujah why there was something inside of me sitting telling it right you know what I thank God for that you know what because I was dead I'm not saying him other ones was full of the devil I'm just saying they got caught up in an emotion hey man they got caught up in an emotion listen emotions would get you killed physically and spiritually but if you listen to what the preacher says and if it rings in your heart truth truth we'll have to agree with truth it's like the brown I'm sitting I want to say it either you're wrong and they're right or you're right in their room you both can't be right man let's just put it you both can't be right when it comes to the word of God you both can't be right there's a right and a wrong right so if we be dead in Christ then we shall live with him in other words what are we coming to we're coming to the part where Adam didn't have to call on God for everything he needed he was the god of the earth he was and had the mind of God that what he said happened amen I mean look at the manifestation that we have even in this building even in this church you got sisters that have fooled the holy ghost it like sister Barbara back there she talks too much man she just her and sister Jean could talk the ears off a donkey if the donkey didn't have any ears but not look they and look I'm just saying you know sister Barbara says why I'm so insignificant I just sit here but you know what she has eternal life she has a connection with the eternal hey man and you know what if Joe Bubba comes off and on the side of the road and sees sister acts this sees sister Barbara on the side of the road with her tire blown out you've heard me say this before I might say it again look count you said well I'm in an insignificant may have a preach the sermon I ain't never brought nobody to the Lord and here sister Barbara on the side of the road with a flat tire and Joe Bubba comes by and changes her tire for no reason no money he just comes by out of the goodness of his heart you know what he goes back home to his third divorced wife I'm gonna make it pretty bad he goes back home to his third divorced wife pops opening a beer and starts watching pornography I'm gonna make it really bad all right but do you know what on the day of judgment before the gavel goes down sister Barbara is gonna be in that crowd and she's gonna bring back to the memory Jesus already knows it he just wants her to have a part in it he wants her to be connected with the eternal life so sister Barbara way in the back you know everybody's talking you got millions of people everybody's talking just to probably says you know what he does he turns and he goes what sister what my child right before the gavel goes down Kojo baba knows he's dead and he's gone he's going to hell he never accepted Christ but before that gavel goes down sister barber says hold on a minute Lord you said you said that whatsoever it's done to my little ones it'll be doing it'll be done to me a cup of water will not be forgotten in this world Lord we're in the other world he was good to me and you know what the gavel goes down but you know what he said he says Joe baba because of her because of her enter into the joy of the Lord enjoy eternal life because of some person that didn't even think they could talk to anybody don't ever think you're insignificant if you're dead in Christ you're the most alive person ever lived on the face of the earth and then 10 examples is gonna happen people that's not and that's not just an example that will happen at the day of judgment you'll never know it maybe sister Barbara probably will never you know if that ever happened she's just like old thank you you know let me pay you she goes on it probably forgets it but buddy when we get there she's in the body change she's got that fresh mind I'm not saying it's not fresh now but she's got the fresh mind she's like okay I'm oh I'm 60 something you're golden yeah I need today's your birthday that's right that's why I'm picking on you but you know her mind comes fresh she goes Lord that man change my tire Lord hang on hang on hold on and you know what he does he's real happy when that happens gotten you gotten you for advantage the world it's gonna happen but he wanted her to be a part of it so that's what a great God we got we got a great God that gives you eternal life and then you take that eternal life and you give it to somebody else and man but you can't be so full of yourself Dwight Moody says if you're too full of yourself God can't fill you all right so now let's talk about this because of this watch the Father's throne cuz see that's what happened with sister Barbara when she become a newborn babe in Christ the father came in and sit down on the throne of her heart amen is that right say man I'm talking about the eternal creator God comes in that's why she can impart eternal life that's why she can do what she does that's why you all can do what you do hey man lay your hands on the sick and they shall recover that didn't say men sisters - what about a great prophet standing up one day get rid him in a prayer line he looks down and he says ma'am your baby's already healed in other words I'm paraphrasing but you're your babies already he'll get so old that sister prayed for you why because that sister entered in brother when I'm cutting enter in as a woman or enter in as a mother but that mother entered in and intervened hello somebody intervened with God so it don't take a prophet always to intervene with God you can do that yourself but I want to ask you a question just like I asked those those guys last Sunday at the Methodist Church if you had a jury a judge and a prosecutor can they commit you of being a Christian my brother Dale said maybe some people don't want what we got because we don't act like what we should have and then John 14:6 Jesus said unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him and have seen him what looks that pretty you've seen him Philip says hold on a minute I don't see your daddy right Philip saith unto Him Lord show us the father and it'll satisfy our what our brain it'll satisfy err you know because they're all probably going is he talking about Joseph oh yeah I don't see no other father because by that time Joseph was already dead his father is you know his father surrogate father or whatever you want to call him was already gone so they're like Jesus said to him have I been so long with you and yet hast thou not known me I ask you don't put Philips name in there put your name in there put your name in there because when we've been walking in this way we've been walking in you shouldn't know who that father is Amen that's the position we got to come to he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how say us they'll then show us the father believe us now not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works in other words he was dead and the father was alive he went physically did you know that but that's why I don't agree with these people that said Jesus wasn't gone to the River Jordan because you got to separate two people he's not two people if he wasn't God when he was born where is that spirit and soul of that baby that was called Jesus but see that's different for me and you though we can see that in our life but not Jesus Christ not the one that came here listen the Bible I don't need a quote all I need the Bible to tell me the Bible says he was born Emmanuel God with us now don't need no more I don't need another quote I don't need somebody to preach me to our sermon the Bible says he was born Emmanuel God with us I'm done he was God when he was born or he was some other person and that some other person couldn't die for me and you definitely that person could not die and give us eternal life because brother Graham said he said it's not one man can die for another yeah you know I can give my life for brother I'll but I can't take what I got and put my life which would have been eternal life in Jesus's spot and put it in him I just died for him and I become a hero and you know they honor me but what about a man that could die that says I'm coming back and when I come back I'm not gonna come back in flesh yet I'm gonna come back in your flesh and then I'm gonna come back in spirit form and I'm going to go into all these believers and you know what I'm gonna do the same work I believe won't you know what the Bible says now let's go to revelations 3 then we'll make a few comments and be finished as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent now this is out this is Laodicean Church age this is our church age revelations 3:14 is our church age all right so he's talking to you and me right now as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me that doesn't say own that doesn't say own because they are physically sitting on this bench but there's no human way that they can be sitting in the bench unless they become the bench huh unless they become the bench that's what Jesus is saying I will grant to sit to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame what do you overcome Wow hmm he got eternal life in the body amen and sit down with my father let me read again to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sit down with my father in his throne so he's not talking about a physical throne he's talking about a position a position listen let's be honest a king a king doesn't need a throne to sit on even a physical King doesn't need one now they have them because some of them get big in their head but a real King out to me a real King I'm kind of like that if I if I was a king you'd never know it because we're servants and that's what Jesus was he didn't and you know sure we exalt him because of what he did for us amen but he just assumed not have a physical throne to go sit down on and then so it's not that there's a physical throne somewhere because it's in my throne now what is it in what a kingdom you're in the kingdom these people are in the kingdom of God the Father's throne I'll read it in a minute is the baptism of the Holy Ghost he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches alright let's go to the next let's go to quote number two now watch this mm-hmm this is the first seal now watch he said it would be known in the last day but it comes forth in a church symbol do you understand a church it comes forth in the symbol of a church that they know there is a seal we know the seal the wild horse rider the red horse rider right we know the seal all right y'all done pretty good you're not falling asleep much yet those of you that didn't hear me well you're setting up here where I got a hold of you now there is a seal but just what it is yet they don't know because it's a wild horse rider I think we broke that I don't see me I think we in your mind you know that that seal was wildfires Antichrist but underneath that there's a whole lot I'm an an underneath that is for me the justification that comes under the first seal and it only to be revealed at the last day when this actual seal is broken broken to who not to cross now watch what's what hold on man watch look at me watch the position change in this one quote right here broken to who not to cross but to the church hold on a minute brother branham the whole church because remember the church can brought you different things watch watching notice now oh my that just makes me tremble I hope that the church truly understands it see what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand it he's talking to the bride amen not the church he's talking to the bride the voice is a thunder the voice came from where from the throne now here we are this is revelations five from the throne where the lamb had just left as intercessor now he's standing here to take his position and his claims but the Thunder came from inside of the throne not old inside of the throne thundered out and the lamb was standing than a watch watch this position change because there's got to be a position change from the church ages to what we're doing now thanks for being silent or asleep would you want the thunder where the lamb had left left the Father's throne to go take his own throne glory now now don't miss it friends we all know as Christians that God swore to David that he will raise up Christ a settlement strong give it an everlasting Kingdom here on the earth he did it jesus said he that overcome the Antichrist and all the things of the world sit with Mina he says ohm but it's in my throne as I have over come and sit down on my father stone see now some day he rises from the Father's throne and takes his own throne now there's a position change same person but it's a position change he goes to take his own throne now he comes forth to call his subjects now look he's called look at me he's called his subjects all down through him but he's called them into another dimension death has taken over here and he just preserved them and pushed them over into another dimension six dimension right were there eternal but they're not complete remember they told brother Branham we don't need over here we're not complete we got to come back I mean they were explaining to him what they had to do right how is he going to know what notice some day he rises from the Father's throne he goes to take his own throne now he comes forth to call his subjects how's he going to claim them he's already got the book of redemption in his hand what are the seals the seals is a complete book of redemption right all right hey man so that was a position change to watch now we're going to go to the third seal number three steel we're on now brother Brad was reviewing but watch what he says and then we went back and got the kinsman redeemer and picked him up to see what his work was and now for all these years Christ has been doing that kinsman redeemer work that's the Holy Ghost in your soul he's been doing the kinsmen wrought work right now all that understands say Amen he has been doing the work of the kinsman redeemer but there will come a time that when the redeeming work will be over and when the redeeming work is over then he leaves the throne of God where he seated now but that's not his throne our Dominion because I know what you're doing in your mind you see a throne a physical place for somebody to sit don't think that don't think that but that's not his throne he that overcometh she'll sit with me in they get you right here in my throne as I have over come and sit down on my Father's throne that is not his throne that belongs there watch I want you to watch the way he said this that is not his throne that belongs to spirit , guard enough stop that's the Father's throne alright the Father's throne it's what the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen because I'm gonna read it on the next one on the mighty God in Vail before us he's gonna explain what he's talking about that belongs to spirit guard stop Christ the lamb it doesn't belong to him that's Louisiana watch he is the Incarnate God which is the same God made incarnate now he's talking about another throne go that's the front that's the son of man when you put God incarnate that's the son of man and then the lamb when you say the lamb you're talking about son of man cuz that's guarding human flesh and then it doesn't belong to him what this throne up here it belongs to the father he is the Incarnate God which is the same God made incarnate now goes the next quote I should have probably put it first mighty gon unveiled before us then we find after his death burial resurrection he comes under day of Pentecost as son of God so now during the church ages by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he comes and dwells in your soul as the son of God's Spirit God to give you the new birth but he's not finished that just gets him started God the Spirit in the form Holy Ghost what was he doing he was changing himself making himself known to his people in a different form like the Holy Spirit which is God he came to deal through the church ages as son of God the Holy Spirit all right but now remember just in that form people die go by the grave hey man it's just a cycle because we got to get this flesh redeemed we got to get it to where this flesh becomes redeemed because Jesus's flesh was redeemed brother Dale talk about this morning amen all right let's go to number 5 just for a second I think this is the last quote this days of scripture fulfilled 1965 all right everybody awake five more minutes like that see he came in three names now I want you to watch what he says we've been through this before brother Dale's preach taunting many many times he come in three sons names but remember there's really four it's really four but it's the son of man twice got it cuz watch the position is why I'm telling you there's got to be a position change when we come out of this third seal when that third seal open to me it showed a position change it showed a change that well now what we're going to do is the words gonna be manifested like it's never been before but look he came in three names he came as the Son of Man which was prophet that's what he did he proved his ministry by being a prophet we all know that every one of us knows it he never said he was the son of God remember he never they said they'll be the son of God he says son of man son of man son a minute son of man why because he was God manifested in human flesh that's what son of man is all right he never said he was the son of God he said he was the son of man now today he is the son of God so he went from Son of man to Son of God nobody got that say man he went from son of man to son of God now today he is the son of God so now when he said today he meant still in this church age Amen which he returned back and now he's in the form of the Holy Ghost the unseen person but yet God the Son of God all right so we went from son of man to son of God now we're fixing to go to son of David but watch him he backs up in a minute and gives you one little key that you gotta have he revealed himself first son of man prophet this age through the church age son of man or son of God he corrects himself I'm sorry in the Millennium he sits upon his Father's throne which would be the son of David remember he promised David he'd have a throne everlasting throne he'll he'll judge the twelve tribes of Israel during the Millennium my man he revealed himself first a son of man a prophet this age through the church age son of man or son of God and in the other age son of David three sons but watch but you notice here he said at the ending of the church age it had got in such a mess well he would be revealed again a man as son of man when the son of man is being revealed how appropriate was that mix-up yesterday now he's preaching on this day the scripture fulfilled remember with a priest giving the Bible and you read the scripture about the mix-up yesterday and I hope you don't miss it we have had the revelation of son of God but the last promise that Abraham had before the son was made or brought into existence the one he had promised before the promised son showed up God manifested himself there at Sodom as a prophet being a man in flesh God Elohim so the position had to come back to the Son of man because the son of man needs to be here for the body change saying God don't need a body change it's the same person but you got to look at the position that we're in it wasn't required here but once this seal opens and we see that we're in a position now because I'm telling you when we get done and get out of here it's all done for the Gentiles we're done when we take a rapture when that says right we're done we're finished we've went through a resurrection we went wait a minute we've went through a third Pole we've been through adoption we went through manifested sons of God which is adoption we went through the call of the dead out of the ground we went through the we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord ain't nothing left for us we're heading toward that now when that fourth seal breaks we leave we leave that neck sealed when we see that seal it leaves so look listen to this this was a me quote when he comes to son of man he was a king with no subjects right I just told you there was nobody in his kingdom except him he told pilots the truth he said if I had subjects dead fire that even the disciples weren't his subjects not at that moment but when he come back on the day of Pentecost he was a king with subjects hey man now he comes back to the Son of man he's now king in flesh your flesh my flesh and then he'll go to the son of David he'll be to the Jews I came to them in the Millennium but you and I are gonna have to be dead you and I are gonna have to be totally dead xed out nothing left of us let's Stan exit out that third seal when you really see that third seal man you've come to a place to where a position has changed because brother Branham wasn't the son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of man we'll get into that next we'll get into that next in a couple of weeks because when we come to that seal number four it brings all this together all the revelations are finished like that third pull all the great revelations that we're looking for when that fourth seal breaks and we see these things happening it will be finished the Gentile age will be no more and God will return to the Jews they won't be one let's all stand and come to y'all come to the musicians come there'll be nothing left for the Gentiles folks but judgment you know why because the kingdom of God is left the kingdom of gods go the kingdom that he had down here that he established on the earth he came to establish it will be in another position or in another dimension and then they can wipe this place off all they want to but you know why they're wiping it off they're wiping it off so God can come back on the earth well you know what let God's like brother Brennan said let God's atomic-bomb faith blow us up I want to be done away with I want to be eradicated I want to be totally dead that's their problem like Dwight Moody said garden will only fill those who are not full of themself so we want to be totally empty we see this seal come to a to a close and get ready to open the fourth seal that third seal it's very important cuz that position of the new birds if you don't have the new birth then you we don't even we're not even talking but you
