we've been in the church ages and we're going to continue on with that so let's bow our heads de heavenly father thank you for this day you give us father we pray that you would just be with us today in the service of speaking father you do the speaking Lord and let us do the listening father just move your servant out of the way Lord and you speak to the people because you know what they need

our sins bless this day keep us safe thank you for bringing the visitors here Lord may they have uh a time with you Lord that they've never had before father we pray in Jesus name amen now we believe that we believe that God is in his Bible amen God is in his word everybody with me all right and we know that God being in his word he gave it to a group of people cuz he said he wouldn't return void so he gave us a Bible he gave us something a standard to go by man's tried to go by other stuff but we have a standard to go by and it's called the Bible all right everybody with me all right so being that then we're going to start we've been starting talking about the church ages in the Book of Revelations and we've been several sermons on it so now we're at the church of Sardis are the sardian church age I want to read you this found this this morning watch happiness cannot be travel to Owned earned worn or consumed happiness is the spiritual experience of living every minute with love Grace and gratitude amen think about that happiness can't be traveled to you can't buy it can't wear it but with love Grace and gratitude you'll have happiness happy people build their own world unhappy people blame other people in the world wow that's profound but let's read Revelations 1:10 then you can be seated I know some of you older ones are want to sit down actually the one in the suit in the back Revelations 1:10 says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day now this is John the Revelator and I heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest right in a book and send it unto the seven different churches which are in Asia Ephesus samna pergamus thyra Sardis Philadelphia and Lea now we know for a fact if you read and we're going to get to the lean Church age sometime before the r takes place maybe not I hope not but um we're going to talk about that age that you're sitting in right now cold formal you're neither hot or cold God's going to spew you out of his mouth he stand at the door and knock and I turned to see the voice that spake to me now John turned to see the voice now he heard it as a voice of a trumpet he turned around and he saw somebody he saw a symbol and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle you may be SE in the Lord as his Blessing I'll read the rest of it here in just a minute but look at the symbolism to this he was gir about the paps which is feminist which is here in other words John is seeing Christ in Bride form because we will not see him until he comes back we meet him in the air and we go into what we go to the wedding supper and then we come back here and live on the earth for a thousand years and that's when we'll see him physically but his body can't be on the earth physically with his bride being here because that would be two bodies he said we're the bride we're the body we're the church we're the one we're the chosen we're the ones that supposed to what portray him so there he is he's telling us he's showing us that there's a person standing there but he's in a form called a bride and we just really believe that we believe that that everybody's not bride I only have one wife God's only got one wife that's right he don't have several he has one he has one wife and we believe that it is his bride down Through the Ages from Paul to today still building that body that body we know that some of them has already gone on and they've done their they've run their race they've lived their life they've done what they're going to do and it was told what they were going to do in the Bible that's right by these seven Church ages because remember there was seven stars in the hand of God so remember that was seven unique people that God used because those were Messengers all right there was one Messenger to every Church age not several God is not the author of confusion he is not the author of anything but Purity and he is precise in what he does cuz he's did we ever not discuss that God don't make a mistake we ever oh that's okay all right right group then he doesn't he doesn't make a mistake at all we must we and if you don't put your faith in that you've lost you're lost cuz we're not going to understand a lot of things that God does that's right but he's perfect but he's Eternal but if you're his child I'm not going to start preaching I'm going to teach Revelation 3 verse1 said to the angel of the church in Sardis now there's an angel a messenger not an angel with wings we don't believe that there's nothing nothing no such thing as angels with wings all right but there are angels but this Angel is a specific Angel this is one that god holds in his hands according to Revelations 1 and he gives that person a message all right and we see that this Angel the church in sest these things sayith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I Know Thy works that thou Hast a name that thou livest and art Dead all right you got a name that you live by right but you're dead all right we'll we'll look at that in just a minute Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God all right remember therefore how thou Hast received and hurt and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments or a group of people they took the word of God for day and lived it yes all right lived it all right and they shall walk with men white for they are worthy he that overcometh he shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels he that hath an ear what let him hear what the spirit says not what man says not what the letter in the book says not what you see on TV or come on right you hear what the spirit says to the churches and then we we took this diagram and we see that that it was broke down thank God he sent us a prophet in the end time to tell us these things and to to take all the confusion out I mean I you know we we've been confused and God's not the author of confusion and and Terry's here today and he knows that the methodists they sprinkle the Baptist they baptized well I'll promise you one thing John Westley didn't sprinkle the founder did not sprinkle he baptized so what happened there's a confusion somewhere between that and today all right thereby with me they did not teach a baptism in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost until the Catholic Church did it right we proved that the other day we believe that right it was in the name of the Lord Jesus find me one place in the Bible you got a Bible in front of you find me one place where any person was ever baptized other than the name of the Lord Jesus or Jesus Christ in the Bible amen not one person that's right so what was Paul confused or was Peter confused no they had Clarity Father Son and Holy Ghost is not names amen I'm a father today I'm a son and I'm a spirit but what am I I'm Samuel wayale II I have a name and now you identifi that name with me so the same way with the Lord Jesus he said baptized in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost Peter comes on the day of Pentecost he's got the keys yes sir he's got the keys Jesus said you've got the keys whatever you open I'll open in heaven whatever you bind I'll bind it in heaven Peter had the keys now Peter goes over there and unlocks the door and I was thinking the other day brother colie you know there was there was the other of course Judas had already hung himself by the time they got to Pentecost to the upper room but then you got the other 11 you got 11 Peter plus 10 and they didn't argue with Peter they got that same Revelation they didn't argue with Peter I never seen that till the other day thank God they didn't say now Peter hold on hold on Peter now I heard Jesus say they knew exactly what Jesus said he said in the name the Bible says the whole family in Heaven and Earth got a what a name Jesus Christ and we're mes Jesus Christ that's why we're not a denomination we don't believe in them I'm sorry but they're just they're dead they're formal cold so are we sometimes come on so I'm not preaching to these walls I'm preaching to everybody right but there was Paul was the first church age messenger we established that irenius was the second Martin was the third Columba was the fourth Church age messenger and Martin Luther the one we're talking about now the Lutheran are the are the um um Luther Luther come in and then Wesley which is the wesleyian doctrine or are the Methodist Doctrine and we'll get into that next Sunday how that that Methodist came about is because John Wesley established a method of worship all right he had he had a method of worshiping but now here we come and we see that according to history there in that middle Church age with where it says Columba we know that the Catholic Church according to Nia we read the book you read up some of you read it too the Nan Council they went to that council with a man that was supposed to be the great guy named Constantine and he was going to bring church and state together and he did and he gave them power and gave them power so much till they killed 68 million Christians the Roman Catholic Church they will tell you they killed that many read Fox's book of martyr they killed 68 million Christians because they would not convert to Catholicism all right everybody with me on that so now what did Martin Luther do now Martin Luther was a Catholic he was a he was a monk he went into the monastery he studied the the Church of Rome he he went with some of their things all right I say things they doctrines they went he went with some of that but then God got a hold of him one day and showed him that the just shall live by faith not by Penance not by dragging yourself down the street not by not by beating your head up against a wall but the just shall live by faith all right is everybody with me on that all right and that's this is total history okay so let's get started now we know one thing for sure when we look in the Bible when it says woman we know that means Church all right so now what is a female supposed to do according to Paul setting up the headship she's to be subjective to her husband not a doormat but subjected to her husband because our head is Christ all right Christ is the head we're the body but we The Head and the woman the female is the weaker vessel or we're going to talk about a little bit about this though that when they change roles they become a dominating female and we see that because what happens in in the Catholic Church they have as we looked before they um they elevate Mary and put Jesus down read it it's called mariology pray to Mary because she's really nice and sweet don't pray to Jesus he he's he's mean that's garbage Mary didn't resurrect Mary didn't Ascend Mary had to go to Pentecost to get the Holy Ghost all right so we're not going to talk about that foolishness but the female somehow became dominant like Eve did in the garden she took Satan's lie over her husband's truth everybody with me so that created something to that it's a pattern that there when you become a dominating female then God departs from you all right now look the Bible says in first Timothy says but she she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth oh I we listen this is life man we get to go do whatever we can drink smoke cuss we can do whatever we want to do that's the life that's death she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth she that liveth out inside the word of God is dead spiritually dead you may be as alive as I'm standing here today but spiritually As Dead As a door knob cuz God will not dwell in an unclean vessel God will not take the garbage of the world he wants us to what he wants us to conform to His Image not not him conform to ours that's what everybody wants in this end time they want everybody to conform to their image whatever they you know pride month and all these different they want you to conform to their image no Jesus said conform to my image cuz somebody told me one time that God was perfect okay all right just want to make sure I still live everybody and he doesn't make mistakes right he didn't have to change his Bible the Mormons had to change their several hundred times but God will never have to change his Bible it was perfect when he started it he wrote it before the foundation of the world everybody with me yes sir okay cuz the Bible said he stood as a lamb slain before yes sir the foundation of the world so now let's look and see I know this may be strange to some but we believe that God opened the Seven Seals in the end time so that we can see what was behind them when you see something sealed up that means that you can't see what's inside but there must be something inside that's important or you wouldn't seal it up listen if if there wasn't like your gun cabinet you don't put your gun cabinet in the living room with no doors on it you seal it so that no one can get what's in behind there all right so God sealed this up till the end time because he said he said many times he said I'll restore I'm going to do this I'm going to give you Revelation I'm going to show you mystery Paul said there's a mystery which is Christ in you the hope of glory and we see that now manifesting itself to a bride of Jesus Christ so the opening of the first two seals when that seal opened there was a Ministry loose now many people I say many people many denominations do not see this because the Seal's not been open to them I I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals so now he's fixing to open something I'm going try to slow down just a minute this is not going to be a 15-minute method of sermon I'm promise you that y'all are used to yeah M and I heard if you need to take a break go take a break as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four beasts now who what's he talking about this is John John joh was commissioned to write what he saw he saw the lamb so he saw Jesus Christ standing in a position and he was going to tear the seal off that's what the Bible says and he heard the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast so something else come into view to John yes now we see this it correlates back to the Book of Ezekiel where you see the four living creatures in several other places in the Bible one had the face of a lion one had the face of an ox one had the face of a man one had the face of a flying eagle and those were the four powers are beast that are in you and me today by the Holy Ghost it helps us overcome the line of the tribe of Judah the ox that the labor that that does the work you know go to work and do your job and and labor in the Lord and wonder why we're still here and then the man intelligence not intelligence of man intelligence of God to know what's right and wrong to know if a man says something you go that ain't nothing but the truth or I don't believe that amen and then the Flying Eagle is up so high till till man can't get there other birds can't get there so we had a lion an ox a man and an eagle according to Ezekiel in the end time because the son of man is supposed to be here Jesus Christ is supposed to be here in our flesh today is everybody with me amen don't lock up you can say amen I know y'all believe that okay so one of the four Beast says come and see John come here I want to show you something what was it it was the Holy Ghost in John but what did John do John was only commissioned to write what he saw right all right and I saw and behold a white horse looks kind of pretty doesn't it and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering him to conquer everybody with me yes all right so this looks really good but if you dig in a little bit further you see that he has a bow but no arrows right how many of you would go hunting without your bullets let's go all go bear hunting let's go grizzly bear hunting brother Tim and and we're not going to take any bullets we're just going to take a gun or we're going to take a bow but we're not going to take any Arrows with us no so this man right here must be crazy he must be anti come on he must be a bluff yes sir cuz he's Bluff ing the people so it's not almighty God he doesn't Bluff he tells you straight and that's what it's going to be amen so whoever this person is a white horse and he that sat on him had a boat which had to be the devil because the devil's the biggest deceiver there ever was he knows how to deceive don't try to deceive him cuz he's already got you deceived right and a crown was given unto him so he was given a crown and he went forth conquering into conquer so in the first three Church ages he bluffed his way into the true now there was a true white righteous church we realize that from Paul Paul wrote 80% of the Bible that's why I have a problem with people I have a problem with people saying well you believe this you you've got you believe this man William Brandon was a prophet yeah I do he's he's identifying the Bible but if we quote Paul it's okay but if we quote him it's not okay if we quote Billy Graham it's okay but we quot will Bram is not okay no sorry I'm quoting Paul right now I'm quoting what John saw right now amen but the he bluffed his way into the true church there was a true church in the in the beginning and what happened was Satan got in with just a little saying like do you really believe that that um you know God God God couldn't be God and Jesus couldn't be the same person we saw Jesus he cried he had to go to bathroom and he hungered and and uh he he got angry that can't be God oh that's a light substance of God so they pulled him apart they said well the Holy Ghost has got to be a third person so here we are with a trinity not even in the Bible anywhere listen it's so easy to realize behold oh Israel your God is one and he has many manifestations of father son Holy Ghost healer savior revealer he's all those he's my husband he's my he's my God but he's only one person you're not going to heaven and see three people come on are three personalities that's schizophrenia my God's Not schizophrenic my God's one now he does in morphe into different forms right now I'm looking at his last name morphe it's in his bride you're not going to see Jesus Christ anywhere except in his bride those that have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul does what the Bible tells them to do amen yes sir with no compromise but that was a saying went out in the first couple of church ages that white horse rider he rode you know Satan didn't Satan today is not in the barroom he got here before you did and he's sitting right beside you are with you so Satan's religious very he's a second to God he's a worship Angel he doesn't look he ain't red with a with a forky tail now he may have a forky tongue but he's the most beautiful angel that God made he made Satan beautiful so you look at this we're going to see in a minute that John saw this sorry we speak plain here because that's what the Bible says we saw he saw this he admired her so much the angel had to say John um get away from that yeah right yeah cuz it was so beautiful look at churches they're beautiful all the colors and tapestries and gold and silver and all this stuff the Catholic church just throws all that out there and makes you you know kind like Hollywood give me an oldfashioned preacher that knows the word of God I don't care if you preaches here or on the corner somewhere so that white righteous church was infiltrated by a white righteous impostor he wanted to look just like it remember he said in the Bible I want to be like the most I want to be God yes I want to be the one and and then God tells us in the church agent he says you ought to know where Satan's seed is the Satan's seed is not in the barroom Satan seed's in church and he wants to infiltrate here he's got them out there he wants to infiltrate us yes as Believers come on come on but praise God if you're sealed by the holy ghost in your soul he can't touch you he can play with your body all he wants to remember he did with job right but remember through that tragedy became a man that we see and talk about Job even from 5,000 6,000 years ago we still talk about job that went through a tragedy and made it through and come out on the other side twice as good as he was before all right so we think our problems are like that you didn't lose all seven kids and all your house and all your whole living and everything and have boils from the head of your feet from your head to your feet joob did but you know what he said he said I know my redeemer liveth yes sir and in the last day I'll stand on my feet and I'll see him for myself what a revelation so when he had opened the second seal so now we see the lamb he's opening another seal up I heard the second beast so another Beast comes which is the ox which is the the labor or the one that does the works says come and see and there went out another horse so there was a white horse rode out with a man on it then there's now is a red horse and pile was given to him that sat on that horse to take peace from the earth yeah and that they should kill one another and there was given unto him a great sword now the the first time he he saw that it was a bow with no arrows he was a bluff he couldn't do anything it's like Brother Gary Atkins always said he said he said Satan has no Arrow to shoot at you but you give him a whole bunch to shoot at you every day we give them to it yes sir everybody all right the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you how powerful is that didn't seem like much but it's pretty powerful and power was given to him that sat on to take peace from the earth and that they should kill one another he's going to be so much into these people well they going to hate each other now right and there was given unto him a great sword now we know what a sword means in the Bible it means a word yes so he was given a word he was given something that he wanted the people to live by and he made it so outstanding like Constantine we we read about him in the in the U in the history books and he's this great man worst thing ever happened he joined church and state together took down a pilus and put up Paul took down this and put up that they started worshiping Mary we saw through these Church ages remember every Church age every city that we mentioned there was a there was worship of a woman worship of a woman is what did away with their power and then here then here the Catholic Church brings Mary up and elevates her to a god well they'll get theirs and there was given to him a great store so now he's got a word he's got a word to say now so he's going to what he's going to start killing with that word let's read here just a second where the Prophet tells us the second calf was what it was a calf like Beast the first was a Lon the next was an ox all right when the lamb opened the seal so let's continue on so a red horse goes forward now what is red red is blood he rode that horse in the ox age which is that middle Church age which is the age of they call it the Dark Ages or the age that where that there was Roman rule over everything and they would kill you they killed Christians they put crosses on their back they said they were on a crusade the only Crusade they were doing was was killing true Christians because they wasn't conformed to the Catholic church and let me tell you something they're killing billions of people now spiritually by the same identical thing Satan is just hid now he's got out of that killing over there in the red now he's over here and he's going let's all be one let's all come together oh let's all be one divide and conquer they'll get theirs they're going to kill each other now he had a bow with no arrows but he has a great sword now he done his killing later and changed from White Horse to Red the same Devil with a sword now and red is what like I said red is blood now he's got a sword in his hand riding red waiting through the blood of every 68 million you take the what was it Josh C State of California the state of Texas two of the biggest states in the United States there 68 million people lives in those two states you wipe those two states completely out that's how many people the Catholic Church killed during that 900 years of persecution that's how many they killed you think the Jews killed 6 million or the the Germans killed 6 million Jews in in four years 900 years 68 million people were killed because the Catholic Church says you either do this or you die they'll get theirs John saw her over there a little bit further riding on a Scarlet colored Beast with a cup full of the blood of the Mars of the Saints she'll be she'll be giving her reward the riter and all his Kingdom subjects that are slain down Through the Ages that's draw all this Blood of the martyrs of the Saints will be slain By The Sword of Jesus Christ when he comes and praise God we can draw a sword now and we can get those people out of that delusion we've got several people sitting here that were in the Catholic Church they know what's going on and they saw a light and got out amen but now remember she had daughters she had prostitutes she had daughters that took her same name the only difference in the Catholic church and all the other denominations is is they say that it's what that transubstantiation that when they give the when they give the communion it turns into the literal body of Jesus you know they get people to believe that that the priest by some power he's got can take that wafer look it up Google it he takes that wafer and when he puts it on your tongue that turns into the literal body body of Jesus and they believe that there a lot of things they believe but that's one I don't think I'd ever believe uh Sister Jesse I don't know if God could you know God can get you out of that but Satan what a delusion what a delusion and to say that the pope has more power than Jesus Christ to be able to change whatever he wants to change start a war and end of War but remember he's got daughters he's got people in his system that are working in the same way yes all right so let's skip through here a little bit more let's look at the sardian church age just for a second he said I Know Thy works I know your Works amen that thou has a name what that thou livest and art dead they took on names for I've not found thy works perfect before God but there are a few people that made it through that church age there are a few people even though the 68 million that were killed in that other Church age that came into this sardian church age there was a few people left that held on to the true word of God they held on to what God has said not what man has said all right and you're going to overcome look you'll be clothed in white rment praise God and I will not blot his name out of the book of life you know there was a name that was blotted out of the book of life you know that don't you man's name was Judas Bible said his name was BL it out but yours can if you're in the Eternal section of the Book of Life yours never will cuz actually you're the book remember the old saying I can read you like a Bible says written Epistles known and read of all men your life is a book that's why when we live out there we live different we're not like the world we don't mingle with the world we have to go to Walmart okay so we don't have to but we go but um but we don't mingle with them listen God is a separator abolutely he said separate yourself from unbelief and I'm going to read your scripture here in just a minute where he says come out of her her a church come out of her my people my people yes sir I'll read it to you in just a minute so the word Sardis means the Escape ones there were some that escaped out of that Jezebel religion that came up in the Catholic church that you worshiped woman all right you're worshiping a woman it's called a doctrine of mariolatry and what it is is that they elevate her and you worship her and you don't worship Jesus cuz she's nicer than he is if you don't believe it ask somebody you ask the Catholic who do you pray to they'll say we pray to Mary wow but now watch Martin Luther praise God stood up and said I'm not going to deal with that no more amen God filled him with the Holy Ghost in that Monastery by telling well actually what happened was it it let me give you a real short summation of Luther Luther was a Catholic Luther was in this monastery Luther was doing Penance Luther was dragging himself across the the um um Cobblestone and and and you know whacking himself with those little things that they have and he wasn't getting anywhere he still was oh man that I am but one day he was take he took the Bible he learned Latin he was a German he learned Latin so the Latin Vulgate is where the Catholic church has the Bible written during the Dark Ages it's written in Latin so you can't understand it what about going to church and listening to somebody preach and don't even know the word they said that's what they do they may change now but that's what they do that's what they have been doing because we've got the truth and you just listen no I want you to have the truth yourself please do not build yourself on a man you better build yourself on one man Jesus Christ you better not build yourself on your neighbor or your friend or your mama your daddy you got to have your own experience with God and that experience will take you to the word of God every single time have I ever preached to y'all that God's perfect oh don't make mistakes come on okay he does not that's right we must conform to His Image this is his image the only image we got is this have anybody ever seen Jesus no he's in here you've never seen him in person you might have seen him in a vision you might have seen him in a picture but You' never seen the physical man cuz he said I'm going to go away he said but I'm going to come back what he do he IMM morphed into the Holy Ghost and give itself out and divided itself among the people Jesus standing on Earth he was one man if the devil would have left him alone he'd have died a man just an old guy but Satan had to kill him to get you and me out of there oh when that side opened up you and I rushed out the Holy Ghost came out and came on 120 on the day of Pentecost we still believe in the Pentecostal experience amen and on the day of Pentecost he divided himself into 120 people so Satan didn't have to fight just one Jesus he fought 121 jesuses then on the day that same day that was 3,000 little jesuses that were birth listen we're M Jesus Christ we're him yes made manifest in another form called a bride he's imorph into the bride that's why we act different that's why we talk different that's why we dress different that's right amen we don't dress different cuz somebody told us the Bible tells us that's why I told that sister the other day I said look if you tell me in the Bible show me the Bible where you can cut your hair I can show you where Paul said that your hair was your glory and and the translation the original translation is uncut hair we know that and we know that the hair is our glory and we do those things because of what like June said many times she said if if if Jesus Christ could hang on the cross for three hours and die literally die God died in the flesh God can't die but God died in that flesh that flesh was dead if he can hang there for three hours for me I can do what he said by not cut in my hair I can do what he said by wearing clothes that don't wear pertain clothes pertaining to a man you so that's Old Testament so is so so is The Ten Commandments amen I've had that and throw it at me too well that's the Old Testament well so is the 10 commandments so don't take them off your wall listen either throw it all out or live it all one of the two amen as Luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith nothing you done not by works lest any man should boast nothing you and I are saved by the grace of God the faith that we put in him that he's already done it for us he's already died that's the only way you can be justified Bible says justify freely it's a free gift it's free for you to have it's not something you have to pay you don't have to pay penants and if you come to church because you have to you're paying pennant cuz you think I got to go because somebody will say no I want to come here sir I want to do this on Sunday that was a time I didn't that was a time you didn't there a time we ran on Sunday I told you many times my Mama Tried to save me but where'd that piece of paper go oh my Mama Tried to save me but she can't right Jesus Christ is the only salvation there is no other man no other name see there there's the name there's no other name whereby you must be saved and that's Jesus Christ but it's not just Jesus Christ now that hung on the cross died went into a tomb came out praise the Lord hallelujah he's alive today yes sir in a group of Believers cuz he said I'll be with you and in you I'm going to come back I pray father that they be one as we're one how was Jesus and God one they weren't two they were one yes Jesus was an amorphia of God yes to save your soul cuz God can't die Jesus had to Jesus had to die that body had to die to release the life inside of it to release me and you watch the song when he was on the cross what I was on his mind I was his very heart the Bible says we're engraved in the palms of his hand well praise God when that nail went through that finger when that went through that hand it went through my name I don't know about you went through mine you got to you got to say it went through yours but there's more to it than just that it Jesus said what he said I'll be in you with you in even in you and he said in one place he said and I'll show you things to come I'll give you more Revelation than anybody's everever got Paul said there's Mysteries there's great mysteries in this Bible that people have not even tapped into too but you and I have when no seals open we saw that Satan was a master deceiver we saw where he was he was in the church he wasn't in the barroom and there's only two Spirits God and Satan there's no other there's no other uh there's just two belief or doubt so now listen Luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held the works penants prayers other unscriptural means and as the freed Christians glorified the son that's us the Roman Catholics increased their deification of Mary until the 20th century saw in opposition to most ranking Roman theologies Pope Pi literally exalted Mary to glorification in a resurrected body you know they believe Mary resurrected just like Jesus that Doctrine is absolutely babylonius one of the son carrying the mother bodily into heaven which was Pagan if we look at all these Pagan ideas we know that the Catholic church and the Pagan ideas are just exactly the same and they swallow that but you know what they do they make it so beautiful this may not be beautiful to some people this may be just plain couple of songs and worship get a little loud every once in a while but this is what God wants this is what God wants he do want that he he didn't want that he wants this the Martin Luther was German he was a priest Theologian he wrote hymns he was a frier but what he done though was he started the Protestant movement or the Protestant Reformation all right or what does that mean Protestant means protest he literally stood against a worldwide at that time religion called Catholicism he was part of the system but he came out and he's one of the most influential figures in Western and Christian history this is a letter he wrote to the Pope the first and chief article is this now this is this is the pope he's God to them right everybody with me so you don't question him you don't question the Pope the first and chief article is this Jesus Christ Our God and Lord died for our sins and was raised again for our justification Romans 3 he alone is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world John 1 and God has laid on him the iniquity of us all in Isaiah all have sinned and are Justified freely without their own works and merits about this time Pope P's face is turning so red cuz this guy is going against everything that he upholds and when without the without the the the hand of God they would have killed Martin Luther cuz they were they sent out to kill him right after he sent this letter out but they couldn't find him he actually went to a castle and lived in a castle deep in a big old castle somewhere over there in Germany he lived over there in a castle for several years and and actually put the Bible together during that time they couldn't find him they had assassins out want to kill Martin well he went he went against their God right this is necess now look all have sinned and are Justified freely without their own merits and works by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus in his blood this is necessary to believe well he's fixing to get it now this cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work law or Merit or beads or whatever you know buying a candle and all that other stuff they do therefore it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us well he's coming against the pope now nothing of this Artic article can be yielded or surrendered you see what kind of stand he took can we take that same stand even though Heaven and Earth and everything else Falls then he wrote a letter to his followers in these sermons he hammered home the primary the pracy of core Christian Valu such as love patience charity freedom and reminded the citizens to trust God's word rather than violence to bring about NE necessary change let's go to Romans 1:1 17 and we'll finish right here we'll finish the rest this afternoon Romans 1 ver1 17 for therein is the righteousness of God now this listen the people put yourself back in that like third or fourth Church age where there was no print and press there was no all you had was verbiage if somebody preached something you you heard what they said and if somebody else wasn't there they had to tell them what he said there was no recorders there not like we're recording going around the country right now recording we're recording and we're live streaming both all right wasn't like that but when Martin Luther takes that Latin vgate and he starts translating what you see now as the Bible into German first so he could read it and then later on tendale did it for the English people and you know what they did the tendale they drug him through the street and killed him cuz he put the Bible together that was a Catholic they didn't want you to have this cuz you'd know truth if you had this Jesus said the truth will set you free so I can I can see just for a moment before we close here's Martin Luther he's dragging himself along and if you watch the movie you see me I mean just he just beats himself up every bad thought he has every everything you know he just can't get he he just condemned God hates me I do all this bad and and and you know even Paul had that problem Paul said the things I do I would not the things I do I would not oh this Wretched Man that I am all right we've had our conversation in times past and this guy right here amen is everybody with me but God wants to look at your soul he doesn't he doesn't save your body he said I come to save your soul amen but your soul is going to tell your body what to do if you say I'm a Christian and I do what God says then your body's going to show it if you happy and you know clap your hand Happ you hand you know I can sing too know it clap your hand so I can see Martin Luther one day sitting in the in the monastery and he's he's pulling out the old Latin Vulgate and he's translating it he comes to Romans 1 he starts writing it down in his German language he said for there is is the righteousness of God revealed from Faith to Faith at is WR as it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men now watch who hold the truth in unrighteousness the Catholic church had some truth when they began but they're withholding it from the people people and Jesus right here of course this is God he's talking through Paul telling us that if you hold the truth and unrighteousness no you live by the faith of God watch Galatians now I can see old Martin Luther he said man that sounds good something Sparks in his heart he kepts writing he keeps writing he goes to the book of Galatians and he start he's writing that wasn't printting presses back then it wasn't computers he had to write them with his hand all right Galatians 3:1 he comes with that verse and he says but that no man is justified by the law Penance no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith and I'm sure he probably said amen he probably said I've been looking for that then he goes to the book of Hebrews and he's writing and putting Hebrews together and he says Paul's writing says now the just shall live by faith but watch but if any man draw back in other words and if you listen to this and you don't do it you withdraw yourself from what I'm saying today not me God if you withdraw from that my soul shall have no pleasure in you Martin Luther if you withdraw yourself because after this you know what he did but we are not of them who draw back under PR but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul he stood and wrote 95 thesis he put it on the wall of the Catholic church and he said there I stand the just shall live by faith not by Penance not by what the pope said not by what you wrote down in your book but what God Said through Paul and the different ones the just shall live by the faith of God Luther was a reformer he to and brought the Reformation in musicians come on we'll stop right there I'll finish the rest of it this afternoon but now watch let me read this real quick Revelation 17 verse5 now remember a her is a female and a church all right is everybody with me we we all know that and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the Great the mother of Harlot so it must be a mama and some kids and Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman Church drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus what it come through that Dark Age and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration John got caught up in what it was go what was going on it looked so pretty and the angel said unto me wherefore John hey slapped him beside the head said John that thing's death right what you saw I'll explain it to a group later praise God and the angel said unto me wherefore Dost thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman or the mystery of this church and of the Beast that carrieth her because you what is a beast in the Bible a beast is a power it's something that carries you somewhere all right that's why we have four combat Beast that combat the Beast of the devil we have combat Beast The Lion oxman and the eagle that comes together and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that helped you overcome in your daily life and overcome as a Christian the Beast that thou sawest was and is not what one Pope comes one dies another Pope pops up one dies another Pope pops up one dies another one pops up oh the Beast that thou sawest was and is not and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall Wonder his names are not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world World when they behold the Beast that was and is not and yet is Constantine looked and he saw a church that was floundering didn't have any money they didn't have any they didn't have any um hardly a place to worship he looks over here and he's got this big church I mean he's got this big building he's got he he owns the you know he owns a lot of the things over here and he he takes the state and the church and puts them together and he instills into him not the religion of the old Paul irenius Martin he brings their own ideas and he marries them together just like Jezebel and Ahab were married Ahab was a Jew he should have never married Jezebel but when he did you saw what happened the dog licked her blood and he died too so let's stop right here let's stand our feet Revelations 181 and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mightily with a strong voice saying Babylon the great is Fallen has fallen become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul Spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird for all nations have drunk of the wine of Wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies must be pretty powerful powerful thing you know the pope could have stopped read your history the pope could have stopped the killing of the Jews during World War II but he wouldn't do it he wouldn't do it popes can stop start a war and a stop a war Popes are really powerful but they're going to find out one day it's all superficial there's only power in the name of Jesus not in the church and I look now watch I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues for his sins have reached into heaven and God hath remembered her iniquities reward her even as she rewarded you and double unto her double according to her works and the cup which she hath filled fill to her double how much she hath glorified herself and live deliciously so much torment and sorrow give her for she saith in her heart I sit a queen and have no Widow and shall see no sorrow therefore shall her plagues come in one day death mourning famine everybody still believe the Bible's right God Don't Make Mistakes right he's going to judge her don't worry but remember he's judging us right now that's right hello he's judging us right now we don't have to go to White Throne judgment we know that why would you send your bride to a white Throne judgment we're white here you get eternal life there you're sitting here with it today or standing here with it today if you believe that believe what the Bible says Jesus said first first thing he said he said what you must be born again that's his first Doctrine his first right out of the gate you got to be born again and and Nicodemus said I got to go back get in my mama's wom he said no you got to be born from above because the one you got down here is not worthy that's right and you're going to die from it because of what happened in the garden P said if you're born from above you'll never die though the skin worms destroy this body job said in my flesh I shall see God God bless you let's
