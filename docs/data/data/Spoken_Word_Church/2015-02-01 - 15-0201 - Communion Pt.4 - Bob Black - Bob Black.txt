========================================

this is here for a reason yes I think I accidentally put that there all right so um so I've got another picture up here symbolize the communion because that's the topic this is the fourth and and maybe today we'll kind of have a different idea of or communion will mean a lot more to us when we take it this afternoon because you know comedian is not just the Lord's suppress it's being able to commune with God and think his thoughts and being able to talk to him and understand one another and that's what God is doing as he as he builds us Brick by Brick precept comb precept here a little there little by his word so that we can we can enter into full communion with it um so I want to turn to John chapter 14. and well I've got it right here so you don't you don't necessarily have to turn but but this is this scripture is kind of talking about the direction that I'm going to go in this class so uh before we read it let's go to the Lord in prayer real quick Lord Jesus we thank you God for your grace to us today Lord God I pray that you'll open our hearts to know more about you and to see you more with Jesus God I pray you to bless the service this morning with brother where you Lord that you'll bless him Lord and cause him Lord Jesus to speak exactly what you'd have until Lord granted Lord that he will help us Lord Jesus to understand you more and bless the ones that couldn't be here today Lord the ones that are sick and Afflicted Lord and just be with us all we pray in the name of all Jesus Christ amen now John 14 1-3 says let not your heart be troubled ye believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you now when brother Brown was breaking this down he begins to talk about how the God Was preparing it's like uh he talked about then when you when you got the new birth it wasn't as though all of a sudden God started thinking about you but he was thinking about you all alone he's like hey and he compared it to when you have a child when when a mother's pregnant and then she gives birth you don't wait until the baby's born to start preparing but you start getting everything ready you get the crib and all the diapers and everything all ready and laid out way before the child was born you start cleaning and that's exactly how God thinks of us he's he's from the from the day you were born before you were born he he already knew that that he would have wanted he knew all about you he knew everything and because he's the same yesterday today and forever he can never have a new thought and that's what kind of stumbles people about predestination you kind of almost think that that he's got somewhere somewhere back there he had he all of a sudden thought about you but no he he never has any thought it's it's uh because he's he's the unchanging God so he always knew that she was one and that's how he he had everything laid out for you so that uh one day that special moment when you heard the word and something just came alive and and it was it was like everything was just laid out one day you hear this minister of preach this particular thing and you would be in a particular place when you heard it and even look at brother Graham's life how everything all through the Old Testament all the all the people in the Old Testament their lives were it was like it was just uh all planned out all the dates and times and numbers and everything is just perfectly uh in in sync well that's how much God thinks of us so I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am a very he may be also because God wants fellowship with us he wants to commune with us he wants us to be where he is and and that's what where where is he now he's one one day that New Jerusalem is going to come down we're not we're not so much going to to another place but that New Jerusalem is going to come because it said it came from God out of heaven in Revelations it came down to earth and that's what the coming of the Lord is the coming of the Lord is God Bringing Down to Earth himself and uh I got I got a lot of material to cover so let me try I'm gonna try to move fast here but let's just start reading through some quotes what's what's God doing he says over the other one is called my father's house I'll go and prepare a place for you take you out of this pest house and deliver you into my father's house so there you are take you out of this old Earthly pest house he's gone to prepare a perfect place for no evil exists no sickness exists no old age exist no death exists it's a perfect place calling you to that Perfection and you have to be perfect to get there and we know what whether Perfection is when you get the bad when you when you're born again when you're born again uh you know you can enter into that and enter into the joys that that's prepared and and all those things but what we're striving for is something that nobody else has ever done in the history of the Earth or you know except for you know Enoch and and Elijah but that's to take a body change for our bodies to be changed and to take a Rapture and so that's what oh let me finish reading this quote so how can you do it through anything else but the perfect word of God which is the Waters of Separation that washes us from our sins amen that's right the blood of Jesus Christ think of it the dripping bloody word the blood the word of God bleeding blood to wash the bride in you can't do it through anything else besides the word of God and I've been reading through the adoption here he said he keeps stressing over and over how you got to stay with the word don't try to get your own idea or anything because it's that's what Nimrod did that's what kush did and that and threw everything off and and God's gonna have to come and destroy everything that they have to bring in a new kingdom to bring us back into perfect communion with him to bring everything back into perfect communion that the the world system the uh the bride the the whole Cosmos okay it's not by knowledge God isn't known by theology or education knowledge takes a man away from God faith it brings him to God that's what separated him from God In the Garden of Eden he went into the tree of knowledge and the pillar of fire he says but God's not known by education God's known by faith God's not known by knowledge man left the Tree of Life to eat the tree of knowledge and he's separating himself from God and ever since then by knowledge he's drove himself away from God God is not known by knowledge he's known by faith and it because because knowledge takes us out of communion with God you try to follow your what you think and it just takes you further away from what God the the message that God's really trying to bring right and and you know people have taken that and said well the education is bad education is bad if you use that to take it up take it off to take you you know to to try to figure out God's God's word but you know when we're down here it's you pretty much just to survive you've got to have education you gotta you gotta you know you gotta even if you're a mechanic somebody's got to show you how to fix a car or whatever that's that's education so we're don't go too far off the off the track you know the Feast of the trumpets in 1964 he said but the bride can walk with the word which is Christ remember last time we were talking about how real communion is being able to walk like Abraham God said walk before me and be thou perfect and and God came down and told Brother random walk with me down the mountain After the Storm was calm well and he said that'd be the greatest desire that I have that'd be the greatest honor to walk with you the bride can walk with the word which is Christ it must be an agreement not the ecclesiastical system but the word in agreement now doesn't mean not in your head anybody could I can go out to a homeless person and say do you agree with what brown said in these books and they I'm sure I agree but being in agreement is having that life live inside of you having have it in manifest and not just not in your head because anybody can sit in church and say I agree with what the preacher's saying and I have a clue what they're talking about right but agreement is when when it's revealed to you when it's when spirit and Truth come together and then you can agree right and that's one that's well let me just stop there I'm gonna get on something communion now see when we're getting these communion messages the brother Brown just said some some just wonderful things well that's what many times that we do in the spiritual realm you see each day we've got to commune with Christ we've got to talk to him each day and we've got to settle with it settle it with him each day Paul said I die each day each day I die yet I live not me but Christ lives in me so if your physical body needs food each day and drink each day to survive your spiritual body needs spiritual food and communion with the Lord each day to survive all right how can you how can you say you're communing with God and never read your Bible and never pray you said that's what the program said that uh a real Christian reasons the Bible and prays every day because that's how you grow that's how you grow up the stature perfect man that's how you become more closer to God and More in communion with them and comedian uh that same sermon he appeared to Eve as an angel of Light so for sure the Lord said this the Lord said this but he disagreed with God right at the end and that's the way false comedian does today when people think they're praying to God I won't obey the word as a false comedian and that was his definition of the Antichrist the Antichrist says yeah I'm sure I agree with the word but won't obey the word if you come to church and Nod your head and say yeah yeah I agree but won't obey won't line up whatever word then something's wrong something that that's not real convenient and identified Masterpiece of God it's God to agree with the word if your spirit and you won't punctuate every one of God's promises with amen there is something wrong and communion this is this is the last month that he preached um now we find out today that this great thing that we're feasible to do tonight in commemoration of his death in his body that we believe that we eat daily or just got through eating as our brother preached to us taking the word of God we believe it with all our heart we believe it when it comes to take a meeting you believe it and we see it manifesting we see it given to us we see God's God's life being manifested into it that's why I was stressing last time that it's the life of God you say well I agree with it but the life of God's not made manifest in me uh double check are you really in communion with God because uh we kind of stress so much the word the word but the word is a person and we don't want to just leave the word on the page we want to take it up and let it make it be manifest in our lives that's the whole point of the Gospel that that the truth will be anointed by the spirit and it will be it would come alive and and and getting us get into some good things right there we see it manifest we see it given to us we see and Vindicated we feel it in our lives and that's real comedian for that same message uh let's come down here what we need is some Thoroughbred Christians born under the blood of the Lord Jesus they'll live not off of church theology but off of the word of God the communion with Christ look at this this sounds like something the word coming into the believer his spiritual body is built up that's right yeah does that sound like the statue of perfect communion what we need is God's inoculation by the word of the Lord God to do what to give us immunity from the devil right man shall live daily by that kind of a food to build his soul into inoculation from spiritual diseases that's floating up around the country now build up get ready for the inoculation now we live by this our bodies must have this and and let me just jump down you can't have life only through Christ and now what does his word do it builds up our spiritual body strong as we commune with him that's right to resist the devil that's right you say brother Brandon what's that you say communing in his word yes he is the word in the beginning was the word and the words with God and the Word was God and the world made flesh and dwelt among us and we are to eat his body then his body is his word because he is the word and he said in John 15 if you abide in me and my communion my word abides in you then you can ask what you will and he'll be done for you there you are that's true see ask what you will you know real Community even in a family life if a husband and a wife I think the real evidence of a real comedian is when they share the checkbook now that's what's happening right here you know brother man always use that time that type yeah I have a neighbor that that one time he came home after he'd been traveling for a long time and his wife left him and and took all his money and and just took everything because they weren't inconvenient you share the checkbook you share that account and you're not a communion now I'm not trying to meddle here I'm just trying to you know brother Brandon always talked about he told uh up when you get into adoption where you can write the check and you put your own name on it because that's real communion when God can trust you with the checkbook you see if ye abide in me in my communion my word abides in you because you're speaking the same language you know what he wants and he can trust you with the bank account then you can ask what you will and it'll be done for you there you are that's true see ask what you will what it is it's got to be a fellowship and not a fellowship of some Creed or even to the written words got to be quickened by the Holy Spirit not much no matter how much theology you've got it's laying there did I could have a handful of weed until he gets into the process to where it can be quicker and the work the weak will never live and he's talking about how this the spirit has to Quicken the word that you've heard there's got to be the spirit and the truth coming together to make it alive and that's something I'm going to get into maybe a little bit long uh further along but Paul being well trained in a new description by the word but you see the scriptures as much as Paul knew all Scriptures it hadn't been quickened to him no matter how well you know them if the spirit doesn't Quicken and then the letter kill him because that that brings us into communion when the spirit comes down it makes the world alive together you begin to see what it's talking about that's why you're not you're not supposed to take my brother Wade mentioned that in one of his his lessons you don't take communion before you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth because you're not you're not in sync with what God wants we are his body right and if I had time I was gonna I was gonna read that scripture but but we'll see how much time we have left God keeps his word I tell you the reason I love to hear Brother Neville speak not mainly because he's a good preacher but because I know that it is right I thought I had another one oh there it is communion this is where in comedian 1963 he says you know uh and remember we want to be constantly be in prayer and above all things watch your life if your life don't tell you what God's holding us then go back and start praying again there's something wrong see we must live in that kind of a state that the fruits of the spirit will make itself known through us that's what we want to live and I'm not talking about a kind of priest that kind of thing where you just say like these days they're like well we'll just let homosexuality and whatever in the church or whatever and just just love everybody that's not the love of God we're talking about these the the life of God being made manifest out of something that the world can't imitate because it's God and flesh there's something wrong see we must live in that kind of a state that the fruits of the spirit will make itself known to us that's what we want to live you know sometimes we hear great preachers who can preach mighty but we'd rather see a sermon lived then we would heard one priest see because that's the evidence that God is on the inside that's right amen that's what I was talking about last time he said it he said the rejected King there's something about men and women that they long to be like one another and that's that's kind of what I'm getting at with Nimrod here he comes up and he he messes up the communion between between man and God whenever you see a minister or somebody trying to get in the middle and make everybody look at them instead see if if you look at me then I'm still growing up a stack your man and that will hinder your growth but the example is Christ that's what we all look at right that's the model when God and his brother around preached that message the Masterpiece he was his model for creating the Masterpiece is himself he's molding us into his image molding us and and chipping off by the word By The Sword of the word all the stuff that's not supposed to be there until it's there's something there that that he can look at and say this is my masterpiece there's only been one man ever lived on Earth that was our example and that was the one that died for us all our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ he was the perfect example of what we should be always about the father's business and doing that which is right always obeying the word if somebody if somebody shows you the word and it's revealed to you and you see it then you better line up with it now let's go back to where we were last time and I'm gonna have got 10 minutes God bless Noah and his sons instead of and be fruitful and multiply and replace the earth does that sound similar for me that's that's what he told Adam and Eve that's what he that was his Great Commission going into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Nation spread it around be fruitful and multiply and replace the Earth and when you get to akusha Nimrod they they did not want to spread the gospel this the truth around there if they want what they ended up doing was was uh taking uh staying in one place and building the city and building a tower around their knowledge around what they thought God wanted to do and and Chris being The Interpreter of the Gods of what he was known as he he started this this Doctrine first first It came it comes at his little Antichrist spirit I think I think this is gonna this is the way we should go and then he he started the saying where Nimrod was crowned uh Nimrod with candy King and and he began to be a mighty one of the earth and Genesis 10 8. so and Genesis 10 verses 10 through 11 it says the beginning of his kingdom was Babel that's where everything started at Nimrod and Eric and Acadia County and the land of shine are out of that land went for actually building Nineveh and the city we hop up in color now if you look in the history of two battle ones and in this in the church age book it says that this is actually a mistranslation that Asher doesn't isn't somebody it means that he got he started his little thing going on at around Babylon he got strong once he strengthened himself he went out and and uh built nilva and all his other cities so this is how Alexander Hislop says that all that Landing went for him being made strong uh when he had been made strong Asher and building enema built this big tower now there he is they're supposed to be in nimrod and what is what's he doing he's going around making people fall prostate before him see that look at me instead of looking at God and moving around seeing what they what they do is they'll they'll uh see this continued all the way down through through Modern Age where the papal Rome instead of letting the the Spirit-filled spirit-led church people put in pastors uh voting somebody that they believe is is a man of God or or run the church by the spirit then this this this uh papal organization they'll they put in like uh somebody I was talking to a church at work that's a that's a Catholic he was saying that every couple of years they'll put in a new priests it's their own Catholic hierarchy they'll they'll figure out who needs to go where who needs to because they've taken out the leading of the spirit and they've just put in theology they they have a little bit of Truth maybe but it's not quickened by the spirits know what to do right now in Jeremiah over 50 where we were we were reading earlier all this has got to be torn down all this has got to be is it's got to be it's got to be destroyed and that's what that stone that came out of the mountain does it it takes this this system that went down from from that head of gold to the the uh feed of iron and Clay it's all got to be destroyed to make way for for God's kingdom to come into being and that's what I'm what I'm com I'm going to be comparing in a few moments is is the goal of nimrod had he had three big goals and the goal that Christ had because he has three big goals they got that really talked about in Christ The Mystery of God are real and and they're they're uh there's very similar goals and very interesting so um foreign this is this is the story of the Tower of Babel and this is uh this is this is nimrod's three big girls a whole earth was of one language and a one speak everybody's in agreement as much as they can be and his three goals were built to build a city and a tower whose top May Return To Heaven he wanted to and let us make a name he wanted to make a name for himself he wanted to set up a kingdom and he wanted to start a religion not based upon God's word but and and these are all things brother Brandon said I'll show you the quote in a second he want to set up build a city and Tower who's taught me reach into heaven and let us make a name unless we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole Earth but God told me to multiply go go around spread the gospel and that's exactly what the opposite of what you want to do because he's claiming that he's interpreting the word I'll tell you what God wants you to do and just go on it totally against see how important it is to stay perfectly with God's word all through this the road around the sermons he just reiterates that over and over just do what God tells you stay with his word and to really stay with his word he got to be inconvenience amen you've got to be inconvenient to know what his word is all about and the Lord came down to see the city of the tower which the children have been building and the Lord said behold the people was one and they all have one language and this they begin to do they're they're building a tower not based upon his God God's word but upon knowledge go let us let us go down there confound their language they might may not understand one another speech so the Lord scattered them abroad from this poem the face of all the Earth which is exactly according to his original plan in Genesis 9. and they left off to build a city therefore is it is the name of it called battles because the Lord didn't confound the language of all the Earth so I'm just I have some quotes about this in the original you know in the early ages of mankind they everybody believed in one soul and omnip indeed and you created all things and bail was known as that um founder now now remember what that scripture in Jeremiah 50 that we just read Jeremiah 52 that says Baal will be confounded Now isn't it interesting that that compound or the one that takes God's word and messes it all up with his with his with his hammer with his with his Club because he had the club was the symbol of bell he is the one that in the end God's Gonna Come found him God's gonna take everything that he did and just and and destroy the same way that he thought he thought he was going to take God's word and set up something else something something greater so Baal is known as a confounder the Bell or Kush the father of nimrod originally was the Ringling to lay the people away from the true God encourage the people as The Interpreter of the Gods to take another form of religion uh he's known as the god of confusion that's where chaos can be all these Greek gods and things of Mars and all that stuff they all came from from Kush and Nimrod uh he's known as Marduk Nimrod and and that's where the the planet Mars comes from the god Mars all this stuff comes from Kiss Kush and Nimrod because they set up that all of the Pagan religions started back there with with uh Kush and Nimrod setting up this thing that was contrary to God's word and his symbol is a clue remember that scripture that I told you to remember the hammer okay he took his club and and destroyed God's word with him and now God's gonna take in the at the end time this what he's doing now his whole process is a destroy the works of the devil that through through this system that that came down that started back then the the confounder that symbol is a club and the name of a club account he comes from the very word which signifies to break in pieces or scatter abroad and he reserved he did teach everything he reserved stuff that's you know but I I strongly believe in just just telling everybody just if you got it just tell it you know because that's the opposite of what um and I'm going a little bit fast that's the opposite of what Nimrod did and there the the the the what they believe the Babylonian symbol of their Pagan symbol of God was this equilateral triangle it's so close to the truth so close I'm running out of town somebody told me somebody told me the funnest the funnest thing about watching my sentence collectors when I start to run out of time they take this and and and and use that to say it represents the Trinity three gods and one but it's really uh and and this see this is the lat or the Greek for um I am that I am so yeah it's so close uh not we yeah I might have to uh Let's see we got we got one more minute let me see if I can uh he he tried to force it down everybody's throat he tried to he tried to cram it down there for him and um there's the image Daniel's now here's what I'm getting to I'm gonna I'm gonna hurry right through this Rome exists to the end because it went to the end of the toes and he seen bud and clay and as people what we're made out of and iron the strength of Rome running every one of those Nations that's that that's that girl and all these all these uh world powers that came down Through the Ages until you get to the bottom that's today is these 10 these 10 uh the Roman system is just extended all throughout the world and God's Gonna there's a stone that came out of the mountain to destroy it and I'm I'm going fast you know what I'm not gonna hurt through this we're just doing next time yeah I think that would be a better option
