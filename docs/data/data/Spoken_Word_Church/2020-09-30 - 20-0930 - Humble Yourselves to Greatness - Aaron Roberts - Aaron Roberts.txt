midst so i think we got double that number or three times that number good to be in the house of the lord tonight thank the lord for all of his blessings and y'all just pray for me tonight and uh looking forward you know i don't it's it's not you know what i have it's what god has and that's that's that's the main thing just just yield ourselves to him and let him speak and bless the people and he's going to ask you a question do you know where you were 20 years ago today yes yes he is so smart he's it's right on that that's a thousand but uh yes yeah yes 20 years yes yes we've been sarah and i have been married 20 years today thank you that's kind of funny yeah so i want to wish her happy anniversary amen and say i love you and it's just uh it's a wonderful thing uh as brother m said give me anybody give a man anything else he'd give it to him other than salvation and and uh i always tell everybody i'll get in trouble for this but i tell it anyway uh ruth graham billy graham's wife said in an interview after they'd been married 50 something years they asked her and she said no i never thought about divorce she said i contemplated murder a few times but but never divorce and i always say sarah's probably thought about murder a few times but i don't know about divorce but she has thought about murder so so i thank the lord i'm still here but i will i will hear about that tonight but that's all right i still see it still love her so but uh good to be in the house the lord know i appreciate yes and uh a lot of you may not know that wade was one of my groomsmen and he also participated in the in the wedding yeah run around that's right he was on the grooms and they'd run out and run back in the church come back here and dismissed everybody so it was it was a lot of fun yes it was a good time but uh anyway we don't want to hold you too long and uh just want to get to the word um matthew chapter 18. beginning of verse one and we're gonna read from james chapter four and uh i want to look at something to tonight um i've been doing some studying on on the early church and looking at the apostolic church and the apostolic doctrine and you know one of the things that that came about and all this and you know i was i've been working on trying to do you know i wanted to do a little do a sermon or something on that and and this just kept coming back to me because you know the scripture tells us that you know they in the book of acts said they took everything that they had and they sold everything and everybody had everything in common and you know it didn't matter what they done nobody lacked anything nobody had too much nobody had too little they all had what they had need of and they sold and they had everything in common and you know one of the things that i was looking at was the humbleness that they had and even the scripture tells us to be of humble mind and you know you know i just kept coming back to this thought right here humble ourselves because this is a this is the passage that jesus speaks of here in matthew and uh that's what i want to talk about tonight it's going to be just a very simple thought but i just want to share this with you tonight and hope it's be an encouragement to you and you know because if you you know when you when you look at this when jesus talks about being a little child and have childlike faith you know you can move mountains amen so let's just all bow our heads tonight we'll just speak to the author and and just commit everything to him heavenly father we thank you for this opportunity to be in your house tonight lord lord we're just so thankful lord you said whether wherever two or three are gathered in your name you'd be there in the midst lord we are here and lord even the ones that are at home listening in lord wherever they may be you know we're still gathered in you though we gather in christ and i pray lord that it may be many miles between us lord but we'll be one in in the holy spirit tonight lord i pray that you go in each room everywhere they are lord and i pray that you be with them and touch them lord give them what they have need of tonight lord lord it may not be in my notes lord it may not but you can give it and put it in my mouth lord to be spoke lord you said if someone had a need or they had a question you'd put a man behind the pulpit lord you can supernaturally give me anything to to be spoken lord to meet any need lord we just look unto you lord because we believe that you can do all things and lord we just yield ourselves to you lord that we would have ears to hear lord and a mouth to speak lord jesus father as a as isaiah lord as the angel took the cold from i off the off the altar lord and touched his mouth lord touch our mouths tonight lord jesus that we can speak lord what is what is pleasing to you lord lord always just let us be sanctified in all that we do lord that lord that we'll be pleasing to you in everything and father for each one that's sick and afflicted lord there's many needs lord i pray that the holy spirit goes and touches each one tonight touch brother dale lord in his body lord and you know we he has stood for us many times already stood in the gap for us lord interceding on our behalves and now it's time for us to stand to intercede for him lord lord you're the same yesterday today and forever lord you've done it once lord you'll do it again and we believe that you will and lord for brother donny and the different ones lord that we know of that are sick and afflicted in our bodies lord jesus we know that you minister in a special way lord you said you sent your word and you healed them and you delivered them from their destruction lord we believe that lord we commit all things to you lord lord as as we go forth lord from this day lord we want to be closer to you not further away lord let us be stronger in the faith lord we commit all things to you we thank you for all your blessings on us in the name of jesus christ we pray amen amen matthew chapter 18 verse 1 and it says at the same time came the disciples unto jesus saying who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven and jesus called a little child unto him and he said him in the midst of them and said verily i say unto you except you be converted and become as little children ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven james chapter 4 verse 10 says humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up amen god bless you tonight you have your seats so brother brown says in the message my new ministry in 1959 he says do you remember when john went came preaching the bible foretold that every mountain would be brought low and every low place would be lifted up see when it come you would think he would be coming out of heaven with fire chariots but what was it but a poor man dressed in a piece of sheepskin wrapped around him and out of the banks of jordan preaching on the muddy banks not even in the church but god called that great and when jesus said to the disciples that there wasn't one born of a woman as great as john the baptist you take all the kings and david the prophet and all of his great splendor and solomon they didn't even touch john and yet he didn't have a place to lay his head so you don't have to be rich and mighty in this world to be great in the sight of god you only have to be humble in your heart and god calls that greatness he he that's great enough to humble himself that's a great person that'll take the blame for everything that'll humble himself that's greatness amen and as brother bob was speaking on sunday this is from first peter 5. he says likewise you younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resists as the proud but giveth grace to the humble humble yourselves before therefore unto the mighty hand of god that he may exalt you in due time amen so i just want to speak on that tonight about being humble before god and you know there's many people in the world you know they want to be they want to be great just as the disciples you know won't know who was the greatest in the kingdom and you know jesus said in mark he said whoever is going to be the greatest or the chiefest among you he shall be the servant of all and you know that you know when you look at a as a servant you know a servant is a person that humbles themselves a person is not someone that does their own one their own will but it's that they follow the will of the master and you know jesus said you know that he said i come to do the will of my father it's not it's not what i want to do he said but it's the will of the father he said he said the son can do nothing in himself except what he saith the father do that doeth the son likewise so he followed exactly and that's what we have to do is to if we want to be great in the kingdom of god because we all want to be great in in the kingdom of god you know the world is full of people that trying to be great at something you know they're trying to fulfill this desire but you know the greatest desire is to fulfill the word of god is to fulfill the will of god whatever and we know that the will is the word of god and you know and if it if you have a question it's in the word of god that's where you find it you know i was speaking to somebody just this week and we were talking about people being you know the the issue that a lot of people have today in this world is they've not been converted they don't even know what the word convert means you know because you look at people today and you know they they are so wrapped up in so many things but this but the scripture says you know you need to have a change you know you need to be converted a convert a conversion is a change you know something that takes place you do away with the old the old part of you the old man it dies yeah it has to be a change there has to be something because you can't be the same old person and and be the same and follow god and he said he said unless you be converted and you know we were talking you know there's a lot of people that you know a lot of people are just church goers you know they just want to sit on a pew they just want to do their religious duty but they don't know what a conversion is they don't know what they don't know what a relationship with jesus christ is you know there's a lot of people that even stand behind the pulpits as as i was speaking to a man that's just a denominational christian this week but you know we were talking about you there's people that stand behind the pulpit and you know they don't even believe the bible they don't even believe what the scripture says but they want to preach a gospel well you know what you know if if i was going to preach you know i mean you know i would just sit down if i didn't believe any more than than that because you know you know it's just like we just get up and we're just repeating what somebody else has said but it's not a real true revelation to us it's not something that's real to us that you know it doesn't really do anybody any good it has to be something that has to be a personal relationship a personal experience to you and that's just what is lacking i said because you know we've got to be converted we've got to be changed we've got to we've got to have a no-sew relationship we've got to know for a fact what is what is truth we've got to know and you know we're talking about people people don't have don't have that and it's not being preached in churches it's just it's just you know just go to church and put your name on the roll and say a little creed and do this and just go right on out the door and they just kind of live any kind of thing and it's just like you know they come back and they they you see people they'll come to the altar and now and they'll confess their sins and they'll want to change and then they go right back and they go do the exact same thing that they've done that they've done in the past and they come back and they want to say well i just want to change right here and then i go right back out the door and they do the exact same thing well the problem is is when you change right here and you come and you say well i want to change when you walk out that door then you don't walk the same places that you walked before you don't do the same things that you've done before because the problem is is just like when brother brandon was speaking to that that woman that young lady you know that she was such a dancer and she loved she loved to dance and you know she that was where she loved to be well then you know she went on the devil's ground out there and decided you know i'm going to go on the devil's ground but she thought well i'm good enough that i can stand here and i can witness under the atmosphere of that dance hall but you know what the next thing you know she was sucked right back in now why because she was back under that atmosphere of that dance hallway because that's where she had a problem and the problem is is you can't be under the same atmosphere and living in the same way and think you're going to get you're going to get free of that the bible says that we should resist the devil and he'll free he'll flee from us but you know you've got to come to a place that you've got to step back away from those kind of things and that's where you get you get to a conversion is you don't go back to the same things you don't read the same things you don't listen to the same people it's the same it's gotta you gotta come through a change you know i listen to you know everybody listens to dave ramsey and you know sometimes as people call in and you know sometimes dave has to tell people it's the same thing you know because they go right back to doing the exact same thing they want to change but you know what they don't break their old habits and he said you're going way down the road to dumb and you got to make a detour well that's the same thing you know people people want to go do the exact same thing well you've got to get a place where you turn around you can't be going the same direction there has to be a change you know we've got we've got to commit it to god that he can do this and it's so funny because you know the one thing that people we hear people talk about uh you know they try to pray they want to they want to seek god for an answer and seek god for an answer and they want to pray and pray and they're trying to get an answer well the problem is is they don't spend any time in the word you know this this is where you this is where god can speak to you but you know if you don't ever crack this open and here and you want to read some kind of self-help book or you want to read something else and you know because it doesn't matter you know dear abby's not going to help you and dr dobson is not going to help you and dr spock and and all the rest of them you know everybody wants to read all the psycho bible that's out there but you know that's not going to change you because you know what it takes the power of the holy ghost to change you you're not going to change because you know a lot of people they they they live to a place where they they try to work it up in themselves but you know what they drive themselves crazy trying to live something without having a conversion and allowing something to take place in their life and if you allow that to change you then you won't have to worry about having a struggle with something why because you're allowed it's not low it's no longer i that live now but it's christ that liveth in me so if we allow him to take over then he can he can live through us and he can lead us to the place that we can overcome it's no longer me that's trying to overcome it's allowing him to overcome through me i'm not trying to overcome why because he's the one that's overcome he's the one that's overcome he has the overcoming power he gives us the power to overcome we can't do it in ourselves but we must be like these little children and humble ourselves humble ourselves and realize you know we can't do it in ourselves we can't do this alone let us be humble about it many people they want to do that looking at trying to find something in themselves but it won't ever work brother ram says in god hiding himself in simplicity he said you know god is so great he hides himself in simplicity and then he reveals himself in the same thing he hides himself in and god is so great that he can make himself simple that's what makes him great he said so so many miss him in the simplicity simple ways that he hides himself now we know that man cannot do this man cannot make himself great enough to be simple see now what makes god so great is because he can be so simple and god does not reveal himself in greatness as we call greatness but he makes himself great by being simple and humbling himself and being so simple and all the way through the scripture we'll find people that are that have been humble themselves and and simple and what god wanted them to do and it was so simple and yet there were some people that had a hard time with that they couldn't follow the simplicity they couldn't be humble enough just to follow the simple plan that god had laid out you know brother adam talks about and and and talking about noah he said you know noah had 120 years that he preached a message that it's going to reign it was a simple message it was a simple message and you know what no uh noah was just humble enough just to go out there and do what god told him to do he went out and built an ark and got together and you know what and god actually gave him the plan on how to build the ark he didn't have to figure out nothing god told him just how big to make it how wide what you what would to use and all the all the process of how to build the thing was given to him and all he had to do was go do it and the whole time he stood there and all he had to do was tell the people it's going to rain it's going to rain and the people's like well we can prove brother ram said that the civilization in noah's day was so greater was greater than ours but he said you know he said they could shoot the sky and they could tell them there's no rain up there there's no moisture how are you going to get moisture out of the sky there's nothing up there for it to happen he said that's all right he said it doesn't matter god said it's going to rain that's right you know and it's you know it's amazing that you're standing there in a day and a at a time where nobody had ever seen that happen nobody had ever seen rainfall from the sky never had that happen and then here he is this man building a boat building this great big ark that he's going to build and he's going to put the animals on there you know how ridiculous does that look how crazy do you have to be to be in that kind of situation you know but you know what god was it had a very simple plan and it was a very simple message and you know what god done exactly what he said all he had to do was get one man that would do exactly what he wanted him to do and that was to get out and preach the gospel to the people to tell him that judgment was coming upon the people and it was judgment judgment's coming but guess what god never brings judgment unless he brings mercy and he brought mercy and that was mercy standing before the people for 120 years this generation received the mercy of god in the building of an ark and every day they come by and they said look there's the crazy man noah there's this crazy man out there building a boat but you know what that's what god was giving per mercy to the people he was showing them the plan a way out and you know there were even some people that just got close enough where they just stood on the outside of it because you know they couldn't get themselves in the ark but they got close enough and they thought well you know what if it really starts to rain i'm going to find my way in there but i don't want to get in there because i don't want to look crazy to the world i don't want to look kooky to my friends i don't have to be separated from everybody else i want to be close enough to the world where i can be comfortable but i want to be close enough to god where i got a way out but the problem was was the people that stood by they were close enough and thought they were going to sit on the fence well guess what they died in the flood also you know what you're not going to sit on the fence and think that you're going to get by you're either going to be in the ark or you're going to die there's no other way around it you've got to find your place directly sealed in or you're going to be sealed out there's no other place to be and you know when they when they when noah preached that message to those people you know he just kept going on about his business and he didn't listen to all the fanatics and he didn't listen to all the rigmarole and everything else that went around him all he done was preach the gospel and he went about his job doing what god called him to do and you know you don't have to listen to all what the world has to say and all the naysayers and everything like that you know because if god put something inside of you it don't matter there ain't enough devils in hell it's gonna run it outside of you you're not ever gonna have to worry about is this message right is god right is god real is this message right is the bible right you know do i have a place to stand you know what god healed me will god meet my needs well because if he's ever done it before he'll do it again i don't have to worry about it one because he's healed me before well it's the same it's the same god that's healed us before well you know he's the same god that's delivered us he's the same god that's met all your needs well you know what he's the same one you know what he ain't lost any power god ain't scared about what's going on you know we shouldn't be either you know people worried about what's going to happen in the in in in november what's going to happen with what you know god's god's going to be in control and it don't matter who comes in who goes out what goes up what goes down you know god's still going to be in control you know and the scripture ain't never changing he said i've never seen the righteous forsaken or his seed begging bread and david said i'm i'm old now and he said i was young and he's seen all the things that went through all the valleys and the battles and everything that david had went through in his life and all the things that that he had seen all of the idols and all the things that he had seen in israel and he had seen the anointed the man that god had anointed to be king and you know he was he was a head taller than everybody else he should have been he should have been a great leader but you know what he got to popularity you know he just wanted to be popular he just wanted to do what everybody else said instead of listening to the part to the prophet samuel when the prophet told him what to do he decided he was just going to do whatever he wanted to he wanted he wanted to be and live his own kind of life but he wanted to be close enough to samuel so that he can use samuel's reputation to be his backing you know because you know he wanted he wanted to be close enough that you know that everybody would listen because you know i'm i'm buddies with with samuel you know we're tight but you know what samuel coming had to bring the rebuke to him because he walked away from what god told him to and you know and and there was there was one that god said that he had had one that was after his own heart and all the things that david had seen and you know david wanted to walk in the in the way that god had given him and that was what he said you know that that was what god loved about david even when david done wrong he could admit his wrong you know everything about david he could he could go and and sacrifice and pray to god you know he never got away from god no matter what happened in his life he never turned away from that you know many people you know we can we see so many people that have have tried to get away from that but you know it's just a simple message it's just a simple formula if we can just follow that exact same thing just do what god has for us to do if we just follow god you know when uh even when you know david sinned and you know he had a son you know solomon you know when when solomon came through and he come to be king you know and then solomon when he stepped to the throne you know god asked him you know what what shall i do for you you know that that he had seen the the life of his father and he had seen the things that david had done and you know he stood there being a young man and he said he said lord he said i want an understanding heart he said i want to be able to discern to the people what is right he said lord he said i can't go in or go out he said i don't know he said these are great people before me and he said i'm supposed to be the king and he said i don't even know what to do he said but i want wisdom hey you know i want to know how to judge these people because i'm supposed to be their king you know and it pleased the lord so much that that what solomon asked of him that he said he said because you know he had a such a humble spirit before the lord and the lord said because you've done this because you've had this humble spirit and he said he said you you want to do good to the people he said because you have an understanding desire for understanding he said you will receive those things he said you will have wisdom he said you'll have a spirit of discernment to work before the people and he said because you've done this and he said you've not asked for for long life or riches or the lives of your enemies or anything like that he said because you've done that he said you will have those things all the other things you will have because what did jesus say he said if you seek first the kingdom of god he said then his righteousness all these other things will be added unto you but solomon walked out there and you know when and brother i said that was a type of the millennium in the in the in the days of israel because you know there was no war you know it had such great uh wisdom and understanding and all of and all of the aspects of the kingdom that you know what there was nobody that wanted to fight israel well because they were such a fortified group such a fortified kingdom that nobody wanted to take on solomon and solomon had such wisdom because god had given him that power of discernment he knew how to handle situations and he knew how to handle things he knew what to do and you know because it became so great because he had this desire to be humble and speak before the lord and had this desire to please the lord and what he done that when he went to go forth then we know that the scripture talks about the queen of the south or the queen of sheba that she came because she had heard of the the ministry of the of the knowledge and the understanding of king solomon that she desired to come see what what god had done because you know she had in her foreign country you know she had heard many people come to her country and tell her what a great god that israel had and a great king they had in solomon and you know she kept hearing this being preached all the time and you know she had such a desire that she gave up everything she had to go find him she had to go find him and hear these things and you know brother brown talks about you know she went on this journey it was like three months and you know she had to go through all of these pestilences and you know she had to deal with robbers and you know all of these dangerous situations that she had to go through but she had a desire to hear the word of the lord and she went through all of those things to face all those all those things that she didn't even know what she was going to face on that journey and then she took all of the all of the riches and everything that she had with her and you know she was a she was a mark if there ever was one to be struck by all of those robbers and everything that were lit you know the highway men and everything that was that during those times but you know she had a desire to hear from the word and to hear what god had done because she had only heard about it but she wanted to see for herself she had a desire to receive for herself and you know and she went and she went in there and then she said when she got there and she heard solomon speak and she heard those things and she said it's even greater than what i heard from all these people have tried to testify to me of what goodness it was and how great it was and now come to find out it's even better than what i've heard well let me tell you something brothers and sisters we can stand here we can tell you how good it is and we can tell you about living in the land of the living and we can tell you about living in the in canaan and we can tell you all about the milk and the honey and everything like that but until you come into this land you'll never know about it we can't tell you about it we can't paint a picture good enough we can't tell you about it but when you get in here you'll find out it's better than you ever thought it would be it'll be greater than you ever thought it would be but you know the greatest thing is she went through all that and he and jesus said that she would rise up in the last days and she would she would be a condemnation to the people because he said behold a greater than solomon is here and so greater is he that is here today than he was back then amen it's great but you know what people can't humble themselves people have missed out on the humility oh goodness he's so great that we can we can see how great it is if we can just you know we just trust the lord and he can show and we say well this is so good well you know what there's more goodness there there's more goodness you know as brother brown talked about that fella eating uh eating a watermelon he said you know he said this sure is good but he said there's more of it you know we we can feast on the things of god but you know what you keep digging in there you'll find out there's a lot more good things in there you know it just it just gets better and better and better you know as we were as a as the first quote that i was reading there were brother and speaking of of john when when john came and you know the scripture talks about you know making all the high places low and and the low places high and making the all the crooked places straight and everything you know people are so amazed by by what the scripture said by isaiah talking about how everything was going to be a certain way and and everything and you know people were just so amazed they they sat there and you know they were looking for some great thing to take place and you know you know their whole time looking at the sky and boy they were just waiting for some great momentous occasion that was going to take place and it was going to change everything and everybody was going to be looking at this this marvelous majestic thing to take place and when it took place they missed it why because it was it was so humble they missed it and we know that when john the baptist came you know he was not he was not like anybody expected him to be you know here's here's a man that was living out in the world looked like some woolly booger coming out of the woods and you know just living in and you know having a having camel hair and you know eating bugs and you know all kinds of stuff you know he didn't look like nobody that god would ever speak to he wouldn't look like nobody that anybody that had any right sense in their mind would even talk to but he was the one that came out there in the power of the holy ghost and began to speak to the people he said to repent that the the the messiah was at hand you know now is the time and in john chapter one verse 25 and he said and they asked him and said unto him why baptize us thou then if thou if thou be not that christ or elias neither that prophet john answered said sin i baptize with water but there standeth one among you whom you know not it is he it is whom cometh after me is preferred before me whose shoes latch it i am not worthy to unloose these things were done in bashir beyond jordan where john was baptizing bethel borough and the next day john sith jesus coming unto him and saith behold the lamb of god which take away the sin of the world this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest israel therefore am i come baptizing with water and john bear records saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and abode upon him and i knew him not but he that went but he that sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shalt see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same is he which baptized us with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god so you know here he is you know john coming out there and began to speak to the people and he began to identify the the old testament prophets and the ministry that he had of the one voice crying in the wilderness and then identifying himself that he was the forerun the coming of christ the coming of the messiah and he began to speak to the people and you know people a lot of people didn't understand what he was saying but you know there was something that struck the people that they began to listen to him and people that were humble enough to come to hear what he had to say because many people had heard what the old testament you know the scribes and the pharisees and the prophets and all the different ones had heard all those different things they'd been told all those things and you know the priests had had made their sermons and all those things knowing what the prophets had said but you know what when they began to see that it was so humble that people just walked past it they didn't agree with that they didn't there was nothing in that but you know it caught the attention of some people and they began to listen and they began to see what things that john spoke and when jesus came then he said i saw the spirit of heaven the spirit of god come down like a dove and lay upon this one and he stayed and it bowed upon him why because he had the spirit of a lamb because he was the lamb of god because you know the spirit the dove can only stay where the lamb spirit is because they have the same nature so you know he had to stay there and he saw that take place but then you know then he began to preach and you know it was time for jesus to come on the scene and you know jesus john said you know i must decrease that he might increase why because he began to preach and point to people that was all his job was was to point people to jesus to show who the messiah was and this is the fulfillment of the scripture now i'm supposed to walk off the scene but you know people wanted to follow john and john was trying to point to him and say that's the one that's the one but people were still looking at john trying to figure out where you know well he's the one that's fulfilling the scripture he's the prophet but the prophet we kept pointing to people look back look at him he's the one you must follow now amen even when john john lost his vision and couldn't see you know he still went and you know they sent word back to john to tell who that jesus told him said yes i am the one i am the one that even when he lost he lost his vision when brother graham said his eagle eye got filmed over but you know it was still he was pointing the people to jesus and the people were supposed to see jesus and you know and here and you know here's the humility and the in the forerunner of jesus and then you see the humility in jesus when he came because he was you know if he was what the scripture said because he was god made manifest in flesh and many people you know they began to look in the scripture go well they expected him to come just like they expected john to come they expected this this great role you know these great stairs to come down from heaven and he was supposed to come and they were supposed to have all these angels playing trumpets and all this great fanfare and all these things was supposed to take place but the scripture never told us that jesus would come that way that was that was the man's idea he never did say that he would come that way because he never comes in man's great idea of greatness but he came in the greatness that god says is great and so he came why because he came from the ramparts of glory he become he came from the greatness and he and he made himself and he humbled himself down to become as a baby why because he had to come and fulfill the scripture that was written of him that he had to come and be just like you and i he had to come born of a virgin and he had to come and he had to walk and talk and just do all the same things that you have to do he had to know what it was like to feel pain and feel hunger and feel rejection and all the other things that he had to go through in his life and deal with all those things that he had to face why because that was what's written of him he had to go through those things that he can be a high priest that can be touched by the feelings of our infirmities to know what we go through in this life and you know what he faced all the same things that you face he knows what it's like to be rejected he knows what it's like to be hungry and cold and miserable and all these different things and be bombarded by the spirits of the devil and you know having him speak to you and you know he had to be bombarded by that but you know what he overcame every single time the devil tried to overcome with him even when he was in his weakness and you know he was tired and he was hungry and all those different things and the devil was tempting him but you know what he still used the word of god to overcome you know because brother and sister we have the word and we can overcome also god has given us the word that we can overcome and here's here's this great king that came and he came to walk just like you and i do walk in and and and face the same things that that you and i do but you know what he he had he had to walk and he was obedient in all those things he said he was obedient unto death even the death of the cross you know that was hard you know that was that was a real struggle one because you know there was there was a part of him that didn't want to die there was a part of him they didn't want to have to go through that but you know what he still he said not my will but thine lord and here he was and he walks out there and he had in the last supper when he was there and he was gathered with his disciples you know he's standing there and he and he gathers gathers them together gathers them together you know and he's standing there and he's talking to him you know because he's getting ready to leave them you know this is going to be the one of the last times that he has fellowship with them and he wants them to know you know just like he told peter he said he said this devil has desired to shift sift you like wheat but he said he said but i've prayed for you and he said he said and when you're converted strengthen your brethren that's right man isn't that isn't that encouraging even even though what he knew all the things that peter would do that peter would deny all the things that peter would do and yet you know what god still had jesus still had love for and he knew that he would use him he still had a ministry for him to and all the and all the all of his faults and failures but you know he went in there and he broke the bread and he spoke to him and you know even even in the midst of all of that you know he took a towel and he girded himself and he went in there and he washed the disciples feet the king of glory that washed washed his disciples feet even washing judas's feet who he knew that he would betray him that all that he would do to him and you know what he went in there and he washed their feet and he went in there and he said he said look he said i am your master and your lord he said you know look look at the position that i have but he said i want to show you that i have that i have a servant's heart and he said you ought to have a servant's heart also he said if i washed your feet and show you these things he said you ought to wash one another's feet he said you ought to be a servitude unto each other he said you ought to not think one is better than the other but he said you should all think highly of each other and he said you should all have this servant it's hard to do these things and you know he went in there and he and he showed these things and he and he told told them listen listen i'm going to go through these things but he said i'm not going to leave you comfortless he said i'm not going to leave you by yourself he said i want to show you one thing i'm going to tell you he said i've told you before he said that i told you when we were standing on the on the mountain and looking over the temple and i told you he said you can tear this temple down in three days he said but in three days i'll raise it up he said you can tear it down but he said i have the power to raise it up and he said i'm gonna raise it back up and you know they were so distraught when he pat when he died and everything you know they got and then you know they walked away from him and peter went fishing and all the other things that they'd done oh god got so gloomy and went all their different ways but you know jesus came back and told him he said this is that's not what exactly what i told you would take place i told you i was going to do this but i'm bringing you back and he told him he said but listen he said i told you what would take place but he said i want you to do one thing he said i want you go to the city of jerusalem he said i want you to go there and he said i want you to go in the upper room and i said i want you to stay there he said until you're endued with power from on high he said i've given you the promise that you go and he said when are these days he said because i go away he said but i'm going to send the comforter back to you and the comforter is going to lead you and guide you into all truth the comfort is going to show you all these things that i've spoken to you are true and you're going to see these things in a supernatural way and he began to speak to these people and then then when he went up in the when he descen ascended you know then he told him you go and wait you go terry you know and they waited well they had to be humble enough to go sit in a room looking at each other wondering what was going to take place because you know even when when the the romans thought that somebody had stolen jesus's body and you know they were wondering what was going on and they're all afraid hiding out worried about everything and staring at each other and wondering what was going to take place but you know what they were like well you know are we waiting long enough have we waited you know how many days are we supposed to wait how many days has it been it's been a week we still ain't got nothing but you got to wait you got to tarry you know what the thing is is when you tarry you don't have to when you when the holy spirit comes you don't have to guess if it came or not you know when they when they received it on the day of pentecost you know what they didn't have to did you feel something you know because it was something that quickened them that it quickened the word to them that you know what they didn't have to worry about if it was something that really happened to them or not it's like oh i felt a tingle did you feel something no you know it took away all the doubt he took away all the confusion he took away all the fear why because the spirit of god had come and it became real to them and it became in them and then all of a sudden then they could walk out the door like drunk men and begin to preach as peter began to preach to those people and tell you that it's not you know it's not about the third hour of the day and he said we're not drunk these people aren't drunk like you think they are but let me tell you something this is the fulfillment of the prophet joel joel prophet prophesied of this and now you're seeing the fulfillment of this and we're going to tell you that the jesus of nazareth whom some of you heard and couldn't follow but you know what this is that what he spoke of that that he would come and they were going to begin to speak of what jesus done of the of the the prophets and everything that they had preached in the past and to come to this very single day and it tells you this is the day that jesus jesus of nazareth has come and now he is the same the lord and the christ when he began to preach this message to him you know it stirred the people so much that they want to know what what they had to do to get the same thing that that peter had it wasn't some well i think about it can i come back tomorrow no if something to grab grip these people so much that when they want to what are we supposed to do peter what are we supposed to do ben and brethren what is it that we need to do and he said you need to repent you need to be converted you need to change he said you need to repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and he said you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost you shall receive the gift of eternal life he said because this promise is made unto you and to your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the lord our god shall call so it's you know it still is today is he's still calling today he's still the same one today he still has the same power he is the same one and you know he is still preaching the same thing today through the five-fold ministry that he's still speaking that if you have a desire you can repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you know what in the same thing he said the same antidote still works today as it ever has you can receive the exact same thing that they received on the day of pentecost yes sir but people have gotten away from that they've gotten away from just this humble humble word of god that god has spoken that god has spoke to people that's just so simple if you can humble yourself too and and you know there was one that came after this and many people have one of the things i was i've been looking at is you know people have been they look and and you know brother brown talked about had a had a man come to him and and he said well what you're doing is all right brother branham said but you're uh he said what you're trying to do is preach an apostolic age he said you know the apostolic age ceased many years ago he said you know all that's over with we don't we don't need all that stuff today you know we don't we don't need what you know what took place back there and he said it was just for the apostles it was just for the apostles he's like uh which which ones were the twelve that were deal with jesus you know that was the only ones that that received this thing you know and he said well really is that true yes well he said well then peter must or paul was out paul didn't say paul didn't see jesus in the flesh he didn't he didn't walk with him he didn't talk he didn't handle him he didn't have the he didn't have the testimony that peter and them had but you know what he knew him by revelation he had received a revelation you know as as all the things that he had done you know he had studied all of his life he had studied the the word he had studied the the law and all those things he knew everything that all the things that the prophets had said he knew all the the writings of moses he knew everything you could you know he could tell you all about it he understood everything you know he walked he walked a perfect religious life he knew exactly how to do everything and you know he was he was a pharisee of the pharisees i mean you know he had a great a great master teacher that taught him everything and he knew everything and you know he was such he had such a zeal to do the work of god that he was going out there and he was going to kill all these heretics but you know what he got he got on the road one day and god met him and you know what all the teaching that he had had and all the schooling that he had had and all the theology in him you know what he had he had a use for that but you know what because when when paul had the holy ghost then you know what he could go back and he had read all the scrolls and he had read all those things but let me tell you what when the holy ghost anointed paul's eyes that he could read the scripture and he went back and started reading and now he could realize that jesus christ is the messiah and here's all the things and showing how christ was all through the old testament how all those things how he could sit down and he could write and he could write the new testament to the church and tell everybody look at these things and these are the things that took place in the old testament and here i'll hear how it all lays out you know he had a great ministry that that god could do for him god could use him but you know what he had he had to blind him so that he could have sight right he had to he had to make him had to put him down on the on the road so that he could make him humble so god could speak to him and then he wanted to know who are you lord he said i'm jesus whom thou persecuted us then he knew who he was then he could look in the scripture and know that and then paul could raise up and say paul a servant of jesus christ paul a prisoner of jesus christ he knew who he was and he knew where he came from and he knew all those things that he had been taught all his years and he said you know i count all that as dung he said you know because all that theology and all those things it doesn't mean anything he said but i'm that i might know him and in the power of his resurrection that he could see he said it wasn't just that there was no count that all the things that he had studied and he had learned but it was through the holy ghost that could quicken what he had studied and he had read but if it was just going to be man-made theology it was just going to be man-made ideas he didn't do any many good and it just it's not going to do us any good either to to just study the scripture and study the message and just hold it if it doesn't become quick and by the holy ghost it does us no good you can hold it you can read it and you know there's many people and there's many preachers that have stood behind the pulpits and you know they can take this scripture and they can put it together and they can put quotes together and they can do many things but you know what if it doesn't have the holy ghost behind it if it's not the holy ghost leading you on the way and bringing the word to the people then it doesn't do any good because you know it doesn't do us any good to try to preach our own ideas if it's not if you're trying to build a kingdom to yourself if you're trying to bring people to you and not to christ it doesn't do any good and all the things that paul had seen and done and he had a great ministry and the great miracles that god had worked through him and all the people that had had seen paul work and seen the ministry that paul had and people that flocked to him and you know they wanted to be around paul and it's like oh do you see what god's done with paul and all these great things and you know people just wanted to gather around him people were so drawn to him but you know there became a change in paul you know you know there was a change went through in his life and you know people didn't hang around him anymore you know as he began to hang to the word and and you know he he wasn't he wasn't doing the same things as he was before and you know he become humble unto the word of god and you know demas was there and you know demas just loved paul when he was doing the great miracles and he had a lot of a lot of things and you know a lot of a lot of flash and you know different things god was moving and there was great things taking place it's like oh boy you know i can't i just can't wait to be here but you know there came a time when paul got separated when god separated him from the people you know he had a he had a ministry that he had to walk away and he just hung to the word you know and and paul writing in the in the in the scripture there when he was writing and he said you know demas has forsaken me you know demas was so close to him they were close and you know all those things and then he writes demas loving this present world he said he has forsaken me and no doubt that was a heartbreaking thing for paul to write that that paul had to write that and talk about demas well you know brother branham said demas didn't go out and go to the honky tonks he wasn't in the brothels he wasn't he wasn't up and down the road with everybody else he wasn't out there in the world doing all the things that that he had walked away from when he loved this present world there was a thing brother branham said that he had popularity he he liked the popular things he liked being popular he liked he liked rubbing elbows and shoulders with with the high-class people and you know having a great name and everything and when when paul realized you know i don't need that that's that's not the life of god i can you know because i just want to be as just me and him and to be humble and be the servant of god and you know he just walked away from things and it's like well paul's lost his ministry he's lost the power you know he used to speak to people and and things would happen to him and now he just turns around walks off and he just he just don't fellowship with people he's like oh i can't i can't have anything to do with this why because demas demas was there when it was all good and everything was looking good but when it became that it had to be walk in humility walking in the hum and in just a humble christian life that paul had you know demons had to leave and you know many people that's the way it is you know it's it's popularity you know it's like well i i you know i don't want to be here because you know they're you know they do certain things and and you know they don't have a big crowd and you know they don't have this and that and you know it just don't suit my fancy you know i want to go where you know i can i i feel i feel more i fit in better over here you know i i feel better you know i like things better over there why because they want to be where it's popular you know many people they they want to go where you know that big crowds and different things but you know what the problem is is they don't even know what's being preached are you are you walking in in humility are you walking in the humbleness that god has are you walking to be great in him not with great with people you know he had had seen all these things and and you know paul just wanted to be he just wanted to be a prisoner of jesus christ he just wanted to be humble and do the same do the things that jesus wanted him to do to live that humble life and you know that's the thing is you know because so many people they want to they want to be in the eyes of the people they want they want to have they want to have commendations of the people they want to have honor with the people they want to be they want to be pressed have prestige and all these different things paul said he didn't care about any of those things if i if i can just be pleasing to god that's all that matters i just want to be pleasing to god i don't have to have a i don't have to have a big name i don't have to have that people know me or anything he said but i just want to be pleasing to god i just want to live the life that god has called me to i want to be faithful to the work that god has called me to you know i don't have to um as paul talked about you know you know just living a humble simple life and you know and he said he said you know i didn't come begging money from you and he said i didn't get my living from you and all these things he said you know he said i've learned to be in whatever state i am there with to be content you know and you realize all the things that he wrote to the people and he didn't write a bunch of stuff to the church to tell people that that he wanted them to feel sorry for him i have a pity party he wanted them to know what he's done for the gospel this is what god's brought me through he said he said you know he said i spent i went through shipwreck and he said i spent a day in the night in the deep and he said he said i've been in barrels he said i've been stoned he said i've been beaten he said i've been in prison all these different things that he's went through in his life all the things that he had that he had faced in his life and he said you know he said it's the glory to god he said it's not in me but he said it's glory to the god but but look at all the things that i've went through he said you know he said but i consider myself to be the least in the kingdom and all the things that he had been through and you know he said i do it all for the glory of the lord he said but i don't want you to feel sorry for me he said because god called me to do these things and it's been the grace of god that's brought me through but i want you to know that this is something that's real to me and this is what god's brought me through and he's carried me through these things and he said i want to i want to show you that that you know i god called me to be the the apostle to the gentiles and you know i'm here to carry this gospel from wherever i can to let the people know and you know whatever happens to me it happens to me but you know it's all for the grace of god and it's amazing that all the things that he went through but you know he counted all glory to god and it wasn't it wasn't that he wanted to build a name for himself or or anything like that but he wanted he wanted to show people that that you know all the things that he had been through what this is my testimony this is what god's brought me through you know and that's the way it is you and i we we can raise up and and be great in the sight of god and great in the kingdom of god and do the things that are god that god has called us to do you know if we god has called us to do the greater works then the greater works is to believe on them that that he has sent you know that he has called these people you know and it doesn't matter if you know your left hand from your right hand or if you know up from down or if you know anything but if you know jesus christ if you know jesus christ in the new birth if you know if you've been born again if you've been sealed in to the body that's all that matters it doesn't matter if you know anything else because many people they want to know you know that you know they get so wrapped up in so many other things but you know and and we we see so many people that that when it comes down and we see people that that have gotten to this place and you know if if you can just wait on god if you can just be humble enough before god that god can reveal to you this word and that god opens up many people say well you know you know what brother i'm speaking on the trial and you know what he was talking about you know they come doing well you know i waited long enough you know i waited this many days x number of years and everything god ain't never done this for me ain't never done me he ain't never healed me ain't never well you know what you still got to wait you need to tarry you need to wait on god it did god didn't say but you know what it becomes when you humble yourself many times people waiting on god to do something the problem is is they've not humbled themselves they've not got humble enough and you know just like brother branham was talking about when the angel of the lord came to him that time and he said he said well if you will be humble and sincere he said he said nothing will stand before you not even cancer he said you but you know what the angel lord came back to him and told him he said you need to be more sincere well you know what he didn't he didn't get a birthday angel and say what am i supposed to do now he said lord let me be more sincere lord let me be more sincere lord help me to be what i need to be that i can be more sincere if the angel of the lord is telling me this is what i need then lord show me what i need to do that's what that's what i want to do i want to be more sincere i want to be more humble before you that i can do the greater works that i can do what you have us to do because god wants us to be you know to fulfill what we have and that should be our desire because that's what god's desire for you god has a plan and a purpose for your life god has a plan and purpose for things for you to do and you know many times people say well you know i i don't know what i'm supposed to do people worry about you know well you know they say well you know if you know sometimes people think you know if you're not a preacher you know if you're if you're not if you're not a deacon if you're not a song leader if you're not you know one of these jobs you know they wonder what are you supposed to do and you know it's like where am i supposed to you know where am i what you ought to do is be a light to the world when brother brahm talking about knowing what the fullness of the word is he said you know it's it's the light to the world when you get up and you and you go to your work and you and you go to school and you live the kind of life before people when you realize that you're not of the world and people realize you know what there's a change in this person and you're going to school and you're going about or if you go to work and you know what you're not like everybody else and people can look at you and tell there's something different about you when people say well you know uh is he is he a christian well i don't know i guess so he goes to church but you know it's not that kind of thing it's when people get around you and they realize you know what there's something different about you there's something different because they know it when they get in your presence you know why because if you've been in the presence of god then you know what when people get in the presence of you they ought to be in the presence of god too they ought to know there's something different about you they're standing there like you know i you know i feel different when i get around him and you know there's people you know they they get around you and they realize you know what i don't want to say certain things when i get around them you know i i catch myself when i why because there's something different about you but you know if they go along and they don't know you you know from anybody else and they don't see any change they don't see any difference then you know that's not showing the light to the world and you know and maybe you know many times it's it's not just on the outward appearance that that people are looking for you know that they look and say well you know what you know you live a certain kind of life you dress a certain way well that that's good if you can dress holiness but you know the thing is there's people that get around you see people that are dressed holiness and when you get around them you know what they got enough timber to fight above saul you know they're just just as sours as brother ernie always says look like they were baptized in pickle juice you know they just they just so sour whether the bible tells us he said the joy of the lord is our strength and he said you know he said that's one other thing one of the fruits of the spirit is to have joy you know the thing is even david said lord return unto me the joy of my salvation you know if you know because you know you don't always have to look like you look like you've been eating green persimmons you don't always have to look like you know look like you lost your dog and all these type things and people worry about you know when they go on one because you know what if he's living on the inside of you if the whole if the spirit of god is living on the inside of you then you know what it should change your your atmosphere it should change the way you look the way the way you speak to people everything should be different in your life it shouldn't be any of the old ways it should be you know because people ought to see jesus christ as the old that song years ago i always always liked it and it says when they looked they beheld him when i spoke they could hear him when i walked my every footstep led them all to calvary he said let others seek worldly fame but when someone speaks his name let them say they saw him in me that's what i that's that's my desire can we be humble enough to allow him to live that it's no longer i that live now but it's christ living in me i want to be great in the kingdom of god but you know what it's not that i want to be greater than somebody else it's not it's not that i'm trying to you know i'm trying to get you know i'm trying to reach a higher level than somebody i want to reach the position that god has for me that's greatness god do what god calls you to do and if we can be just what god wants us to be you know because the as paul said you know he said all the body has to fit together you know he said there's hearing and and they're seeing and and all the different parts but you know even even the uncomely parts have have honor you know and even more honor and you know all these different parts why because it's part of the body it's all works together and we all have to work together and you know what you're not god's not god's not perfect he's not complete without you and you know what we're not complete without you god we all have to work together we all have to do our part i and you know it's it's a desire that i have but i i want to to all of us to get to the place let's be you know because you know any anybody that gets up it's just like praying you say you can't you can't pray enough well you know what you can't be humble enough you know as you go along you know you say well you know i can always be more humble why because the we're still fighting the old man we still fight him every day but i want i want him i want to live the way he wants me to live amen amen god bless you now let's saw stainless let's sing that today i want to live the way he wants me to live i want to give until there's just no more to give i want to love yes love till there's just no more love for i could never
