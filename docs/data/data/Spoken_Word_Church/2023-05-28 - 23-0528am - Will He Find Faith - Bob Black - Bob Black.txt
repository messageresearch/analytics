it's it's good to hear stuff like that right there that that uh I just have to throw some roses out that was that was wonderful now uh y'all just remember brother Wade and Louise going to uh Ministry at brother Martin's this morning brother Ryan already mentioned that and uh and uh sister June doing well and I saw the pictures and everything of the little birthday party and everything so she that's wonderful to see her up and doing and and uh brother Ryan mentioned my dad so let me talk about my dad you know I I I I I I mentioned on the little chat that my my dad had my mom was out in the out in the yard and and she noticed that he's his face side of his face was drooping and he wasn't able to respond to her questions and looked like something something was happening so she took him to the ER and you know everybody was real worried and everything but um we certainly thank everybody for your prayers what happened was when he got to the hospital you know that he wasn't able to answer the neurologist questions right and everything but um prayer got to working and something began to happen because the next day he he was fine they did an MRA MRI and I'm not just trying to you know exaggerate or nothing I they did an MRI and he they said that he got the brain of a 30 year old they couldn't find any kind of evidence of a stroke or anything in his brain um they you know they're telling him you know he just needs to stay on some blood thinners and things but as far as you know that's that's concerned everything looks fine and you know I think we've been we've been seeing a lot of things lately God moving on the scene and testimonies and it sure is good to see evidence of Faith working and I sure I just I just can't thank God enough for his goodness to us so at this morning I want to talk to you about Willie Find Faith because we've been kind of studying in Sunday school about faith and uh you know to think about that question will he find Faith so before we read in Luke chapter 18 verses 1 to 8 let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord we're so grateful to you Lord that to wait to know that we have a God that answers back that responds to our faith in you that you didn't just give us a word that'll fall to the ground and return void that you gave us a word a gospel that will do something and you promised us that it will accomplish his purpose Lord Jesus if we'll just let it fall into the ground of our heart it'll come up and it'll produce something that'll produce a change in her life it'll produce healing in our bodies it'll produce a sound mind and joy in our life Lord God and I pray Lord that you're just Lord let your word go forth to your people and minister to whatever the needs that they have this morning Lord you know all of our needs Lord you know what we have need of Lord Jesus and I pray God it is the word is spoken that it'll be Lord you'll have Liberty Lord among Among Us and just build our faith up Lord to the place where we can believe the promises that you have given unto us that are laying here in this word Lord in this in this Bible that we all claim to believe Lord Jesus build up our faith we ask granted Lord did you just be with us this morning Lord Jesus be with all of your Saints be with the the brother Wade and brother Louise they're ministering for Brother Martin or this morning I pray God he shall give them a special outpouring a special blessing this morning Lord granted Lord that you'll just be with us Lord in this house we pray in your name amen now I'm gonna just try to take it slow this morning in Luke chapter 18 and verse 1 to 8 let's just meditate on these words as we read it says Jesus gave this little parable and he spoke a parable unto them to this end that men always to pray and not to faint saying that was in City a judge which feared not God neither regarding man and there was a widow in that City and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and he would not for a while but afterward he said within himself though I fear not God nor a guard man yet because this Widow troubleth me I will avenge her list by her continual coming she weary me and the Lord said hear what the unjust judge saith and shall not God avenge his own elect which cried day and night unto him though he bear along with them I tell you that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth he may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now you think about that this morning brother Brown said when when he was explaining this scripture he said that you know God's not looking for to see who's coming to church or who's real religious and he kind of went down through the list of all the different things that what God is looking for is Faith and to think about this morning that that if you really want to please God that just show him your faith let his let your faith be observable to God that's that's the really the thing that makes God happy when God speaks a word out and it falls into the good ground of your heart and you say I believe that I believe that it's you see that's what that's what we come to church for that's what we gather together to hear the preaching of the Gospel to stir up our faith to a place where we say you know what I I do believe I believe that God cares about me I believe that I believe that these promises that he told I believe that there's healing that's laying in the Bible and I believe that this promise that God made is for me oh you see that's what with something when you really begin to glue lay claim to God's promise something begins to work and you think about this this story that Jesus is explaining about this woman that that she something that happened to her in her life maybe maybe we'll say it like this maybe maybe just put it in present day maybe her Joy got stole maybe somebody stole stole some of her lands her possessions something something maybe if we'll say maybe something that God had promised to her maybe some you know she she had a possession that that her that had been passed down through generations and that was hers and somebody come in and stole it from her and she had to go before the judge that she was saying it was mine and somebody stole it you got to pay you got you got to make it make this right and it was a in the story it's an unjust judge a judge that's sitting up there that didn't know God and doesn't doesn't know doesn't care about man doesn't care about maybe this little widow woman that's that's got this real problem but to think now that this widow woman that would come and would implea implore you've got to make this right that God is saying that if we'll come with that same kind of a confidence the same kind of a confidence coming to God if if that unjust judge if that unjust judge would make it right just to get that woman away to make her go away what will God do to to to to to somebody that comes with confidence that he's going to fulfill his promise with faith in his word how will God reward that you only to think about that God Jesus was was telling us this story to stir up within us to stir up within us that we should have confidence to know that God will reward will reward our faith isn't that what Paul was saying there in Hebrews 11 that that you've got to have faith in God you've got to have faith that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him you've got to have confidence that if you need something from God that he will reward you I I want to say this morning maybe it may be somebody's maybe maybe you you aren't able to pay your bills you got to have confidence that God will come on the scene and and work a miracle in your life you've got to have confidence that's the kind of faith that we can have oh you go back and listen to that first message that brother Brown ever preached the faith is the substance and he laid it out how strong that faith faith if you really know what faith is faith will take an obstacle and move it out of the way faith if you've got great big old faith that might start as a little Mustard Seed but you let it grow up big enough faith faith faith it will move move any obstacle out of the way you got a problem at work it'll move it out of the way you got a problem in your family it'll move it out of the way faith will overcome any obstacle now the question that Jesus is asking there nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth oh you think about this morning now that God God is watching this congregation God he's he's moving just like in those meetings when brother Brandon was speaking now of course certainly we don't we don't compare at all to the ministry that brother Branham had but yet we're preaching the same thing that he preached and in his ministry that the pillar of fire would move over the congregation and move and he'd say there it goes and watch it and I believe within my heart that what that Pillar of Fire was doing was watching for Faith where can I find somebody that will believe the words that are being spoken where can I find somebody that'll that will believe when all in the world all that Pentecostal age all the denominations turned their head and said we don't want nothing that you've got but yet there were little people sitting out there in that congregation that said I'll take it I'll believe it and that's what the pillar of fire was looking for that's what God is looking for this morning I I was I got a the privilege to talk to brother William and he was here in my home and and we got you know you're just sitting around talking and we were talking about how that in many meetings that they've been in and many many people many ministers have began to notice while they're preaching the gospel they'll be an angel standing on the platform you see this we're preaching a supernatural gospel where God is still manifest in the in the meeting and that they would say he asked he had the privilege to ask a brother when you looked over there and you saw that angel standing on the platform watching the people as you were preaching with his arms folded and listen it's this happens frequently I just want to stir up your faith this morning but he would say what would the angel be doing and he said watching the people now you think this morning that there could be Angels moving down the aisles this morning watching you watching you to see what's going to happen one time he was he he said he was at a meeting and there was an angel a brother nudged at one brother and he said look there's an angel over there and he looked and there was an angel on the platform and the angel was standing there watching the people and he stood there until the preacher happened to move over where the angel was and then the crowd just erupted because the Angels there to recognize your faith the Angels there to do something God is looking to see if there's anybody that wants to believe him and he could be standing here this morning and looking to see if there's somebody that will take him at his word up don't you realize that morning this morning that if you believe if you have faith in what God promised something will happen that your healing could be manifested in your body or you say well it's just for your dad it's your dad's the only one that can be healed if you see one person being healed it can happen to anybody if you see one person receiving the Holy Ghost you could claim it oh that should stir up our faith to believe well if somebody if that person over there can get it why not me oh without faith you cannot please God that's the only way to please God or you say well I'm I've gotta I've got a good track record for coming to church I've showed up my attendance streak is really good I've been here for the last 40 years and I've been here but but without faith you can't please God without faith your attendant streak does not mean nothing to God without faith your your tithe pain doesn't mean nothing to God without faith you're paying the parking lot and painting the building and putting shingles on the place and maybe even helping people not do nothing for good doesn't mean nothing to God without faith you cannot please God faith is the only way that you can please God oh you've got to believe God's word oh there's some benefits tied up in this oh there's some benefits that you can reap by believing God's word if you believe he's still a Healer you can be healed if you and I'm not just trying to trying to excite you I'm trying to stir up your faith because brother random sin oh he said if you can have faith as a mustard seed you can move a mountain and if a mustard seed faith will move a mountain there in faith is the substance he said how much little less Faith would it take to move that little bracelet hanging there in the room if you've never read that sermon before I I encourage you to do that he's talking to that little sister there in the room and he said if you got you say you've got all Faith well move that little bracelet that's hanging there and he he moved and concentrated on it and moved it and she said how did you move it and he said he said she said who who moved that was it the devil was it God he said no I moved it now you didn't think think that your favorite see that just go goes over our head to think that faith is so powerful that your little faith your faith can move an obstacle your faith can change something and he said if faith is a mustard seed could move a mountain how much little less Faith would it take just to move something like that oh to think now that he said if you're a pocket knife hitting in your pocket faith will put it there and that stumbles us now that stumbles us but it it's yet it's true because the prophet we believe the prophet don't we we believe the prophet y'all don't draw up on me now we believe the things that he said is true faithful faith will do something Hebrews 11 6 says but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is what a rewarder of them that diligently seek him now that's what we fail to recognize sometimes that God will reward our faith now you think about this little this little woman in this Parable the little Widow that that she didn't have a husband that she could turn to and do go to battle for with it with the judge but she just come up there by herself and started troubling the judge and telling him I I I've lost something out to see if this morning if you've lost if you've lost your joy you just believe that God will give you back and he'll give it back if you this morning if you've lost your children if the devil has taken away your children you believe that God will give them back to you you see I remember Ron Spencer preached one time he preached a sermon take back it's time to take back where the devil stole and I think we can have confidence with Faith by faith that if the devil's taking something from you that you've got a right to go and claim what the devil stole from you you've got to write like this little widow woman to come and and making them make your appeal to the judge make your appeal to God and say come on the scene for me I need you to come on the scene now God will reward a little if an unjust judge will reward a little winner woman that is an aggravation what about a real child or daughter of God that comes by face believing in a god that is touched by the feelings of our infirmities believing in a God who is the heartbreast of our confession oh you should have confidence didn't Paul tell us to come boldly come boldly to the throne of grace recognizing that we've got somebody that's a help to us brother Brahman he said he said in accepting God's provided a way of the end time he said cry for your knees that's God's provided away I didn't Jesus explain it when he said the unjust judge to the woman that cried day and night how much more will the heavenly father give than the spirit who cry out for it day and night oh my you think now this morning and if you're if you're if you're seeking deliverance from the things of this world you've got to promise that God God wants to give it to you more than you want than you want it if you're seeking the new birth and everybody's telling you and the devil's telling you it's too late for you to get it you just keep knocking keep seeking that's what he said seek keep seek and not keep knocking just keep on till he opens stay out with it cry until the promised word is Vindicated then you got it you don't have to worry no more you see the Bible promised it then stay right there and cry until you get it now now that's what our problem is we back off from the promise we come to church and we just kind of get into our little State we feel like we're we're doing our our weekly uh we like I think it was William or somebody said checking it off our list but and and we failed to just press into the promise oh if you could recognize that if you press if you persevere God will give it to you to think about that now whatever whatever promise you can find laying in the Bible you you got to have something to base your faith on and what we base our faith on is the word of God so if you can find it in the word lay in there you persevere until you get it like Abraham he just kept pressing on believing believing for 25 years that God promised him a child that God promised him he'd be the father of Nations that God promised him his seed would possess the Gate of their enemy and he just pressed on through all that oh you think this morning that God gave you that same promise that his seed will possess the Gate of their enemy so you got that same promise so whenever you see the enemy's gate coming up against you you press on and say oh maybe in your little prayer closet you say oh God you're the one that made the promise you made the promising you've got to make a way and Faith begins to go to work something begins to happen something begins to move you begin to call upon God and say I know you made the promise for my children I know you made the promise I got something wrong in my body I need it I need healing I need a touch from you so that I can preach your gospel that I can serve you so that I can be a real testimony of what you are and who you are shout them begin to go to work oh you got to persevere Church you got to press in press on to the mark of the high calling in Christ this kingdom is taken by force not just a little haphazard not just a little well I'm just going to go to church and that'll be it but you got to press on brother bear said when you hear that God made a promise [Applause] when you hear that God made a promise be persevered to see it come to pass oh how many of us could say it you don't have to raise your hands but just think inwardly how many of you know that there's a promise laying there in the Bible that you want to see come to pass you want to see it come to pass and maybe you've just backed off from that promise and you said well maybe one day it's going to happen but oh if we could just really we just push forward and say God I I want to see it now I want to see the healing in my body I want to see I I know that you're the one who made the promise brother I'm said job look at job when he was afflicted soars all over him he was all in the plan of God but job too was persevering because he know that he was keeping God's word nothing was going to bother him oh you think about that little woman that Jesus called a dog he's he said I'm sent to the children of God and you're nothing but a bunch of dogs but he said you know Faith she held on she was persistent persevered oh that's what perseverance does when somebody says something wrong to you when somebody somebody said something to put a block in front of you but yeah you know you read it in the Bible somewhere and you're just going to persevere and hang on to what God Said oh listen all of us we look back in our spiritual journey you look back to when God gave you the Holy Ghost that's my testimony when I was seeking the Holy Ghost people would tell me that I couldn't do it if I wasn't in this person's specific genealogy or that was all these reasons why it wasn't for you laid reasons down before you but you look into the word and you claim it with perseverance recognizing that if God made the promise he's able to fulfill it the whole thing about little David that he was anointed by Samuel and and he knew that he wasn't going to die he knew that if God had delivered him from The Lion and from the bear that he was more than able to deliver that Philistine that uncircumcised Philistine into his hands and he went forth with perseverance with faith faith knowing that that same God that was with him with the lion and the bear was going to be with him when he fought the Goliath and brother Brown said he grabbed up his little slingshot and went and brought that sheet back by killing the lion why he was persevering he killed slew Goliath because he was persevered you got to be steadfast you got to be persevering you got to take your faith and claim what your god-given right is take your faith and hold it up over the over what God Said and lay it out there and James chapter 1 it said James said blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial for when he has stood the test he will receive the Crown of Life which God has promised to those who love him in James chapter 5 said behold we consider those blessed Who Remain steadfast you have heard of the steadfastness of job and you have seen the purpose of the Lord how the Lord is compassionate and merciful oh you you got to you got when you see a promise of God you grab a hold to it and you just lay claim to it and say God this is mine Hebrews chapter 10 said for you have need of endurance so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is Promised oh to think about that endurance now endurance is that that mundane that brother Louise was preaching about on Wednesday night the mundane that that that slowed slog up the statue of a perfect man well you're you're yoked up to the ox you're under the ox anointing and you're going up and you're just you're going through endurance you have need of endurance Paul says so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised that slog like like like Abel when he brought his sacrifice up there but just believe even believe in that God would come on the scene and accept his sacrifice coming coming with his faith believing that God will come on the scene and God accepted it went by fire in First Corinthians chapter 15 it says therefore my beloved brother is be steadfast and movable always abounding in the work of the Lord knowing that in the work that in the Lord your labor is not in vain oh that's that's an encouragement to any preacher to know that their labor is not in vain many times we preach and preach and not see seems like nothing's really moving but yet something's working because the word will have an effect in people's lives many times you don't see it many times it looks maybe maybe it may be disappointing but there's an encouragement in the words that to be steadfast and movable knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain in Galatians chapter 6 verse 9 says and let us not grow weary of doing good for in due season we will reap if we do not give up oh you think about how many times in the Bible Paul and all the all the apostles encouraged us to not give up to just keep pressing on to just keep pressing on toward the mark of the high calling in Christ and not grow weird don't grow weary of saying good things to other people don't grow weary of coming to church don't grow weary because in due season the fruit is going to come up it's going to produce it's going to ripen it's going to produce a harvest in Romans chapter 5 verses 3 to 4 we rejoice in our sufferings knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope oh you've got to endure you've got to endure to get the prize I was talking to my brother at work he's been running those uh he's been running marathons recently I think I mentioned that before but he he you know he just to talk to him about running America the ultra marathons like not not 26 miles but like 50 miles through the woods or whatever running through the dark in the middle of the night and you got to have endurance then that's why Paul said to run this race run this race well you start you start off the race but in the middle in the middle of the night one time he actually did that he got tired and he just pulled off and he said after about 30 miles he said I I'm done but you see God don't want us to be that kind of a Christian to just get get halfway and just say well I'm done I can't go anymore but you got to persevere press on toward the mark of the high calling in Christ press on press on toward what we get we get seems like sometimes we'll get weary and tired about what we're doing here what are we doing here we're pressing on for the Capstone pressing on to the to the unveiling of the Seven Seals to give us rapturing Faith so don't just cabbage down and say well I got it all I'm I'm good but press on why because faith faith wants the outcome faith wants a body change faith wants to see God do something in your life and Hebrews chapter 12 Paul said therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside also every way and sin which clings so closely and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us looking to Jesus the founder and Perfecter of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the Throne of God oh you think all these promises lay in here about somebody that will seek in Luke chapter 11 he said I say unto you ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for everyone that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth unto him that knocketh it shall be open I wonder if we could ask that question this morning just down in our hearts if if there's something if if you want a further revelation of the of the of of this of the message have you asked God for it have you sought God for it or if you just kind of come to church and said well it's good enough for me to be here it's good enough for me to just check check it off my list but if you got along with God and said God I need to know I I you know I going along my Christian Journey I've seen people cry and get all frustrated because they don't understand Daniel 70 weeks and get all frustrated and you know that I think that's a good thing I think that's a thing that should be encouraged we should we should want it so bad that we we cry when we don't see it because that's somebody that'll get to Knocking you get to to knocking on the door of Christ getting on the on the door get knocking on the door of his promises and God there's God said he would open it up to you now he said now if you notice it isn't just Lord I want it he that asketh seeketh keep on seeking keep on knocking just keep on on you've arrived there so just keep on knocking till it happens I believe it Lord I'm on your hands I'm on your hands oh if we could just be persist persistent be persistent like Ruth who said I'm not going back where I came from I'm not going back I like I like what brother Louise said on Wednesday night I'm not going back I'm going forward I I I I I'm going on David persisted with when he went got to Goliath shamgars find the promise of God that the land was for him and he he grabbed up that Ox goat and who went after his promise because he persisted with by faith believing that God is the one that made the promise Abraham going on for 25 years persisting and Moses who who 40 years through the Wilderness persisted to believe God's word and and to find that promise all these promises that we're laying here all these examples of great faith people that would would persist and believe what God had said brother said just keep on knocking just keep on seeking just keep on on and Luke chapter 11 if a son shall ask any bread of you that is a father will he give him a stone or if he ask a fish will he for a fish give him a serpent or if he shall ask an egg will he offer him a scorpion if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him what's Jesus doing building up our faith oh you see that's what happens as the preaching Goes Forth it something begins to stir within your soul to know that God cares about you think that God cares about you you might have got to a place in your life where you think well God just don't care about me anymore but God still cares God still cares about that gift in your life to minister to the church he still cares about that gift in your life to play the piano or to sing songs he still cares and he ain't forgotten about you he cares about you and if we could if our face could just be built up to recognize that we've got a God that will reward our faith that he cares about us we you've got a God that answers prayer to think about that when you get it down on your knees your prayer is not in vain that there's somebody that listens and hears and will answer back that's why the Bible says pray without ceasing pray you praying will do something praying will accomplish something you get down on your knees in faith or pacing around like the Bible says I stand praying whatever whatever way God will reward perseverant faith Jesus is saying God rewards perseverant Faith but will the son of man be able to find anyone that believes that oh you think about this morning we got a lot of people that come to church you got a lot of people that congregate around Believers I got to read a thread online a message thread of just people talking about all the all the different churches that they've been to just denominational people seeking seeking a good church to go to and you you think about think about the condition of the world that it's gotten into where churches now they've got light shows and and fog machines and I I was reading one person said they went to a church and it was a woman preacher got up and they just read real quick a scripture and then they looked like they had like an advertisement playing on the screen and nothing nothing really pertaining to God at all and that's what this the God of this evil age is calls that's why Jesus could say back then he said when the son of man comes will will he find faith is he going to find somebody that believes now oh you elevate that on what what's God looking for in this day God is looking for somebody that where the faith the faith has been built up built up from Luther's preaching and Wesley's preaching to the Azusa Pentecost to brother random is preaching to restore us back to the original Faith the original faith of the apostolic fathers to believe the word for their age that's what God is looking for in this age somebody that will believe what he's saying somebody that will believe that we're going to take a body change somebody that will believe what like brother Ryan was preaching this uh talking about this morning that that that the statue of a perfect man is not out of our reach that God has given us the recipe for these things he's given us the recipe to come into perfect Oneness perfect Unity with him oh God wants to see our faith God wants to see us God wants to see us enthusiastic about the word excited about the word wanting to see the word made manifest in our life not just tired about it not just all drawn up about it and saying well I'm just going through but if you've got as Jesus said if you've got faith as a grain of mustard seed ye shall say unto this mountain remove hints to Yonder place another place he said if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say to this sycamore tree be thou plucked it by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you Now isn't that the same thing brother Ryan will say and what he said if you got faith you can move you can move the little thing hang in there in the room if you've got faith it'll put the pocket knife in your pocket now how many of us have testimonies that we can relate to and say I remember when that was manifested in my life I remember I remember brother in South Carolina brother Al Arnett talking about him and Pat Tyler were riding on the road and they lost their keys and they prayed they leaned over the hood of their car they said we need our key and they asked God to give them their keys back and they they raised up from off the hood of the car and the keys were sitting there right where they had been praying how many of you have the same kind of testimony where you lost your keys or you lost your wallet and you prayed and Faith what was it Faith put it there no you see you think it's out of your reach but you believe and you've got your own testimony where God did the same thing you believe oh oh you you have a need in your body and you believe you're sitting there in church and as the words going forth is being preached and Faith takes a hold and something happens and you get up and your backache's gone and you get up and your kidney problems gone and you get up and your kidney Stone's gone because what faith took a hold faith will do it now Faith just is a grain of mustard seed can move a mountain now brother Brown said he'd say now you start off you might start off with just a little Mustard Seed of Faith but you keep what do you keep adding you keep adding the word and it'll keep growing oh how many don't have to raise your hand but how many wants your faith to grow this morning how many would want your faith to grow so I I want to encourage you this you got this little Mustard Seed Faith this morning it don't have to stay a little Mustard Seed but you know if you that's if that's all you got mustard seeds faith will accomplish a lot just a little Mustard Seed Faith if you just keep hanging on and hanging on eventually you're going to see that mountain move but if you've got great big faith in the mountain will just move right out of the way must you see your little Mustard Seed Faith now brother Brown said this it'll grow into a marble and then it'll grow into a grapefruit and then it'll grow into Mountain sized faith and now we got to have faith he said you you ain't even hardly got faith to see a toothache healed but you got to have faith for a body change so we got to have a great big amount of faith we got to have faith to overcome all these obstacles I I want to encourage you if you maybe you're struggling with faith to see a toothache healed that that there's let me encourage you that there's a promise in the word that all things are impossible it doesn't matter if it's kidney stones it doesn't matter if it's a toothache let's get all these let's get all this reasoning out of our mind see as soon as you start going to preaching along these lines people start the reasoning you start talking about what Paul Paul wasn't healed for this and I remember what brother Brian wanted to heal to the squirrel and all this kind of stuff let's cast down reasonings and just look to what God's word says it doesn't matter if you've been sitting on your sickness for years and years and the devil's got it in your mind that you just got to deal with it you just got to sit on that you just gotta you just that's just the way it is but yet there's a promise in God's word laying there that we've got to come to we've got to come to the place where we can believe that we can believe like brother Branham did the little fish he did fell over there and he spoke about their life that Hattie rice children were laying over there laughing in the corner and the word the faith came into the room and Faith had an effect to bring those children back to her that's our problem reasoning goes to work that's what the statue of perfect man is to cast down reasoning the word will get rid of all of our reasoning until our spirit completely lines up with the soul the faith that's down on the inside of our heart that's why if you really see what faith is like like that quote brother Ryan was was saying if you really see what faith is it's an impartation of eternal life from you from God himself to you that starts your journey at the bottom of the pyramid faith faith the faith that I have the the life that I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God faith is what God has given you as part of the new birth it's his faith it's his life in you his life in you to believe the word until they claim to the word that's why you've got to be born again because without being born again you can't have that kind of Faith you might have a little bit of faith for the time like the Believers in the Old Testament Faith to just kind of get get a quick Glimpse at what God wanted them to do but faith that comes with a new birth is God himself in you believing his word to see his word come to pass in you oh that's why it'll produce a miracle in your life that's why it'll change you that's why it'll change your nature or to change your thinking as as we'll get to this afternoon when I'm I'm gonna talk about Oneness brother Adam said that when Eve listen to The Devil's lie it changed your thinking what will the word of God do to you it will change your thinking it will change the way that you act so that you love your brother and love your sister and it'll change you because what is it faith is having a an effect and be not afraid to desire Brotherhood said why did he say that about must receive Faith you cannot hybrid mustard it won't cross with nothing you can hybrid kale get rapes blood and so forth but you can't hybrid mustard it won't cross no sir it's genuine mustard and if you got great big Faith a miracle will happen but if you got just a little bit of faith and this genuine Mustard Seed watch it bring you right on through every case bring you right out why cause must receive Faith still believes that God is still God Amen oh Mustard Seed Faith will lay Hank claim to it must receive Faith oh think about what muster see faith is it's not going to mix it's not going to mix with a reason it's somebody says well I don't know if I think you just lost your heel and I don't think you really got what you you did but Mustard Seed Faith will just it'll hang on because it's not going to mix it's not going to mix with the devil's lie it just hangs on Mustard Seed Faith what does it do it believes that God is still a rewarder it believes that God will reward you oh you say you come you come to God in the middle of the night beside your bed with that kind of faith and you might think well my children are past saving well it just don't matter anymore I've tried and I've tried I've tried and I've tried to be healed and I've went to all these doctors but you come claiming claiming your inheritance with Mustard Seed Faith Mustard Seed Faith can wait patiently and confidently like Abraham for 25 years that's why the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength as long as you wait the more you wait the more your faith builds up the more your strength and the longer it takes the more you believe not the less you believe that but the more you believe and God has given us this morning a recipe for faith and it's laying there in Romans chapter 10. I know this morning this morning is the short lesson so I don't have much longer Romans chapter 10 verse 14 says how then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard and how shall they hear without a preacher how do you even know what to do without a preacher how do you even know what to do without hearing hearing somebody tell you that God made a promise and how shall they preach except they be sent as it is written how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peach peace and bring Glad Tidings of good things are the feet of them beautiful that bring glad tidies some sometimes you know it feels like they're not sometimes you know like brother Brown said he got pulled over by that cop one time and he pulled out his wall and it said he was a minister and that guy got to got to mocking him and God I think this is an age where you should we should be given more respect to the ministers why because they're bringing something to you to help you to get you out of to preach a message of Liberty to get you out of the condition that you're in this this is Aid where we shouldn't be putting down ministers and and making fun of them and putting them under our feet and trying to trying to say we know more about them more about it than them and and the Bible says that the feet of the of a Preacher is supposed to be beautiful the beautiful because it's bringing you something that will help you and so then Paul's goes on to say in verse 17 so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God so if we want more faith it comes by preaching if we want more faith it comes by the word if we want more faith it comes by repetition just hearing it over and over again now I don't know about y'all but but I like I like hearing things over and over sometimes it seems like you know we want to hear the great the next big thing something that'll just knock our socks off but I like hearing somebody just tell me about being born again I like somebody telling me about the stash you're a perfect man why because hearing those things over and over again it builds up my faith it causes me to know praise God somebody else is getting it somebody else is understanding I like to hear I hear kind of things rehashed a little bit why because hearing is connected with your faith maybe somebody will rehash something that I preached a long time ago or brother Wade or something but you you preach it again you say it again say it again in the parking lot many times I've heard somebody say it again in the parking lot and it'll be something that I never thought of and I thought oh God thank you for that why because hearing is what is connected with your faith as you receive it in your ears as you receive it through your through your reading sitting there you're just receiving it in and it's building up something that you can something that you can base your faith on brother Brown said what a beautiful thing tonight for Divine Healing The Promise is given to you by his stripes you were healed what do you think about that by his stripes you were healed it's yours by promise now we have to go in and take it maybe you can't take it all at one time maybe you can just accept it tonight like I said this morning if you wanted an oak tree in your front yard and somebody give you an acorn you've already got the oak tree you've got it in seed form the only thing you have to do is plant that seed it'll produce the tree so as soon as you get the seed you've got the tree that's right and seed for now what was he saying now as soon there's the seed by his stripes you were here by his stripes you were healed and that's preached over the pulpit and you hear that preach by his stripes I'm Healed and you and it falls down in the good ground of your heart and you just you just sit there and meditate on that God you said by your stripes I'm Healed and you start thinking about how all that ties together he died on that cross for me he stretched his arms wide for me all the all the scripture types ties together and he's the one that made the made the sacrifice and you begin to meditate on that that's the seed it's a seed that's planted in your heart and you keep hanging on to that and it's going to come up oh I thank God that we've got a promise like that that you hear every promise of God if you'll just hold it in your heart it's going to come up and he said just as soon faith comes by hearing hearing of the word and when you hear that Jesus Christ is the Healer he's raised from the dead reproducing his life has healed the sick you've already got your healing in seed form oh to think about that now that is the word is being preached you've already got it you hold it down in your heart you've already got it now now you just got to hang on to it hold it hold don't let it go hold on to it until it comes up man it will manifest now there's there's you the recipe recipe for receiving every promise of God that's from the new birth to Healing to Salvation to your children to paying the bills every promise of God you the word is received down in your heart and you just hang on to it you've got the thing you got it just hang on and it'll come up now now bear with me just a little bit just walk through walk through the process of being born again the word you hear the word and you it tells you you need to be justified and you turn around and you start walking a little bit Direction what the word is having an effect on your life the word is is falling down in your heart and you're hanging on to it it's causing an effect in your life the word you keep you keep laying there under the subjection of the word and the word gets rid of that the word that you're holding down in your heart gets rid of that unclean spirit and you begin to come to church you begin to want the things of God and you begin to act different hang around hang around Believers if you want different things and you're you're the the life the life starts to change because the unclean spirit's going out but then that word that you've been packing down in there that word that you hell that promise that promise of the new birth now you've hold held on to it and the baptism of the Holy Ghost can come on that word and Quicken it now that the unclean spirit's gone out now that you've turned around your trajectory has been changed and it'll bring it up bring it and manifest it in your life see if you've got the seed you've got the thing but you just got to hang on to the promise and watch it produce brother Adam said let me plant the word of God in my heart and purpose there that I will not turn to the right hand or to the left hand away from it but I'll live true to it all the days of my life oh we sometimes we think the word the gospel is so complicated but it's just as simple as it's so simple you can preach it to some uneducated people in the jungles of Africa it's just like just like planting a seed in the field you plant you plant the word in the heart of a Believer you find some good ground and plant that seed in there and it's going to come up Let the Holy Spirit move into our hearts brother Brandon said and plant the word let us be the feel that the word will fall in that will bring forth fruits in the coming year Grant it Lord another place brother Raymond said I believe that God has to do the saving I believe God has to plant the word I the Lord says the Bible Isaiah I the Lord hath planted it all water it day and night unless some should pluck it from my hand oh to think this morning that God is looking for somebody that'll hang on to his word like that God is looking for Faith and how do you get Faith by the word he's looking for somebody that will take what he said and just believe it say that's nothing but the truth like had it right Patty Wright got her children to fall over her knees because she just said that's nothing but the truth the word was born and married because she just grabbed hold to the word and said be it unto me according to Thy word the angel spoke a promise over her life and she said be it unto me according to Thy word and now that's that's real Mustard Seed Faith that ain't mixed with no reason of the world there was plenty of things that Mary could have reasoned about she could have said well I'm not married that would have been a big one I'm not married I've never known a man all these things laying there that she could have reasoned about but instead of that she cast down reasoning and said be it unto me according to Thy word God is looking for for somebody that he can get a hold of he's looking for that good ground that he can plant that word in he wants to think that he wants to plant the word and the ground of your heart yes he wants to see you bear fruit he wants to see his promises fulfilled in you and I believe this morning and that's every one of our confession this morning that I want to see God's word fulfilled in my life I want to see his promises I want to see you know you know look at the Statue of a perfect man there's a promise in here that you can have the same kind of temperance that God had that Jesus had the same kind of patience that Jesus had and that that this the recipe is laying here in his Bible to get that same kind of a life you just got to lay under the word and let it have an influence on you you just keep taking in those seeds those little seeds as they're planted the little the little bits of word as they're planted and grab a hold to it and believe it and it will start to have an effect in your life in Matthew Chapter 13 it says that he that Jesus was telling that parable of the sower he that soweth the good seed is the son of man and he said in Luke chapter 8 now the parable is this the seed is the word of God and brother Brown will say every spoken word of God is the Original Seed God planted everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the Original Seed it will breed itself right back and reproduce itself again let's let the musicians go ahead and come forward and we'll stop like there now sometimes like you're watching a wheat plant grow up from the little seed it takes time it takes patience for seed to come up it's Taken 2 000 years for the bride to come to a place of maturity that that the original word the original Faith to be restored back sometimes it takes time patience but that don't matter sometimes it takes time to see something happen in your life and your family's life and your children's life but that doesn't that doesn't matter you just keep holding on to God's word and you'll see it you'll see something happen you love the Lord this morning let's just stand to our feet and just Worship the Lord God wants to see what you believe he wants to see you believe what he promised he wants he's looking for faith all I want to see I want him to see my face I want him to know that I believe his word I want him to see that I accept what he said oh I will shine I could buy your hair [Music] and I was near the Lord [Music] [Music] and now I am no
