uh little spring you know well do you do it for this he said no he don't do it for do you do it for no I don't do it for the deer I don't do it for that he said there's just something inside that pushes me up out of the earth and keeps me pushing up and keeps me pushing up so good to be in the house of the Lord remember if anybody wants to go to Ruth with us Thursday and Friday we'll be there uh for service if none of you went I know a lot of time uh several years we have uh went on Friday together it's it's really an experience to go and and you get to meet brothers and sisters from foreign countries and um you get to um uh as a church we give money but you can give money individually if you want to for certain needs that go up on the screen and it uh helps you to um kind of see that part of the world you know see they're they're part I know a lot of us some of us have went overseas and we're able to see that but the ones that live it they live it every day over there they're sincere in what they do so we're going to be there brother Keith Reed's coming back with us on Saturday morning we'll have 5: to 6:00 we'll have prayer meeting and then from 6:00 to 8 we'll have

yesterday sister June and I brother Jason Jackson is actually preaching at brother Luke Gibson's and I had been brother luk in a long time and I I think we're going to run up there this after the service is over and be with them with brother Jason Jackson that's where the TRS are today they are up there and and fellowshipping with them so we if anybody wants to go you can follow us up it's about an hour drive from here and um they start at 6:00 so if I won't so long winded maybe we'll have enough time so Son of Man part 123 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 3:3 say Jesus answered and said verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and that word see means what understand cuz remember he told the disciples he said the world will see me no more but you'll see me you'll see me cuz I'll be with you even in you to the end of the age you may be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word and then Nicodemus you know looking back in the Old Testament Nicodemus is like how can a man be born when he's old how can I enter back into my mother's womb and be born and and Jesus said verily verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God and we were talking about this this morning that's extremely important that we do it right it's extremely important that we do we we go through justification and we go through sanctification and we go through the baptism of Holy Ghost because you can just you can get born again in one in one city it it's happened uh look at the but now you take people like on the day of Pentecost you said well they just the Holy Ghost fell on those people at the day of Pentecost and they just got the new birth but now remember they had walked with Jesus for three and A2 years they walked with the word the word was justifying them the word was telling them I'm coming hang on a little bit this is not what you're going to get you're going to get the promise we'll read it in just a minute right before he left he laid it out he told him he said go to Jerusalem and you'll be endued with power from on high go there and wait and T all right so he told them where to go where to wait and that he was coming back and of course they the next question they asked him they say are you going to restore the kingdom to Israel they thought he was still going to stay there but see they didn't understand but on the day of Pentecost you know they had a moment to where they're like oh man this is what he was talking about this is when the Holy Ghost is going to come inside and then do the work and we see what happened to him in the early church ages that's why that brother brandham and I got it way over in um where it gets up there the Holy Spirit but brother B tells us he says you know the the Malachi 4 has got to turn the heart hearts of the children back to the fathers well we're talking about what the fathers are doing now what they were doing the faith of the fathers all right taking the Babylon Pentecostal babies that had lost their first love that had went through six Church ages basically and had the word had been eat down by man's Creeds and man's ideas and it was not of any effect as it was in the first church age so that's why brother Ram had a call back Malachi had to call us back that Prophet called us back to those fathers to give us a chance to get the headstone back cuz the headstone we'll read it maybe it'll be next be Wednesday night probably I want to continue on before we key gets here but um The Headstone was rejected why was it rejected it had no power cuz the people took the power away from it the people Satan really Satan wanted to kill Jesus sure he did through the people but he's want to kill him again by killing his influence and that's what he done cuz he told him in the first church days you've lost your first love I mean right there at the beginning and listen they were a powerful Church they had the Holy Ghost working in their life that Silver and Gold Have I None they walked in you know somebody lied against the Holy Ghost they fell dead we want that around well we're going to get it cuz the Bible promised us we'd have an aniz s the fire again so it's going to happen all over again Bible even tells us there'll be a time when the sinner can't even sit here it's hard for some to sit here anyway get to squirming and all other kind of things walk out the door and don't come back and all that other stuff so but Jesus said verely verily I say un you except a man be born of water and of spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so what is the entrance to the kingdom it is by the new birth yes sir by by Jesus Christ no other way not by William brandham everybody with me he didn't come to preach us a new gospel he didn't come to give us a different Bible he didn't come to give us a different way to get born again but yet he's the most misunderstood as far as being born again because they said he taught it several different ways well he never did he always kept it exactly the way it was supposed to be he always you know you hear people they they have that little point or angle that that brother Brown changed a lot in 1963 after the seals broke well the only thing he changed was is the things that he got wrong before he corrected them after he didn't change the way you got born again they say he that he changed way and now it's just you just you know just boom realize who you are you know no praise God on the future home brother randam said now this was after the seals broke and this was toward the end of his life he said I've preached the same message of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost he showed it all the way through the future home showed us how we went through it and showed us how the world had to go through it all right so he didn't change the people changed his idea just like they have now they've changed it to everything in the world but there is a truth somewhere and I hope you find it I hope I find it I'm praying that I'm going to find it I believe we found it but that's for you to decide all right brother B saying you accept a man be born of Spirit cannot enter into the kingdom of God for that which is born of the flesh is flesh and that which is born of the spirit is Spirit look he said Marvel not no come on Nicodemus you're the teacher of Israel and you can't understand this why he didn't understand it he didn't have the new birth he had a Old Testament idea right that's some of our problems now we got people with Old Testament ideas whoops acts 19:1 said he came to pass that while Apollos was at Corinth Paul the messenger to the church age passed through the upper coast of Ephesus finding certain disciples now he didn't just find them he was watching he was listening to them preach cuz he said have you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe well believe what he had to be able to listen to what they were saying he knew there was something missing because they were preaching John's gospel well John's gospel was found during John's age but John's go gospel the door closed he was to introduce the Messiah not to have a Ministry he was a messenger but he wasn't a church AE messenger he was to introduce the head that was his job nothing else right then you come now to where you see that the disciples Paul Peter James John they have the word of God for the hour and they're preaching and then here's Paul with the word with the message of the hour and he's listening to them preaching he says there's something missing here if y'all received the Holy Ghost since you believe and obviously they answered this question they we don't know what you're talking about and that's Pro that's basically what the people when the message of the hour came on the scene even with brother brandom they it had all been eroded so much to where they thought it was just the baptism or as we read this morning it's just shaking of hands or it's or it's you know shouting or speaking you know I mean he comes among the Pentecostals and I know they like they loved him for a Time but when he told them he said look he said speaking in tongues is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost Buddy they didn't like him no more cuz that's what they built their whole Doctrine on their whole Doctrine was built on you speak in tongues you got the Holy Ghost brother Brown told him he said that's not true he taught him the correct baptism the way to get baptized not just only in in in the name of the Lord Jesus but how to get the Holy Spirit baptism all right now listen I'd rather have the Holy Ghost baptism right than my other baptism right if I get my Holy Ghost baptism right I will go get the other one right all right so everything's connected together so brother Brown's talking about that Jesus's first Doctrine I'm going to try to fly through this was you must be born again now why was it you must be born again cuz he was the one that was going to birth them and if they didn't understand him which they didn't and he knew they wasn't going to it's like brother you know he stands there and he says you're not going to get this it's not for you he knew that the word was going forth he knew that the that the anointing was going out and it was not hitting anything during that whole week of the seals he was throwing he was throwing the the most perfect message that had ever been preached the seals were being open and they're just you know sitting there so he said you're not getting it it's not for you sometimes messages are preached and you wonder who it's for right is it my turn Lord must not have been it must have been brother George's turn cuz he really needed it yeah who made you God yeah that was for sister Regina and we find out that I got you we find find out there's so many different meanings that people put to it nearly all churches say You must be born again all right so every church and even every message Church knows you got to get born again but their way of getting born again versus other ways of getting born again sometimes are not the same all right this church here believes that you need to be justified you need to be Sanctified and you need to be all those two to get the new birth not just the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the new birth all right be careful with your terminology cuz remember I'll read you a quote later later on down the road brother Bri said you can have the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell okay on your spirit realm he never said if you had the new birth say John didn't get the new birth John had the baptism of the Holy Ghost he had an anointing Elizabeth had an anointing all right that's hard to explain to people too cuz listen the Holy Ghost was not given to any One Soul I'm even talking about the woman at the well the woman at the well brother Brown said there was eternal life and it sprang up I know those quotes but you got to remember she couldn't get the Holy Ghost in her soul before the disciples there's no way potentially yes cuz remember Jesus before he died he breathed on him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now brother Brown said they did not receive it right then that's right he said that was a promise that they were going to receive it cuz that Holy Ghost listen that Holy Ghost was bottled up inside of that manen and it could not get out until they killed him to release the life to come back on me and you everybody with me on that amen that's the meaning of being born again it's that life coming inside of me not on me and changing my life yes so the Methodist and everybody's got a different way but we know one thing for sure we believe that you got to be justified as we were talking about this morning we got to be Sanctified and then we've got to come to the new birth where there is a new Creator a new creation all right old things are passed away behold all things have become new all right like I said this morning the whole problem is is when we when we get into trouble we want God to change our our at you know around here well start with this guy first that's not yeah well I want I want listen I want a good wife and I want a good job you ought to be born again that's a good not much not you ought to be it's you must if you'll start with getting born again God will help you with all that other stuff all right so like I said before quit trying to do that quit trying to change your world get changed yourself that's right get a new attitude a new thought get a get a get a fire going inside there all right get something that you say man this is different yes sir I had lived this around this message for years grew up in it 9 years old 8 years old all the way up to 18 years old knew it like the back of my hand believed in serp seed I knew that I knew my my problem was at 18 years old is everybody with me and I knew about marriage and divorce and I knew about all those other things but I was just lost as a Goose I didn't get this guy changed if I had got this guy changed it' have been different but I knew the message and I grew up on a Pew a message church this one actually and all those things but that don't mean nothing you must be born again you must be changed from inside out it's all got to start from the inside out I'm going to skip through some of this you know Lord change my neighbor no change me it'll make you see your neighbor different you can never change your neighbor you're still what you were until you're actually born again of the spirit of God still what you were you can suppress it you can push it down you can just like try to hide it but it will get out yes sir that's right whatever you are will come out I'll promise you you're still what you were until you've actually got born again of the spirit of God it doesn't change you now he didn't say the spirit of God didn't he's talking about the Creed and the denomination all that won't change you your Creed joining Church change your idea or your good intentions although as good as it might seem it's still not right there something got to happen the new birth is an experience something that takes place sir and I know a lot of you are wondering you say well well do I have the new birth find an experience I mean a good one not just a good day versus a bad day not just a I got more money than I did last month I must be born again no you got an experience I me well some of you most of you in this building sisters have had children right right right so you know what I'm talking about you know you had that baby cuz you had an experience amen you were there and what did it do it changed your life well I'll say Amen anyway your sisters don't have to it changeed your life start having them yanging change your life so the New Birth the same way if you get born again it'll change your life yes sir it'll make you have an experience and look something that takes place yes nail that thing down I sister Ruth she's not here and she's not feeling good she's probably watching in so she really don't care if I use her for an example I'd use her if she was here anyway but um sister Ruth and I go way back we grew up together and her dad was in this church and she was a little old bitty thing in the church and and I've watched her and and I went away and she kind of floated away and then back and forth and and the other day last year when we were baptizing her you know you can and I'm just going to be I don't know I'm I'm got where I'm like Claude I'm going to be honest with you were we going to lie no I'm going to be honest with you she when when a person looks at you and goes I'm tired I want a change I want something that I can put down and she looked at me out there in the water and she looked at me she said this is it now when she said this is it to me that sounded so different what do they call it a hollow promises we've heard of hollow promises you know promises that don't have anything into it it's just something that you say at the in the moment but when somebody comes to a juncture in their life when somebody comes to a place in their life to where like I said you're sick and tired of being sick and tired she was sick and tired of being pulled this way and pulled that way and push this way and push that way she said this is it and when she looked at me I said I believe you believe that pretty much I don't know I didn't say exactly that but I when I looked at I thought man she really believes this time cuz there's a lot of people I mean come on we baptized people three four five times don't need to but if you'll want it do it but you need to nail her down one day and say look this is it h so she did so that's what I'm saying there's a there's a place in your time in your life where something's going to click it's going to have to amen cuz you got your normal world everybody with me here for a minute before you start going to sleep I'm going to get to you okay you ready we've got our normaly right we got our work we got our kids and husband job blah blah blah right but there is something that you come in here to sit today that there is a small world inside of your big world everybody with me here there's a small world inside of your big world and that small world is the reason you're here not the big world all right You' took a time out of your big world to come into this small world but remember that small world is worth way more than 10,000 of these other worlds all right right 10,000 worlds man that's your your soul so that's what you brought here today you didn't bring your body here cuz maybe your body didn't want to come maybe your body's tired arm hurts everything hurts but you brought your soul here today your soul is what we're talking to your soul is what God is speaking to God is Not speaking to your flesh cuz your flesh only reacts to what that guy that's inside so you brought your little world you brought your little you brought your soul here and if that soul is worth 10,000 worlds then let's talk to it that's what needs to be born again let's don't get an anointing that just makes us feel born again it will not stay that way cuz when you go out into your big world this will dissolve into nothing and it'll become the big world again I may not ever be able to say that again but I said it one time but that's what you got to do you brought your soul here your soul is either what drug you here or Drew you here one of the two ain't that the truth you either wanted to come or you came because XYZ kids especially got drugged to church all my life I was drugged as a kid all my life I drove to church every Sunday every Wednesday but you know what when you get the person inside of you when that reason to come is that you want to listen to somebody tell you about that person that's inside of you to me that's the connection that comes together and it can't come apart see that's what you're looking for you're looking for a something that settle your soul bring you to church get you around Believers and listen we can speak our problems and we can speak our ups and our Downs ain't that what we're here for that's what we're here for to bring testimony or to bring I should have done this but pray for me because this is bothering me this this I have a problem with if you don't have one pray for me I've probably got yours cuz I have them it's called me but the reason we have to be born again because the Bible teaches us that we were born in sin all came same way shaping iniquity come to this world speaking lies then that shows us that our nature look our nature that's the soul our nature was what sinful we're no good to begin with so we cannot claim anything by our shrewdness sincerity and how great we are or how little we are or whatever more we are all together wrong to begin with all right so you can't say oh you can say it but you can't say God made me this way you made yourself that way God didn't make you that way because look God said in the Bible according to Joel I'm going to pour out my spirit upon All Flesh all right I'm pouring it out you either got to receive it or reject it one of the two you you got to make a decision and your sons and your daughters will prophesy old man dream dreams young man see Visions we'll continue through this a little fast and upon the servants and handmades he's not Los leaving anybody out that's right he's going to pour out his spirit so that you can either receive it or you can be deceived and it shall come to pass that whosoever shall call in the name of the Lord shall be delivered for in Mountain Zion in Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the Lord has said in the remnant whom the Lord shall call so there's the Holy Ghost spread out among the whole world yes if everybody now there's 8 billion people in this world now it's one up to 8 billion now there's 8 billion people in this world all 8 billion could get the Holy Ghost today if they'd want it and God would be no less God he'd be more happy than than he is now cuz everybody would accept him but he knows that everybody's not going to all right so now Hebrews 9ine we were talking about Tabernacle this morning there was an actual Tabernacle in the wilderness that God set up that people could come to and the and the uh high priest could come to that would not take away their sins but it would cover them and keep God from killing them it would keep God to where he he didn't couldn't come down through that and kill them that was the covering or the Capo they were covered but God didn't want that God wants children that he can eradicate sin take that old nature out and put his nature in he wants children that act like him Hall and that's what he was heading toward but he couldn't just drop Jesus down I mean why didn't he just bring Jesus in the Garden of Eden you ever thought about that CU Abraham was part of the plan the part of the plan he saw by what for knowledge he saw all these Isaiah everybody had a part to play to fulfill a part of him yes right everybody with me that would fulfill a part of him Abraham what father of our faith Moses you raise up a prophet Prophet like unto me all right all the identifications were in the Old Testament prophets the different ones but remember they looked for one to come and Jesus stood there one day and he said the prophets would have loved to have been in this day but now listen he said but a greater is here today I say that the same thing here sure it would have been wonderful been in brother Brandon's day but you know what you'd have been real old and you'd have had a long journey but thank God he gave us an opportunity that we have people like sister C and different ones that was in the that was that could tell us the scenario of what went on while brother Brown was here but you got to catch a message of the hour inside here uh to me it's like it's like brother uh um who was oh brother Tom your dad always say he's them old war stories well everybody likes old War Stories I don't want but I don't want that to be part of my life I want to have my own story all right this is my story this is my song what praising My Savior so I want these things to be brought up present day yes sir so today this is present day amen all right to present day to get born again is what not to go into a temple to go into a physical building and go through one place and go through another place and meet God there that was for one man back in the Old Testament that was for the high priest but the Holy Ghost now though is signifying and using that as we were talking about here this morning that the way into the holiest of all was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing and as I said again there was and if you don't understand it ask a question because there the new birth means means that God took took something out of took the old nature out of your soul and put his nature in all right and that could only be by the releasing of the Holy Ghost the releasing of that Spirit right well in the Garden of Eden God not he released it to Adam he released it to Eve and they were supposed to start the family of God every by with me they were supposed to start the family of God but God knew as brother Brown tells us that God knew when he put them in flesh they'd fall yes but here he is holding savior Redeemer healer he's going to come yes see he sent that first Covenant and they broke it listen he sent his man of the power Adam and he broke it all right and he knew that but he gave him a chance that's right so he withheld that that taking of the nature out and putting the nature of God in to when Christ came on Earth he brought that nature with him everybody with me and that was Perfection he knew that over here they couldn't be Perfection bulls and goats can't per F you all right cuz remember if they' have kept they keep making that sacrifice every year every day who was it Saul uh No Sa um Solomon there was one day when they made so many sacrifices for the people they said you couldn't even number them they forgot how they couldn't even count them there were so many sacrifices made when they dedicated the temple and all that they gathered everybody together and they started confessing their sins and they just started killing Adam animal well praise God we don't have to do that today praise God we didn't have to drag a lamb in the building or a turtle love or whatever it was or a cow and but you brought yourself yes sir Bible tells you to be a what a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto the Lord and that's what God was looking at but he couldn't give it because of sin right but if there had been no sin there had been no savior pretty simple if Adam would have never had a headache there'd been no healer there'd been no need for it but as the need was God had to allow them knowing that plan would work and knowing down through the Old Testament that he could use types and shadows but that he would have to come according to Genesis 3:15 he would have to come and not just get with them get in them cuz he was above them he was with them and then he was in them that's our stage he's in us now it's wonderful if he's above us it's wonderful he's with us I don't want him standing beside me today that's right well that'll make you quiet cuz I can be fooled cuz I'm an individual but if I got him inside of me yeah yeah I got him inside of me see that will make the C there unto perfect where the blood of bulls and goats couldn't where the blood blood of bulls and goats only as brother rown tells us pushes it pushed that sand to Calvary well when he got to Calvary he said lay it on me I'll take it all but remember their position as we were talking about this morning their position was they can't be made perfect without the bride being made perfect first how you going to make the attendance perfect before you make your bride perfect everybody with me the bride's got to be perfect first cuz she's part of him she is him as Eve was part of Adam back in the Garden of Eden so we're just rolling right back to the right back to the same place that we were start that we started from we're just not we're coming by sex now but by sex to get our body here and then by spiritual multiplication to get our soul redeemed that puts the two together and if we if we have to pass away that's this is because of the fall but you can't blame this staying the way it is because of the Fall I'm talking about your soul when I do this I'm talking about your soul the inner being of you the one that the motivator the one that makes you do the things that you do all right that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience so in other words make a sacrifice still a sinner make the sacrifice still a sinner but Christ being made a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect tabernac of what his flesh not made with hands that to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered into once the holy Place having obtained look having obtained Eternal Redemption for us amen he had to get it his body was not Eternal he was not a complete Eternal person right he had a body it wasn't a sinful body but it was made to come into this sinful world to take on mine and your sin and then he was perfected yes and eternal after he come out of the grave Brave you know every person that's ped on is going to do the same thing all those that have passed on folks they're not coming back to do something something something they're coming back with an eternal body their death has done nothing but just put them in a place of holding and waiting till we come to Perfection on this side and when we do they're just going to step over here and we're not going to have to uh speak nothing to them they're done they're complete they're finished we don't have to speak their new body they're just going to come right back into here pick up their body they're ready to go how much more shall the blood of Jesus or Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God and for this cause he is a mediator of the New Testament that by means of death for the Redemption of the transgression that were under the first testament first testament old testament all right they which are called might receive the promise of Eternal inheritance New Testament the New Testament in my blood where a testament is there must be a death of that testator so Jesus stood and he said look I'm the New Testament I'm going to give you this new way remember I've been reading to you brother where Jesus said a new commandment I give you it was all new that's why Nicodemus had a problem with it it was all new that's why listen today if this is all new to you that's okay you must be born again that don't change that but it can be a new way how can you tell the world that just if you're just a good Baptist I mean man you can just you shake their hand and and you sign your name and remembering good standing and you ain't got to go to church no more once saved always saved some of y'all already doing that um but anyway but what about this new way though that we're talking about bring that person and send them in here and say look man you got to be justified well I believed on the Lord Jesus Christ and I was saved you can't and you can't deny that they did but you got to go on with God there's more to that sir there's way more to that yes sir that's a whole new testament to that what we're going to talk about Paul says grow up Desiring the s in milk of the world but then growing on up we're going to get to that going on up this way so we know as brother Bob we were talking about this morning Hebrews 11:39 and these all all that whole Hall of faith in the Old Testament they obtained a good report through faith they receed not the promise listen the promise was you're going to live eternally in a flesh body that is your promise I don't care about no other promise oh yeah there's others there's anointings but if you're not born again if you don't receive the promise that God said you're going to live here eternally in a body that's got Flesh on it and it's your flesh it's not somebody else's Hallelujah see that's another thing you take somebody from a a denomination and you bring them in here and say look man what do you think I'm going to get well I listen I have experienced that I went to church with a guy one time Mark Gunner he just got saved and he was a Baptist and I mean he was just I wish some of y'all had a little bit of that he was just so excited he wanted me to go to church with him and listen to this brother preach well this brother gets up and preach listen this what he preaches on he preaches on when um Samson they made him mad remember Samson had a little bit of a temper they made Samson mad so instead of uh killing a bunch of people he just took a couple of foxes read your Bible he tied their tails together and set them on fire and sent them out through the wheat field well they just burn all their wheat up oh they were mad well he was preaching on that how they God would do that with you you know he'll light the tail of a fox and it through your life and it just burn everything up but we got outside I knew he had a rough voice I've been around smokers all my life he had this Gruff voice you know just it just didn't come from just their mom and daddy it came from camel and Paul mall and and marbor you know the marbor man so he goes out soon as he walks out the door I mean he's you know laying that pack of cigarettes out and he goes to smoking and one of the brothers did say well now and he got the coughing he got the coughing I mean he was just coughing coughing coughing I think Daddy went with me but he was coughing and we were kind of giggling at him he was coughing though he couldn't get somebody was saying something to him he was like you know couldn't get couldn't get nothing but smoke out and somebody said brother I ain't going to call his name but brother so and so said said said you're going to die if you don't quit smoking and this is what he said he put that cigarette in his mouth and he said I ain't wor worried about this body cuz I'm going to get me a new one and that's been probably 15 years ago he may not be seeing that at the moment but that's his whole thing was it doesn't matter what I do with this one in other words somehow it got detached from my Christian experience and I'm going to get this new one God's going to just throw me another one in there because this one I abused no wrong answer Ghost Rider nope no you're attached to your flesh and you going to be with your flesh until you either go to hell or go to heaven but listen that's a Doctrine that's a doctrine that they put on the people that it's okay if you drink a little smoke a little you know cuz this body we're just going to throw it out you know get us another one no the Bible says if you abuse this thing you going to have trouble Hebrews 11:39 said these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise the promise of eternal life in their soul God having some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect but they're going to be made perfect I believe when we come to Perfection wherever they are they're going to come to Perfection too all right so you can fill in the blanks every how you want to I just know there's one thing the Bible says they're not full they not fully matured yet that's what the Bible just said that's right they without us so basically they can't get anywhere without us getting somewhere first and like I said before God has bestowed everything on this bride best of the best best ministers best teaching best message best people to listen best people to talk to best people to fellowship with that's his people that's his bride so he's not going to give a second he's given us first yes sir Peter said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise there's your promise for the promise what of receiving the gift of the Holy Ghost is it to you your children and all them that are far off that's me even as me and the Lord Our God shall call Brother R in Blasphemous names he said look the reason that there's so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit is not correctly taught I believe that the baptism is taught just say baptism just like you say automobile but listen there's a lot more to an automobile than just say an automobile that's pretty much what he was saying cuz look and when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that H see there's a lot goes with that and here is what I think that God is proving he's proving the holy spirit is here what is he saying the holy spirit is saying through brother brandham listen to what I got to say cuz this is the holy spirit talking to you without him puffing up and say you got to listen to me bless God no you didn't have to but it just was the vessel that God wanted to use at the time to get the message to us I think God for that he could have just left us hanging he could have just said hey like what brother R say I'm going to try to find that quote brother R said if I was God I'd tell you one time he said I wouldn't tell you no more I'd tell you one time and if you didn't do what I said then out you go well praise God God didn't do that he's given us 60 something years to get this thing right starting with the new birth yes sir now here's his e therefore saying to the house of Israel thus sayith the Lord God I do this for your sake oh House of Israel but I don't I do not for your sake oh House of Israel but for mine holy name's sake which you have profaned among the Heathen whether you went now that's us and I will sanctify my great name which was profaned among the Heathen which you have profaned in the midst of them and the Heathen shall know that I am the Lord sayith the Lord God when and I shall be Sanctified in you see I didn't get to it this morning but what cleans your uncleanness if I may say it that way when when we get to that scenario where the unclean spirit's gone out of you why something has been hired to come in and clean your house and he's not a hireling I know that but something has come in there's a there's a there's something com in there's Surf Pro or somebody like that has come in you be you become a mess you stink you're full of smoke everybody know what serpro is right when something happens some catastrophe something burns down they come in and man they supposedly put the thing back to where you don't even Smell Smoke and all that stuff well you know what that's God God's my serpro call him up amen say hey clean my house out cuz listen you got to want it yes he's not going to just walk in and say I'm cleaning this out no sir I wish you'd had done it to me 30 something years 40 years ago but it wasn't time cuz he's a gentleman and I had to ask him can you come into my heart can you come and clean me up cuz I'm a mess I've tried I I might have wiped a little off over here or or or dabbed a little over here or or or you know water will clean you a little bit but takes a little soap and scrubbing to get the rest of it off right okay so you try to do that but there's a time when you just say God I'm just a burning mess and I want to get rid of all this so that's who comes in and burns out that unclean Spirit okay all right so the unclean Spirit goes out why cuz something comes in and burns it out but remember it burns it out and then it waits on you it waits on you to decide that that person stays or leaves yes you with me you understand what I'm talking about cuz if not if he leaves then it's empty Bible says and then those Seven Devils come back and they enter into your house all right make you a lot worse for I will take you from among the Heathen and gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land land what is Our Land listen we Gentiles don't have a piece of land amen Israel literally has a piece of land brother George Smith asked me the other day he you know he was up at the at in Tennessee and he asked me he said hey why don't you go to Israel with me I said I said how much is it and he told me you know $88,000 or something like that you know I said George I think I'll just wait and go over there for free he looked at me and I said you know I'll go over there in the Millennium I won't need an airplane ticket I just travel like I thought and I said you know what the MOs of Omar is going to be gone cuz you know it gets blowed up the MOs of Omar is going to be gone really don't care about the thing anyway because it's a Muslim deal and ain't a Christian deal I said so I'll just be able to walk over there and I said I'll promise you they won't be an AK-47 pointing at me either they won't be a Palestinian want to lob a bomb at me so I think I'll just wait and go to the Millennium if y'all want to we'll all just get together we'll have a little tour bus thing we'll just have a tour we'll go through but they literally have a land Israel is promised that square P or not square that long piece of real real estate I'm talking about real land God give them that that's their Promised Land see our promised land is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we take it where we go sir and it don't cost dime to get there and it doesn't cost a dime to have it right but he promised these people of his a piece of property and that's going to be there forever oh eternity that's where the new city is brother R said right then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and your Idols will I cleanse you a new heart also will I give you and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the Stony heart so we started with with a Stony heart take it out of your flesh and I'll give you a heart of Flesh and I will put my spirit within you okay now he's going to give you what right here he's going to give you a new heart and a new spirit that's not the holy spirit all right everybody with me that is your sanctification the justification is the new heart you do get a new we listen if if you knew knew that you had I'm not going to ask for people raise your hands but some people can accumulate parking tickets you know and all kind of stuff so I'm not looking at anybody it's I'm just I'm just not looking at anybody that's got on a pink top that's sitting next to boy um but but we're just family we just confess our sins Regina said leave me alone but you know we accumulate we we accumulate all these things and they're against us and they're against our account and you can't get rid of them you got to go to for a judge right but what about if just going please do this what if you could go before the judge and the judge says what are you doing here what sins are you talking about would that not make you feel so liberated it's sure would boys bank account that's for sure but it would make you feel we're just family and it would make you feel so Li wouldn't it come on if you had this load of debt on you I don't care what it is XYZ parking tickets I you know why I didn't really remember that but now anyway parking tickets debt of your house you know debt of this debt of sin and you know what it don't just come on you it stays on you that burden stays with you all the time espeically parking ticket that you can see the you know the stack stack of like this but you can but you can get free from that amen you can get free from that go before the judge and say I'm sorry if you'll help me with this right here I won't do it no more if you'll help me with this right here but now God forbid if you help if God helps you with this right here and you do it again right I mean we might do other things wrong but when I when I got that load of sin I knew I was XYZ you can put whatever you were XYZ but my XYZ was every I did back 20 years in my in my sinning life but to know that God will not ever remember that again man that ought to perk you up that ought just that just that amen right not the part where he puts the Holy Ghost Inside and makes you Eternal it's just that part where you say God I got this load of debt on me amen and now it's gone yes he gives you a new spirit Hallelujah to be able to deal with it I'll take away your Stony heart I'll take away your debt I'll take away your load of sin than you and although this may be simple but let me tell you something if we can't get down to where we we we know that God has forgive us then what did we what did we' been talking about uh brotherly kindness if you can't forgive Sin from your brother God can't forgive you or your parking tickets or whatever it is God can't forgive you that wow so how liberating is that Lord forgive my brother but Lord as I forgive my brother don't forget me don't forget me I'm standing here Lord in need of something to move forward in my life I need you I can't do it but you can I want something to move me forward in my life I want something for you to move forward in don't let the weight of sin what did Paul tell us the weight of sin that what so easily besets us let us run with patience race it's a lot easier to run without a 50 lb pack on your back amen some of y'all has been in the military boy like brother Andre said I mean he carry a pack and brother Donnie also and some of you been in the military they put a 50 lb pack on you is it 50 50 or more on your back well you've been Sister Sister Mary bless your heart and and boy when that thing has lifted off of you you feel like you can run another 10 miles and and about that high off the ground why because that load's been been lifted off of you let's start unloading remember I told you the quote the other day about the camel brother rown said we load that Camel down so much till it's bowlegged he said unload a Christian supposed to unload listen we're the only ones that know how to unload this world that's why they're crazy they can't unload their burdens it just keeps piling on and piling on and they go over here to get help and that person needs help they they go to this physician and find out that physician needs help he seeing a psychiatrist your psychiatrist is seeing a psychiatrist you're in trouble it's like somebody being a divorce counselor and being married three or four times and I will put my spirit within you here's the key he's going to put him eternal life inside of you yes sir praise God and listen and once he deposits it in there it can never come out he attaches I like what brother Ernie said we have attached oursel to the Eternal we were not Eternal to begin with our soul was dead but by regeneration and by us giving our heart to God and getting that load of sin out and having that thing cleaned out everything cleaned out of us we have asked the Eternal yes to come inside something that's not Eternal and not just not just anoint me brother John but live in me live in me and I believe that's why brother Brown that's why one of the things he came to tell us that he said when your hand mve God Hand move when your foot moved God's foot moved that's how close it is it's not like Jesus is over there and he's controlling everything no he's inside controlling everything working from the inside out he's still working on me and I will put my spirit within you and cause you there's that rotor cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them now that was in the Old Testament according to Ezekiel but praise God that same my stood on the day of Pentecost and came into a group of believer and didn't do away with the Old Testament but brought a new testament in brought Church ages and brought the Gentile age to where now we have a Homeland amen it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost our land is what you're walking in possess ye your soul praise God so justification therefore being justified by faith you got to believe just like I said you got to believe that your sins are gone amen John 3:16 for God so love the the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him shall not perish but have everlasting life do you all know if you read your Bible John 3 is where Jesus says You must be born again John 3:3 when he starts with Nicodemus he gets down to John 3:16 and he just lets her have it he says for God so loved this world till he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life now let me ask you a question brother Brown told us that Nicodemus and Gia never became bride they but they will be given eternal life for their stand that's what it is right there they might not have believed him as as so much as the Savior but they believed on him and they should not perish and they going to get everlasting life for taking their stand Hallelujah with the word of God as much as they can see that's why I said folks we can't we can't say it's me me me foreign no more no there's a lot of people going to make it that you probably didn't think was going to make it and there's a lot of people's not going to make it cuz I'm going to read you if I ever get to it I'm going to read you one where they come up to Jesus and say have I not cast out devils in your name have I not done Mighty works I just weren't a church pew sitter I preached he said depart from me I never knew you you never let me in your soul you let me in your spirit you let me anoint your flesh but you never let me inside your soul you never let me have an intimate relationship with you and boy wow he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God so we know justification we come to water baptism sanctification now this is where he gives you a new heart and a lot of things happen in sanctification that really puts you toward uh brother Bown says you in other words your name is is put on a book all right then remember it's transferred because judas's name was on the book it was erased it was never transferred as we were talking about uh sister Anna had a question about Judas listen the only thing difference in Judas and us is one thing he didn't make it to Pentecost we know that but there's one thing God knew his heart God knew our heart yes and God knew the disciples heart so he made it available in that upper room for those people to go and receive the Holy Ghost and brother Ram said if if if um Judas would have made it to Pentecost he was already Justified and Sanctified by the Lord himself but he didn't go on because God knew his heart his heart was a heart was a deceiving heart it was deception that's what killed him right so anyway sanctification so he gives you a new heart he gives you a new way he brother R says one day sometimes he said you were you become a part of a religious order boy you don't want to stay that people you want to be bride you don't want to be a religious order a religious order will put you in hell 1 Thessalonians says this is the will of God even your sanctification so God wants you to be San listen he won't dwell in a what unclean vessel for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor Matthew 12:43 says when the unclean spirit is gone out of a man we've already talked about that that unclean Spirit wants to come back cuz he feels comfortable we want him to be the most uncomfortable thing sir in the world we you don't want him back listen if you'll take the washing of the water of the word though he won't come back Satan hates the word he hates it he hates the anointing that goes with the pure word of God now I'm not talking about all this other junk but he hates that he can't stand it he couldn't stand Jesus so when the unclean Spirit was gone out of a man he walkth through Dry places seeks W find none then he say I will come into my house see he's even got still control over you my house H from whence I came out and when he come he findeth it empty swept and garnished in other words cleaned up then he goes and takes seven more Spirits more wicked than himself and enters in and what dwells there and the last St of that man is worse than the first even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation John 17:17 says Jesus praying he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou Hast sent me into the world now watch as thou has sent me into the world even though I even also I have sent them into the world right right like I said many times before he he didn't pray that Lord you take them out of the world he's praying to cover them while they're in the world right and for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might be sanctified through the truth 1 Corinthians 6:9 do I need to read these again we every one fit in every one of these such for some of you but you're washed yes amen but you're Sanctified you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God now let's start just for a minute with the birth this is where he says I'll put my spirit wake up I'm not going to say it that low again my spirit and I will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and you shall keep my judgments and do them Matthew 3:1 this is Jesus speaking I indeed baptize you with water into repent no I'm John speaking but there reiterating what he's saying I indeed baptize you with water into repentance but he that cometh after me as mightier than I whose shoes I'm not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost comma and with fire what happened on the day of Pentecost little licks of fire now if we were able to follow that lick of fire because you only got so much commentary that you can write that was written by Luke right Luke wasn't there okay but there's licks of fire over every one of the people well what happened to those licks of fire they didn't just fly out the window they went right down in those people and stayed there and that burning fire stayed with them till they passed away howy you know you got the holy ghost that burning fire that you got when you were born again it's still supposed to be in there John 14:26 but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost now here's Jesus identify who he is and what he's sending and what he's going to do the comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things now that's his job and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you acts 1 verse4 says being assembled together with them commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem this is Jesus but wait for the promise of the Father which saith he you have heard of me for John John truly baptized with water but you shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days hence in other words 11 days from there they received the Holy Ghost when they therefore were come together they asked of and saying Lord will thou also at this time restore the kingdom to Israel they didn't even know what he was talking about and he said unto them it is not for you to know the time or Seasons which the father had put in his own power look but you shall receive power amen dunamus Dynamite power that's a word dunamis right but you shall receive power after after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you yes and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem Judea Samaria the uttermost parts of the Earth let me ask you a question real quick everybody is an individual if somebody were to one onone let's let's just say somebody walked in off the street and he says and he or she says hey how'd you get what you got you say you got this Holy Ghost you say you've got the new birth how'd you get it could you take them in that room and explain to them your experience if you can't you haven't got that experience brother Bram said tell them how your fire got lit well guess what that's how my fire got lit that's my fire Holy Ghost and Fire yes Acts 2 ver4 and says they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave him utterance Acts 19 verse1 here we go again about being Paul he says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe so see as and justification you believe you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you believe that he took away your sins you believe that he took your load off all right then you believed in under unto sanctification that he is cleaning you up cuz listen let me explain something to you that been explained many times before you hear many people sometimes they say I know I'm born again because I quit smoking I know I'm born again because I quit drinking I don't lust I don't do this I don't do that that's not even got anything to do with a new birth nothing no you can quit that and be just as black as s in your soul you can Will yourself to quit smoking right you can Will yourself to do a lot of things but when you know that the person that caused you to do them doesn't have a hold on you anymore that's when you know something's happening that's when you know that you that grip please people wake up for a second listen that grip that whatever that was had on you I don't like it it's a grip and it's got you and you're trying to get away from it it's bringing you back you're trying to get away from lusting or drinking or you're trying to get and it's going it's a grip it's got you all gripped up you ever get a new birth that grip that grip will be gone that grip listen that grip will be gone if you get the unclean Spirit out of you but it's got a chance to come back so you can't say uh well listen to what brother R said you know he said he he said in a sermon he said you know smoking drinking cussing that's not sin remember that woman asked him afterwards come come up to him afterwards and said pray tell brother bandam well I've been told since I was a kid that was sin he said no he said sin's unbelief there's only one sin and why you're the reason you're doing all the XYZ is because you don't believe God strong enough to take it away from you you don't believe you don't have enough faith that that God that you want or might want can't take it away from you how about that are we good I want that grip to be gone Hey listen he's got enough grip on me in the spirit real listen he don't stop I didn't say it went away and it never came back I'm just telling you that thing that kept trying to pull you out it's not there anymore now he may try something else he's a good Devil he's a good Devil he's persistent but if you receive the Holy Ghost since you believed what you believe that's my question to you I'm not asking 2,000 years ago I'm asking you now and they said unto him we have not so much just heard whether there be any Holy Ghost and he said unto them un what were you baptizing and they said John then Paul said John verely baptized with the baptism of repentance now watch he put John in his place John had a Ministry Paul was not denying that John had a Ministry he knew what that Ministry was but he placed it right here all right John verely baptized with the baptism of repentance saying unto the people that they should believe on him which should come after him that is Christ Jesus when they heard this they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid hands on them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them and they spake with tongues and prophesied Romans 5:5 says and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by what by the Holy Ghost which is given given unto us Ephesians 4:29 said let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth Yes but that which is good to the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the hearer and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of your Redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake forgive you 1 Corinthians 2:12 say now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches look comparing spiritual things with spiritual that's what we've been trying to do today all right but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him listen religion was foolish when I was in the world I didn't care it was foolish that people had to go to church and people did this and people did that I come to find out they wanted to for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they're spiritually discerned let's read this right here and then we'll close this is church order 1958 brother Brown says we believe in justification by faith Romans 5:1 we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking and doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies this person for the service of the Lord and that we believe in sanctification according to Hebrews 13:2 12 and 13 where Jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament okay listen you couldn't get Sanctified in the Old Testament no you had that same dirty unclean spirit inside of you God was just so gracious to cover that until Christ died knowing your heart why you David's heart he knew David didn't want to sin but David didn't have something to take it away and we believe that sanctification is taught in the New Testament and meant for the Believers through the New Testament age which we're now living and we also believe that after the person has been Sanctified unclean habits has gone from that person and he's a Believer on the Lord Jesus Christ and his habits are gone now he's not born again yet though we believe that he is a candidate for the baptism of the Holy Spirit a candidate which comes as a filling of the believer and when the believer is just as many times as I've taught it like picking up a glass out of a chicken yard justification is picking the glass up there's a purpose in God's heart to use it that's what God does to a sinner he's still filthy then he is cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means cleaned and set aside for service in the Old Testament the altar Sanctified The Vessel and it was set aside for service we believe that the holy spirit is putting that same vessel in service so the Holy Ghost is what is putting you in service it's making you a living breathing instrumentality or a temple of the Holy Ghost and then next Wednesday night we'll talk about anointings because after that we got if we're born again then then everything after that is a growth development all right let's stand our feet it's anointings it's things that we need like gifts of the Spirit like the nine spiritual gifts and all those different things we need those that is part of your Christian Journey but and it's given to you but you don't know how to use it everybody with me amen cuz Paul says Desiring the sensory milk of the word that what we may grow thereby no how to use those anointings because remember power without character is satanic right we need that anointing obviously we need it but it can anoint you and you be lost as lost can be but listen but Power with character virtues with the Holy Ghost God can use you he absolutely can use use you listen we've been used by the devil long enough yes amen that's right pray for me if it's not y'all we have been used by the devil long enough let's turn some of that effort over to let God use US Open yourself up and say God Here I Am Lord send me that voice kept calling his name he just finally what Isaiah he said Here I Am Lord send me Jeremiah I Sanctified you before you come out of your mama cuz I know what you're going to do when you get here you're going to help me condemn this whole nation of Israel and you're going to help me call the people out so what's happening now the Lord Jesus knows there's a group of people that he's called out to call a people out to grow and get bigger learn more teach me Lord to wait you know why you need to be taught right sing a song but the Holy Ghost is the most important thing you'll ever get in your life nothing else is the most important but that on you get that get up and walk with god let's sing a song God bless you Bor again there's really been a change [Music] me born again just like Jesus [Music] said testimony and for the glory of the Lord amen um about 3 years ago I was redoing some model remodeling the kitchen so putting this kitchen cabinets up my brother wanted to do it for me and it's I can see that when you do things whatever you need to do it need to be your Revelation at least to know what you're doing and know what's happening and uh the cabinet I kept looking at them I said these cabinets are not stable they going to fall off the wall CU they all right they all right just let them just leave them there Thursday Friday I was in the kitchen fixing some cheese toast and I looked up and the cabinets about to this far from my head and I was able to push it away by the power of God I'm not that fast and not that strong right right but I was able to push in this only got scratches on my arm from here down to my wrist temporarily and it brushed my chin and the side of my head but it didn't it didn't skin this or nothing it didn't right I wear a plate so it knocked it kind of loose but it's the thing about it is when you know what you know you got to live by it and so when we come to church we come to to live to rain to understand what is real and what is true right if if you don't get the revelation of what's real anything can happen to you that's right brother and I I realized that he want to redo my cabinets again I told him no I don't know what cost to get them done but I want somebody to do it they know what they doing so we we come to church and we hear preaching all we want somebody to know what they preaching that's right and if if if if they if they don't have a revelation can't give you one that's right and he didn't know do he know he was doing them cabinets they was B off with me to put them up I just leave them sitting in the floor at least they wouldn't have crushed my head almost so I I just want to say I'm trying to follow the lord and that's the way I want things to be done everything according to God is real and it just keep going and keep reading the Bible prophet's messag and so I I I do I try to read a lot sometime things get I get sleepy reading at home too but I go back and read it over right brother God's word is real am and time as you look around us it's very short it just every thing the prophet said would happen is taking place and so we just got to do that and that's all I just want to say I thank the Lord that everything came out all right yes and so just pray for me amen that's all amen yeah I find me another cabinet maker somebody knew what they was doing let's thing born again there's really been a change in [Music] me born again just like Jesus said yes Lord amen all because of

so the problems we have in life a lot of times we think we're the only one that that has that problem no we got a church full of them amen and we got a church full of Believers though that are believing with everyone else brothers and sisters you're never alone as long as I'm standing here you'll never be alone as long as some of our brothers and sisters are out there you'll never be alone don't you think Satan is going to he's going to cut you from the herd that's his job the wolf's job is to cut you from the herd cuz if you stay as a herd he's not going to bother you but if he ever Cuts you from the herd don't let him cut you from the herd you stay glued into this you stay plugged in to the deacons and elders and different ones here that can help you don't ever get away from us amen stay right here than you Hallelujah I'll go through the same thing that you go through you go through the same we got people we ain't all perfect that's for sure that's right but we got a perfect God that we can just listen to what he said but don't ever tell the devil don't ever let the devil tell you that you're alone no one's listening yes I want him to listen to what I'm fixing to say boo boo boo devil I want you to listen to me if you're going to be here you're going to listen boo these people will win you're a winner either way I don't care you bring all list of troubles you want to we'll pray for every one of them but the devil is going to have to back up to the bride he has no power got Jesus said I'll give you power once the Holy Ghost has come upon you he never gave that power to the devil he gave that devil an anointing sure but he never gave him power the power is in his bride and he's transferred it from us hallelujah from him to us you got to believe that and you're not alone I promise you you're not alone know that you're born again know that you know and if somebody tells you you're not probably going to be the devil that's right okay cuz even God's positive enough to say hey if you don't hang around here long enough I'm going to birth you I'm not going to lose you I'm not going to lose you the devil would love to lose you but God will never lose you he'll never leave you or never forsake you you love the Lord let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord thank you for touching us today Lord thank you for giving us purpose for living and I
