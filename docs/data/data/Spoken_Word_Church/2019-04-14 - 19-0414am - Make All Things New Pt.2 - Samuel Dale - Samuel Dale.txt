asked you to just be with each one remember all the other sicknesses there's many many sicknesses among us and Lord just reach down and touch each one and let your loving grace be with us got each one we love you and we thank you have your way in Jesus name now I thought it had it finished up on that but we're gonna continue a little bit on to this thought and I wish you would read and study more and more on the future home alright and that you would read then and study keep your thoughts and read it down on revelations 21 because revelation 21 you'll see it John says sees the bride coming and describes it he sees the city coming and describes it and you can't tell which one he's talking about because they're identical the city is made to our desires right our thoughts are not like that of what we desire and God said you know I mean the Prophet said that God would make it according to our desires so when he see the city you see the bride when you see the bride you see the city so that's what we want to you know keep our understanding into that line and do it and just let the the Lord have his way okay verse one revelation 21 and I saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I joined saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband see that's bright but it's this city in the same fire I see that I'm in the same sentence and I heard a voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes I shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and heat it set up on the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done I am Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is athirst of the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things now he's gonna make everything new and look what you get this is to the overcomer now remember how we taught it each overcomer in each church age gets what the other ages get right it's not that you got the first Church age you just get so much overcoming and the licen get a great big now each church age the overcomer inherits what precedes you know so now look so this is the overcoming to ever age now see how you can read that then to he that overcometh no matter what church age ease in what's he gonna do he's healing her at all things and I'll be his God and he shall be my son father just bless your word and your love unto us in Jesus name Amen you may be seated now keeping our thought because that's why I want you to read the future home over and over he said well I've read it well read it again because every time you read it you're gonna get more there'll be more and more understanding or listen to the tape and things because it'll it'll bring out these things and they'll bring out what I stopped talking about see when John describes the city he describes it like the bride we need to describe the bride he described it like a city you know because it's the it's the same as I said the Prophet said in the future whom he builds it according to our desires all right so whatever is there in this to do this that the other we may read a little bit of that later on and understanding but it's a beautiful picture now I want you to follow this thought women today and all because we just kind of pulled up a little bit of it there this past Sunday and speaking of it but we want to stay more or less more or less in our thoughts today on to the earth and holding that thought and then we'll move in let her into the message part to understand alright because I want you to understand we just read where he said I saw a new heaven and a new earth well because the first heaven first earth passed away now we know that it's not passed away like an ayah lady right that's why I want you to go into the future home and read it over it's not annihilate it I'll read you some in a minute of that it's not totally destroyed see we we always look at something like that you know when it says pass away well let's just blow it away well where we're going you know I mean if the world's blow it away while we're going we're going to Mars Venus Jupiter where we're going to yeah what I think most people do in their mind they can't comprehend eternity or something you know to be marvelous so they just want to try to keep it down here to simple and you know and they said well okay we'll just go off to another planet because the world blow it away well it's not blow it away it's not nothing it's not annihilated it's not blowed away it's just changing in one form to another our cleansing as far as Satan is to the earth and the things it'll be the cleansing of that and it'll be redeemed see we talked about Redemption but do we think about the world being redeemed now do we do we keep that in our thoughts me alright see then it's so beautiful when the Prophet would explain it as to how he said I I saw a new heaven and a new earth and he says on Satan's Eden we gave that that the first heaven will be the Millenium because heaven we're looking at heaven lock up the atmosphere of like over this or that or the other are great things or what you know looking at it as something like that instead of looking at it as as to what it's to be all right the millennial reign will be God ruling over earth all right now that's the best definition that you'll get for redemption if you'll think about it god ruling over earth alright see we was worried we think well we'll just go up into the heaven somewhere and we're gonna all play harps and float around and we're gonna have all this that in the other you know and we're gonna think about you know some kind of a deal that will it's beyond what we got here you know and it's a but yes it's think simple all right he's not going to annihilate the earth okay the first heaven proves that those the first heaven is the millennial reign the millennial reign will be one thousand years of time upon the earth to prove the sin curse is gone from the earth right now is that definition the profit gives for it he said it's the seventh day out of Eden thing and man is gonna live a thousand years somebody is won't matter about us code we're gonna be eternal but somebody's gonna live that well it's something for a prophet to come along and say that there'll be a healer and in the Millennium the God will raise up because somebody's gonna live a thousand years all right and if we're all eternal what does it got to do about a thousand years all right let's see the Millennium is heaven ruling over earth okay God is going to be sitting on the throne of David not a natural throne or things it's this terminologies and words that you use will you be sitting on the throne ruling the whole world as the son of David all right now see that's the millennial reign okay says then there'll be a new earth now watch what I'm talking about because see God Armageddon comes after it's ours at the end of the tribulation is the Armageddon all right Armageddon is just like Oh there'll be things in in the Millenium it won't be in the future home so there'll be things left over from from Armageddon if that's true Armageddon will leave things that is not totally annihilated because the Millenium will not be a city or something coming down and dwelling on a redeemed earth you got to wait one more stage I'm trying to get you the order of events to work that when you finish with it you'll have a beautiful plan of redemption in your understanding and you say well hey this father's this this follows this hey we got it in line all right we see the Millennium Satan is just bombed for a thousand years all right and there'll be things Arthur probably said it won't be in the future home so just take the Millennium then as heaven ruling over earth Satan bound to word that he cannot rule not a dilated now he's bound and he's bound at Armageddon by chain of circumstances brother run said he really at the point that he's doing how nobody to work through its so made ride until he don't have no like to work through he said it's not a log chain holding him or something all right sin dinars the Millennium Heaven ruling over earth for a thousand years all right cuz that's what he's saying he said what is the new heaven he said that would be the Millennium in what is the new earth see the new earth wants the millennium takes place you still got a problem because you've got a lot of things that needs to be destroyed alright then you have gog and magog to come and that will be a total annihilation of all demons all stuff like that everything Satan is not just bang he's destroyed everything is destroyed that it is not of God at gog and magog alright and see then you come forth within you earth in other words you can take the millenium coming into Armageddon you can see that there will be a lot of nuclear destruction probably because once they start shooting off bombs or anybody does everybody else gonna start pushing buttons too and then it's gonna be a nuclear destruction but gog and magog won't be a nuclear destruction that'll be God destroying even destroyed all demons never they and you come forth with a new earth not a different earth not another or instead of this one would you come forth with a redeemed er er then the city comes down now you get to get the layouts yeah I'm trying to make you follow the layout in your mind yeah the new city don't come down in the Millennium now you got a thousand years of earthly reign of God ruling over earth we'll be there with him ruling and reigning for a thousand years all right then at the end of that thousand year Satan is loosed and it goes forth and he'll be a time tired and all kind of problems can take place but then there'll be a gog and magog which will be destroying all demons all things all people that are not right everything that's you know no sin can go there but it'll start with Armageddon yeah not being a total annihilation the Gog and Magog view into the demons being destroyed now I want you to get that and hold that in your mind see then you can separate Armageddon from Gog and Magog because you got the two battles during the Book of Revelations all right and seized it but when gog and magog comes it'll burn off hold the whole earth and God will redeem it he doesn't written down listen to the word he doesn't redeem it at the Millennium he just uses it but he will redeem this earth through Gog and Magog will redeem and he'll come forth with a redeemed entire earth then the city can come down see so we're tied up somewhere you know we don't have no you know we're not after battling I've heard that the people of the message you don't preachers old one heard the Millenium we're gonna come riding back with him on white horses and we're just gonna fight and we're gonna kill and we're gonna you're in a glorified body it's the rest of them in glorified bodies no no no we're gonna kill them what are you gonna kill them with what are you gonna do all you gotta do speak it they but that's where these people get their ideas and they want to make some thought just solve the problem go step by step of what the Prophet says and then you got it done next thing is the rapture order of events right next things around after that the two witnesses in your tribulation period for three and a half years then you've got Armageddon coming right at the end of that threat I hear tribulation then you got what then you're going to step by step you go into the Millennium from Armageddon into the millennium and then from the Millennium that you go to the next stage and you'll go and you'll have Gog and Magog and then you'll have the future home the last thing is - future home coming down it's not the redemption of the earth the redeeming of the earth is Armageddon then you have the future home coming down on a redeemed earth well go get Matt you you put them together I'm again first call you may call second okay and you you wind up with a beautiful picture of the plan of redemption because by the time you reach that future home brother Brendan said ain't no more sin he said ain't no death I'm distraught he's on the side of my Bible as I hear him say it he said there's no more death no more sorrow the scripture says no thought but the city is cut the lysed is the city in the prior to Armageddon you have a Millennium temple or right after you have a Millennium temple to be erected on earth for the Millennium that's what your prophet said it gives you the scripture everything all right let's see then there is no temple we're gonna read that and study those stars there's no temple in the future home God is the temple but I want you to see the plan of redemption no that's that's where I love it when brother Branham goes into the future home he's gonna try to describe a city you read it and you'll you get it he's gonna try to describe a city that he sees coming down from John in it he automatically gets into justification sanctification baptism on the holding of what happens in the days of Noah what happened in the days of the Lord Jesus what happens over here in a fiery baptism he's trying to explain it and when he does he said if you don't get nothing else get the plan of redemption because that's what he was explaining the plan of redemption to us to where we can understand alright so then remember one thing if you want to go to it you can go to they can pull it up if they want to number two but it's in the future home it's not destroying the world it's destroying sin it's not annihilated right he gives the big word for it he said and he covers that you know what that word means it means to pass away now you should have studied the message enough those out on the internet go to the future home read the future home and see what the Prophet was saying it's a beautiful story of redemption giving you each step each stage of the journey of redemption he said well as the World Cup everyday why not see that's that's what's always tore me up is it's all when you're looking at something the Prophet is trying to explain and he's explaining Redemption why do you want to redeem something just a little bit you know what I mean why do you want to just whitewash it why not say Regained why not believe in Redemption and that the redemption would be something made new and that's why covers in Revelation by chapter 21 he said all things are made new well what I believe is it we're just gonna go along here and it's gonna wipe all this off and then it's gonna just turn around start back over an old world again you know what's wrong with you you don't have enough faith to believe that God can take care of all of it so you want to make sure to keep just a little bit just in case you don't make it that you can drop in the ground and holler and scream about the earth or something you understand what I'm sayin the Prophet said the word redeemed is what take you back to where you come from is that redeem all right the world came into existence one day right it was created okay it's to be redeemed then the city comes down after the redeeming of the earth see the world is going to be cleansed off do away with seeing doing and come forth not just a Garden of Eden to your you want it to just be turned back to a Garden of Eden style now I know I'm touching on some easy feelings so I like to touch them just a little bit why do you not believe in a redeeming to make something eternal why do you want to just redeem it back to a Garden of Eden situation are you listening do you want do your votes your soul redeemed but I want it just a little bit enough left until I can see in just a tad and still be alright do you want to hold on to yourself so much do you want just a little bit of the old person left that's easy feelings because you see I know the human being and I know how we think why not believe in Satan being annihilated out of your soul oh yeah I believe that brother Dale but well I I've just got my own thoughts now this is just my thoughts I like that you know right real quick you're gonna get some garbage come on you know right real quick when you start saying you see my thoughts I don't care where it's you or me or who it is when we come to our thoughts it's garbage can cuz that's the garbage can it comes out of are you getting the point I've been thinking on this all week of try to express something to get you to see do we believe in Redemption or do we believe in just enough cleansing until it can become good head of no man years ago and I tried to talk to it the end brother motorboat did they got a little thing a little doctoring going some of you may have heard of it and they were talking about babies being born in the Millennium I know the quote brother run said it looked like they will it looked like it won't but I just asked one simple question because that's what I asked the man I thought the bride by the time the millennium comes was to be in a full glorified body body spirit and soul to be made eternal now is that your thoughts of redemption or do you think you just got a little bit redeemed now come on I'm sorry - be nice T and hateful but what I saw was an old man an old man in his 70s thinking we don't have babies in the Millennium I didn't have to have discernment to read his mind yet and I'll move on I knew what he was taking a glorified body when sex was the original sin and you know what I mean the attribute see he had in his mind the hemming II did that exposed today come on that's not Redemption he said well we'll have probably said he didn't know I ain't telling you what's right I'm telling you what can't be you can't have sex and the glorified body because there's nothing to have it with sorry I'm playing but it's too tight I've got to say it like it is and then you turn around and say well I think it fits the way well go with your thoughts because I listen to people they're talking well I think that you know we could do what do you think you think with this world here we're gonna wipe it off we're gonna totally annihilate it we're gonna go to Mars when we're going to Mars far Jupiter what are you doing why don't you do what your mom was doing because that's what your prophet was doing when he preached the future home you're not listening even to the title of the message how many of you even know the title of the message what if you're old it's the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and the earthly bride because once it's redeems you and I no problem to listen what are you talking about then the millennium will be a great cleansing Armageddon will be a great cleansing for the millennium to take place but it'll be things dire that won't be in the future home later on the Satan will be bound for a thousand years where he cannot tempt anybody or do anything wrong in that thousand years but then he'll be loosed no Bible says he'd go forward to see the nation's the Prophet said he brings him up Gog and Magog one time he says he loses them to raise their he right to bring forth in other words in a resurrection has to come up I don't understand all that don't climb - I'm just trying to tell you the truth of what I do see a future home then we're about to City till we get the earth redeemed city can come down on earth is not redeemed it can't come on a time element world of situations are still bad thing if it's redeemed it's made eternal this world is to be made eternal well that's worth a week we made eternal but the world okay I just don't believe it's enough yeah you don't believe God is enough to take care of it why don't you say what you're talking about you don't believe enough in Redemption to be able to make the world eternal why not because if the world can't be made eternal your body can't be made eternal oh come on may I quote brother Branham you know as the Lord Jesus his body was not eternal and had to be redeemed or made eternal at the resurrection and the change not that he was sinful and no part of that but it was the fact that he had a beginning anything at the beginning has to have an ending to it right so the world had a beginning it has to have an ending to that part of it that existed under and used of sin by the devil but it will come forth into an eternal age what don't you want to believe in eternal age why would you not want to believe in eternity like that why would you not want to believe in an eighth day of eternal life no types and shadows no more it comes forth eternal we don't think I got a right to believe you got a right to believe what you want to but just remember when you speak to me I'm gonna speak back to eating tater I don't believe it sorry for that now because I'm me you're telling me what you believe so allow me to write to say I don't believe it then you say why then I'll be glad to show you well because you see getting the stage correctly you get them a millennium and then you get gog and magog and the world is made eternal then the city comes down upon an entire redeemed earth your prophet said in the future home why because there was the Lord Jesus standing on the River Jordan down come God own to a redeemed earth and What did he say he said from this part of the earth I have redeemed and from that part of the earth which was the body of the Lord Jesus he said I will retain the rest of it in the resurrection his body was made eternal well the world has to reach it reach that stage that's why we preached so hard about it because this message is the message to bring the body to it a change not anihilation as our bodies we're bringing it to a change that our body can be made eternal our soul is eternal by the new birth we're waiting the redemption of the spirit and body you know the earth will be redeemed and become a new creation the earth will be redeemed and become a new creation a new creation is not the old creation made over it's a new creation okay not destroyed but made new are regained are made eternal are do you follow me where'd you believe it or not I'm asking you do you understand what I'm talking about then that way it goes to God to reveal it that's not up to me uh-huh so then his body was regained at the resurrection I remember now his body was not regained right there on the river Jordan you know it wasn't made eternal right there he had a body that had to go on and die but it was done as far as God was concerned far as God is concerned this whole world's already redeemed but he's gotta wait until the time of that right see the new city yeah I dare to say in our minds that we think a lot of times and how much did we confuse it with the future home see the future home is not the world the future home is the city that comes down on the world there's the world's regained its mighty eternal with the future home is really the city that comes down the future home is the dwelling place of the bride of Jesus Christ with her husband it's your home made if the prophet said according to your desires see him any thought about it well I think the future home is a new world and you know go get that laid out and write the scriptures right you got a millennial reign it's even study that if you'd look at it I saw a new heaven and a new earth yeah I know you don't think like I be enough I'm glad the whole world own thing like I do but I think that's in reverse order to what it ordered me but it can't be to be worse right yeah my mind says that ought to be I saw a new earth and a new heaven does your mind think matter what but it can't be the Bible is perfectly right it's a new heaven and new earth because the millennium has got to come before they can be a new earth because the millennium is here in time right so the Bible's are perfectly right it just doesn't fit our human terminologies because the first heaven the first earth is passed away the millennium one day will be passed away this old natural earth will go through a Redemption form to be rejuvenated read that in the future home notice how much time is he spends on it I ask you to just read come to me I'm not forgetting see the new city will descend upon a new earth and the city will be the future home of the heavenly bridegroom and what used to be the earthly bride because we're all earthly but when we're redeemed we won't be earthly bride anymore but you got to start from our earthly bride a new creation not the old creation made new it's a new creation the CD will come down a poem the redeemed earth the city will come down upon the redeemed earth and it's not that he's gonna come down here and I mean we ain't got to go over the Artic in the Millennium just want his things I millenniums not in the future in the Millennium you can they could be building houses and doing this and doing happen do it but your future home won't be nothing built by mankind you'll never be built every bit of it will be built by God himself I read real careful when I'm reading I noticed brother branham explaining something he's talking about those kings of the earth he said they bring their honor and glory into the city and he first uses the word tall or works then he switches it real quick and I'm watching that because I know what he's his point he was thinking like all the rest of us but when it finished there won't be no toil and labor in the future home there won't be no house building in the future home you have things in the Millenium you don't have there'll be a temple built in the Millennium but there won't be no temple in the future home because God is the temple the lamb is the temple hmm see the new city will come down upon a redeemed entire earth because that's exactly what happened when the Lord Jesus were standing there and down come the redemptive plan this part of the earth I've redeemed and from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest of it okay remember the world our earth excuse me using the word earth his first may do and then the city will come down the earth has to be made new example of that is the fact of what will take place in the millennium I said a type example to take place in the millennium called in the Millennium God will be ruling over earth then when the earth is made new are redeemed the city can come down now don't get tied up in your thoughts keep it straight we come riding back in the millennium as the anointing to the temple but now we don't come riding back into future home we are the one that's riding back we are the one that's descending right in the millennial reign the earth will be going through the plan of redemption another earth because it was washed in the days of Noah right justification it was cleanse in the blood of Jesus Christ drop it on it to cleanse it and claim it but it's got to have a fiery baptism the earth is not redeemed in the Millennium it's in the process of redemption it's still under a seven time is still in the Millennium but it'll get a fiery baptism which is gog and magog then the city can come down now what will pop dropped back to this next Sunday but I want you to get a point now the bride will be able to live in the city code is her home he's her house he's her place that God is nice for her she'll be able to sit here in the Millennium with him on the throne but she won't be in her home just to wait until God can make all cleanses at all then she can come forth her home can come her real home can come she's just done the honeymoon in the Millennium that you were to your prophet see the kings of the earth the Prophet said and the others will not be able to live in the city now let's raise up we'll drop back and review this later but I want this point and you thought because well we're talking about that that earth when it's fully redeemed then the city can come down you say well I just don't believe a world we made eternal why not why would you not want to believe this made eternal that's what I'm saying you said what I just don't believe it to be made eternal I just got my idea your idea is showing that you don't believe in Redemption you believe in partial Redemption and you're holding on to some sinful act of human humanity to try to justify our thinking sorry would you tell me if I'm wrong why would you not want an eternal world why would you not want the earth to be made eternal if your body spirit and soul is eternal maybe you don't believe your body spirit and soul can be see why is it that the kings of the earth they can bring their glory and honor according to revelations 21 22 through 27 well is it to take ain't stay cuz it's not their home I love company don't you the brothers never make quoting brother George Smith I'll get him in trouble leave me out of it he said companies like fish he said after three days you throw out the fish right so you get him in trouble he's won latest a but I didn't make I just called it in okay I love company you know but this is the time then he want to be a home we've wife and kids or whatever you've got darling but really you've got a a home is for you and your wife I love my kids who loves the grandkids and all alike at and I love for them to come to a house and visit with us we have a good time they come and they sit down and we play games we do we have a good time as a family we eat together no that's good but you know what after a while I like for me and my wife Lee by herself right cody's our home and I don't want somebody coming in you know changing my home company comes in they like to change you home for you right move things around you know okay but listen why is it that the bride gets to live in the city why does she live in the city when the rest can't pull-up number 6a and let's read that one just where you'll see what I'm talking about I'm giving the numbers and then give them extra numbers and 6a is revelation it's 21 go ahead and I saw no temple their own Darian scuse me well the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the temple of the earth and the city had no need of the Sun neither of the moon to shine in it for the glory of God will lighten it and the lamb is a lot thereof and the nations of them which are saved the town of future home comes everything saved will be saved you done went through between the millennium and and Gog and Magog you got a white throne judgment and everything settled so over the time you come to the future home and the city coming down everything's gonna be saved is saved saved means saved from where you was going it doesn't mean born again it doesn't mean those things I'll read you the quote from the Prophet the minute and the city had no need of the Sun neither the moon to shine there for the glory of God did lighten it and the lamb is like thereof and the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it they get to walk in the light of the city they'll get to walk in the city but just have to go out and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it the gates of it shall not be shut you know oh by day or there shall be no night there and they shall bring the glory and honor of the nation's into it I like when you get on over there in a little bit and you're talking about the Tree of Life and how that is growing you ever noticed the Tree of Life over in the Book of Revelations the bride can eat the fruit but everybody else gets the leaves they don't get the fruit that's the Bible now I love that we get to fruit they get to leave can be saved from their sins safe from destruction safe from being lost but they're not saved like the bride I'll get to that in a minute but why thank you near mine why does a bride get to stay in the city number one is she's part of the city why because according to second Corinthians 5:17 all things are to be become new now that's like it says in Revelation it'll all be made new Galatians says none of these things of health much but a new creation does a new creation a new creature in Christ Jesus the born-again Christian is a new creature in Christ Jesus right that we need to go through all of that for you to understand the new birth makes you a new creature why is it this age never you don't play don't tension to those for the message to this age it said he's the beginning of the creation of God and brother Branham says we are the rest of that creation the beginning of the creation of God was God in human flesh up on earth through the wound of a Virgin Mary that's according to your prophet and you and I are the rest of that creation are the continuation of that creation and by the time we get to there we'll have bodies like unto his glorious body to the future home a new creature a new creation the cities built according to your desires because you a new creature you have a right to stay in that city but nobody else can't stay in it they say well what about see if jump over no terribly it what about 144,000 they're servants or eunuchs to the bride no matter where you put them they're in the millennial reign I have found no statement that I know of that wrote around them covers this own say the future home were doing this ideal if you find it I'd love to find it but I know one thing for sure if they're eunuchs to the bride and have eternal life in the millennial reign and rules are I mean to our dire to be servants for the bride then they'll still be servants because they're not gonna be made children of God see the future home is made for the children of God God's own offspring foolish virgins are not God's offspring they're impartation of eternal life given unto him they're not part of the body of Christ see the body of Christ is that little bride and she exactly fits the city the city exactly fits her John could describe the city and talk about the bride he could describe the bride I'm about to see if he could just go either way it didn't bother him because he knew what it meant but what does it mean to you what about it the everybody else can't stay in that city because they're not part of it they're not his children well if you're given eternal life that makes you a child of God I had more understanding of that in the Baptist Church now I'm sorry because we taught in the Baptist Church that there was foolish virgins that didn't get eternal life the way the bride got eternal life we taught that enough then how much more is it now an impartation is different from a birth your bride is a born-again Christian going through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost the closest your foolish virgins could go would be sanctification and they'd be left like I was saying I want to go the world in the days of Noah was wash as justification the days of Jesus was sanctification then it gets a fiery baptism one day Holy Ghost and fire the Bible calls him what about it I'm asking you to just listen and think the bride is the only one that can stay in the city why because it's her home by then she will be totally eternal body spirit and soul you'd have to agree to that you don't have to wait till fiery baptism come on I'm in the future home what I'm asking you believe it if you didn't go to go read it at least you could believe what said the Prophet covers in the future home that we are ahead of the world right you remember that the world is still in the days of the best it could be would be in the days of the blood of Jesus Christ it hasn't had a fiery baptism yet but you and I have already went through justification sang vacations and the baptism of the Holy Ghost given us eternal life in her soul by the time we reach the future home will be eternal embody no if not if you don't believe it that way what would be your purpose of going you want to move to another planet what I think we just go to another planet and start over yeah that's what I'm telling you you don't like me to be that plain you still have that lust spark then you take that and do what you won't do it I'm human but I'm your pastor these children understand terminologies I thought we believed in teaching our children right to stay away from the world and the things of the world but I don't want you to using bad words brother I ain't used a bad word yet I've used some terminologies you probably don't like don't use no bad word and your children can understand what I'm talking about but do you understand I'm talking about salvation for you and me we're about to future home until you get the earth right he said what do you mean by that I mean plain language don't worry about going to heaven until you get heaven right you realize we get ours here that's why we can go there we get the change of the body you remember what I was bringing out the other night there like Sunday the bride is the only one that does not have to die to inherit all things now some will keep on dying yeah but somebody's going to be changed v sells you 144,000 foolish virgins all of those have to die to be able to go to a future park come on Church time to get down serious to thinking about what we're doing if we are new creature according to the Bible go to the Bible we're a new creature in Christ if we're a new creature in Christ within old things are passed away but we're waiting the redemption of the body and that's what I'm trying to get you to see right now the stages that it said in this world will has been through justification it is in this stage of sanctification the Millennium is still under the sevens and all but then one day all will be made new are eternal and once it's made eternal then the city can come down you say the city can come down well I thought let's see if I'm a right now I go by the new birth that it made us resurrected sitting in heavenly places in Christ Jesus by the new birth I thought that was what it made us I thought it made our soul eternal waiting the redemption of the body this message would bring the entire plan of redemption unto us look at that great message he preached on the future home because our thinking we were such as I tried to explain it to you the all churches teach are used to used to teach that number seven was a rest day I heard that in the Baptist Church that it was arrest the eternal life was rest but we had no thoughts of the redemption of the body that's why we believe we we're gonna get a new one come on ever organized religion you name me one organized religion that don't believe they're gonna get a new body you want to name a few in this message about half of this message after all brother Branham has said still believes that we're going to get a new body why because they don't believe that the blood of Jesus Christ is sufficient to redeem this body it could do some supernatural thing and save the soul but can't do the bodies because we just got to be these bodies we've got to be we can't have these bodies just remember I'm not all that hard you don't sin with your body you sin from your spirit that's within you you can't sin from your body it has nothing to do other than display what you're seeing is do you want to stay with some kind of a display but what is organized religion believe you don't get anybody - the people of this message believe anyway listen to what you're listening to on these internets I've got one brother in mind if you asked me what that brother believed in and getting a new body or this body redeemed I tell you I don't know and I've known him for two years but I couldn't tell you what called one time he's new the next time he's redeemed but do you listen to that like that I just don't know I want this world I want this world throw the way and get me a new world I want this old body throw it away and get me a new body what the Lord Jesus was so hooked to Redemption until when he resurrected in his glorified body he still had nail prints anything in our scars in his side you must have lived in Redemption well what did we believe come on the nation shall not be able they can come into the city but you got to go back out as they're going out as I said the Bible says they take a leaf Prophet said it's for the healing of the nation's that they won't have no war no more they don't get the fruit now watch what I'm saying where's the seed of an apple is it didn't leave last time I checked it was in the Apple you know that's what a guy told me at work one time not talking about pecans and and you know there's an old thing runner comes out about like that I don't know if the corn it hangs down and he said yep said that's where that the cotton grows another for contrary yes what is he asses from that thing and hangs out time dropper the state is in the pecan that's the only way to get another pecan tree is planted for Colin no I shall make a deal with you and I done it I shall make a deal we as you plant a bushel of them stragglers and hangers whatever the hanging off I said I'm gonna go home and plant me a pecan I knew how to speed it up I said get me up a cone I'll bring it to you I'll show you the life is in the pecan not in the little thing that hangs off I did I cracked it and I kept it warm I got it to split open I took you back down that do it I said now you produce a seed you get what I'm saying they get to take the leaves for the healing of the nation's that's wonderful we get two apples off of the tree we get two seed off the tree we get your glorious things listen let me say this way I'll just make the point let me say it this way they ain't go to be no need of the moon stars like in the city but now outside the profits there they could be the even in the future home risen he says they can be things that those outside but I've told you there's no way for it to go black dark cuz then gonna be no clouds to cover over the moon and no matter where the moon that was done that it's gonna be light enough for you to be able to exist right but ain't no light in the city because the lamb is the light right the lamb is the light well I just don't see that I can't understand they got to be some kind of a situation that makes light or you want the Lightning burger we need to be people what are you walking what are you talking about you realize the outer courts of the temple that day night not time right inside was the candles right how do we make sure and kept live but you realize in this Shekinah glory there was no night there was no night behind that are in that interval this Shekinah glory was delight you realize that what I'm saying every where he's at is like you realize that whole city to be lit up because every where we're at is like it won't be that the outside people will look at you and see you glowing I'm not that far maybe it is but I don't think it's just the point of view of what I'm talking about wherever he is is light and in him is no darkness whatsoever even back in the Old Testament you had to daylight the dark out of court enter court you had candlelight seven candles had to be kept lit make sure but in behind the veil you had no darkness it was eternal don't even worry about trying to figure out your mind of how big city that's 1,500 square miles etc can be seen from all over the world unfolding brother branham how it would be a lot if he could do it behind the veil under tops and shadows the Prophet said a soft glowing light the Shekinah glory what's behind the veil you we know problem never where he's added like three women less tan come on musician think on these things I'm trying to preach the plan of redemption trying to take what said and just bring it down to where we can city cuz come on think about it Church you remember this the way the Prophet described that priest they had a failure that they put to mana in to keep it were the priests it didn't take it back out and spread it to everybody it was left behind the veil and it never spoiled the reason it was dire it was for the new priests to come home and each time a new priest came on he was allowed to reach over in that pot and take a piece of that which was the same manner that they started with when Moses and Aaron in the same manner he was allowed to go in and take a piece of it body he wouldn't have put it in his pocket and carried out or spread it to anybody else that man I stayed behind the veil in the presence you remember one of the priests one day he messed up and left his cane back there that would be an almond bush it took off uh you know what caught in the presence of that that kind of glory it butted in blossom and bore almonds don't worry about whether or not this world could see the light or what's gonna be what kind of a light would it be he's the light but I like what he was trying to bring out to her the other day now back up on it again next time the Bible says you're the light you're the life so when we get dire there won't be nobody to worry about it to be worth a lot not great thing to be able to stay in that city you cause you're part of it anybody got an aide come walk out brother thank God I am free free free from this world of sin washed in the blood of Jesus I been born again hallelujah I'm say save sane buys wonderful grace I'm sure glad that I found out he could bring me out and show me the way thank God I am free go to

glad what I've found out he has me out and show me and it's offensive to you for a long time travel oh we should come and try to preach some common down alone I've got justify nothing just to him my heart was so have you changed and I sink then I heard about Jesus not a wonderful hour I'm so glad that I found out he could bring me out our sister has a prayer request that she wants us to read said I have a prayer request I know what the truth is I believe in brother Branham and I know the truth and then this message and I know this is not because I grew up in this church it's inside of me the last thing I want is to be what I don't want to be a hypocrite alright I'll read it anyway in this church I would rather die and go straight to hell before I play with this message I don't have the courage to live the life of a believer so I have accepted and know for a fact if I died now I'm going to hell because I don't live accounting to her brother according to brother branham's preach him pray for me if God truly wants me to be his bride and a genuine believer for him to make it happen to me okay let's just pray for our sister and believe for salvation for her because that's what she's needing right with your brothers Wade Aaron come on Garrett let's just pray with our sister coach the one thing she needs is salvation she's saying that to us in her words in her thought that she desires to be what this message says don't want to be a hypocrite about it well let's just pray for salvation cuz that's the funny that's what she needs she needs salvation so let's ask God to save her sister so and to make her to be what he wants her to be and deliver her from herself problems sometimes just let her rest in him okay all of you pray now father in the name of Jesus Christ we lay our hands upon our sister no one is Satan and all of his powers of Hell has fought against her sister we believe you she wants to be right she has the desire her heart can be right so you go according to that Lord and you just reach down and touch them and you take away that problems in life we're all human they all have troubles but we just don't have to yield to those things and we just ask your
