love as we sing holy holy holy high and lifted shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we sing holy holy holy you are holy holy holy holy holy holy i want to see you amen that's the truth and i believe if you've got the right revelation you can look around and see him right next to you in the pew amen while you're standing i'd like you to take your bibles and let's turn to saint matthew 22 god bless you all uh thank you for the short break we'll get back with it and i'll see if the lord won't permit me to be able to uh bring this to some closure brothers and sisters you know i i think we realize by now at least i do that god's word is eternal and really there's no end you see we could be preaching these things back and forth and up and down in different dimensions and and all kinds of uh uh patterns and as long as it's god doing the inspiration and god behind it there'll be no end to it so the revelation is endless it's so compound and so we want to be able to uh allow ourselves to just settle down ask the lord to open himself up to us amen through the way of his word so if you've got matthew 22 we'll we'll get right down through a few of the verses and get you seated it says like this uh in verse 1 jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables and said the kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king which made a marriage for his son sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to the wedding and they would not come let's pray father lord i truly believe with all my heart lord had these folks known the end result father of them not coming they would not have chosen that way lord they would have wanted to come they would have been encouraging each other to come lord but in fact the bible says they did not come so father there is a mandate and there has a proclamation has went out lord that that the the place will be full and lord there will be people there who want to be their lord i pray that you'd make that father the the zeal of our heart this evening and help us lord to settle ourselves down now and allow your word to speak to us father we love you and thank you in jesus name amen god bless you may be seated i'm just going to take off from this morning if that's okay without any laps verse 4. now we saw over in luke 14 that a servant was sent very little was said about the servant except that he was given a a responsibility and a job to do and he went out to do it and he was rejected flatly rejected at the end of his ministry we find out that there were some that showed up [Laughter] just very few compared to the amount of invitations that were sent out so here we see now over here in matthew 22 parable of the marriage feast not just the great supper that now it's a certain king not a certain man i wrote this down while i was considering things that the prophet said a certain man and you'll catch this after i get going would represent his first coming and a certain king would represent his second coming and many of the things that brother branham had taught us were concerning the the the first coming compounding over to the second coming it would be like jesus in luke four when he took the book and he went into the synagogue as as was his custom and and and took the book and he he read out of the book of isaiah right and uh but he only he only read one and a half scriptures and then he stopped all right now we realize that he's the god of his word and his word does not stop why did jesus stop in the middle of that scripture is because the second half of that scripture pertained to his second coming and and and if you'll read on in isaiah you'll find out over there in the rest of those verses and in the next chapter that the reason that he didn't read the second half is because it did pertain to judgment know you not that the saints will judge how are we going to do it we're not going to do it by sitting in a in a courtroom i want you to understand this uh and and declaring what is right or wrong what is righteous and unrighteous and so forth what is good and bad the way that the second half of that scripture is going to be fulfilled in isaiah is by a body but it's a many member body and that body is the mystical body of christ that we call the church and or the bride of christ and believe me brothers and sisters your life right now if you're a believer is judging everyone around you everyone in your family anybody you become acquainted with who becomes acquainted with you know ye not that the saints will judge you see god reserve that for his second coming and i believe his second coming is here right now it's just that the last member of that body apparently has not come in or he is here do you believe he's here well then for you who believe he's here he's not coming he's here but it's a coming is a movement an action something that that constantly is out reaching out and looking for something that last one that last one comes in he'll take the book we are told and redemption is then over right but that's his second coming that i'm saying that for a purpose because over to me in luke 14 it represented his first and his second coming except there was a pause you're with me i'm going to read to you how that pause happened out of blasphemous blasphemous names is the right way to pronounce it but you got to forgive me i might not always say it just right the brothers know that i want to start at page 41. there's no paragraphs in this old publication that i have but uh now one more thing brother branham is going to say that's that's these are his words now one more thing he's just preached blasphemous names which really if you get the gist of this message along with stature of the perfect man was about how you received and how you were sealed with the holy ghost did you realize that they tie together perfectly at the first of this message he talks about the baptism of the holy ghost and it's not correctly taught he says and the reason it wasn't correctly taught in his day and much of the day we live in is because what people don't realize there's a lot that goes with it they don't realize there's so much that goes with it they'll say baptism the holy ghost i've reached the summit i'm all done no the prophet said you're just getting started why because the baptism of the holy ghost has lots of intricate working parts with it he says like the automobile points plugs coils it's got suspension it's got exhaust it's got fuel delivery it's got spark it's got you can go down the list it's got a body it's even got wheels within wheels you see so it's so we all want to simplify it and when i say simplify it i don't mean it's difficult i mean you have to go through the process what we want to do is we want to pull up short i appreciate the specials that were sung especially the one that said he don't stop he don't stop you see i read to you earlier today out of out of uh uh is this the sign of the end sir up a hill down a hill up a hill downhill and he and he disappeared well he disappeared but god don't stop that's the whole gist of what i'm trying to convey to you is that god don't stop the message don't stop revelation don't stop somebody asked me what we were going to do when we got to heaven i said well the first thing i'm going to do is rest and walk around and visit with folks and that might take 10 000 or 15 or 20. i don't know how many thousands of years it's going to take it really doesn't matter to me yeah but then what are you going to do well revelation isn't going to stop god don't stop it's hard for us to imagine how that could be because we're creatures that began at least in this form and we can see that we might have an end but the true believer don't stop all right so out of blasphemous names he says it like this bear with me now one more thing will you permit me to for it to be said day before yesterday morning you'll notice on the board out there a vision i like the fact that brother branham was so bold and so confident that when he had a vision put it on the bulletin board now maybe that vision hadn't come to pass yet but he still put it on the bulletin board right i had a vision it was about five in the morning five o'clock as my wife back there knows or six i'd woke up we got up to get the children ready to go to school i want you to notice this this is god's prophet he's going to go into a vision but he ain't you know on top of the mountain with his legs crossed in a yoga he's just doing his daily chores he's helping his wife get the kids ready for school and the spirit of the lord comes down i just have these now and then you all know every one of you here they never fail i believe that they never failed because they were god they weren't the man he didn't give himself the vision now they're absolutely perfect they never fail and i thought i was the happiest person i ever seen why because he was standing in the sun s-u-n and was preaching the gospel to a large mammoth congregation i just wanted to see if it was being taped he said a large mammoth congregation and they were sitting in a setting in a forest and streaks of the sun was shining down on them but just here and there are getting it getting the word amen and i'm as usual always too long too late preached too long and i preached so long until the congregation become hungry for physical food and they some of them got tired so they just got up and went out to get them some food started going out and i said don't don't do you remember something like that over in is this the sign of the end time sir huh you look on this and people just got weary or whatever happened to him and they started wandering off but here he says don't don't i had two climaxes i wanted to meet i wanted to meet in my sermon now don't you find it interesting brethren that he didn't say three and the lord had given to me and any preacher knows when you really know it's god give it to you you just burn and to tell the people and i was just a preaching just uh uh just to preaching charlie just as hard as i could preach just laying it on you know and saying all these great things and that was this what god's doing look at this he discerns the thoughts of the heart what is it the word and going on like that and oh i wish i could remember it now this blows me away oh i remember i wish i could remember what i was saying what my text was are you kidding me he got a vision from the lord and he seen himself preaching but he didn't know what he was preaching amen it was the lord preaching through him but when he would try to remember what was said he couldn't remember it he couldn't bring him back up i'm going to tell you why it wasn't him preaching it was the lord preaching through him there's that's going to make a point here one of these days all right now i'm not demeaning a prophet so don't you get offended i'm being realistic about what i'm reading he was preaching the house down and he couldn't remember what he was saying most preachers don't hesitate to give you the whole message you know what i mean you should have heard me what was my what my text was i can't think of it see but i was just preaching away and i was watching myself do it and then when i was that's interesting when i was standing there looking he was watching himself do it well i thought he was doing it in a way he was and in a way he wasn't right when i was standing there looking and watching myself preach it and i was just a preaching to who wouldn't have it isn't that an interesting saying that must be from the south why in the world would you preach to somebody who wouldn't have it yeah right okay apparently they wouldn't have it because we're going to find out they got up and left can you imagine after a bit i raised up you know and i thought glory to god i said look at these wonderful things and this and that directly i noticed the people begin to get like they was physically hungry you know what happens when you don't get spiritually filled you get physically hungry so how they had enough spiritual so they started let's read that again are you with me they had enough spiritual i can't get enough so they started walking away and some of them brother branham yawns to illustrate started walking away and i thought what's the matter with everybody brothers and sisters there in a day goes by when i don't think that what is the matter with everybody and i looked here and saw some young couples praise the lord going along to my side and i stopped and i said just a minute friends just a minute you'll be back again when the evening shadows fall is that what it says can i can i point out to you that the word shadows is plural in luke 14 it was a shadow servant but in matthew 22 we have plural we have servants servants cast shadows a servant only cast a now shadow not taking away from the prophet now but something's happening you see he decreased so something could increase he left the scene why because the people that were surrounding him were seeing more light than they could manage and it was beginning to blind them far be it from god to allow his work to blind his own people yet israel was blinded for our sex why israel decided that they would take on other gods you see how it works it looks like it all falls on god and he's the one who'd done it no they were blinded by god because they elected other gods that's what happens in this age blind laodicea is blind because she chooses other ways than the ways of the lord now his ways are mysterious his ways are beyond understanding and comprehension by the human mind but they're his ways nonetheless you still with me i said you'll be back again i want you to notice he didn't say i'll be back again you'll be back again but let me give you this first climax first pull second pull third pull that's the first climax that's the second climax it's the third climax where does all these things come from that i've showed you where are they from i said here they are they're in the word of god and they are thus said the lord his promise because i said all of you bear me record witness this that my commission is stay with the word i said what's the matter with all of you can't you understand the word you must understand it now that goes right along with your t-shirt brother samuel but as i read these things i see something in here maybe you don't see it and if i'm wrong i'll accept it but what i see is the prophet again trying to explain the first climax what about this what about this and what about that what that and the people are like i'm hungry uh-huh and someone said man i'd like to have some biscuits and some like that i want you to understand now that this is a vision you know this these things are symbolic and they're also real glory people want biscuits i'm going to tell you right now i want prime rib i want baked potato with the works oh i'll take a biscuit but that's not what i'm hungry for huh man shall not live buy biscuits alone bread alone right but look at this look at the condition look at the condition of the people he said well i just thought well glory to god if they want biscuits let them go get them right so i turned around and i thought oh but you know what the shadows plural is going to fall after a while right away and i said then tonight when that congregation gathers in again now i put the climax to them told them that the things that they have seen me do is found in the word of god not in some mythical book or some organization it's found in the word okay every bit of it in the word because i'm commissioned to that and i thought you know they'll everyone be back tonight so here's what i'll do i'll background that's what jesus done on the road to emmaus by the way kind of background you know the way i do it on these church ages and things and say what i said before i'll background it on the word and then this great marvelous climax i said what a time it'll be praise be to god now he saw something he saw something in this and i seen myself watch now watch how this fits in with over here up a hill down a hill up a hill down a hill getting smaller and smaller and smaller wait a minute it'll be praise be to god and i've seen myself getting real little you know why because god won't give his glory to another there ain't no one man taking god's glory but one man can be the glory of god but he ain't taking god's glory and heard that praise be to god and i seen myself fading up not out fading up like that and here i was standing there now here's the interpretation thereof see the first thing that i have done the things that's been done has been mystical to the people most of them i don't mean the full gospel and saints of god but i mean to most of the people does that not sound like saint luke 14 that servant went out and they just couldn't accept him okay and you never want to look at the world cosmos as the message of god when you go in you say like jose i'm reading this for a purpose matson bose of course it's boze i've always said i had a dream years ago that the the god would send me to chicago and shake chicago for the glory of god i said joseph watch it now he's already done it he's already sent his servant listen to how it ended up why he said they haven't been shaken since moody this is jose and brother brown says that i'm talking about the church listen to what he says that's cannon fodder out there oh again you see god sent his servant and they rejected him and they could not come in cannon fodder he called them okay that's just dust of the earth that bunch cramming through the streets painted jezebels and everything i said that's out there then big old lodges and things will crumble fall into the streets and there i said he's talking about the church the church has seen the revelation of jesus christ made manifest and they recognize it they may not be 15 out of chicago man that was a big city it's still a big city 15. remember go into the highways and the hedges compel them there may be 10 in this congregation out of the whole city of chicago come forth did you ever think of that as it was in the days of noah so will it be in the at the coming of the son of man wherein eight souls were saved how many come out of sodom see what see what i mean i doubt being a handful see but the church itself has received the shaking they've recognized it they knowed the word they seen the word when it was being materialized and they caught it now look at that for a minute well let's take a minute amen remember something brothers and sisters that the church and the bride are only one and the same when the bride is in it what we find out over in revelations what 17 or 18 that the church itself then has a shaking you see chicago was shook here and those that did not accept the invitation were cannon fodder and then there was more calls and more pools and more preaching made more manifestations more signs wonders and miracles and a handful almost got it he said that's the church it'll be a small group he's he would always say fear not little flock see but now watch what's going to happen that was under the servant yes at the end of luke 14 there were people that finally decided through the for the through the much labor of that servant to come to the great supper what they didn't realize is they hadn't arrived yet because it's not just the great supper to them that's what it looks like and that's what it was called and that's what they came for but then they heard a cry saying come out of her my people be not partakers you see so we're not finished yet right that was just the church the bride has to come through the church but she don't stay in the church she becomes an invincible army she becomes him she becomes the word made manifest she becomes christ as he is in a mystical body that's a handful and we can say it yes sir i can preach it i believe it but when is it going to manifest well i'd say that's in god's time because i'm ready you ready then we need to pray for the last one or ones to come ready who makes her ready over in the book of revelations that says she has made herself ready you see but it was based on the message that the first servant brought what he was really bringing and they didn't want any part of at first was the garment they didn't want all the word they only wanted the part of the word that fit them so they began to make excuses of why they wasn't coming and they were lame duck excuses written up by a crack doctor i've bought some land i better go see what i bought right huh i bought some oxen i better see if they can even stand on their own four feet i bought a wife have no idea whether she can cook or clean or what she looks like or whether she loves me or not or what that's all you get he bought a wife had to go check it out that's brothers this is whether you realize it that's what the church was doing under the first call under what we would call the first coming now it wasn't the first coming of jesus christ but it was as i was talking to brother samuel and i'll be careful i agree with him that brother branham is not the chief but the ministry of jesus christ through brother branham was the chief wave offering stating that this is one member of the body of christ and this is what the body of christ is going to look like so every other member will do these works no we won't take the position of the prophet that's not what it's saying but we become members of the same body that performs the same actions now brothers and sisters you may not be one of the god hath placed some in the fivefold ministry but if you sit in a church where god hath placed one you're good that's right because the spirit that's on that office will permeate throughout that congregation and that congregation now becomes a part of that part of the body therefore you yourself listen careful and i'm not impugning or demeaning signs wonders and miracles i believe they can happen in each and every life i believe that you as a believer can perform any one of them at god's chosen time it has to it takes faith but even if you've never seen a sign wondering miracle and you're part of the body that performs them you're good you're right amen are you with me and you could be bad as we're going to find out and if you stay in this body the only thing that'll keep you from glory is how you're dressed in the word if you believe you don't have to understand all this word you just have to believe it now here's what happens in the world we live in as you believe as you receive you become the very word you don't understand come on can i ask you a serious question is anybody in the house understand themselves completely i know you don't because the prophet of god's wife said billy that people don't understand you and he said i don't understand myself but the revelation of jesus christ in your soul gives you the confidence that if you don't know it yet you will and if you never know it it's because god didn't show it to you and it won't matter in your walk you still with me all right let's keep going oh i'm going to get over to matthew 22 and close on that one all right now where did i leave off now okay but the church itself has received the shaking they've recognized it they knowed the word they seen the word when it was being materialized excuse me and they caught it now look at that for a minute does that sound familiar paragraph 133 answers look on this now remember what he asked them to look on was not written on yet it was white stone it was inside the pyramid it's all right if i preach under inspiration oh where is that quote you know i'm it's something that's in us could it be something that's in us yeah remember brother brandon preaching on that now i'll have to think real hard i got it written in here but i'm not going to take the time to look through and find it oh recognizing your day and its message paragraph 72 the rapture is at hand is it something that's inside us that's part of this look at this white stone not written on yet because light hadn't shined on it because it wasn't time and the reason why that god hadn't let light shine on it and keep it on written is so that the enemy could not get a hold of it and begin to try to manipulate mimic interpret you understand what i'm saying an imposter the third pool will not have any mimics there will be no imposters there will be no impersonators exactly it will be the real deal okay and and and brother samuel and i were talking and at 100 percent the third pool is the opening of the word exactly i believe that with all my heart but the opening of the word brings repercussions you understand what i'm saying like for instance brother branham would say it's it's to the totally lost but it's for the bride okay i know i'm paraphrasing but i'm close you with me so the same word and i know i have that written down here somewhere i believe in questions and answers on the seals brother branham says the same gospel that's being preached to you tonight will condemn those who reject it the same do you see the same word it's not two different words it's not two different sentences they're not even they're not even worded differently they're worded exactly the same way but one of them cuts off and one of them cuts in right still with me all right i'm going to lose track of time but i'll go i'll speed along as fast as i can thank you it's like throwing the dog a bone all right let me find out where i was at again you see in my old uh book there's no paragraphs all right i had two climaxes i wanted to meet no the church itself has received the shaking now and this first message when they'd see it so they would see it when they'd see it everybody rallied for it and said oh glory to god oh if i could see this that and the other and they'd go right away the same way they came in the first message the first climax did you realize that you can hear the first message by putting a tape if you still have one in your tape player and turning it on i want you to get this everybody rallied for it oh glory to god oh i could see this that and the other yeah a lot of different viewpoints and revelations came into play whenever there was not the prophet there to say wait a minute or whole or that's good that's right that's wrong see and they'd go right away the same way they came in see and now they think and now they think well i don't know listen look at the stages look at the pools now when you think of a pool you're thinking of first one is healing the second one is discernment of but but remember brothers and sisters these servants in matthew 22 also have three pulls they're not different than the poles that god has always used i want you to catch that but god uses his mystical body in a particular way because it's a representative of his bride and she will act and do exactly amen like he has commanded for it to be done she will not miss a revelation she will be right on the cutting edge because we'll we found out that she is him is that right that's a quote all right now watch this now watch the mindset well i don't know where would you join yeah if if i don't come with this it'll be this way and i'll be kicked out over here and i won't have nothing to do here i mean these things this is exactly what's going on today in the minds and the hearts of people and it's a climax and brethren set down and say well what would i do if i see there they they won't stop long enough they won't stop long enough to recognize it's the word that god promised being manifested they won't stop long enough luke you don't have to put it up brothers but luke 14 17 sin is servant at suppertime to say to them that we're bidding come for all things are ready and they with all one consent began to make excuse don't you see that's what's going on here they won't stop long enough to recognize it's the word that god promised i believe they recognize it's god's word but not the one that was promised for their very hour that's what happened to jesus first coming he was the word of god being made manifest but they rejected the manifestation of it the god promised being manifested see and they walked away but don't worry the shadows plural are close at hand see now it looked like in chicago where do you say barely a ham i doubt being a handful down here the shadows are close at hand it says when i return to the field you remember the other night of the message that he gave me back yonder when i was laying the cornerstone just exactly said do the work said when you come out of this vision read ii timothy 4 you know it's laying right there in the cornerstone 33 years ago he said do the work of an evangelist make full proof of your ministry for the time will come and they will not endure it doesn't say doctrine it says sound doctrine sound meaning firm meaning correct meaning appropriate and also airwaves sound doctrine but after their own lusts shall heap teachers having itching ears turned from fable from truth unto fables it hasn't been just word if that hasn't been just word by word but remember then the other night when i never did read the rest of it this is the part i read all this to get to this right here the 30-something years that i've preached in this tabernacle never one time now i want to ask you a question we're all visioning brother branham preaching in branham tabernacle but i also believe all scripture and all prophecy is compound and he's also standing in his tabernacle the 30-something years that i preached in this tabernacle never one time did i ever go any further than that and i don't know why this is god's prophet and that is something that god did not acknowledge nor reveal to him but he did do what god told him to do up to that point you with me amen i often wondered till one day i seen where jesus picked up the scroll and began to read now that is in luke 4 and read half of the prophecy and stopped and said there in capernaum he said and this day this prophecy is fulfilled why didn't he read the rest of it it pertains to his second coming amen all right matthew 22 verse 4 the first set of servants went out to call them that were bitten and they would not come verse 4 says and again he sent forth other servants not the same ones remember what brother branham said in that vision little birds beat up lots of them then the second round was a little bit bigger birds okay sent forth other servants saying tell them which are bidden here we go to the same group tell them which are bitten you see they're still adhering to god sent a prophet tell them which are bid and behold i've prepared my dinner my oxen my fatlings are killed all things are ready come under the marriage i want you to notice that god left that portion of the word to the servants the servants took what the servant brought and began to reveal the menu this says this and this means that and this ties in with this and this is over here you see he brought the gold nuggets but the servants are now polishing them and they're beginning to see the reflection of something in them and that reflection is beginning to identify what it is are you with me prepared my dinner my ox and my fatlings are killed the things are ready you won't find that over there in luke 14. but they made light of it and went their way i could just imagine i've been made fun of oh yeah oh come on brother i mean i've been told this we don't preach the seven seals you don't what good are they then why did god send the revelation of the seven seals why did he take all that time to work his way up to the seals and then continue to minister about the seals afterwards what do you mean you don't need the seals well that's what i told them at the end of the conversation well you may not but i do yeah they made light of it amen and went their ways that's right notice their ways all right it's their revelation it wasn't the one that god sent through peter it was there some say your lies some say you're this their ways see one to his farm another to his merchandise and the remnant who's the remnant and the remnant took his servants and entreated them spitefully and slew them and as i was talking to brother wade today i mentioned this and and another brother you know that you don't have to kill somebody today to slay them you just have to work their influence onto the negative side of the tracks brother branham said this and you're killing their influence which is the same thing as destroying them look at the world we live in that's what's going on in the world we live in a man will stand up and try his best to to to maintain whatever principles that seem right and brother sister they'll kill his influence quicker and they that that's called the cancel culture and it's coming our way it's just that when they try to shut us up close us up we're going up i put the shut up in there because they want to stop the preaching of the gospel right if they can't stop the preaching of the gospel they'll close off the buildings and they'll begin to send out spies i was talking to a little sister yesterday and she said it's called see and say i think a commercial on the radio see and say you're supposed to turn your neighbor in now did you know that did you know this government wants you to turn your neighbor in for kicking the cat for abusing the dog that's right what people don't realize is that's how hitler got his power they call them brown shirts okay do i care about politics nope but i want everybody to understand there's two horns on one head one of those is politics and one of those is religion and brother branham says politics has got into the church and churches got into the politics following a part of the world and they're talking about nixon you can get it still with me who better hurry up but when the king ah now we're getting back to the king when the king heard thereof he was wroth and he sent forth his armies and destroyed those murderers and burned up their city hmm did you notice something they all come from one town oh then saith he to his servants no again it's plural this is the third time this is their opportunity for a pull the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy not worthiness in the way of the way they dressed or the way they carried it they rejected the word of god through the other servants reject it they'd have no part of it and brothers and sisters in just a second we're going to prove that it's the same exact message these servants are preaching the same message as the servant over in luke as the prophet preached the five-fold ministry that god has placed is going to preach and is preaching and will preach the same message but because the prophet of god said if timer to go on there would be more light not a different light i like to say that more light on the same word well it's kind of like this greater works than these shall ye do because i go to my father brother branham corrected that and said it's not greater but more why because there's more of us it's servants now it's not just a servant and don't be afraid this word has got to become that real right in your life it's got to become so real that you become not a mimic not a parrot but a carbon copy what's already been sent amen it's not a new word it's not a different word it's just that as time goes on more light shines on what never has had light on it before and becomes manifest and it scares the people to death because if they don't understand it they think it's some kind of a mystical mystic you know what i mean some kind of mysterious whoa it's witchcraft oh it's spiritualism oh it's not if that person's life is walking the walk and talking the talk you with me i'll finish watch this the wedding is ready but they which were bidden were not worthy go ye therefore into the highways and as many as ye shall find bid to the marriage here's the same message go to the highways all right find them so those servants went out of the highways and gathered together all as many as they found both bad and good so you see brothers and sisters it's not how bad and or good you are it's whether you receive the call because what'll happen is if you receive this call in your soul what you think is good and what you're doing that's bad will find its way into the middle of the road and you'll be just like him you don't think that they didn't call him bad beelzebub they called him king of the devils here's a certain king but he's working in a different way they went out into the highways and got her together all as many as they found both bad and good and the wedding was furnished with guests praise the lord because i was one of those and when the king came in to see the guests here we go you talked about the coming of the lord now the lord has arrived and he has arrived i want you to see the timeline he said he's arrived to see the guests he saw there a man which had not on a wedding garment this is previous to the rapture then in that and he saith unto him friend you see he still wanted him to come in he just wanted him to come in right friend how camest thou in hither not having a wedding garment on now the lord knows how this man got in there but what he's looking for is the man's answer he's giving him an opportunity just like he gave cain cain why are you so roth you just do what your brother did to get my confidence and you're good oh no king got jealous like his daddy and his daddy was not adam and what did he do slew that servant how cameth thou and hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless do you know why i got this written i wrote this down he had no revelation of how he got there therefore he could not express to the king how the garment got where it was supposed to be was speechless he couldn't say nothing because he had nothing to say but you get somebody in a corner who's got revelation and they'll talk their way right out of that corner preaching all the way is that right then said the king to the servants bind them hand and foot take them away cast them into outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen what is the remnant of verse 6 it would have to be the foolish virgin because down here in verse 13 brother branham tells us that the foolish virgin is cast into outer darkness that doesn't mean they're cast out into space that means they become speechless no light can reach there they'll have nothing to say so they'll run for their lives when they're confronted by the authorities who are out looking for you and me and guess what brothers and sisters we are gone did you know the prophet of god said it like this that you could be sitting next to somebody or you could be that somebody sitting next to somebody and they're receiving it and you're not let's not find ourselves like that you see because then you become speechless and all that god has for his children that might be for you would be set aside and it would become outer darkness there's a place in the message where brother branham says now there are so many just so many places set it allotted and if you don't take your place this is what he says someone will take it for you please stand there's oh so much more of it that's where i want to stop right there you love him amen amen i hope you still love me yes that's right i love him oh i love him because he first [Music] my salvation [Music] go ahead brother [Music] him [Music] my [Music] anybody have a need we've heard a great message now come and reap the benefits of it [Music] love me [Music] oh [Music] i love you [Music] love me my salvation [Music]

pray one for another tell our brother how much you appreciate it let's give him a good hand appreciate him coming appreciate his wife coming down with him and fellowshipping with us for a few days just have a good time doing that so you tell him how much you appreciate the word because that's what we do we appreciate that all other things can amount to nothing but the word is the real kind amen
