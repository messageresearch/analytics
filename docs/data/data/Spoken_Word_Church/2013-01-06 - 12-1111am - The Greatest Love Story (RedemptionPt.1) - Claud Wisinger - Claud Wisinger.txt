enjoyed it had a good crashing things and no way brother uh clogged on a marvelous job expressing some points and I've been I believe that if things will work out better because we're going to have the next meeting here we'll be in January and it's going to be built on questions and answers because we didn't have time yesterday but we had a good time good fellowship and all in the lord well we're glad to have brother Claude my singer with us this morning yep already right I've got sister Amber in the accident and everybody glad to have a brother called with us from Oklahoma we're starting a little bit early this morning now we're going to start early this afternoon 15 after so that way we'll probably start the services 5-till you know start singing the 15th after being the pulpit no communion foot washing this afternoon my brother Claude has already said that he may be a little empty 45 minutes but I'm not hoping for him to do that we're hoping to to hear the word of the Lord we're glad to have brother Claude with us and really in Fellowship yesterday and all and and from Thursday on but let's just sing Open the Eyes of My Heart Is brother Claude weisinger from Bartlesville Oklahoma comes to speak unto us from the word of the Lord remember all the prayer requests and all the things and I pray that the Lord we bless each and everyone okay Open the Eyes of My Heart New Year the eyes one of you know holy holy holy way for the power and holy holy holy holy holy holy foreign it's a big responsibility but you know what I promise the Lord if he'll reveal it to me I'll tell the congregation no matter what it is if you'll reveal the word to me I'll absolutely preach it and I won't do it partial I won't do it by friend or enemy I'm just going to put the word out there glory and it will not return void I believe that's right on my heart so I know that brother uh I hate to keep you staying I'm Gonna Keep you standing for me I'm not Joel Forney I'm not a helicopter preacher I don't go straight up and come straight down I'm like the C30 transport I'm a big fella it takes me a while to get to the end of the runway once I get up in the air it's going to be fast and furious and then we're going to come back down okay I'm gonna be honest with you I'm a little different brother Jewel I'm a little different brother Samuel but we all preach the same message that's right we do have Unity of the faith right right and that word faith means Revelation you understand we do preach the same message we're under the same messenger and it's the same holy spirit that reveals us to assistance now he talks in his what are you call you guys at Georgia Bulldog games yeah his brother Branham I tell people talk at our church Kentucky ease and I talk in okibonics okay high top and okibani so you're gonna hear a thing you may laugh at some of the the cliches I use because I'm an Oklahoman I've been there my whole my life and and is what I am I'm An American in this last election it breaks your heart when you see it happens that this part of me is sad but there's something on the inside of me that knows I'm a stranger and a pilgrimage and I'm just passing through this later so I know that God sets up and God tears down and once you have total confidence in him you know that confidence is love you know when you love your wife you have confidence in them is that right and if you really love Jesus Christ you're going to have confidence in him right that he's going to do what he said he would do and brother Graham said he's looking for a bride that'll take him in his word right and what is that it's your death confidence he will perform what he said he would do and that's the Bride of Jesus Christ I enjoy preaching here you're a lovely group of people you're well taught I can tell that when I Minister it when a minister preaches they see faces you know brother Brandon one thing he said I wish you could see the devil's face now you know what he was looking at the people when he preached serpent seed there'd be some out there going if you want you know who's getting it as a preacher and you say it's a spiritual discernment not all together because your body will respond to a revelation right I don't know about you but there I've spent a lot of Tears in the Book of Genesis right I told Brother Jess when he pastored our church I said you preached so much out of Genesis the pages stick together I've cried so much in there and so you will respond to the message of our is that right this outside is going to show what's on the inside right so just you know it's got to it's just the way it works right so anyway I'm gonna I'm gonna read a scripture and I'll let you be seen because it's gonna take me a while to warm up and then it's gonna you're gonna see me I'm like a rocket blast we're gonna go okay so let's go to Leviticus 25 if you would please I thought this when I first read this and and I'll explain it a minute I'm gonna read the scripture I'm gonna let you sit down I got a lot I'm gonna lay some work and then we'll uh we'll go from there okay of a minute since Leviticus 25 and 23. listen what it says real close the land shall not be sold forever right okay for the land is mine who's the Lord do you know the promised land wasn't even Israel's it was God's land right but he said he told him he said okay Israel you cannot sell the land forever right in other words brother you can't sell it you cannot sell it is that what it's saying now let's know what it's saying for ye are strangers and Soldiers with me you know what I just said right the land was what did I say oh that's my note I hope you ain't got my note up there I don't know where I'm going okay but anyway I'm gonna I'm gonna try at the end of this read the entire book of rude that's why it's gonna take me a long time this afternoon I know you think that's crazy but that's my note so I didn't know we had that on there I should have told him to take it out and in all the land of your possession this is this next verse ye shall Grant a Redemption for the land right do you realize the previous scripture he said the land is mine forever right right and you can't sell it the next verse he says now I'm going to give you Redemption for land now if I wasn't a spiritual man and had Revelation I would say God contradicted himself no God knew that they were going to go in debt God knew they were going to have to sell their land to get out of debt you understand and this is really these two verses here is showing you the Plan of Redemption amen that God said don't sell it forever right but God knew you would fall God knew you would be a sinner is that right so he made a way of redemption a plan a Redemption even though his commandment was don't sell the land it's mine is that right but they did it anyway do you realize God wrote your name on a book before the foundation of the world that he already set the Plan of Redemption right right there yes you're name was on the book you're already a part of the plan right now man God put your name there but God knew you would fall God knew Eve would fall this is the same thing he's saying here see God don't change his mind about Redemption he says don't sin the day you said Eve that day you'll die but he knew they would do it right he had already had a Plan of Redemption set for him where they could come back now that's Grace brother that's love I think don't you yeah let's bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the word we pray that you'll give a revelation your Prophet said well we need more than our next meal is a revelation from God lord Jesus we ask for that Revelation here this morning therefore your Prophet said the Rapture was a revelation give us that Revelation today in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen you may be seated let's put up the one on the definition of revelation if you want to Brother Joseph please I don't know if you look you know it says the revelation of Jesus Christ is given to John you know in the first chapter of Revelation that's right if you go in a message and you click on the word revelation these are the different definitions it gives this is the one that really struck me yeah everybody see this one here that I highlighted it's coming so let's do this let's call it the coming of Jesus Christ do you have a problem with me doing that because that's what it when he that angel has said it in 10 7. what was he bringing a revelation what did Brother random say this save and seal was the coming of the Lord is that right brother Brandon said and I had him show it here and you've been preaching the Book of Revelation I have two I just haven't been doing it the way you have part one but it is you know what I mean so you guys are going to hear exactly what he's been preaching to you yeah you just want to hear milky box the bride has got to come to the unity face speaking the same thing you you are the final voice to the final age under your master right he's got to preach what brother Brandon's saying you've got to preach what Brethren and that's the unity of Faith all right because remember brother Brown said there's in the Redemption he said there's seven plans of redemption is that what he said if you're in Paul's age you were under that Plan of Redemption if you're an ireneous age you would have fell over Irene if you took the message of Irene it's that you were part of the Plan of Redemption for that hour right sure reth said you were predestinated for this hour you're the one that would receive this message you're the one that would eat the whole book right that's what annoys me today we got message churches that are naughty eating the whole book right you know what they want to do they want to tear out the Book of Revelations yeah focusing now I'm gonna tell you something you're gonna think I'm funny I'm gonna say it in a minute and you you really you're well taught you'll get what I'm saying brother Brandon said the Book of Revelations is in three parts right he said chapter one through three is the church ages right now let me ask you something did he come to Paul did he come to ireneus yeah man did he come to William Bradham you're a prophet so see it says the coming of Jesus Christ man you say the revelation of Jesus Christ now I'm going to tell you what the definition I'm gonna break it brother said we're supposed to say to cool of a room break it down for the people right right so now we're going to break it down it's the whole book of Revelation is the coming of Jesus Christ these things must shortly come to yes is that what he's saying it sure did 53 A.D it shortly come to pass he came to Paul Paul went to Hebrew the book of Hebrews guys I don't know if you know it or not the book of Hebrews the theologians say Paul didn't write it they argue that Paul wrote it you know why the book of Hebrews is his notes where he went into the synagogues and preached yeah first when he went into the city he would go into the synagogue he would give it to the Jews they would reject it he'd go outside and he'd preach it to the Gentiles in that town finally Paul said you know what I'm tired of this the Jew of every city I went to in Asia Minor they rejected I went into every synagogue I go there first because he said take it to the juice first right and they reject it so it goes right to the Gentiles amen see brother Brown said we Gentiles are going to hand this message back to the gym right does everybody understand in June of this year they opened the first message Church in Jerusalem in June of this year the first message church has been opened in Jerusalem I it just makes a hair stain on my back when I talk about that it's showing you that this gospel is soon to replace go to the Jews everybody believe that now I'm going to scatter this and I'm going to tell you why I'm going to pre preaching you I'm going to tell you my title now the greatest love story right Redemption amen but brother Branham win the book it was the whole book all right he said in chapter 5 of Revelation the seals were sealed on the Seven Seals on the back side and within the book right see what people don't understand did we understand serpency no brother random time was that sealed so see the book was sealed within the book and on the back side of the book Revelations does everybody got what I'm saying so did we understand uh knowing Turtle hell no we didn't understand those things right did we really totally understand Redemption right right exactly right we didn't so see the whole book and it's the book of redemption is that what it was is that what was open in chapter five right the most Sublime scripture all right so everybody look the word survive he's Grandeur right can I put in okibonics the bestest right the bestest scripture there is is Revelation chapter five and you know what he saved the bestest for last this is it folks he predestinated you for this hour right because you're the ones that's going to digest you're gonna eat the whole book you're not going to chair out Daniel's book right let me say it let me break it down you're not going to tear out Daniel's 70 weeks right right because you have to eat the whole book you have to eat serpency yeah you have to eat Redemption you have to eat the Book of Ruth right you have to eat all those books buddy right because look low I come in the volume of the book it's written to me amen who is me the kinsman redeemer Not Me Jesus Christ is that right he was the kinsman redeemer and it's required of you all right can I say it again right it is required of you to eat the whole world God just didn't open the whole book just because God don't do something just because God's got a purpose and the purpose of the whole book is redemption and I'll tell you what since I've been preaching on it just set me on Fire Inside Man because it helps me realize who I am God has become more real to me in this hour since I've been ministering this then he's ever been right all right it's the truth he's become more you know more real means true right it does you know she's a real wife to me she's true right right this is what it says that's what real means my God is real for I can't feel right give me my soul and he's true to me I understand all right and I'm true to him right right what the reason I'm true to him is appreciation of what he did right right that's your sanctification if you don't do this message you don't believe it right justification is what he did for you right those he justified right he glorified amen but sanctification is what you do in appreciation for what he's done for you and sanctification is serving him right and if you're not doing this message the do's and don'ts of this message you're not serving him right it's going to show you where you're at in the progression of redemption right can I say it that way no I don't like the word progression in the steps remember him said there's three steps and he said you know brother man said that was his message the woman stand going down the road on high heels like this oh don't listen to that crazy man that Prophet don't listen to him she he said he heard the most blood hurtling straight scream when she fell off that road right and he said there was three steps remember it was his his mother the Indian it she was in the end and she had she had always a spiritual dream right he said that is my message three steps justification amen sanctification of baptism all together you want most of the preachers in this message preach yeah and brothers said it but you better put some detail or wrap it around it right because people he said this if you recognizing your day just leave the message you believe the message you got the Holy Ghost yeah the scripture says that you can know all the Mysteries come on you can know all the mysteries of this mess message and you don't have love you're a team lead singer you're just a noise makers all you want well we got around the message there's a bunch of noise makers they don't even most people in the message don't even understand true justification sanctification and the baptism Holy Ghost what we got is a bunch of dry eye church members right you can be a member of this Tabernacle this morning and you ain't it's not good enough right I'm sorry you can come to this Tabernacle every time the doors are open right it's not good enough amen that's your reasonable service that you serving him right we got people even in my church it says you're supposed to go to church as you see even more as you see the day appearing right is that what the scripture says and some of you hitting me it's hit and miss that's the way you serve God right that's sanctification is how you serve him right right it's what you do in appreciation for what he's done for you you can't three times out of your week to come here and gather together and you know what you've come to do you know what worship is to adore him all right but you think worship is is for you to come and get something out of service it is but what you want is God give you got to give me yeah give me Lord get him already gave you he gave you the open book why don't you just eat it the bride that made herself ready you're waiting this is what people in the message mean they say that it is it's a quote they say the Revelation is a a Rapture so everybody some of you right here this morning I don't doubt are sitting here waiting for a single Revelation that all of a sudden you're going to get raptured out of here is that what you believe I'm going to tell you I know for a fact some of you believe it I've watched it too much do you know you go read the Rapture book and brother Brown don't talk about a revelation he talks about the whole book right he talks about Revelations you have to eat serpent seed you have to eat the Redemption story you have to be baptized you have to see one and said on the front you need to see the 20 and four Elders there's a lot that you need to digest to this book because you know what whatever you eat is what you become said the word of God's anointed already right if you don't eat the whole book you don't have the whole anointing of the word you're not going to be in that new Temple does everybody understand so people say oh I believe the message shoppie left outfits you're a stench in God's nostrils is what you are you're supposed to bring a sacrifice and you're a Living Sacrifice before God you may have you're a cross-eyed bow-legged Christian it won't walk this right and you expect to present that to God you better bring the best of the best before you God because it's the appreciation of what he's done for you right so I'm going to tell you some of you are Sanctified you made a decision to come out of the world and the things of the world but you're not Sanctified you're not serving it every day what do you say what do I have to do to make it an everyday simple Christian life amen like that old boy in England remember you was delivering the Christmas presents he'd have a little shot of whiskey in one house and another and another another he's walking through the snow and he looks back at his son he says where are you at he's back here trying to follow in his footsteps and that man quit drinking after that right did you know brother man said you each and every one of you in this Billy leave footprints on the sand of time but some of you want your children is growing up to fall in your footsteps when you say you're a message brother you'll cheat a brother out in the world see what people think in this message if I cheat a Baptist or a Methodist out there it's okay no they got the same father you did right now you need to get a revelation from God you're supposed to walk up right you shrunk events what you do is you bring a reproach on this Bible that I believe get yourself Sanctified brother you better start looking at sanctification and look at it real close all right right because you think oh I believe the message so what the devil believes in dreams that's right right I'm not mad but it surely got me on fire right now Big Brother so Book of Revelation chapter one through three they only know what that's coming Church age he said chapter four through nine right because look there's two quotes remember I asked you one I just want to be sure I had it right yeah four to 19. did I say that oh well read between lines Revelation 4 to 19. you understand by the way it was too close he says we go up before we come down to 19. right he says Revelation 4 19 are the Jews I'm gonna sneak something in here for you okay you know what I did so when I looked at this whenever I have said this I've been preaching now since the first year on those three parts I said he said there's three parts right now I'm going to dissect it down for the people the three parts okay I preached three months on this first one yeah I'm gonna tell you I'm gonna give you a quick review okay look if you want to understand how you fall remember the work of the churches or in both ages right and all those Spirits in each age comes down to this age right the first Spirit of the first stage was Antichrist right you know and there was somebody in our church said this okay let me show you how simple it is can I show you in our church said well when my girls get to be 16 they're going to make they can wear pants they wear earbuds they can cut their hair because remember they're 16. and she told it in the church somebody got back to me now this I'm gonna say this is hard this sister may watch it but I'll preach in our church big deal you know you're going to take it it may sometimes it's not it's bitter isn't that right it's better but I told her I said look I got another Pulpit because they're going around see that spirit's going around right as a pastor if a spirit comes into this church he's obligated to kill it right and if he don't you need to vote him out and if I see a spirit creeping into this church and I don't Hammer that thing yeah I told my church would you do me a favor and vote me out right yeah before I harm Myself by keeping my mouth shut and letting things go that's not the way to solve things Phineas in the scripture remember him he took a a spear and thrust that through and for four generations after his family was blessed why because the rest of the Levi stood there doing nothing you know what we got in the message there's Levi's standing there doing nothing get your Spear and kill the thing they were in the church in a tent door crying and he took a strange woman into his tent right in front of him that's you know what can I tell you something people will bring people will come in this message and I I've seen it I don't know this is awful because you may have humble say it okay I've had people come to my church a man and woman be married okay then she's going through the change he can't take any divorces or he brings another one from a Baptist Church in there yeah yeah you know what I told him I said what in the world are you doing right I call him pizza out in the corner I said what are you doing man well you know the scripture says it's better to marry to burn I said you misplaced the scripture that's right and say if you have a virgin daughter right that she's engaged and she can't keep herself to an engagement get her married don't let him live dirty dirty till they have the vow does everybody understand that right that's right he ain't talking about you not heads and got a wife and you're looking another wife you need to get Sanctified man amen he tried to blow that button I thought are you kidding me right and you know what this is what I told him I said look I'm going to be honest with you there's a lot of preachers in the message out there that will accept you in the shape you're currently in they'll even let you marry that woman but I said I'm not one of them amen so if you're going to stay with that woman you need to find a preacher that'll accept you yeah because I said I won't right that's good because you and your wife both have been in a message You're supposed to reconcile with her brother said if your wife's going through the menopause can I just say I don't know if she's going through that if you ever stick with her right stick with her then amen she may go so you're not a Woman by the way you realize that if she's going through that she may go out and run with other men did you know he said that right he said now look if you ever stick with her stick with her then right okay do you know what Jesus Took you you were a fornicator were you living in sin were you born and said shaking what's so good come on why do you come why do you come like yeah and live a sorry life right come on and then you tell me I know I got the Holy Ghost you know in as a pastor you want to say you don't have a revelation of what the Holy Ghost says that's what you want to say but you can't beat everybody down I'm pretty tough but I'm to a point okay so Revelation 4 19 was the bride going up and coming down right 419 he says what's to the Jews right that's correct is that what he said right so what I did I preached the church ages and then I went to Daniel 70 weeks you know what my personal opinion is if you don't if you're the ministers in this message saying I don't mess with you know they've said it I don't mess what is that I don't that's what they in other words they're not they're not gonna make a mess out of it right so am I wrong if somebody help me I I think I know the English language I'm not going to mess with Daniel 70 weeks right is that what they say so you know what I say let's hear this out of the Bible yes if brother Ram's claw was right and it was and 419s to the Jews just tear it out because remember God only deals with the Jews at 490 years right exactly does everybody agree with me amen that's their that's their time set for redemption in the book I'm trying to tear it out now what they got left is one three and 19 and 22. now they're going to tear it out they're going to take out ten seven yeah which was the mighty angel that came down was that a Comey see there's a coming here right there's a coming here right and there's a coming here all right amen does everybody agree with that amen so now then do you understand what Revelation means it's the coming of Jesus Christ amen now you now look go read 10 7. he that Mighty Angel hands the book to you right right it did it say that you're going to go take the hand out of the angel that stood on land and sea and swore by himself right who is that Mighty Angel only Christ it could be you know what you take the book from them and the open book all right Glory you remember brother man said it's become a new book because why it's an open book The Seals have been taken off if the 17 was the coming of the Lord does everybody agree with that right amen I mean I'm looking everywhere because what did he what was the book that was open the book of redemption that's right and look and I told our church I had a guy that was coming for four weeks pulling from me good you know but I don't step around the message I'm gonna feed him the word he's either going to eat the whole book or he's not gonna make it anyway right right you're not gonna make the Rapture eating a half a book right you're not gonna make a well should I say that I'll say it but look if look if Daniel was sealed in 12 4 till the end time does everybody believe that exactly until they're gonna be running to and forever you see everybody running to the pro now right it's all right it's assigned to you we're at the end right right he said now we're gonna put seals on this until the end and they're gonna be running to and fro it's assigned to us right and he said you know what then we're gonna oh we're gonna reveal at the end time well look if you're eating the whole book are you gonna have to eat Daniel 7 weeks right man you take your brother to put that in the message for a filler are you kidding me come on do you know what If you deny Daniel 7 weeks you're taking part of this out and that's right and Revelation says if you add to or take away from this book right right your part will be taken out exactly the pledge will be added to you you understand all right I'm not causing the doctor and I'm not saying the doctrine of Daniel 7 weeks I'm telling you Daniel said it's part of the book all right so you gotta eat that you gotta eat the Rapture book you got to eat spoken words original seeds you got to eat the church there's people won't even pick up the church age book because they said Lee Bell Road yeah well that's Lee boy it's libel it's a commentary Brotherhood said read my book and you'll understand it better that's right that's what he said and people in the message don't open the seals they don't open that do you know what they're doing they're taking their part out they're taking their part out you take your part out Let Me Tell You Folks you better eat the whole book amen already the whole book and that's what the plan and Redemption is all about right and so I started this plan every day I preached eight times when I finally told the church Wednesday night I gotta end it because look if you preached every if you said I'm going to preach on Redemption Church part one he'll be preaching the rest through eternity Redemption because the whole book is Redemption all right I find what I did I started in chapter five I circled around and this fellow was coming to the church all excited pulling I could feel him pulling you know who is you know how I know right I can lift your face yeah that woman smiling she knows she agrees with what I'm saying some of you were like I want a pickle yeah I told our church does it somebody tell me what a good apartment pickle is that's right I have never heard what good a book is on the pickle right your body will respond to the ministry and I'm going to tell you in verse 5 of Revelation when you get what Redemption really is you're going to be a happy happy Church you're gonna come in here going holy holy crap holy under the Lord but you come in here like a bunch of dead beats whatever you come for what you're getting dead right exactly right yes Lord I'm hard aren't right but I'm not hard I love you do you know what chapter three I got through the book around chapter three it says those I love I rebuke right if you've got a preacher it won't rebuke you he ain't preaching chapter three now let me tell you something you rebuke rebuke and they got to repent right and then forgiveness right you know what it says in that scripture you're supposed to forgive a man seven times seven have you ever really read it close have you ever read it said rebuke them and if they repent forgive them all right now I hear people say oh just forgive them now I don't disagree with that but they've got to repent all right the condition of repentance right of forgiveness is him repeatedly exactly that's what justification is repeated right I told him does everybody know in Acts 2 38 it shows justification occasion baptism that one verse what do you have to do repent is that justification he said and be baptized in water that's what you do right right that's an outward show of an inward work now that's something you do there's your three parts program never change that that's right remember that's my message right that is the Plan of Redemption and it goes through the whole book is everybody okay with it so 19 and 22 I haven't got there yet I'll be honest with you but what is it they're coming white horses is that right it's it's Millennium it's the new Heaven A New Earth right and I'm gonna get into that okay amen and then when I do that I have preached all of Revelations right so if you see if you throw your church age book away you see how you took this part out yeah if you throw your future home away you see how you took this out right if you go to so damn 70th week right sure so you think this 70th week of Daniel is just nothing you're crazy that's right right where does the Antichrist you know go up to Rome right and we have the Battle of army savings Peak all right so see if you do it with Daniel 78 you know you do at the battle over again right you do have seven plagues you do away with the three frogs Yeah right right anybody ever understand what brother Graham said to three woes are yeah I'm scattering it but it's the whole book yeah I'm gonna give you a lot you know what brother Ram said the two well he said one woe is over and two's over he said the first one was one was World War One all right does anybody know what happened in World War One really have you ever seen the reason I I did I was somewhere reading and it said the greatest battle World War one was the Battle of Jerusalem yeah did

that body ain't been redeemed yet that's why the devil knocked you around like he does so you're in partial Redemption but one day you're to wit the Redemption of the body you're going to get a new body in a moment the twinkling and high at the Rapture you're going to get a new body right but you know what you're still under partial reduction right right you know that yeah still not done right you know what full Redemption happens when you're standing on that news right exactly amen that's right it was Adam and Eve's before the fall and it's mine yeah it's like brother random could talk to a bull you know I'm gonna talk to a bull that way it might not be here but it will be in anybody he said Adam had the ability to tell Mr lion when him and he was walking down through the Garden of Eden that's what we're doing that's what we're doing right exactly we're going back to the new having a new Earth amen we're gonna be walking down there you know even at Orlando and even go oh I don't

gonna be honest I'm not beating you down I'm trying to condemn you I'm just being honest with you if you're going around sad all the time there's something wrong with your experience right right you need to be happy all right scripture says when the Devil Comes you're supposed to get excited when when it comes and persecutes you yeah right is that right brother Brandon said if everything's going perfect you need to sit down and figure out what's wrong because I don't know about you but those 200 000 000 demons I don't want to check my feet hit the floor in there after me right I look in the mirror it's like oh no I know I'm not in that new body yet so see I'm not going to sit here and say well I believe the message and just park it yeah that's what people in a message do they say I believe the message and they park it they don't serve God enough come on brother I mean oh I feel sorry for God is that possible yeah the way we serve him I feel sorry because he died for us a friend there's no greater thing a friend can do for you to die right has anybody ever looked up what the name Ruth means friend you know Ruth was a friend of God has anybody ever looked up boaz's names means quick quick yeah she was a friend of God and he quickened her all right that's right all right yes amen did you do that all right so the second man was a quick Spirit right okay just the last time Christ in the scripture right amen yes he does there's the types yeah I've never seen it the love story as play as I have this time all right it's excited me guys let me read some quotes can I do that like I said I'm gonna be a while I apologize I don't like let me read a quote out of kinsman oh let me read one out of breach first already quote no already quoted it I'm gonna just kind of quote it and read it a little real quick brother this is the most Sublime thing in the scripture right where I say that that's right that's out of the breach they act but not an angel nothing could do right and the lamb come and took it right from the right of the hand of him that sat on the throne what is it now it belongs to the lamb right right now what did the lamb do in chapter 10 you gave it to you right yeah if it was the most Sublime scripture the sublime book and he had to do the sublime book amen why can't we be happy all right who cares who got elected all right you know what I told him I don't know this is some food for thought okay I want to show you something does everybody believe that Obama's a Muslim sure amen he will he won't admit it but he is do you know he had a false prophet named Muhammad right do you realize America just voted a guy in that has a false prophet all right now I don't know how you voted I'm not into politics I don't care all right amen but anybody listen to this you say well I didn't vote for Obama okay does anybody know Mitt Romney is a Mormon and as a false prophet I do America the best we could come up here was two men with a false prophet now let me ask you something would Elijah have voted for Ahab come on think about it would Ahab would Elijah voted for that that adulterer right do you think he would have do your sister thank you remember Brothers Elijah was the spirit of Christ do you think he'd have voted for that no that's right you know what I told him I said I didn't vote for Obama I didn't vote for Mitt Romney I voted for Christ in his problems he said he overcome yes I can't lose right now we'll be honest with you I'm American this guy here is as American as he can be and I hate the fact we got Obama in there right but I would have hated the fact they would have put mid in there yeah so I'm a soldier I'm a stranger I'm just passing through anyway that's right whoever it is going to get this thing over with get the pressure take the money and breakfast which Obama's doing a fine job that's perfectly fine with me now this is what they say out the world you didn't vote well you ain't got a right to say nothing tell that to Elijah let's just tell them the scripture can we do that face final resting but did Ahab shut his mouth up he went right too and said you can't have yourself your brother's wife you know what he said get Elijah keep his mouth shut you think Elijah would have voted no he wouldn't that's all right these people out in the world are just slap dab and say all right they think because you didn't vote you don't got a right to say nothing go ahead keep John the Baptist siren yeah go ahead keep winning Brown Simon go ahead keep me silent the only way you kill a rooster is ring his neck right that's the only way you can shut this wristband this rooster up right because we're the he's the rooster here and I'm the rooster back there you go that's the only way you shut the restaurant all right all right until I draw my final breath I'm gonna be screaming this message and the final voice is in the bride all right right you're supposed to speak it speaker is possession right right he's possessing it right that's right if you don't speak it God can't bring it to pass all right he sent a church age but if she'll speak it I might perform it I will perform right right if you speak the word Glory you have a promise now I tell the church look promise is a kind of you know you'd probably I don't know if you have any boys yeah you ever take them fishing oh yeah did you ever promise taking fishing and couldn't yeah see your promise is different God's promise let's see our kids when we say promise we think all this is something to come it will happen right I ain't going to tell you something and not do it right so I'm going to tell you you take sauce you're the bride and you believe every word to proceedeth out of the mouth of God right you know if he said it he will perform it it says in the scripture by his stripes I'm Healed now I'm gonna tell you something I got an insulin pump on me a second I have oh man I've been a diabetic for almost 45 you know how much an average a type 1 diabetic Lives 25 years I'm 45.

come back and you love her come on guys let's get this yeah right let's eat the whole book right and we'll get out of here all right if you're just eating part of it and your name's on the book we're gonna stay here until you eat it all right right I'm gonna be here you eat it all right right and that's okay but let's start eating can we do that all right good Lord yes and this story was written in all the old manuscripts when they were segregating the Bible the holy men when they were trying to put it together in the Old Testament The Book of Ruth was one of the outstanding books that they accept it and why it is just a love story why it's just a love story why would writers in ancient sages accept the book as inspired right that was a condition of them putting it into in the Bible does anybody understand that right if they didn't judge it to be inspired they couldn't put it in there right remember in Hebrews 1 what did Paul say it's hundred times God at sundry times moved on to prophets under what inspiration right the Bible was written by inspiration that's what he's saying here right so those old sages put it in there because they thought it was inspired right right right so the Holy Ghost had to move on them too right okay right because listen Sage is acceptable as inspired because there's a hidden revelation in the Book of Ruth there's a hidden revelation right everybody got that and in this hidden revelation you can catch the real meaning the true meaning right and it'll bring you you you real close to God right amen you it's only you okay let's go to the Book of Ruth is going to bring you real close to God yes okay and I pray my whole soul this morning that God will catch every heart so Spellbound I'm going to tell you that's what I am this morning I'm so Spellbound by this man I just oh when I when I was in my back office at church I would just weep I mean it just it just tore me up but you know what there was one day Johnny was weeping yeah yeah right you know why yeah you seen there was a kid's been redeemed right that's exactly John wasn't right wasn't weeping because his name was on the book John was weeping because he seen a man that was worthy right he caught a revelation of the Kinsmen Redeemer all right let me use another example here job you know Joe has anybody suffered like job in the church raise your hand please none of you have right do you know why job suffered so much because God wanted to get him a revelation right right I know what really cool that's right brother you know why you suffer no no God's trying to bring you a revelation and you're so dense you won't get it it's your fault yeah right everybody get what I'm saying all right amen the reason you suffer is because you're a heady high-minded outfit you live at laodicea we know everything we're the most educated people that's ever been on the Earth but we can't keep it simple right right yes so why did Joe go through all that he went all his friends accused him yep he went through boils on his gums are you kidding me yeah has anybody here had a boil on your gum that's where your teeth are sister I'm not talking in here I'm talking on your teeth all right that's rough folks and if I didn't have to eat it'd be rough look at me and tell that all right amen so do you understand with Joe and you know what job finally seen listen to what he did listen to what got job off the ashy brother Randolph said he was sitting on a sheep there was the Thunders and the Lightnings does everybody agree and he caught a revelation yeah when is the Thunders Mysteries is that why until you know the seal is that what he's saying all right he's previewing you that and job he's telling you the story of redemption I understand the Thunders and the Lightnings joke out of Revelation and he stood up off that edge he said I know who lives My Redeemer liveth liveth and in my flesh I shall see him the greatest Revelation that job could have gotten his entire life was that of a redeemer right right now look he knew it had to be a Kinsman not sure he got to revelate the greatest Revelation that he could get was of the Redeemer and of Redemption all right because that's the whole book everybody you understand I can go through the whole scripture you know Moses when he went up to the burning bush he said take off your shoes that's right do you know it was accustomed at Israel when they were doing the work that Kinsman redeemed we had to take off with his shoes I'm gonna tell you something you might not have seen everywhere you see feet in the Bible is who speaks of redemption blessed are the feet right what is the gospel Redemption in that image of Daniel where did that stone hit him right right you know what it's telling you it's the time of redemption Glory look up your Redemption it's near everywhere I can show you that in the go to Psalms there's a scripture I'm quoting a lot of them or I'd have to waste time to do but in Psalms it's talking about redeem and then it talks about feet do you know what feet is it's your balance yep if you got Redemption you're gonna have a balance in the message exactly does everybody understand try it try it but I did it the other day watch me watch me I can't do it very long God gave you two feet right how many parts is Redemption all right okay in and out right God knew what he was doing when he designed you right he wants you to be balanced brother all right we want you to keep a balance in the message hey if you got Redemption you're going to have you know what God hates a skill that doesn't have balance right right yeah right that's you all right you're supposed what does the scale do at judges you're supposed to be balanced he hates it when you're not balanced the whole book brother the whole book's talking about Redemption just open up it just is amazing don't you see Jesus in every chapter every verse everybody he is the Kinsman redeemers Bible is about Redemption the whole book and that's what you look every Prophet every Sage wanted to be sitting right here at Lulu sure hard to imagine isn't it right but some of you won't even come half the time a third of the time oh what was the one that went across the desert yeah remember the Queen of Sheba remember she went across the desert took her three months to do it yeah to come to one of Solomon's meetings right a greater than Solomon is right here right does everybody get what I'm saying a greater than Solomon is here is that what his title was amen and yet you will come to church you need to check up on yourself if you missed search one time you're out I'm not legalist okay I understand if Mama's dying she wants you there by the way don't get ridiculous right but when you if you could be here you better be here right all right but some of you are playing games is what you're doing and you can be here and you know you can and you're not trying sanctification is you serving and ministry right do you know that the bride ministers under the Lord amen sure you want Ministry is Sir you think this guy because he's a minister you serve him you got it backwards then right this guy's a minister he is greatest among you let him be servant of all right right exactly this guy is a minister because he ministers under you right right you're the bride and you Minister unto him sisters how you serve your husbands how you serve God I'm going to tell you what I'm gonna eat I get all the way down okay if it gets you repent that's all I care okay sister you don't keep a good house brother have said the way you serve your husband's way you serve God right Paul said a woman's supposed to be a keeper at home the Brotherhood preach what Paul preach right right I went into some people who claim this message house and I'm afraid to go back and you sisters call yourself a real Christian and you don't keep your husband's house you need sister you better get checked out amen you you know I doubt you know honestly people say I believe the message what they're really saying they got the Holy Ghost yeah isn't it really really brother say to know what they're saying yeah and they don't even know how to do the ABCs yet we've been 40 years in this message and you don't have to Do's an adult yet all right but you oh yeah really I mean I I hate to be negative but I doubt you Holy Ghost you know what I mean because whatever's on the inside of you is going to come up all right don't be hitting it right whatever's on the inside now you're not gonna perfect this all right but it's going to get close before we get out of here they mistook brother Branham for Jesus Christ right that's right they baptized in his neck how many of them baptized in your name lately so I must have a ways to go but that man got real close does everybody understand right that's what we're supposed to do I want to get back can I get back to the Rapture it is the whole book if I preach Redemption and I say now I'm gonna preacher I'm gonna finish it today I'll be nuts we'd have to break into Eternity for you to get the whole story exactly because the whole book is going to finish today right but you've been preaching them too I can't preach anything different what he preached and I'm not right I'm just doing my little local bonics way okay it'll give you a different angle to see it okay but people let's get let's get real about it let's let's go back today and say are we mystified all right are we really Justified that's right are we really Sanctified or are we really are we really serving him right are we doing everything that we can do you know what serving is can I tell you what survey is integrity right are you honest with everybody come on even an unbeliever see some people well you're a brother I can do your right you're a brother now that guy out there he's Cannon fought her so I treat him like a hound dog really they must have missed 316 God so loved the world right exactly and you'll spend a bad deal I know people that are spun bad deals on Believers in the church you know what Dan disagree no not a bit honesty is integrity right abimelech brother M said in one place he's an Egyptian king did you know that Egyptian pharaoh right you always said that here was a guy going to take Abraham's wife but he was honest he had never took her if she had known he was had to live with a husband what God Said I knew the I see the Integrity of your heart that's why I'm here to save you if you didn't have this honesty I'd let you die right you know what part of sanctification is integrity glorious brother said a man is as good as his word right if you give your brother your word you brother like you all right okay I'll wreck my car I bring it to you say I will do this this and then I'm going to give you uh I'm gonna put four new tires on it new hubcaps and then I find out you went down to the Hubcap City bought a beat up old hubcap that's taking off a wreck you're not honest you don't have integrity and you need to get Integrity because that's a part of sanctification that whatever you say it's that way right has everybody got that that's Integrity folks Ruth had Integrity when I read Ruth you remember what I'm putting together now you're going to see real play brother man said you will understand Redemption Story the greatest love story in the Bible all right better all right when you get because it's a perfect right the perfect type a Redemption is in Ruth is that right you agree with that amen right okay no one's uh I'm a reactor talk all the time you can't shut a preacher up guys did you know that kid and now here's one I really want to I want to read kinsman redeemer now many reading the Bible read it just stand up read a page and read a page you'll never get it because it's in riddles and Jesus thank God for God affirmly did right you've hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and we'll reveal it unto babes such as we'll learn as I've often said in Mrs Brown I'm sitting back there this morning but when I'm overseas she'll write me a letter all right I'll write me a letter she'll say dear Bill I'm sitting here tonight with the children I'm thinking of you I hope my wife today Charleston's thinking of me that's right I sure am Grover I miss her amen I really miss her and she'd go ahead and write and she's going to but I love her you see the first one I love her and I know her now let me tell you something about the word I know people don't understand you know what the word I know means Faith it's a revelation exactly the woman listen listen close the woman said if if I can Touch the Hem of His Garment I know right I'll be healed do you know what she had a revelation amen she said if I could just touch and she did everything she could was she healed now look your wife that letter she's going to love him you're going to love Jesus Christ amen right but you're also going to know him you're going to have a revelation do you understand that yeah and let me tell you what a revelation did you know what brother and I may say yes I may be ahead brother Ram said love is confidence all right if you got confidence in your husband you love me if you don't you don't really love me that's right do you know God has confidence in you brother Glory he's counting on you he loves you and he has confidence and you're going to do what he said that's the kind of he put He has so much confidence you put your name in a book that's confidence so you know what it's love first of all she loves you second of all she knows it see that you could say you know what scripture says you can know all the Mysteries come on is it that no one but if you have not charity right you're like a tinkly you're just a noisy person in a message church right right so see you can you can I know but you gotta love him right remember the first part of what it's quote is here she loves me and she knows me there's what it takes for you you understand right he's talking about the kids with Redeemer there's the part that you need to have brother you need to love him and you need to know him right right see if you're a friend if you're Ruth and you're a friend a free man tells a friend everything if some of you say this person in the Church of friend you tell them something they tell me that ain't free yeah as a Trader well it is so see Ruth was the friend of God Glory a Boaz and Boaz quickened her it's the honest it's the most Sublime Revelation chapter five but then he in a book doesn't go right back to Ruth right exactly sure so look at everything he says in chapter five he goes to Ephesians one number four through eleven those he did presents he for me right he puts your name in a book for the fact that's Redemption he's talking about Redemption all the way back there all right he knew what you would do and he made a way just like he did in Israel he gave him the land but he knew they had given up right come on he gave you the Holy Ghost he knew you'd still mess yourself up right yeah amen he's dead but he said but you know what I'm gonna give him Redemption all right so yeah okay you're in the land right you possess the land you got the Holy Ghost isn't that your Holy Ghost but you're still gonna mess up people think when you got the Holy Ghost you're Mr Perfect are you kidding me you can't perfect yes what's perfect what's in you it's going to get close now I'm going to tell you but you ain't gonna finally you're look this is what I told them the other day you know what people think the rebel what the Rapture is but it is brother man said it but what it is that we misinterpret it with our own theology brother I said the the Rapture is a revelation a singular you know what we're doing in master churches we're clowning around until we get that one Revelation come on when I get that Revelation somebody comes forth preaching two Lords oh that's it we jump on her ship this is the rapture wrong all right it's not one dot we are not making Daniel Sammy week a doctorate amen it's part of the player Redemption I eat the whole book right I'm not gonna sit here day after day after day doing Daniel 70 weeks right I'm gonna do chapter four Revelation which is the rehearsal and Rapture is that what he said right chapter five most Sublime is that what he said which is a Plan of Redemption the greatest love story there is all right chapter five in the Book of Ruth right right but people sat here because some of you might be sitting here today I'm not an accuse her I'm just being honest okay and you're sitting here clowning around like a great big bosel the Clown not a message believer but a clown that's the spirit of America brother I said Spirit America is going hahaha laugh at all right do something stupid and laugh it off you ain't repenting that's right repentance is a far cry from laughing at all right you need to get out and get a good old-fashioned repentance get down to the altar your heart's your altar buddy it's not some wooden something in a church that's right but that's what we need to get to as a church you understand that right we need to get to repent you know justifications every day of your life you know sanctifications every day you guys still serve until the day you Rapture out tonight all right you'll have did you baptism it only goes one day I get a refilly every day everybody they got this they got oh yeah they got this one Revelation and they're gonna get rapture and that's why they go from this one Doctrine to this come on they went from perusion to two Lords to the son of man some of them Daniel 70 weeks one one after another and it don't take a Rapture right right right that's right that's right cool it's true it's going to take you believing yep partaking eating of every word is that right and you're going to put Flesh on this book you don't want when you eat something it becomes you no wonder brother Graham said she is him it's got to be you all right you have to start being written Epistles written right above me right your life speaks louder than your words that's right tell me you believe and pull some of the pranks you doing Brothers I don't believe you yeah I'm gonna be honest with you it sounds tough don't it when you get home would everybody do me if I read the rest of Leviticus 25. you know what it goes into you can't treat a brother wrong if if I bought you out of hawk and you come back to pay me back if I build a barn on that land you're supposed to give me the over plus yeah you're not supposed to spend a deal on me right you know what you know what I call them brother-in-law deals yeah anybody ever dealt with your brother-in-law I have and never come out right for me I'm going to tell you there's some people in the message that have pulled some brother-in-law deals and that I'm going to tell you something and you may think I'm funny and I'm being hard but if you're a part of redemption you ain't gonna spend a deal on a brother right right you're gonna love everybody yeah it's the greatest love story look if you love your brother could you take his wife no that's right come on remember Jesus said that the two Commandments it's all wrapped up right right love the Lord thy God and love your brothers yourself how could I take a man's wife if I love him right how could I steal his horse if I loved him right right you understand right so you tell me you've got the greatest story Redemption and it lives in you and you spit a brother wrong you need to get in an altar brother that's right I'm not saying you can't repent but we need to wake up right we've got so common with the message all we do is we come to church we hear him preach he does all your studying he does all your praying he's your pope whoever you are the scripture says to study to show yourself amen now that's what my Bible says Brethren said pray read your Bible every day see I told the church when I took it I'm not a pope I'm not going to do all your praying that's good I'm not going to do all your stuff if you do you do Pope and I'm never going to become a Poe right so I recommend that you start doing the bride I'm gonna say it again the bride hath made herself ready right you know what herself is exactly certification she's doing something all right sanctification is what you'd now do all right don't go crazy with me I understand we're Sanctified by the blood amen right right we understand that but if you go through all the quotes didn't Brethren say second patient serve me right I prove it rude I'm not I'm not clowning what I say that I could prove what I'm talking about so there is see Church wake up there is some Shake Yourself people please all right amen and realize there is something that you are required to do right it's a requirement God didn't put all these quotes out there for me and you to fight for me and you to fight a bunch of preachers for me and you to take a club and beat the brother up on the fourth row that's not what I'm here to do right right you understand but you know what if I got a pound of pound a square peg and a round hole to get you to get it I'm gonna get a bigger Hammer all right because we're gonna do it because you know what I want to see every one of you in this congregation man you know why I want you to make it because I love you right right if he loved the whole world why would I spit a bad deal I just you know I've seen so many bad deals in the message I've been here 27 years and I see I'm going to make your hair curl right yeah you know it's rough like brothers treating brothers that way yeah you know since operated Leviticus 25 you know what I'm gonna say you spent a brother and I'm not talking about it brother I'm talking about they got the same father is everybody understand that right and you spin them wrong you do a raw deal on them I really doubt your Redemption all right can I just get it down to where we're living right I doubt your Redemption right if this guy is a preacher done a bad deal on you right yeah I would doubt where he's at you know I'm not saying he's lost but he sure needs to move up all right right so we we need to really we need to we need to slow down Brethren said if I can get this ride to slow down she she's not gonna be running to and from right chapter four is that what it says in Daniel let me run into and fro if I can hit this slow down I'm dressed yeah exactly yeah I'll get you the Holy Ghost you understand if you can slow down if you listen to this message and serve all right amen that's sanctification folks let's see what happens is they take the quote well justification or sanctification made way for which it is just in case you may wait the same case citation made away from baptism Holy Ghost and then that made a way for the person the person right right well so what they say is well I got the person what means they're not don't Justified anymore because you know it made way it did say it did away yeah right it didn't say it blocked it off right see what happens is we got a people out there don't know the message right right you're still supposed to be justified you're still supposed to be Sanctified living in everyday cleansed life right right sanctification is cleansing right right and you're supposed to live in every day simple Christian right Christian means christ-like by the way life and we missed it somewhere maybe we looked at all these great Revelations I know you have brother Samuel because it's the hour of it right I know brother Satan was a man of God I know I'm talking to him I know I know where he's at Amanda yes sir he's preaching all these great things and you can't live a little simple Christian Life right right you need to get yourself down an altar somewhere right you need to get yourself cleaned up that's what you need to do there's something you can do and you need to do it right right and I tell you that right is everybody okay with what I'm saying okay oh we just man we just don't forget the ditch from what you've been dubbed right yes all right Ruth a type of a Believer now okay what is the believer when she or he comes out now he's saying what's a Believer right now we're all saying I believe the message yeah right right let's see let's see by quote if you do when she or he comes out the person from the world yeah are you out of the world that's he comes in amongst Christian Believers so you got to separate your old junkie friends out there in the world and you know I see these young people that you know they really want they want it but they're not willing to separate from unbelief that is justification you've got to come out from the world of things right and to do that I hate to say it you're a Believer and believing this message is very much Associated to you all right yeah that guy out in the world drinking smoking running to women is very much associated with him right you can't run with a dog that's got fleas and not get fleas so the first thing is justification you've got to get yourself separated right right there are a lot of message leaders I hate separated yet folks I know some people say they believe the message I still smell smoke on them I never knows see this nose it smells good it is a good smelling nose and when I shake your head get a whiff of smoke constantly not once where you've been with somebody so I'm telling you tell off on yourself you really do you can't fool a preacher you fool a lot of people you ain't go full with this guy when she or he comes out the person from the world he comes in amongst Christian Believers women that used to smoke right drink and play cards and societies and so forth and have all listen to this now your sister don't get mad at me I didn't say it I'm just reading what he said he's talking about sister and have all kinds of fancy stuff huh he said I didn't all sorts of all kinds of fancy stuff and like some kind of a frizzed up bird hey yeah has anybody been to a message Church where you're sitting in the and you can't see over his sister's hair that's a frizzed up Bird come on you're laughing sister you're laughing you've been there haven't you have you been to a message Church where they got their frizzed up here and you can't see the guy you're going like this that's frizzed up sister I'll just give you the definition okay but now she's changed he's made a decision to go with God now she comes into a people that doesn't believe that kind of stuff a people yeah right right so whoever in here that's a Believer Christian but you don't believe that stuff right and when she comes in if she's you know I've got women sometimes come and wear pants do you think I preach pants Adam and do I look stupid no I preached salvation to her right but when they look around and all of our sisters are wearing dress all of our sisters haven't cut their hair all of our sisters doesn't wear makeup now brother you don't have to preach these things if these guys are living right exactly you don't have to if you'll live it right but if half of you on one side is all painted up like a jezebel got your hair all frizzed up it got jewelry one like you went through a magnet with a 10 cents towards a magnet on what do you think that sister's gonna get out of your life right what do you think she's going to go your life speaks louder than your words so you know what he's banking on you're going to be Christian Believers so when that guy comes in here they're going to see how you live and they're going to come back the next time and they're not going to wear it fast right and some women don't come once wearing pants they'll come twice but I've never seen them the third time right they're going that's right you know women look at women anybody I work I was in a group of 75 or three men in it and I want women when another woman goes by they'll go you do that don't you you're a woman you do that don't you admit it she does it do you think that unbelievable unbelieve the church he don't look every one of you women over yeah all right come on and you look like a bunch of boat no you don't I'm saying if you did like I better watch out if you look like Bozo the Clown what do you think that woman the third time's gonna come looking like oh so the clown right yeah so when she looks at you she says oh she separated out of the world you see what I'm saying she's coming amongst Believers and now she wants to be a part right that's what sanctification is you understand okay amen she's a stranger she got to walk as a pilgrim she doesn't know their Customs okay that was Ruth you think when Ruth's coming to Israel then women yeah I guarantee they were that's a woman I don't care I don't care I don't care my wife will tell me she said did you see I said no I'm preaching I can't attend to what sister Soul's got away I don't know that's just the women but see I'm showing you you women look at other women sure yeah that's that's okay that's the way it's both that's when that sister comes into church she's gonna be looking at you that's why it's very important sister you live the love of this message because if there's one of you that don't she's live will be looking at you right that's right and her blood will be on your hands one day it's a seriously all right that's what Ruth had to do that's what you have to do right that's what I have to do right when I accepted Christ I was turned out of my own home this is run around did you know miles right listen when I accepted Christ I was turned out of my own home when I accepted Christ my boyfriends girlfriends you young guys here in Maine yeah your boyfriends your girlfriends everybody throwed me down everybody used to hear what I'm saying hey everybody throwing me down right I went in with a bunch of old people gotta get to the next page and had the Holy Spirit okay and believed in God what did Brother Branham do he separated himself he went in with friends he moved in with some old people in the spirit of God right good place to be right right that's what they do out there they come out of the world they come here they see you sisters and a brother see you and they see you somewhere yeah you owned a parts store and you jipped them boy now that's going to be good yeah yeah and you're a deacon here no less antigens aren't exam remember brother Brown said they raided the bar for more deacons at a local church hey Deacon is just it's just a title for us but there ought to be a life with it right okay believe in God serving him the girls was down there in that church was different than what girls I'd been going with they looked different yep they acted different they were strange and I was scared of them this is Brother Rams this is not my it's him he was scared of them because they were different so when you get a visited sister in here so the world she's really scared of you right right that's why you gotta you gotta project that Christian the holy ghost that you got right you've got to project that let that emanate from you you understand what she wants to be with you right amen that she don't want to be out there right right that's what you people are supposed to do right that's Ruth folks you understand that's you be you big wife of Jehovah right right that's what you are

respect been your undivided attention this man has spent time studying praying over the word and he knows that what he's preaching this today myself I know that this is important I know this man has

Brothers same to us so I'm gonna preach what brother Samuel to give him a revelation I can't give him a reference right you understand there's no Great Woods Among Us right the only great one Among Us is Jesus Christ we need to understand that people we really need to understand that right and you know I know I've been hard I know hard oh I try to hate myself sometimes you know brother random went home he said why do I preach like right why do I rebuke you don't understand that he said it sure go listen to it on tape why do I review him I love them remember the preacher said why don't you keep rebuke and women why don't you teach them how to get the gifts how to do he said because you won't I'm not saying he won't you know what I mean but look and I'm gonna say it again because it just really when I did the church is so astounding to me in the third chapter under our messenger it said those I love I reviewed does anybody hold your hand up know of anybody and laodicea that rebuked the people anymore William Brown that's the truth brother right do ya all right well when the sales room he said a thousand of my friends have left them so you had when this book of redemption was open his friends left yeah is that what I just read all right when you hit the book of redemption the friends of Romania all right now you love them but they're going to leave you the only way they're

needs a little pay somebody please find that quote for me that's right nope but I can tell you brother Brandon said hello Miss dog week yeah see we're supposed to go to the unity and we're supposed to be saying what that'll take right come on this this love story this Redemptive story is supposed to become real to you right that's right it's supposed to be made flesh to you right that's exactly it becomes so real to her that she would leave her mobile Kingdom and she liked it all behind right right you maybe think she had some sisters down there guys well you know she probably had a moment Daddy yeah at least yeah it's uncles she you know some of you here remember the apostles when he said well we want this you know The Mother We want our boys to sit on your right hand right yeah and
