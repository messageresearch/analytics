Romans 7. in Exodus 19. I believe that all announcements we're supposed to make and to have Matthew and Brittany and baby Ace with us today too they're up with us glad to have them you know let's see there's something else that I'm trying to remember that uh brother came by the office a while ago and I said hey wait a minute I got to tell you something but I don't forgot what it is I'm 73. you know I remember it after a while okay Romans 7 and exodus 19. Lord Jesus we thank you Father for your grace and your love into it thank you for all the things that you've given unto us thank you for giving our brother and sister an opportunity to bring children forward because we know that they were told that they couldn't have them but yet we believe you and you've taken care of all things because you show yourself unto us and you make known the things that are impossible to man but all things are possible to you and then you turn right around and said all things are possible to them that believe so we thank you we Praise Your Great Name come now and speak to us as we read your word and then come and give us lord of the understanding forgive our sins and may your grace and love be with each one of us in Jesus name amen Romans 7 we've been on this for quite a while now and we're we're still speaking on marriage and divorce and you say well you've you're on this and you're on the law and you're on the things and yeah and that's why we're still on marriage and divorce because marriage and divorce tires ties into our Bible together from Genesis to Revelation is marriage and divorce to see what God has extended the grace unto us of all the things okay Romans 7 know you're not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how does the law had dominion over a man as long as he lived remember over mankind as long as he lives he's under the law you said no the law ended at Calvary I got a quote from the prophet amen just keep on reading you'll find him saying some things to you because if Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to them that believe if we're not a Believer the law is still in existence that's where the problem is mankind wants to do away with things you'll see that as we keep going along in it that we you know wanting something to do we want to change it off or something and God has already got it set knows what it's going to be all right now watch he illustrates around said this is not necessarily he said well sure this is wrong marriage and divorce invisible Union he's speaking of it but he said really this is a prophecy of sitting in order of scriptures all right so what you're going to illustrate it for the woman which hasn't heard when it's bound by the law to her husband as long as he live it but if the husband be dead she is loose from the law of her husband so then if while her husband lives she'd be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she has no adulteress though she be married to another man now watch wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law how by the body of Christ so he's speaking of the body of Christ he's not speaking of just the woman part you know all right he's illustrating that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are to now we are delivered from the law how because of the body of Jesus Christ because of being saved what that being dead we're in we were held that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the oldness of the letter all right let's go back and we pick up from Exodus 19. we all well know what this party is it's a prophet told us that Israel made their fatal mistake here so let's go back and read it and just pick up a thought and try to continue on with what we're on so we're going to Exodus 19 verse 3. and Moses went up unto God and the Lord called unto him out of the mountain saying Thou shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and tell the children of Israel now listen he telling them who they are how great of people they are what All Things Are what you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and I'll bear You On Eagle's Wings and brought you unto myself now therefore if you will obey my voice indeed and keep my Covenant and you shall be up to you remember that's an unconditional Covenant we'll get to that in a second all right you'll be a peculiar treasure unto me above all people for all the Earth is mine and you shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and holy nation these are the words which Thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel and Moses came and called for the Elders of the people and laid before their faces all these words which the Lord commanded him and all the people answered together and said all that the Lord has spoken we will do and Moses returned the words of the people unto the Lord you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been in this for quite a while and trying to express some thoughts and ideas and uh but I want you to think about something I didn't finish up the message Wednesday night as you know I never do I generally get up to a point and have to stop because time runs out but we were talking Wednesday night about an unconditional Covenant now what is this an unconditional covenant mean to you well brother Dale it means that God gave me a covenant and it's unconditional okay now precede with that thought and express what you're saying unto me of what I asked the question well it means there's no regulations there's no rules there's no thoughts there's no nothing's well you know not going off on the Baptist but they had a Doctrine of call once saved always saved and in that Doctrine it was that if he was ever once born again you would always be born again well I'd agree with him if you know when I did back there and argued with him over some things even before I was you know if I heard of this message really because I never did accept that point because I'd always seen there where the scripture said he that believeth amen and that's what I asked the Baptist preacher one day about it and he couldn't answer it I said why does the Bible say believeth and you keep saying believe I mean you just say all I got to do is believe you know and I said how come it is it's talk to us like that when the Bible says believeth right and it's baptized shall be saved and he honestly admitted he said I don't understand of course he didn't change anything because that would have changed his status you know as a pastor but what do we think about an unconditional Covenant this is not the message this morning I hope may just be the message I may take this thought because it's there uh what do you think an unconditional Covenant is well he just gave it to Abraham and and he gave adam a covenant and Adam broke it you know we quote brother random coming down and said he seen that every time he made a covenant said he gave it on over and come through Noah and the things you know the Covenants and said always man would break the Covenant you know and do wrong that's true man so he comes to Abraham and he said Abraham I've already done it it's a finished product and right around called it an unconditional Covenant right he said Abraham that's not what you do or have done I've already done it now does that give us a license to go out and do wrong it was what I was trying to express Wednesday night does he give us a right to just well it don't matter what I do or what you know it's unconditional well I know I'm a strange old bird sorry I've been this way a long time and I imagine I'll stay this way and I have an odd way of expressing things but like sister Gail says brother they'll make you think well all right that's my purpose that's what I'm for to make you think we have two three three School teachers here I know and uh they want their children to think because in engaging their minds are getting a thought in together with it you know you can you can get to the mind of the children and be able to help them but what do you think about an unconditional Covenant there would be no way that it could make it that we could just go live like we want to live now the prophet said if you live like you want to live it proves you're lost so do we do we need those quotes do we need those thoughts or do you believe it like it truth of what it is the Bible says here if you live like the devil you are the devil perforations in the Lord's Prayer you can't serve God and man them you know the world all right but yeah we live in the world but we're not bound for the world all right that's where I try to maybe I shouldn't uh like that you know we're in the world we're we're on every line of what would be called the world ma'am you know the the things but the Bible says we're not of the world all right now without an understanding of that where we left but see that's what I try to do is get you to think things over you see this afternoon the Lord willing when we get down to it you'll see maybe why we've been around here about 40 years 40 something years after the profit's gone it's our fault it's certainly not God was ready to deliver Israel with Moses right but yet things got all messed up 40 years later before Moses came back all right but just think now as I said now I keep stating that to where it stays in your mind we don't believe in just living like the devil and calling ourselves Christians we believe in living the best we can in life but yet realizing that we're going to make mistakes and we cry out for forgiveness not like people would say well what I need to be as forgiveness for God is unconditional you see then you're teaching the children they can just live like the devil and you're saved anyway because they go to church they're named on the book well see that's organized religion and we'll see that's death as the prophet would call it but what about an unconditional Covenant see this is what I was holding off and I knew it'd take a long time to try to express it and it may take this morning but an unconditional Covenant well that means there's no conditions whatsoever a condition was required now listen a condition was required and met before you could have an unconditional Covenant right it was required that God come and deal with Abraham or Abram as we call him and there's word what I want you to look at is something to look at things instead of this well it's just unconditional I just believe the Bible well amen I believe right around especially well amen but has it been revealed to you a lot of difference in the two thoughts right Prophet expressing it if I don't get to it he said there's two classes of people he said one class of people says I go to church I do this I do that I do these things and watch it he said the other class just because within me there's something different I go to church and I do this and I don't do that now what's the difference in the two people can you look at the two people and see the difference no because they're setting in the pews but one of them because of a book of rules is sitting there a law the other one is sitting there because of Grace that has been extended into their heart and from the heart they want to go to church but you know it's hard to read people's faces if I spoke a lot of times here and you know and I look back at you and I'd say well brother College sure ain't agreeing with me because he's frowning it might be hurting might not have a thing in the world to do with expression on his face I can't read them I can't read who comes in the door and stays and who goes out but I've always expressed to you and I wonder why it is but seemingly those who are just at a state of sanctification they want to go to church more than those that claim to be born again right because that's the religious side but truly what does it mean an unconditional Covenant and they had that and wanted something else right that's why I said you read in Exodus without brother Branham I don't know of any author that I've ever tried to read of any footnotes of things or Scofield or some of these other few that I have none of them picked it up that Israel made the greatest mistake of their life that's right he said before Calvary because that's when they turned him down but they made the greatest mistake of their life by choosing law but can you read the Bible and show me that no I got to take what brother Brown says and then I go from what he said I can go back to the Bible then and see because if you read it if you read with me there God is explaining how beautiful perfect Israel are a kingdom of priests a royal priesthood as you take other scriptures explaining how beautiful they look to him and they said but we want something to do right it looks like they're wanting to he wanted them to them because he had said if you keep my Covenant that's what he said now what Covenant is he speaking of he's not speaking of the Covenant with April without him because that and done been broke he was speaking of the unconditional Covenant that he gave the children of Israel then it looks like they wanted to do what he wanted him to do right that's just why I expressed that see you got one group that goes to church and everything but you got another group that goes to church one of them does it by Grace the other one does it by law or works or have to you know what they're both doing they're both trying to serve God true that's right but now here's my thought I laid it down a little bit Wednesday night and I really didn't see the full understanding myself to finish it but I knew there would be I have to be a finish to that message Wednesday so we'll just take it this morning call it part two brother Joe of the unconditional Covenant again because I'll never get on my other notes but you talk about an unconditional Covenant yet it required a savior now that's not on your part all right now still unconditional right it's on God's part right because the only way that he could make an unconditional Covenant was to make an atonement are you following me then you realize that to Abram I say that because a lot of people you know they'll say oh you don't even know who you're talking about Abraham you notice right around him a lot of times he called in Abraham when he's ready to talk about Abram or vice versa that's all right but I say it that way purposely to keep you to hang on to it the code that was made with Abram in his name was changed Abraham because it started a long time before that you read in about Genesis there when he comes down and divides the birds and makes the Covenant you see Church if we think that in unconditional Covenant allows us to just be able to do anything we want to and still be saved then we're totally missing amen the entire thoughts of redemption salvation what God done go to his unconditional then why did he have to come down and finally be sacrificed for you and I so you probably thought of what's he talking about a minute ago when I said an unconditional Covenant was based upon a condition the condition was that God had to do it you agree with that now aren't you following me God done it now then before Exodus 19 where they chose law and after Exodus 19. and today it is still an unconditional Covenant go Jonah 2 and 9 says salvation is of the Lord it's unconditional but it costs the life of almighty God to bring that into being now which came first Grace or law well see if you can't back up any further than Genesis you'll find out that God made a sacrifice so that was Grace but if you can back up enough into God's mind and you know about Revelation 13 8 and you'll find it I believe that's right where it says our names were written in the land book of life that was slain before the foundation of the world Amen and then go back and listen to the prophet and you'll hear him talking especially about the old black brother the first one he heard you know and said he took his text of up in heaven he said he spoke of the oldest religion there is in the world he said salvation Christianity because see before the world was over God knew in his mind the world ever started got you in his mind what he was going to do and wasn't going to do now then an unconditional Covenant wouldn't be based upon what we look at it as our human terminologies right right or we'd be totally out of the scripture now the prophet's message see then somebody thought well I got the scripture and I got all the quotes that says it don't matter what I do or don't do that's right and what you do or don't do it matters what God done then I must accept what God done yes right right you remember Wednesday if a pardon is not a pardon until received is a pardon then go set in the jail of the world as I said about the man if the man would have simply walked out and cooked the paperwork he would have never been killed right but he wouldn't do it he would not accept a pardon that's right right see God gave us a pardon but if we don't accept it it's not his fault that's right but now here's what point I was trying to drive that Wednesday we accept God yes but why is it that that a lot of the churches the world the religious Realms and Etc as Billy Graham says 30 000 converts in one meeting and come back and can't find dirty why Yep they're going off and they're all going to heaven because nobody goes to hell no more they're gonna have to do away with it did you heard that brother they'll start a new doctrine they're going to do away with hell everybody else says hell's already here we're living in it you know now that's the doctrine in the message my reason to say this because there ain't gonna be nobody's foot there all right you ain't been to a church in a long time been to a funeral you ever heard of a person preached into hell this person's going to hell no they paid the parking lot they painted the church they done something they gave two dollars an offer and play they believed right the prophet of God made an outstanding or two outstanding statements it really caught with me when I first started studying the message first he said you never saw God right that's right I remember crying and praying and all other things don't you said you never saw God right right he said God sought you then one day I realized it and read the scripture where it says the goodness of God is what leadeth us to repentance it's not the goodness of man it's the goodness of God that leads us to repentance all right now then the other one was and when he said you accept God but he says has God accepted you know as I told you and I still got around looking up the scripture I figured somebody tell me that scripture they're in the book of Acts one time they were praying for the Holy Ghost to come on in people these were born again Christians they were the people of God acts 10 acts 10 acts 10. all right the whole chapter they were actually praying for these people to get the Holy Ghost they were born again filled with the Holy Ghost Christians well yes you couldn't get the Holy Ghost come on you remember that they call for John and who was it when the other Peter Peter and John or Peter called for Peter and they came down and now they got the Holy Ghost who was it in Peter's hands no come on let me open the door to the first that still ain't it yet Peter probably preached him a sermon because nobody gets the Holy Ghost without hearing the word first then you show me that in the Bible or brother runs message either and when they said a few words and laid hands on the Holy Ghost came on not be christianizing the others it was praying it was just something wrong and I come along here I am a resort on with the people but I had people to pray for me for two years everywhere I went I had to come in this message and not as a Baptist deacon at 23 years of age and talked to adults Sunday School classes and everything else when I come in this message I realized I wasn't born again I realized I'd come through justification and sanctification when brother started talking about the new birth I realized I didn't have it where everybody else said they had it cause it come into Mass speech I had to pray for me everywhere brought him out one day he said brother Dale the Holy Ghost is a person he's a person of Jesus Christ which is the word that God reveals into your heart there it was my wife and I both received at the same time why because it's just something wrong with what had been said to me we'll get to that later about organized religion and how they blind us this book The Prophet says they drive us away from the truth but yet we think they're trying to save us and they're doing the best they can we're not against that yeah what is an unconditional Covenant whatever I mean there are no conditions to it well I just brought your condition it meant God we see that wasn't on me and you that's on him so it's unconditional it means you got to check it right pardon another pardon let's receive this one you got to accept it that's right okay looks like a pretty good condition don't see where we mess up is is is the fact that he must accept us then that made my conditions out of non-existence all I'd done was accepted him for what he done for me but when he accepted me he gave me the new birth he gave you the new birth and doing that then now in the New Testament I want this I want to find it in the prophet I want to find it in the Bible that after you're born again I want you to talk to me about an unconditional Covenant after you're born again after you're born again you're only Born Again In Your Soul you're not born again in your body in your spirit right that's right not my body is born again not my spirit it's in my soul then my soul starts working back outwardly right it I automatically receive all of these virtues just because I got born again if I did why did Peter talk about it why did bread around him preached a message and said we didn't all right after you're born again it's not conditions I know that's hard to follow sometimes I don't serve God out of conditions do you know I don't go to church out of conditions you know what I mean well you know I need to go I want to go maybe ought to do this I want to live right see you're making it things that it's not involved in it but from the inward part of me something says there it is and when I was in the Baptist I didn't lay out a church my wife and I were talking the other day about something and even today if we take a vacation there's always a relationship to a church somewhere to go and come back even the kids the other day we said we're going to take off for a week or two you're going to leave while we're having service because they know it's never happened but if we do we'd be sitting listening to you are in a church somewhere because I've never had to do somebody tell me you need to go to church right you don't have to tell me to pay my time I didn't come in the message to learn these things you know you didn't have to tell me that if you tear down the man's fence I've heard sermons on that you know you need to go put it back up you didn't have to tell me that when I was a kid if I tore down a neighbor's fence you better believe I put it back up if I didn't I had to go get his cow put it back in the pasture go apologize to him and then I got a whooping when I got home so you didn't have to tell me no I wasn't supposed to do this or do that we had already started since during our TV before we ever heard of the prophet wouldn't let them watch certain things you see because I always believe that's a Christian Life to Live Like a Christian all right what you see once you get born again it's not a condition I don't serve God to try to appease him you know maybe that's a bad word to use you know or satisfying or or whatever you want to use the word I do it because I love him I don't try to live good because I'm trying to appease some God you'll find out when we get in the message this afternoon maybe that that's what the children of Israel wanted you know what they really wanted I put this in and then get to it this evening give us something to do you know what they wanted they wanted to be like the neighbors around them that built the idols and made their gods and bowed before them and come on second stage was what give us a king right that's right see you'll see a long time together and we'll find out we're just a bunch of organized religion is what we are ain't nothing wrong with organism there's a lot wrong with organization all right let's get back on the talk he realized it when we become a Christian then we serve God from the heart then if I make a mistake come on if you make a mistake what do we do well they don't make no difference I'm safe anyway I just made a mistake okay I can read the prophet he said it wasn't better than what I do or don't do no that proves there's something wrong with the inward man because immediately when you do something wrong you repent right if you don't there's something wrong with that inside well you're making it on conditions relevant God gave it to me the word that he gave me the way to live it come on your Prophet said if you want it no man could keep the law the law is a policeman to put you in jail and nobody could keep it that's right Paul the greatest of all of them said what I thought to be life keeping the law he said I found to be death read the Bible a little so then when we get over into the new birth is it conditions no no it's not conditions it's like the prophet said he said if I go overseas it's gonna take my wife sit down we pray he said I don't say now if you do something around me don't I'll divorce you she grabbed me you do something wrong with it no he said no it's not the way right he said if I go over there and do something wrong and come home and explain it to my wife he said I believe she'd forgive me but he said how could I do it knowing she would now the Earth's where the catch is right he said well don't matter what I've done I know I I know I I don't know something wrong there but I'm saved well anybody said he was lost but just remember my story goes behind always in that that today I do something to brother colleague you know I want to go tell him I'm sorry well about two days later might take two maybe one you know I didn't come up with a thought well it was his problem to start with I don't need to apologize to him he's going to cause me to do it he would have looked at me like that after a while I don't know him an apology he owes me one right right that's right because that's human nature to try to justify our ways and her thoughts that's right so do you understand my point yes yes but that ain't all the point you see it costs a savior to bring us to an unconditional Covenant now under the time of an unconditional Covenant do you realize and we read it and we fail to listen to the prophet he said Israel had Grace watch it he said Grace had given a prophet are you with me he said Grace had give them a pillar of Fire he said Grace gave him a sacrifice and we look at Grace as well it doesn't make no difference from Saved By Grace then we don't listen to The Prophet when he was talking like he remembers condemning the lady that was in the restaurant and and he was going to get up and go over a tour and tell her off you know because she was doing wrong the Lord said come on behind the door I need to talk to you he walked over behind the door and got in the quietness and God showed him a vision and showed him all the things in his life right that he had done and said he showed him then that taking the sight of Jesus the blood and covering for all of his sins it says now you want to be forgiven but said you want me to condemn them right see grace is a little different than what we think of the words because we've been taught by mankind what it means that's why we were on Paul and James Wednesday night and showing they brought around and said it twice there he said they said the same thing well Paul looked like he said was saved by grace James would like to save my words that's got to be saying the same thing or your Prophet was wrong and Paul and James was wrong but it's saying the same thing James brother Rand said was looking at what man saw he said Paul was looking at what God saw all right James was just telling you his works it didn't been displaying his faith Paul was not saying I'm saved by faith what did he say saved by grace what a little word there we want to leave out don't it Say by grace through faith I'll save my grace no that's not the Bible it says by grace through faith but now think about it after he gave Abraham the unconditional Covenant now here's what we're thinking about it so that's reason I'm saying we said well then it'll make no difference what we do he gave Abraham the unconditional Covenant to him and his seat after him right why did they go on making offerings you realize where you're standing folks listen to what I'm saying why were they making offerings of sacrifices why did God command them to make offerings or sacrifices if it was unconditional like we want to make it president don't understand you you talk about unconditional we believe right around unconditional now you're telling us I'm just telling you what the Bible says go back and read from Abraham and Genesis the rest of the chapter and get over into Exodus and go back to about Exodus 10 11 12. we talked to the token where they had to make yearly sacrifices amen the difference between is basically one thing Moses was not the first that made the sacrifice it God made it before the foundation the world is number one two Cain and Abel made it and all of them had to make it until Abraham was even told to take his son up and sacrifice him the sacrifice is not making it on conditions boy you blowed my mind because you just said it was unconditional then you said it was conditioned then you said it's unconditional come on am I right in the Bible they made their sacrifices before you come to Exodus 19. right right before Moses brought the law the law never brought the sacrifice show it to me the long proud condemnation made you to realize you needed to sacrifice it never brought a sacrifice show me in the Bible you see Church we want to play around with little sugar tips or the message I think it's about time we quit playing around horrible we'll read that this afternoon I guess remember they're playing around horrible we've been around horrible long enough we've had 40 something years it's about time to get settled down but I I never thought about an unconditional Covenant the way you preaching it but I thought I had it figured out until you said it now I'm confused well I didn't confuse you no you was already confused don't tell me that well you was I owed it this is why people don't like me and I don't like myself because I before I preach it to you I expose my own self I realize who's standing here talking but everyone said my whole makeup is Grace well why did he ask for forgiveness when he done wrong if that's your terminologies of Grace and unconditionals and whatever day come on unconditional Covenant he gave that Covenant to Abraham and by Abraham receiving it he never stopped making the atonement why didn't he stop because every one of those sacrifices spoke of the time that would come when the god of Glory would stand on Earth he was covering their sins you remember Balaam trying to curse him trying to God says I don't see any wrong but Ron said he couldn't see it because he was looking at what and they say he's looking at an unconditional Covenant come on what did he say he was looking at he said he was looking at the sacrifice they made in the shout of the king in the camp you say are you trying to make it some condition brother Dale there was a condition that required God to die and when man received the unconditional Covenant when Abraham received it he turned right around immediately made offerings from then on why that he was wrong now here's the condition of the existence between I want to express this before get through the difference our condition of existence between the atonements of of the after the Ten Commandments in Moses and his Commandments and those with Abraham Abraham didn't necessarily have to make a yearly that was put in by Moses because God ordained it to be for all the people right one atonement before Moses before that everybody made their own atonement are you with me everybody made their own atonement the head of the household made the sacrifice before Abraham I mean for Moses but then when you come to Moses surely everybody then still had to sacrifice to make they didn't have that one major one that one major one covered for all Israel of a yearly thing Abraham when he go do wrong he'd go out for a sacrifice that was the way that God wanted it to be come on what are we well we'll go to church once a year and make an atonement right now I'm not supposed to repent for what brother Addison does right he's supposed to repent for that I'm supposed to repent for what I do right all right then as a whole atonement that was made at Calvary and if I do wrong he does wrong you do wrong we're not lost if we were truly born again to start with right we're not lost so it's still unconditional he made it but you see he gave me within my heart that's what he wanted with the children of Israel and the people he didn't want to give him law wrote a random says on the message paragraph 90 6 pull up number two we'll just get that known there were to be on the internet number one give me number one first make sure they're on the internet where people won't think this is some idea of mine they wanted a place that they could do something listen what he said here Katie's coming down I wish you would listen we did last night to this message I ask you to Listen to Invisible Union this is not in book form that may be in the brother mammales book form okay all right but it's not in book form for spoken word as far as I know as far as what I've got okay it's in brother mammalists but listen to this tape it's really called Church choose involved for Grace but I want you to listen to that message if you listen to it over and over and when I keep on preaching on it a little while you'll say that's exactly what brother Branham was saying sister told me the other day come to him and handed the Bible said here's exactly what she was talking about I see yeah see she found it in the scripture herself that's what I want you to do it all right look remember case there was only 11 days in the crossing day couldn't believe it because they had already seen so many great things done what they were sure that they were in the will of God what about you and I are we sure just as our fathers was a few years ago look the greatest mistake that Israel ever made was when they renounced Grace and accepted law it made its greatest mistake in Exodus one of the Fatal mistakes that Israel made the Covenant that God made unto Abraham was completely Grace but Grace had provided for them a deliverer a prophet a sacrificial lamb so now you can see that it wasn't just my ideas that they were offering sacrifices before the law came into existence the law never brought sacrifices it is the greatest Revival and all but they wasn't satisfied with it they wanted something they could have something to do into get that decision get to number two because I just want these these two of them go ahead to number two which is God's does God ever change his mind about his word preaching 65 4 18. God permitted Israel to take a law in Exodus the 19th Chapter when Grace had already provided them a prophet Pillar of Fire sacrificial lamb of delivering power and they cried out for a law and we'll get to that this evening it wasn't God's will that's going to be a tough one to try to get your mind in the right order to understand it wasn't God's will to bring the law what do you mean they wanted it look what it done but it was injected because man wanted it and he was cursed by the very law that he wanted next one is a message called well number three Abraham's Grace Covenant pre-61 317 therefore it's not nothing that we could do to Merit it's God's grace that gives it to us by faith Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness the law is what man wanted not what God wanted you poor old hypocrite sorry but it's time to call nothing Hypocrites at least I don't I try to refrain from calling names anymore but Hypocrites are pretty good word it can cover a lot of people do you understand if what we think of an unconditional Covenant if what you thought of an unconditional Covenant had no conditions in it I hope you listened because why did Abraham offer sacrifices after he got an unconditional Covenant amen you got it many deer so go ahead at least you got part of it right and you gotta admit come God come down through an exodus in the beginning and begin to give them ordinances or whatever whatever you call it the the uh you know laying in order of the things to be done on this day and that to be done on this day and that to be done on this day in so many days than an offer was to be made and this will be made read your Bible if it's unconditional like we think then why did Abraham offer sacrifices why did the people offer sacrifices until Moses came in existence they made it because they knew they was wrong the Bible says it was after the similitude of Adam's transgression is the reason they done those things they knew they were sinners do we realize we're sinners saved by grace well Brothers don't make no difference what I do they don't save yeah if you truly saved if you truly saved it makes a lot of difference the difference is after you're born again you start seeking after God for more things like statue of a perfect man striving to climb this pyramid trying to serve God trying to be in his will and repenting when we do wrong but that's been forgotten in the message right people are so perfect no more we don't need to repent we don't I got a few scriptures and a whole lot of the prophets need to be tore out of the Bible and that of his message you know what I mean by that he said he prayed every day for God to forgive him to lead him direct him what about you and I an unconditional Covenant I never heard it like that well maybe you haven't but now you've heard it what are you going to do with it coach come and show me it's wrong that's on the internet that's on anywhere else come and show me I'm wrong show me one thing that I've been outside the Bible today to talk to you about well I don't like your attitude that ain't in the Bible about my attitude that's your attitude too God I'll deal with me about my attitude you don't have to deal with me about it but yet the prophet of God said it and I keep quoting it he said if you say it soft people don't they think you're trying to pull some over on them he said say it hard and then you can't at least accuse me of being soft soft you know and you can't say I've changed either because when I started right here in 1971 the brother mode is a pastor and I was a sister I was preaching this hard then and I haven't changed since then as a matter of fact I guess I've got harder as far as the way I preach I'm sorry but is it the truth do you understand Abraham got an unconditional Covenant brother Dale it don't matter what he does what he ever does and he's seat after him the saved now I'd like to see that in the Bible and I'd like to see it in the prophet's message I believe in Salvation being of the Lord and I believe in an unconditional Covenant that he gave you I've done preach that you can't sin enough to be lost but if you try to sin and it's Sin from the inside of your soul you're already lost so don't try to deal with me about it you see then the prophet would say it don't matter how high you climb make sure you can walk straight when you come back down see grace is unmerited you didn't do anything to get it but after you get it why wouldn't you want to follow what God Said you see God didn't want them with a set of rules he had already given to him the ordinances the things to do the atonement to be made and to follow the prophet right I hope you listen didn't want to go when I said it differs Moses Moses when he said make that one atonement that cover for the whole Israel sure we still have to repent this one the true Grace of understanding of marriage and divorce is a whole blanket covered over the Bride of Jesus Christ but we still got to repent but before then everybody made the atonement when they repented they made that atonement Abraham would do wrong he'd go make an atonement any of the others that was our they do wrong they would go make an appointment for themselves they wasn't trying to figure out the neighbor and get the neighbor right they were concerned with their own lives you see that's why there's so much falsehood has been put forth before the children of this message until they don't want the message probably because it's been this way it's been that way been this way been that way you'll see them when we get to it won't be this evening probably but when we do get to it you'll see that's what organized religion has done there's a quote something to paraphrase that brother run says you can't denominate this message would say he said they'll organize it into lady osia nothing wrong with an organism a lot wrong with an organization but are we so carnal like the brother that left a certain Church in this message because when they've got their internet website run up it says something something to org you know on your computer you know I mean you look at it every day right look out there and said orgy you know he said that's an organization I ain't having nothing to do with it all right but I will tell you this much it takes more than one person to be an organization takes at least two according to Webster yeah what do you think about an unconditional Covenant come on musicians let's stand what do you think about an unconditional Covenant to give your right just live like the devil and you're still going to heaven anyway or does it put you in a situation that people don't like to use the word condition it puts us into a situation that we want to serve God we don't just go to church then because we're good people are supposed to go and for don't the preacher is going to say something about it like I told you I got tired of calling people I know I'm not a good pastor I agree with you 100 percent I got tired of calling people I used to call people and say where was you at Sunday well I decided to go to so-and-so's all right I'll just tell you to put that go where you want to I ain't gonna call you no more if I don't have something that lets me know about sicknesses and sicknesses you're supposed to call me I'm not supposed to call you to pet your little feelings you're supposed to call me to get me to pray for you well brother Dale don't ever call me well you don't never call me oh okay what do we got brother 404 404 404 anybody have a need I believe in an unconditional Covenant if I do wrong he's not going to send me to hell I'm going to cry out for forgiveness I don't want no truth when it comes down to the river called in the Bible there is a talking of giving account of our Deeds not a judgment of where are we going to heaven or not no but a judgment that is each done in the body if we don't correct them here we're gonna have to answer that all I want to do and he loved me and gave me an unconditional Covenant but let me do it I am an advocate foreign Jesus Christ the righteous if I do wrong he'll condemn me according to Corinthians in our communion that we always read that way he won't condemn me with the world say I'm sorry Daddy how many of you lately have ever even said God forgive me well I don't do nothing wrong you're a liar right you keep going that way you're going to be a hypocrite no you're going to start justifying it say brother Dale shouldn't have brought that up Jesus did say to him one day he said you used to have a cloak for your for your sin but you don't have one no more because I spoke to you what are we talking about partner let's just believe that all is well because you see I still believe in that a sacrifice that atonement you still laying fine laying there for me but I can believe it father we raise one hand to you and we place one hand upon our sister's head Lord we believe you and by your stripes her throat is he is he we thank you for it in Jesus name you feeling anybody else one more time all Hallelujah see we we think well this is what he wanted this way I can't remember Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we give our brother a prayer cloth we're leaving with him that about his job and the conditions in life we make the right decision it may not be the one he wants to relax we love you we thank you in Jesus name thank you yeah before we go they're saying that to one another as you leave in remember the service is the evening all I want to do is because everybody there is realize foreign
