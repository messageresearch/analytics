to be here I like Wednesday nights it's middle of the week and real faithful ER here and we thank God did he give us a middle of the week he's a lot he didn't I thank God he's give us a middle of the week to come in and and just listen a little bit learn a little bit more about him amen and that's your desire brother Brown said if you don't want no more it want to know more about God there's something wrong with you amen so good to be here by the way of announcements brother down myself and be leaving in the morning going to Kentucky well Illinois brother Richard Douglas will be here Sunday and both services we will be at brother Richard Heights we will not be preaching simply because he asked me to come back the next Sunday so I'm going back the next Sunday and preach for him in Kentucky because he's got a he's some kind of IT guy and he's going to take a trip and he has no other ministers to back him up so we're gonna do that for him but we will be in church service and be back here probably about 8 or 9 o'clock Sunday night so keep saying your prayers and we'll be doing some work up there and it's gonna be hot so just keep us in your prayers also next Wednesday night a week from tonight brother lanlan brother Rolando Genesis will be here from the Philippines he's coming in on Tuesday he just sent me a message and now on September the 8th brother Matthew brave will be here with us that will be the weekend of the of the Bible study so that will be September the 8th and then September the 15th I'll be at brother Tim Humes for Sunday service for him so just keep all these things and you pray if you got your Bibles let's turn to first Corinthians 15 I want to take a little subject that it comes up it comes up quite often and there's a truth to it but I'm gonna read you a quote in a minute we're brother Brown say one word off one word off took them out of the Garden of Eden so you can say what you want to tonight but if you think brother Dale and I are and the ministers in this church are dogmatic that's fine with me because one word off and you were going to be doing your funeral one word off you will not take a body change will warm wear it off Jesus Christ was the Word made flesh he took a body change he wasn't one word off he was the word and as you keep this in the back of your mind as we go through this tonight and I may be 9 o'clock getting finished but you know what we'll stand out there till 9:30 and talk maybe we'll cut a little bit like talking short outside but I'm gonna get this finished because we got a couple of weeks that were gonna be gone so but remember what brother George Clinton said Sunday boy that was probably the best sermon I ever heard him preach basically Sunday afternoon he said scripture cannot be broken scripture cannot be broken and brother Brown tells us that face final resting place is in the Word of God III was thinking that yesterday I read the Bible now more than I read the prophets message you shall halt well so did everybody else down through time before the Prophet came along you better read your Bible brother Brown didn't say study the message and pray he said if you want to get closer to God read your Bible and pray because that's God talking to you know we know that brother Branham lying the Bible up we couldn't have done it without him but now that we have the divine interpretation the revelation then that filter of the Holy Ghost ought to be able to look down at the Word of God and filter all the junk out a man and that's what we're going to talk about tonight you look at my title and you'll probably understand kind of what where we're going in Adam all died in Adam all died all right first Corinthians 15 we'll read that in just a moment because you know what that's what the Bible says all right so let's go to the Lord and pray for a minute the only father would thank you for this day this you give us Lord we're not here to make anything of ourself but we're here to prove that your word is right and it cannot be compromised it cannot be one word off it must be spoken as you gave it and thank you Father for sending us a prophet that we can take the essence of this message and that we can see what man has pondered and wondered about since the beginning of time you brought us the divine interpretation of the word and that had to come from Almighty God himself because we were lost not so much lost in our soul but we were lost in religion and lost in many things of traditions of man and many false doctrines we all come from different avenues of even denominations and come into the message to see the truth father now that we're here Lord we know that the devil's here also and he's going to try his best to stop us from seeing the truth because that's what he did in the beginning one word is what took him out of the garden so one word off is not gonna put us back in Lord some people may say that can't be done all scripture must be fulfilled we which are alive and remain at the coming of the Lord will not prevent those that are asleep because we'll all be what changed amantha will be changed in a moment in a twinkling I got you promised that in scripture cannot be broken father forgive us of our sins and the daily things that we do against you father we ask you to cleanse those just listening to the Prophet here just a few minutes ago where he prayed Lord for you to forgive him of the things he did that day forgive him of the certain things Lord a prophet how much more are we to get on our knees and say God forgive us of our sins Lord just come and speak today you be the one do the speaking father you're the only one who can do the revealing so as the Holy Ghost comes to anoint Lord we pray that he'll North this whole building they hit anoint everyone that's watching that will understand what's going on in the day and hour that we're living in give us this day father our daily bread Jesus name we pray amen first Corinthians 15:20 says but now is Christ risen from the dead and become the firstfruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also the resurrection of the Dead for as in Adam all died now remember the Bible didn't say Adam is the father of all living because he wasn't amen Eve was the mother of all living man Bible says that but Adam was not the father of all living but as in Adam he didn't say an evil died says in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive there's a contrast there between Adam and Christ the first item in the second Adam but every man in his own order Christ the first fruit afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming now when is the coming of the Lord its revealing of his word is right now today today is the day that Christ is here so you may be seated in the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word but remember that again remember these two things in Adam all die and scripture cannot be broken same way as as anything and I'm just gonna say this may be a little contentious but I'm gonna say it anyway I don't agree with what brother Joseph Branham doing in in Jeffersonville okay but I do agree that his pretense is is that the people preachers of this message have messed this message up so much get back to the tape I agree with that 100% but it's got to be through a fivefold ministry that gets the message to the people and they will be scripture cannot be broken there will be a five fold ministry that will bring a group of people to the perfection of the Saints a man but I do agree that this message has been messed up by the preachers in the pulpit so much so you could be frustrated and say hey get back to what the tape says well in this church that's not so much but in a lot of other churches they're not saying what's the tape said and then they run it through their own filter and they get something different and then they get something different if you get something different than it's what one word off alright let's go to Genesis 2:15 and I want to and I think some of you know where I'm going there was a it seems like that a doctrine that's real prevalent especially in foreign countries but it originated in them in Canada because I heard that I'm old mouth that that Adam had to place his natural seed into Eve to savor well I don't agree with that that's not in the Bible and brother branham never said that okay so you run it through your filter tonight but I'm gonna read you the Bible and I'm gonna read you the prophets message and you got to run it through your Holy Ghost filter tonight you run it through your Holy Ghost filter because I just read you the Bible says in Adam all die that's what the Bible says so whatever brother branham teaches the same way with the Daniel 7 new weeks and all the things that that people say that he was offer or missed it or whatever they want to say it wrong it's got to compare with the Bible if face final resting place is in the Word of God then that's why I said that's why I told you I do I read the Bible now every morning 30 minutes every morning and I probably don't read that much of the message because I believe now this is just me I believe if you get the essence of the message for Louisville now we're talking about this other day getting the essence of the message it's not a verbatim quote because a verbatim quote you may say anything you want to say but the essence of the message listen true redemption through the opening of the seals will straighten up all doctrine all doctrine will be straightened up with the revelation of the seven seals not just on the surface but all that year and a half that I spent that God with God's help to try to get you to see the plan of redemption because the plan of redemption did not did not come from man sperm please that's where everything got all messed up listen that was the quote that he planted this error that the preacher said and I've heard he said many many times that Adam had to place as natural Steve indeed seed and Eber saber no you know what that's what killed her she died anyway she fell they both needed a lamb they both needed a redeemer and I'm gonna prove it right here and the Lord took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress in to keep it now remember there's a couple of things we gotta cover tonight and listen if I get too fast hold your hand up and say slow down okay hold your hand up and say slow down all right but I'm gonna try to clear this up by what by the Word of God all right so let's read this right here real quick I said I'm gonna read it real quick dinner I just said who's gonna read it real quick didn't hold you hand out sec slow down okay and the Lord God took the man now watch Genesis 1:26 man was that theophany man that God in Genesis 1:26 says let us make man in our own image all right now that person that theophany was Adam that part that God was putting on the earth to be the gardener that was Adam is all right that was Adam in spirit form theophany not a tangible flesh man because when Genesis 2 he takes that man and puts him into human flesh that all right amen he puts that Genesis 1:26 man into the Genesis to six men and that gives God a man on earth in human flesh to rule the world and to do whatever it needs to do on the earth to contact the earth that's what our five senses are given to us for see taste smell felling smell see taste tell me to be quiet tell me to slow down see taste feel smelling here - what brother Graham told us that contacted our earthly home see taste feel smelling here we use it every day all right but now then you got the five inner senses memory reason conscience affection imagination now we're at in mind because we're fixing - I want you to watch how this reacts in the Garden of Eden you'll see what happened between Adam and Eve because remember God says you don't love there's a filial love and an agape love figlio love is that memory reason conscious affection and then you cannot love God without having the Holy Ghost in your soul you cannot love God all right that's a gap in love that's the love of God but now the love you have for your wife it's not a godly love it's feel your love amen all right and the Lord took Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it in to keep it now remember he's already putting them in human flesh and we're going to cover that in just a minute and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now we know what brother Brown said to the thousand years of the day in the day is a thousand years no one lived my foods will live 969 years Adam didn't live but 900 didn't live but 900 it be nice to be nice clearly that sister claimed that be ten times what you are now goodness gracious but thank God we don't live that long could you imagine America sunny but 300 years old if he was 900 years old you was way back in under and hey using three Church ages backwards so thank God we don't have to do that but the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat them now remember what was that tree that they were not supposed to touch what was that tree that they were not supposed to touch he said well that was Satan yeah and I've got another quote brother Bram said it was Eve not supposed to touch it and the fruit in the midst of the garden if you order want to know what I'm talking about because remember you are the fruit of your mother amen that's where God hid that with Moses he hid that into that he said / took of the fruit well you're the fruit of the womb all right there buddy okay with that I may say some things that may be a little you mount to explain to your kids but you know what just got to say what I gotta say and the Lord God said it is not good that the man should be alone I will make him an help meet for him now remember like brother Dale says that doesn't say help me that says help me that's somebody right here besides you because remember we forget all these other quotes and we just say what somebody else said because somebody's got a big name in the message and we listen to them YouTube or whatever it is we just quote it because they quote it you better not you better study what we say cuz it's your soul and then the Lord God said is not good that man should be alone because remember before the fall Adam and Eve we're cold equal coal equal until after I mean it's not until after the fall that God put man over the woman they were co-equal and Eve being a byproduct of Adam didn't make her a lesser vessel it made her the same thing all right brother discovered that many many times I want you to I want stir up some of this background that you've heard for 50 years all right and some of you hadn't heard it so we're gonna try to stir that ground up again and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every fowl of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof Adam named all the animals and like I said many times before when he was naming the animals God wasn't nervous God said that's exactly what I was thinking that's exactly what I was thinking why because that him had the mind of Christ at that time all right everybody understand that same Emory and Adam gave names to all cattle and to foul the air to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found and helped me for him in other words Adam brings the lion up well the lion didn't come by itself mrs. lion came to mrs. beast came to a man that was a male lion and a female line because back in Genesis before Genesis the sixth day of creation listen there was intercourse between the animals and they were producing babies thereby okay with that you say well how do you know that well when God took that lamb and slew it and took the skins off and throwed one into Adam and throwed one into Eve that would have ended the lamb line if that would have been the only two lambs on the face of the earth Deb I understand that okay so it's not a problem with the animals reproducing God tells them in Genesis multiply and replenish the earth but he doesn't tell them to subdue it like he does in Genesis once when he says you've heard his preaching that many times before because you and I have the position that we have we have that God nature they have nature we have a garden nature because we have a soul and God in creative evolution well that's hard to say no brother Brown said it in creative evolution he started with a small and come all the way up you know what he comes all the way to the monkey and then he puts the beast and then he brings man and puts man into human flesh hey man let's question many times before that people have asked him I want to settle this tonight the reason that you and I the reason that Adam and Eve were put in a body they were put in everybody understand me it's because it was animal flesh so when he put Adam in his body he had a male part when he made Eve to be in creative evolution he had to make a Eve with a female part you know what the word woman means it means a man with a womb a man woman means man with a womb now remember he didn't call her evey called her woman she became even after the fall all right so watch what happens is when Adam when God brings all these cow and fowl they're reproducing but Adam is standing there and can't reproduce anything he's alone he needs a womb to reproduce himself to reproduce himself because listen you got to take this all and type it to Christ Christ needs a womb to reproduce himself not a physical wound but a womb of the mind because listen Satan got to Eve's wound first in here up here then the act happened this is where the fall started not down there that was just the that was just what that was a manifestation of what was up here I hope everybody understands that that's really like ABCs okay but it's gonna help explain what we're talking about here in a few minutes but for Adam was not found to help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept took one of his ribs closed up the flesh instead thereof what a wonderful operation did him leave a scar and the rib which the Lord God take took from man made he a woman what put her in female flesh because listen Adam and Eve he told them to multiply and replenish the earth you can't do that with one person Adam said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh now as we've said many times before that is a literal statement whatever God took the DNA he took out of Adam that bone that rib he took out of Adam and he formed Eve and put that theophany of Eve inside that flesh called woman was Adam's flesh but it was the female part because in Genesis 1:26 let's create men our own image male and female created he them male and female crazy hot you have a male and a female and then brother branham always talks about you don't take a woman to your bosom because there's always an imprint well you know what think about that that's what he wanted he wanted us to have an imprint think about it whatever the male is the female is just the inverted of what the male is so it's a man with the womb to what to reproduce yourself God told him to multiply and replenish Eric so he told them they were just gonna do what God told him to do but Adam couldn't do it myself so God instead of going and getting what somewhere out here in the dust he takes from Adam and makes his self his self he reproduced he makes himself so he can reproduce because remember her name was Adam we're not gonna read it but remember the Bible says and her name their name with Adam why because they were the same except she had the feminist part and he had the masculine part so don't worry about you know don't worry about why God put us the way we are he knew we'd fall and you need what we needed but still being in creative evolution we had to come just like the animals and I'll read it in just a minute I'm not just gonna say it I'm gonna read your quote it's what has told them other day when I was preaching somewhere else the last time I preached and I said I said something oh it was in Arizona and I said something they all kind of went I said don't you believe I got a quote for it if I won't stand out here and say this don't you like a quote for it therefore look and I don't said this is now bone of my bone flesh them up there she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed I missed the quote didn't uh no I didn't now let's read this quote right here I had to insert this this is one of my favorite sermons I quoted a lot its oneness 1962 very good this is where brother man talks about God and Adam and Eve being one because that's what we got to get back to now let's think seriously because you never be able to think anymore after this after this mortal life is over your thinking is now you cannot choose after this you must choose now for this is the day of choosing making your choice now she is talking about Eve one word not a hold the ecology doc log or whatever that is Decalogue just one word she questioned God because it was presented to her in that light that that word was questionable God's Word cannot be questioned like brother Quinn said all scripture cannot be broken and all scriptures got to be fulfilled so you can't break scripture in any doctrine you have it has to come straight through the scripture and I just read this scripture word but the Bible says it Adam all die all right so there was nothing redeemable about Adam or with Adam all right God's Word cannot be questioned he meant just what he said but she questioned it because it was presented to her what Satan was preaching her sermon from his pulpit through the Beast but she questioned it because it was presented to her oh god Shirley didn't mean that but he did mean that God means every word he says and it doesn't need any private interpretation it's just the way he said it will you say how you know about the Bible I believe that my God has guided this Bible he watches over his word he knowed that atheists and infidels would rise in the last day so he's watched over it this is exactly the way God minute it's the way it's to us now now we must believe it one word off of it and we lose our fellowship go off into to death eternal separation from God just as Adam and Eve did we must believe God's truth so that was in in line with with you you think sometimes that we're like said combative and dogmatic no Lee we're just trying to save you so we're just trying to get by I want to see everybody take a body change I don't want just preach a little vanilla sermon that how good you are and you're good but I do want to show you though when it folks doctrine comes in what to do with it you take it back to the Word of God you take it back to the Word of God and really you don't have to take you to the prophets message because you might find a quote that's kind of like what's the person said but if you take it back to the Bible this is the way exactly the way God meant it everybody all right say man now let's start I've only got 15 more quotes to go we okay hmm questions and answers don't Genesis now but then there's no man to till the soil no man to till the soil this is in coming of the scripture we just read and then God formed man Genesis 2:7 out of the dust of the earth now we follow it he formed a man out of the dust of the earth and put this supernatural spirit got it Genesis 1:26 man he put into that 2:7 man that's that supernatural spirit he's talking about because there's no way item could name all the animals and rule the earth would not having some kind of god quality inside of him amen he had to be led by the Holy Ghost even brother Brian said they had the Holy Ghost veil over their eyes because they were naked and didn't know it but see that's a problem but when the fall happened that veil was lifted and now we live under a lust veil that's what he said I didn't bring that quote but that's pretty strong but that's what he said and we do you got your anybody got a problem with that yeah we live on that's what we live under that's why it takes the Holy Ghost to make us turn our head men and women it takes the Holy Ghost to turn us away from that and that has to be the one inside because before we had our conversations in the flesh Paul said in times past with the white lust of the flesh all right but being born-again now what we turn that turn and we focus our supernatural love to God and our natural filial love to our wife and then our husband back and forth all right now he was laying there I can have many pictures of it I can see Adam standing now I believe him brother branham's looking at a picture I believe he's really looking at a picture I believe he's looking he listened he had the first wife I there ever was since God because God would just throw a screen up right there and show him what was going to happen or what had happened or what's fixing to happen didn't need no wires didn't need an antenna he just whipped there it was bluetooth I can have many pictures of it I can see Adam stamp why do you think he knew but he was blond-haired blue-eyed he saw her and you know what that was kind of strange brother branham come up in the era of no color television he'd sit there watched Bonanza or Gunsmoke in black and white but when he was telling the people their problems he said I see you got on a blue dress and you and you're driving a red car if he was looking and he was looking in Technicolor and we were looking to black right right thank God for a spiritual line Stein they came to tell us and give us clarity not change the Bible one iota but to give us clarity of what God was talking about amen look see him standing like a tree God had made him he was dead as he could be his toes like roots were sticking in the ground God said let there be or breed the black breath of life into him and he jumped came to himself he was breathed the breath of life into him he became a living soul and he began to move on move on and then God taken from his side a piece of him a rib it made a woman see he didn't take even go over there and pull her out of the roots like she's like the wood show that here comes Eve no he'd come out of Adam that's why you and I come out of Christ because you got to think your contrast because remember the first item was in the transgression the second Adam's what brought it back so see there was no redemption in the first Adam he's want to killed us the second item is one that brought us up the second one is not planting natural seed he's planting a spiritual spoken word seed like he was supposed to have in the beginning amen and then God take him from his side a piece of him a rib and made a woman now where did he get the spirit woman see when Genesis 1:26 he said let us make man in our image after our own likeness created he them man male and female he made the burly spirit for the man he made the tender Lord delicate feminine spirit for the woman how wonderful and you know what that all came from God they didn't come from the devil he can't make that he can pervert that but he can't make that all right so let's continue on number two look Jesus came to manifest the father this is questions and answers 1954 look in the beginning God made man in his own image is that right now see I'm building the foundation to bring us to what what we're gonna talk about okay mm-hmm so go with me here in the beginning God made man in his own image is that right well what is God a spirit st. John 2:4 chapter Jesus speaking to the woman at the well he said God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth is that right if God made man in his own image what kind of man did he make then a spirit man so the spirit man was made first and remember that spirit man wasn't made as nothing and then here's something because that would mean that would have a beginning and it does not eternal life doesn't have a beginning remember we've been through this before the word created remember an automobile was in the Garden of Eden because every element that you got out there in your car I don't care if it's plastic titanium alloy wheels rubber it was all in the ground at some period of time there's nothing new Under the Sun everything automobile was in the Garden of Eden it just wasn't created but it was always there so this Genesis 1:26 man always was he was in God he was a part of God and then he comes out to what to come down to me and you to make us a God that all right in Genesis 2 there was no man to till the salt now he's talking Genesis 1 is the spirit man Genesis 2 there was no man to till the soil and God made man out of the dust of the earth not in his image but in the image of animal life hand like a bear foot like a chimpanzee he's done told us there's many many quotes and he put the spirit of man in this animal man here and he became a living soul now that's the difference between a man and the animal the animal don't build automobiles he doesn't do things like that to help his living and so forth like that he's an animal dumb brute some of us may fall into that category but he hasn't got a soul the animal doesn't have a soul he can't read and write he can't talk speak he's a dumb booth but a man is in flesh like a brute but he's got a soul of God in him that makes him immortal boy that's pretty heavy and he can invent look what he can do he's owned almost on the equal with God we'll look at today they broke into God's laboratory they went all the way back to DNA and all these different things that that man even it brother branham's era it wasn't possible now they make it possible because he's the son of God even in his fallenness state he's wonderful all right so let's go to the next one now make some comments after this after we get done around here I will restore unto you saith the Lord 1954 all things beginning cults begin the Church of God began in Genesis you believe that notice closely now as we go into it now now the two that we want to deal with today now here is my conception that's when God made man in his own image he made him spirit man of course because God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth now I did not bring this quote but remember if you if you know the essence of the message brother Branham said God knew when he put him in human flesh they would fall can't fall that Genesis 1:26 man cannot fall never will fall never had a bad day never sinned today in his life because that's what came into you at the new birth and recreated the way it should have been had there not been a fall so we're not so far off for this are we then he made man out of the dust of the earth that's why I think botanists and so forth get their chronologiste and gets all scrupled up in other words what he's talking about is you know they say man this man is twenty million years old and this one forty million years old because of carbon dating and he says foolish and I believe it is too when you realize that man and his five senses to contact his earthly home is in the image of beasts not in the image of God man made in god's image was spirit man then he took that spirit man and put it into the two seven men are the flesh man that was made like animal with a male being the way a male's made and a female being the way the females made is that all right and then there's no man to till the soil he put man in the image of beasts life and I know what you're thinking right now the Bible says there's different kinds of flesh of an animal and all these day and we can't coincide with them do you know why we can't do you know why we can't we actually could could have you're forgetting the Beast you're forgetting to be in creative evolution brother branham's that he can lean back toward the animals but he could what except except the one except of woman of the because that's what happened okay what did God do God totally took that missing link took it out of the picture so there's no way we can get back and go inside with animals just real simple real simple he put man in the image of beasts life why creative evolution monkey little higher intelligence the beast obviously he was close enough to man to coincide with man you understand what I mean mingle seed mingle and be able to stand upright and talk I mean that's just the truth and then said when God cut that thing off he writes over in the New Testament he said now there's life of animal you know he said don't lay with beasts and all these things in the New Testament I mean the Old Testament everybody got that pretty plain why cuz he cut that off because that was so that's where the sin act happened was right here in that gap the missing link we all went to school and everybody said we don't know what they missed the link is well you know what it's in the Bible but they don't understand it because I got a I got a little quote here from from the Greek lexicon that talks about I just pulled it up it says Adam the meaning of Adam is the red earth the first man the parent of the whole human race that's a lie we know it's a lie Adam is not the parent of all human race don't look at me like that the Beast there is a beast see don't miss our Lord from Cain that's why the Bible says Adams not to father of all women but Eve is the mother of all living remember Cain and Abel were half-brothers they weren't full brothers they were half-brothers and that was the Beast seed that's still here brother Brown may ask him still wears it out he said it's still here God didn't kill Cain Cain killed Abel tried to cut it off and Adam and Eve had to get back together bring Seth but that Cain lineage he went off to the Land of Nod and populated the world half as much as the rest of them did everybody okay with that so there was a beast life that beast lineage is down through there somewhere we know it's all mingled together because the sons of God met the daughters of man and they died all just kind of intertwined there's no way you can get a full lineage of one or the other it's like brother Dale said I don't care if they've traced me back and I'm Cain's 759 millionth cousin I don't care the blood of Jesus Christ take care of all that and then that's why he had to come back to take care of that Lord he put man in the image of beasts life he might give him a hand like a monkey a foot like a bear never brother branham he even used the analogy when you skinned a bear now this is him when you skinned a bear it looks like a small child why cuz that that creative evolution right up to man and that's why we're in that's in the flesh part that we're in it's because of creative evolution but the difference between the animal and the man he made him a soul a living soul because the spirit of God was in the man and then the only way that God could redeem the man have nothing to do with the first item right zero zero to do with the first atom right because the spirit goes in and then the only way that God could redeem the man then God came down and was made flesh to redeem the man that had condemned in the flesh and Adam couldn't be our Redeemer he couldn't even be listen to be a kinsman redeemer you had to be just like your kinfolk right Adam wasn't born Adam was created a full-grown man he cannot and will never be our brother but Jesus Christ came out of the womb by the spoken word of God that's the whole deal it's the spoken word is original seed that's nothing man sperm will kill you we're dead while we're walking I was thinking other day I was in the airport all those people five or six thousand people down that one thing in Atlanta y'all know how crazy it is down there we're all born same way and we all had the same choice everyone there's not a person you can't look at nobody walking down the street and go they were made different than me no they came the same way right so we're all put on the same level and even Adam and Eve was put on free moral agency to decide what they were gonna do when they were putting human flesh then the only way to God for name of the man then God came down and was made flesh to redeem the man that he had condemned in the flesh that's when Jesus Christ the Son of God was made flesh and dwelt among us is everybody alright with that say man it's pretty simple okay alright let's read number four and then make a comment here number four I just want you to understand why we're putting the bodies that we're puttin because remember brother Branham says when we go back when we go back to the Garden of Eden there's no sex organs because your theophany don't have one the spoken word is the original seed and the word is the seed that's the only seed we better be worried about listen you had no way none of you ever decided that you were coming here you had zero to do with it that's my brother Brahms he said I can see I can see the virgin birth God creates the sperm earth crisis one germ brings an egg out of creation places in the womb he said you got here by millions upon millions of eggs and millions upon millions of germ and then they crawled over each other and Powell there you are God's gonna get you here anyway hey man now our bodies made out of 16 different elements of the world they're male cam I hurt anybody's feelings some of you look I am you know he's gonna have a little sex education class did you know our bodies are made out of sixteen different elements of the world we know that made out of potash a little calcium and petroleum and cosmic light and atoms and so forth all bundled together and makes this body come from the dust of the earth and remember even brother Brown says your body was in the Garden of Eden your body was in the Garden of Eden your literal body somewhere in that potash counts him and all that you eat food as you eat food then turns into from the dust it comes from the dust it just goes right on your flesh as far as your flow is no different from a horse or from a cow or anything else it's still just flesh hmm keep going and boy you glorify the flesh but that spirit has a soul in there my brother that's right but your flesh is just dust of the earth like the animal your flesh is no more than an animal and if you lust after the flesh and the thing you see lust after women left after these different things it's still animal that's right that's right you shouldn't do it the Spirit of God will lead you on and put you on a higher plane than that that's what the Holy Ghost was given for was to bring you to a higher plane amen all right now let's read this one let's see what Adams led literal seed this is what was said the liberal seed was placed in Eve to save her right I got the quote from where it was said all right and I've heard it I've heard it been preached two or three different times in different places and it's false it's wrong it's not right it's not biblical so if it's not bad because it's wrong I don't care who says it now couldn't we stop here just a man get a real sermon oh if the blood has cleansed it back what about now now this is in the breeze right when you get ready to preach the seals look what the Son of God the second Adam did said the works that I do show you also see Adam lost his inheritance the earth now listen Adam didn't looses eternal life God's not an Indian giver he didn't give out of eternal life and then take it away from him he took the ability for Adam to take this thing and make it eternal cousin Adam all died all right so Adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to Satan he sold his faith in God to Satan's reasoning therefore his eternal life now look his right to the Tree of Life his to the earth belong to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of Satan now if you read that quote and don't get the essence of the message you see brother Brown says he lost his eternal life he lost his ability to become eternal in his flesh he did not lose his God ship eternal life in his soul okay because remember if you keep reading your genealogy there in the Book of Luke 3 it goes down and says an atom which was the son of God okay therefore now it has been it returned and has been polluted the seed of Adam has destroyed not saved or redeemed the seed of Adam has destroyed the inheritance that Adam should have had that's the earth and that's this earth right that's right the seed of Adam so how can a sex act do anything but kill you it can't raise you up it can't save you alright and I'll tell you what what my thought on this is and take it for what it is I really don't don't bother me now what happened that polluted OMA read that with me the polluted seed of Adam has polluted and absolutely destroyed the land do you see any redemption in that scene to salvation than that do you know the Bible says that and because that he has did this the polluted seed of Adam God will destroy him if you don't listen if you don't get the second Adam inside of you to redeem you you'll die go to destroy you hey manage that alright say man shakes out the polluted seed of Adam has polluted and absolutely destroyed the land now Adam was a godly man but the thing he did destroyed the whole human race amen in his flesh what he did in his flesh destroyed the human race no salvation in that that's why the second Adam had to come in human flesh be born a baby by virgin birth no sex virgin birth by the spoken word of God which is way it should have been to start with and then he comes in and listen Adams life when Adam died at nine hundred and something years old when Adam died his theophany went into another dimension and it's still there as far as I know there's no way that even that great theophany of Adam there's no way he can come back and come into you right or he would be your savior we wouldn't have needed the second Adam there's only one Savior and that's the man that can come out and say all power in heaven looks given to me and in eleven days in ten days you go that upper room and I'm gonna come back I'm gonna come back and I'm gonna redeem this whole human race that's the atom they planted a spiritual seed in the womb of your mind and new creation was born not of the old creation anymore sure we carry the old creation right here but inside you're a new creation if you're not born again you're of the old creation and God will destroy them number six hey bye all right now no one answering one question another one is apt to come up boy tell me about it and people asked me if I felt that way what did Adam do for God lays the blame on Adam that is simple the Word of God is forever settled in heaven let me read it one more time let me give you a door to quinn quote the George Quinn quote says scripture cannot be broken I love that scripture cannot be broken the Word of God is forever settled in heaven before one speck of Stardust was made that word God's law was there exactly as it's written in our Bible now the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband listen to this now I just read this in the Book of Jeremiah just read it yesterday morning and listen look at me if a woman goes out and has relations with another man you're not supposed to take her back the Bible tells you not to take her back if she goes out and pollutes herself and has relations with another man you're not supposed to take her back and man that's what the Bible says but remember Adam did so did Christ because you now were married to another and we did all these horrible things they okay cuz remember like I said it's got to be the essence it's got to be the continuity of the message in the Bible all the way from Genesis or revelation called this the book of redemption Genesis tells us to fall all the way through tells us how he's coming back up with me now the word teaches us that if a woman leaves her husband and goes with another man she is an adulteress and it's no longer married and the husband is not to take her back that word was true in Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law you st. know Adam Eve Eve was from the Bible was written the for one speck of Stardust was made God's law it was there exactly as it is written in our Bible so listen there was redemption already written in the Bible there was a lamb not for justy but for Adam not to take her back that word was true in Eden as it was true when Moses wrote it in the law the word can't change let me quote that one more time scripture cannot be broken alright the word can't change Adam took her back he knew exactly what he was doing but he did it anyway right she was a part of him and he was willing to take her responsibility upon himself not the act remember it started up here right this is the first wound he got to he would not let her go so Eve conceived by him he knew she would he knew exactly what would happen to the human race and he sold the human race into sin that he might have Eve for he loved her and I'm gonna read you a quote in a few minutes where brother Brown said God should have sent us all to hell but he went to hell and got us just like Eve Adam went out and got Eve and didn't have sex with her to save her I'm gonna tell you that one more time please good grief folks this is we're way too far up the line for that to be anything in our in our thinking all right and remember truly the two sons that were born they were born outside of the garden and they both needed a lamb if not if we go back to that where Adams done what he did to save Eve then it would have saved Abel it would have saved SAFF that would us know they know all needed a lamb to represent the fall and the redemption through the Lamb of God that was going to take away the sin of the world that's what I mean if you get the essence of the message folks forget I don't say forget the quotes but you got to take the essence of this message if you keep reading quotes they will kill you you will get confused and there's no confusion in the Word of God and there's no confusion in this message it's what man has run it through their filter and confused it which is what confused the people all right number seven we got to keep going we got sixteen quotes to read okay everybody all right everybody's okay all right I'm not trying I'm not trying to degrade nobody I'm just gonna tell you something one word one word off and we're not gonna take a body change I contend that we're gonna be that one word on and take a body change but we got to have this listen if we have this thing lined up there's no more fear the theory is is whether I'm right in your own or whether you're wrong and I'm right but when we see the Word of God and we all come underneath that word of God we see that it's right and the Holy Spirit inside of us connects with it and says that ain't nothing but the truth I just wanna watch what a woman did she wasn't him in church he was in her house cleaning up her kitchen and the prophet of God said something she said that ain't nothing but the truth he said God heard that and told that woman whatever she wanted she could have same way with you and I Eve said be it unto me according to thy word that's the same thing sister heady Rock said being unto me according to thy word in other words brother Ram Nate you what you said ain't never betray and God honored that by giving her the what the salvation of her two sons yond Roxy Avenue Adam and Eve that first little sweethearts there in the Garden of Eden I see Adam back there when he put his arm around his a little sweetheart to walk out with her for God had condemned them and he started out with his arms around his darling Adam was not deceived he didn't have to walk out but he walked out because he loved his wife he walked out with both eyes wide open no matter if she had to go to torment he'd go with her now I'm gonna tell you something rock Tara stop look at me remember I talked about filio love and agape love that's filial love but it turned right straight into agape love because listen for him to take a woman back that had laid with the Beast an animal and he knew it he could have had her destroyed and made a whole brand-new another one but it wouldn't have been him it wouldn't have been Adam it'd have been something else that okay but he took her back because agape love took over we're figlio love started agape love took over to love because look watch cuz look God doesn't love us with figlio love God has never loved you with figlio life he doesn't know what figlio love figlio love come after agape love fell down because remember brother Brown said it starts with a goofy love figlio love lust all he goes all the way names all of it right down to the bottom the prostitution all that stuff like that but it started with a godly love when God looked down and seen that love of a human being but see remember it was Adam I believe it was the inside man that Genesis 1:26 man is the one that took her back not the flesh guy and I'll explain to you in just a minute what I think about that it was so cuz remember there's no doubt he had intercourse with Eve no doubt it's in the Bible but we'll look at something just a minute if you'll hang with me just a minute when God looked down and seeing that love of human being was so great that he couldn't stand it itself that's right he said I'll come and go too and said I'll put enmity between her seed and the serpent seed then you see four thousand years later you continue on and you see the second Adam comes but look back yonder when Adam was leaving with his sweetheart going out under condemnation was a shadow of redemption somewhere not Redemption a shadow of redemption somewhere because there was blood running over them remember God killed the animals and throat the skins then they put the skins on all right somewhere there was a shadow he knew it and I hear something going brother Bram clouds what is it it's the old bloody sheepskin beating up and down on his leg speaking of sometime Wow and I can see him going yonder now look this is the second Adam now the second Adam going up the hills a little spots on his back they got bigger and bigger as he walked up what is it after a while they got all into one spot I hear something beating again what is it there goes the second Adam now if the first Adam had any redemption why do we need a second one no more than Jehovah himself who comes down and was made flesh to what even to go to hell with his sweetheart to redeem her back hey man Christ to redeem his bride hallelujah he's seen it in Adam yonder what a shadow and he comes down was made flesh kinfolks with us that he might marry the human race to himself there he is going under to Calvary that Alright married the human race to himself so he could be our kinsman redeemer number eight what does it take to make a Christian life now women must bring forth this germ of life hurry man together by connection we won't go into that because you certainly disagree with me now what he's doing is he's talking about what happened in the garden it wasn't apples they'd taken in the Garden of Eden so then when they did let it be what it makes he's in Chicago in 1957 he's not really in the serpent seed all over the place now he's trying to kind of you know work his way around it so they don't cuz you know what he knows they're humans and they'll shut it when he says it was sex between even a beast they'll go and now I walk out the door let he says look so then when they did let it be what it may woman sin man never said no watch he stops because he's wrong I mean man sinned woman never sinned the woman was actually deceived Adam was not deceived he knowed what he was doing Eve actually thought she was right she was getting some new light that Satan was giving her he's still giving her that light but he said stay with the Bible that's it but he told her now wait God said but he said surely and then whatever it was the act was committed me we know what that was and then she enticed her husband it don't look like Adam was over there trying to pull Eve in it looks like he was selling him the product because she protect first then she enticed her husband him knowing it was wrong how can you get a ride act out something wrong and Adam walked out of the Garden of Eden because the love of his wife which was a type of Christ knowing no sin come down and was made sin for his church waltz right out knowing what he was doing I have power to lay it down or take it up he walked out knowing what he was doing and was partakers of our transgression that he might redeem us back there's only one Redeemer folks that's Jesus Christ a man not a nutter an atom not a first atom the second atom cuz you know why you know Wayne could redeem us he can come back in us Adam couldn't come back in you and me the Lambs and the doves and the turtles not couldn't come back in to mend you it had to be a man and it had to be a supernatural man inside that natural man so he could come back and what spiritually multiply itself then all right that he might redeem us about what a beautiful and it is it's one of the most beautiful pictures in the world is redemption number nine thirsting for life now we see the different types of life that's the reason that this man's born as a product of Adam which was a product of sin from listening to his wife how you gonna get Redemption from that how you gonna get salvation from that you can't which was a product of sin from listening to his wife and the wife was a product of sins come from Satan and Adam followed his wife out a perfect type of Christ going with his bride to take her sins as Adam took the sins of Eve and left the Garden of Eden not deceived but willingly walked out with her so was Christ not deceived Satan could not deceive him if thou be the Son of God did y'all know I didn't bring this quote but the three temptations in the garden were when Jesus came out and went through that 40 days of temptation the three things that he was tempted is the three things that she fell from in the garden which is a whole other sermon but it's the same identical thing the second Adam went through the same thing the first item went through with temptation of Satan pride of life and the other two but that's exactly what happened in the garden I didn't bring that quote but man it was very powerful you can look it up yourself you wanted but he deliberately walked out and took sin for the church he's our sin bearer Adam cannot be a sin bearer the sack he fell in sin alright next conferences with God 1959 God selected a certain tree in the Garden of Eden and after he had throwed out in the mould ladies sheepskins into the behind the bushes he called Adam and Eve they made a conference talk to over made a remedy for this horrible thing that his children had done God's conference and there was a decision made always at a conference there's a decision and God made a decision that because that Eve had when he held her at the witness stand because she took life from the world she'd have to bring life into the world and to Adam in to the serpent oh of course that being the head of the race all the race under it fell with Adam there's no salvation in any act of Adam that's what caused the fall number 11 and everybody know you ought to be able to quote this now notice making it known cross the mystery of God revealed and I would tell you something else you may not think this is from God but I'll promise you for three days I've been looking up quotes and all I done was is when I'd get a thought I'd find a quote and I'd put it in here I never had to move these quotes number one state number one number two state number two now I interjected that first one because of the one word off but every one of them was exactly the way I moved them from the message right into this I never had to move them around or cut and paste they came right together everyone I'm right in line all right now notice make it known hat and my there's just so much here we could just keep on going notice the tree of Christ's body in the garden making his mystery known to this bride tree watch redeemed and Eve again man and woman which are one made out of the same blood and the same spirit and everything else by Christ the second Adam you believe he was congregation says I'm going back home to Eden with his fallen wife redeemed back home again that's Christ in the church today taking his wife back sees a three-fold mystery now God manifested in Christ Christ manifested in the church all together to bring back the original item there was nothing wrong with the original Adam the original all right let's go to number 12 man running from the presence of the Lord it's always been that it's been in man has shirked and went away from God ever since Adam in the Garden of Eden when Adam was in the Garden of Eden when he come to the responsibility to make his choice would he stay with God or go with his wife he had to make that rest he had to make that the the responsibility was up to him he either had to take what his wife said or what God said and when he chose to go the way of his wife and when he did that then he lost his original condition and brought the whole world subject to death when he had to take the responsibility or either accepting a new light that his wife had found which was contrary oh god think of it God only gave them about eight or ten words to keep there was no Bible there was no 1,100 sermons there was no dry moody there was no he gave them ten words but of that tree thou shalt not eat that's all they had to keep and even with that much word they broke it it says they broke it then Adam had to face up will I will I do as my wife had said do he listened to his wife or shall I do what God said do and he walked out with his eyes Oh but he had to take the responsibility that throwed the whole human race unto death now find me any life in that there is none alright number thirteen power of transformation now we find out that this fella found even the Garden of Eden this young woman that knowed no sin know not what her nakedness was and he knew what Satan knew he was smart subtle wise and he told her the seed the fruit was pleasant and it was desirable and when he lived with her that morning and then see then the afternoon she persuaded Adam it don't tell it that don't tell me that that Adam quickly took her in and done what he did to her it shows me that she persuaded Adam to do the same thing telling him what it was and then Adam deliberately knowing he not ought not to have done it walked out with his wife and did this act which finally would have come to it anyhow but see it had to be that way the wisdom of God cuz this then that displays his attribute to be a savior a father and a healer God knew when he put Adam and Eve in human flesh they would fall but when they fell he had already made weight away from to get back but to be a complete to be God he had to be a savior father and a healer he couldn't be that in the Garden of Eden before the fall amen but now remember he didn't make him do it either he didn't entice them in any way he gave them total free moral agency to do what they were doing alright number fourteen and then we'll get to number 15 which is what we're what we're looking at here we're not doing to that layout of Stan church age quick look these scriptures would involved the Lord Jesus now this is no way out of staying church age in Matthew 4 where in Jesus is tempted of the devil he overcame the personal temptation of Satan by the word and by the word only oh this is that right here and he the three major trials that caught that correspondent exactly to the temptation of the Garden of Eden you ever thought about that you probably rated it quote a hundred times but whatever Satan tempted Adam at the first whiff he attempted the second Adam with the same thing what three things the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life Jesus overcame by the word he fell to the personal temptation of Satan by failing to use the word Adam fell in direct disobedience to the word but Jesus overcame by the word and right now let me say this is the only way to be an overcomer also it is the only way that you can know if you are overcoming because that word can't fail alright now here's the quote that everybody that they use to base their and now let me tell you but don't look before we get started George Quinn quote scripture cannot be broken brother Brown can't say one thing that the scripture didn't say and the scripture says in Adam all die alright and then we're going to read now we're going to also read in Romans and we'll will cut this thing off in the book of Romans 5 verse 14 explains every bit of it knight-errant church age CUC death or organization came into the church died or to make it plainer death became a resident we're in shortly before only life reigned as the original eve brought death to mankind so now organization has brought death for organization is the product of the double corrupters Nicollet ism and Balaam ism propagated by the prophetess Jezebel now Eve should have been burned along with the serpent for their awful deed but Adam intervened now remember don't forget all them 14 quotes I just read you and one more quote I'm gonna tell you scripture cannot be broken right in Adam all die now Eve should have been burnt alone with the serpent for their awful deed but Adam intervened taking her quickly to himself so that she was saved you know what she got saved from it didn't save her from sinning she died right what did save her from she died anyway it saved her from God killing her right then but when this satanic religion has gone the full course of the ages there will be no one to intervene in other words Christ has already took his bride and he's not intervening anymore she will be burned with her seducer for the and her children and the Anna Constance Satan will all find their place in the lake of fire so let me read that again Adam intervene now don't forget them 14 quotes we had before where Eve enticed Adam Eve sold Adam the product Adam without with her took her sin on his self so that's not talking about what that brother is talking about or those brothers are talking about that has nothing to do with a natural seed no way go scripture cannot be broken in Adam all died an Adam seed polluted the earth I just read you that quote to everybody understand that so how could us that's why I don't understand it's just not common sense common sense will tell you that the act that we were born under it's what's killing us the natural man and woman getting together and having you y'all are getting older and so am I because of natural seed we're not natural seed children anymore we're already here but we're supposed to be spiritual born seed brother Brown preach the spoken words original seed he spent six hours six hours trying to explain that the spoken word is theory you know seed man seed is what got it all in trouble and the parole beast was just a vessel he had though he was he was just he was just incarnated by the devil and the devil took over and well I don't have to explain that to the adults of what he told Eve he said hey Eva I think I was let me just go go through this okay the Beast says Eve I was here before you were creative evolution so there was a beast there and then then in the sixth day because the Beast was created on the fifth day all the animals was created on the fifth day six day man was created right so he said hey Eve I got here for you did and said I remember God saying something now this is Satan talking through the beefs he's got to be slick he can't just tell her what he wants to do to her you understand what I mean she's got to first receive it up here amen so he tells her he says hey he said I remember didn't God tell you the multiply and replenish the earth because he Satan was standing right there when that Genesis 1:26 man was spoke right he was standing right there and he's heard God say let us make man in our own image male and female created he them multiply and replenish the earth then the beast said men missus beast we making kids all right look at the little look at the little lambs they had little lambs running all over the place there's a little sheep running all over the place there's little cows running all over the place he said all I see is you and Adam what's that I'm not doing because you know he had to turn it towards Adam fault he had to say well now wait a minute because remember brother Brad said Eve was God and Eve got a new revelation she get it from Adam she got it from the devil and she presented it to Adam after she did what she did so here so here Satan and the Beast is I can help you do that comes remember brother Brown said Satan knew the principles of life he knew that in creative evolution that that beast could coincide with the man or coincide with the Beast he knew that why how did he know how how do you know to go straight into that so that was the closest thing to the human right and it would commingle and and remember Satan don't have a seat say it's not a creator Satan had to borrow the Beast the body of the Beast to do the act talked even to doing the act and then that happens thereby okay without me he just kept going I believe maybe it was days months years it could've been hundreds of years it really didn't matter there was not any time before the fall so he just kept talking to her and finally she said okay remember what said she took them presented the product to Adam when the product was Adam me and this beast here have been talking got together and this is what we've done now listen Adam wasn't an idiot Adam was the god of the earth thereby all right with that Adam was the god of the earth Adam knew the principles of life also he knew what would happen cuz he would watch you could see the whole world repopulating by ear course but that was put for God to give to the animals not to the man because we were not supposed to reproduce sexually we were supposed to reproduce by the spoken word of God Amen because the spoken word is original seed why did he spend six hours preaching that sermon she didn't take the spoken word she took Satan's idea and committed the act first in her brain comes remember Mary had to do the same thing she had to receive it up here remember she said oh how I do this not knowing the man it was up here how can I do that's not knowing the man Holy Ghost said don't you worry her Gabriel said don't you worry said the Holy Ghost was gonna overshadow you and said what's gonna be born in you as Isaiah 9:6 and when he said that she said be it unto me according to thy word and from her spoken word and from the Holy Ghost doing what he did she received the seed without any sensation so he could be our brother now listen on the day of Pentecost when 120 lo jesus' were born they weren't born sexually they were already born they were born dead Jesus kept telling them unless you believe I am he you'll die in your sins he's the only one that could come out of the grave go over into another dimension come back into this dimension and divide yourself out to redeem man starting with 120 and going to 3,000 and now look at us we were all born again by the incorruptible Word of God in other words the incorruptible seed Word of God a man the son of man went and sowed seed he didn't sow natural seed he sowed spiritual seed because you and I are now spiritual children by the union of God and us together made a spiritual union he planted the seed Word of God in my listen you're receiving it now you're receiving the seed Word of God now not just me standing up here but when you read the Bible when you get a revelation that's the way it's supposed to be and that's God making love to you not the other way that's a perversion re or a shadow of what God is trying to do with us so it can't be Adam planting his natural seed no he said God I'll take her sin I'll cover her because I know what she did and I know who did it and you know what I'd have said it I just said God you already took care of that part remember he took the beast and he said on your on your belly he took that completely out of the picture but then God said he said I'll put enmity between die see talk about Satan in the state of the woman and a woman doesn't have see she received a spiritual seed word and that's what saves us folks is not a natural exactly what saves us is the spiritual word of God entering in the womb of our mind a man not a natural act all right now let me cover this let's read this right here real quick watch this we okay ten minutes till now we'll close in just a minute Smyrna church age I'm gonna give you my give me my thought on this but watch Smyrna church age not read the church age book a hundred times and I've never read this have you ever done that once in a while once in the morning while in the afternoon man Adam took life and turned it into death but this man Jesus took death and turned it into life Adam took innocence and turned it into guilt this one took guilt and turned it into righteousness Adam took a paradise and turned it into a waste howling wilderness but this one is coming back to turn and earth rocking and reeling with destruction into another Eden Adam took a life of fellowship and joy with God and turned it into a desert of spiritual darkness that brought forth all sin moral decay pain suffering delusion and corruption that wars within the souls of men but this one from all the tragic death and decoration that filled mankind brought forth the life of righteousness and beauty so that as sin once reigned unto death even so men now reign and righteousness by one across Jesus and not as the offense was though terrible indeed it was but now much more as his gift undo eternal life now do you know that he's quoting scripture that is exactly romans 5:14 turn it over let's read romans 5:14 he's actually read he read that whole scripture but he interpolated nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him that was to come in other words Adam remember brother Brahim said well Adam and Eve caused all this he said no they cause there's you cause yours I who is the figure of him that was to come cross Jesus but not as the offence so also is the free gift for if through the offence of one many be dead what is the offence Adam and Eve or Adam selling the human race really much more the grace of God and the gift by grace which is by one man Jesus Christ has abounded unto many and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift what Christ came he income sinful he came to take our sin for the judgment was by one to condemnation Adam but the free gift is of many offenses under justification for if by one man's offense death reigned by one Adam much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one Jesus Christ that's your answer right there Adam turn this thing upside down he had no ability to bring you back so he went out with her he had no way to redeem Eve and when brother Branham talks about being saved that don't mean saved like saved you understand what I mean no that means that it kept God from killing her because same way evening flames that Adam I mean that God should have killed Sarah God should have killed Sarah for laughing in her heart but but God brother Brown said God couldn't get to Sarah because of Adam I mean because of Abraham but God couldn't get to Eve because the first Adam said I'll take her now you say well you know he didn't he did commit the act yeah he did you wanna know my thoughts on it just for weak low you mow us around and run it through your holy ghost filter it's absolutely true that Adam had relations with Eve brother Brown said the Beast that morning and Adam shortly after that now we understand that that case happened back in the 60s in California the same way she that's lady had relations with her husband in the morning and had relations with the gardener a black guy in the afternoon all right now I don't know the science of all this but you know one thing's for sure sisters that when you do have relations and you start having a child your wound closes right you womb closes up and you can't receive anything else to make another baby until that nine months is over is everybody okay with that I know you might have to explain this to your kids but you know what they got to know it sometime okay so adamant what did Adam do Adam y'all quit laughing so Adam Zach so Adam saw what he Eve had done he saw what he had done he could not reverse that because he's not that kind of a guy he's not God he yes he could have killed her but a godly love took over and said even though she laid with the Beast she's me she's not another woman she's me she is me made manifest in another form called a woman water we will cry we are Christ made manifest in another form called a bride hey man where Christ made manifest and listen if Adam hadn't done what he done that whoo closed up and you would have only had Cain's lineage and then so that's why Adam did what he did he understood that if he didn't do something he wouldn't have a lineage because it is a natural lineage it does start a natural lineage Adam begot this one and Seth but I'm yeah I forgot this one and this one we got down there would have been no lineage and you know what there would have been no way to rock the Bible I know you're looking at me a little funny but there'd be no way to rock the Bible the way it was already written except Adam did what he did to raise up a natural seed that would have a chance that would have a chance to meet that Redeemer one day there was a not a better job Isaiah Jeremiah there would have not been those great prophets had Adam not done what he did so you know what what he did killed Eve killed him too but he preserved the natural race so that God could hey he was using the mind of Christ he did not lose the mind of Christ he still was thinking like God hallelujah he still was thinking like done I can't save them naturally or spiritually but I'm sure try to save them and put some people on this earth and let God did I can't that I can't fellowship with no more because God running my other garden he lost his fellowship God couldn't come down in the cool of the day but but genesis 3:15 God stood there and said Adam you can't do nothing about this but I will I will I'll not just bruised a hill I'll cut his head off I'll bruise I'll come down and come basically the same way that you come I mean that your children are coming but I'm gonna come the sinless one I'm gonna come and I'm gonna redeem that's what job job would have never been able to say I know my Redeemer liveth if Adam had not heard Lee he didn't wait for five days to take Evy couldn't've because her woman would have closed up you understand I'm talking natural so Adam knew folks he still had the mind of God we think he's a bumbling idiot after the fall he's not do you know one thing's for sure he had to be the doctor the pharmacist they wasn't but just a few people on earth a man he didn't lose his godlike quality I don't think he did he could remember so he did what he did not to save Eve but to save a lineage that had a chance because he couldn't go take her and go back in the Garden of Eden only God only the Redeemer they hung on Calvary could take us back to the Garden of Eden by what planting a spiritual seed and changing us and multiplying us the way it should have been had there not been a fall Oh Satan you just I'm sorry son I'm sorry you cannot and will not win you can pervert all you want to pervert Satan but they'll come a group of people one more time scripture cannot be broken in Adam in the first Adam all done but in the second Adam by spiritual multiplication when you talk about seed and talk about God God's seed is only his word this is the seed of God because this is where you get your new birth from is from this right here and the new birth is what God planning a spiritual seed in the womb of your mind and you say be it unto me according to thy word let's stand our feet when God came when God came down and Jesus was on that River there was a voice said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell he had waited 4,000 years to be able to say that because he was in Adam but he was in no one else because remember even the spiritual womb was closed until he came on earth and on the day of Pentecost there was 120 spiritual wounds opened up and God came down and settled down because Paul says we have the mind of Christ that's what comes to you in your birthday night and I don't say this to belittle no one but you can't you can't run what was preached through my filter and get the right answer get that answer but you can run it see you got to take it back to the Word of God the Word of God cannot fail will not fail and there's no way that it can be broken it has to come to pass somebody preach that soon they'll bleed it has to come to pass because scripture cannot be broken in Adam all die listen if you have a need tonight by your head if you have a need tonight just raise up your hand God knows your heart you don't have to come up here but we're gonna close the service out we're gonna pray and then we'll be dismissed this is a little bit after 9 o'clock I am sorry but I hope it's helped somebody I hope it's I hope it's righted some ships you know you know we all we're all a ship but the Holy
