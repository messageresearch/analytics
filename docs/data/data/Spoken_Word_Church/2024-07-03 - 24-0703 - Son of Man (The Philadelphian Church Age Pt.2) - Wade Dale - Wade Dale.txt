many many many comments is over 700 views on on uh YouTube just for the funeral service around the country and uh I read this to the to the family the other day and I forgot my phone but this brother from Uganda sent brother Keith Reed a message and said I watched the funeral service he said I thought brother Dale was black he'd never seen him he' heard his he'd heard his CDs they got the CDs but they didn't have internet service until they went somewhere to watch it and when they watched it he called brother Keith he said I thought he was black well I didn't even think he talked black but anyway there is something if there is something like that but uh uh they had we had a chuckle because uh I tell you around the country there's there's a lot of people being impacted uh by Brother Dale's Ministry that we'll never know until we get the other side I was talking to talking to brother Dutch Scott or somebody I believe it was in the we'll never know do we get there how much even

I accept his message the message of the hour the way it was preached but we still got a lot to do now so uh we um we're not going to stop we're not going to even pause you can't pause God don't pause he carries on all right and like I said before traged tragedy doesn't destroy a Christian it defines a Christian if you'll realize that it defined everybody in the Bible there's a defining moment in the Bible and sometimes it's not good job Jonah all the different ones look at Samson there's a defining moment in their life that they could have just curled up and said God I'm done but no they persevered enough to where God thought enough of them to write them in the Bible and and give give us an example to carry on so we we uh we're going to carry on do the best we can and uh we pray that

the love of the Lord couldn't have done it you know brother Dale couldn't have done it without you guys cuz he'd just preached the four walls if he nobody sitting in here but there's a lot of people that he met on that other side that afternoon that he had preached them into that place of rest and I love what Brother Richard said he said brother Dale knew where to go he wasn't lost at the river

double the place up but they really are looking forward to it and um and don't brother Andre said you want to not do it I said why you plan on going somewhere else or you plan unless we go in a rapture we coming right we ain't stopping nothing I hated to call off service Sunday but I knew we' every one of us their mind our minds would be in a different place on Sunday after the service so we just kind of took off actually me and June took off and went to brother Donnie Reagan's meetings and had a good time up there meeting people we had met in a long time and uh they honored brother Dale

see how that goes but also pray for brother Lise they're leaving Thursday going to Honduras next next Thursday so they'll be gone for a little while so pray for brother Lise if you got a little something to hand him and give him you know a few dollars here or there it sure would help the church is paying for the uh trip part of that so if you want to give him a little extra I'm sure it will go toward uh brother Lis is one that I can I like him and brother buron I can I can really uh put my faith in what he does with what with what we give him so I have have um a lot of faith in in what he does down there in the Honduras so man said one time if you love a flower don't pick it up because if you pick it up it dies and it ceases to be what you love so if you love a flower Let It Be Love is not about possession love is about appreciation amen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for this night you've give us Lord in the middle of the week I pray that you'd strengthen us now Lord for the journey ahead of us Lord and just put us where we need to be put the right words in my mouth tonight Lord that'll help someone and Lord may we just invite you Lord to just take over

that are under the sound of my voice and Lord bless the ones that are sin sick father this is a late hour they got to get in and it's just we're to preach and we're going to preach until we can't preach anymore and put some salvation in it cuz they people need to be saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Lord I pray that you'd bless us now and keep us in Jesus name amen I told somebody this weekend I said I am expecting something to happen I don't know what it is but I am expecting something to happen brother Brian preached expectations go watch go listen to that if you're expecting to just you know this is when night and I didn't feel good so I ain't coming to church and Sunday well that's just an anniversary meeting and I think I'll just take my kids and go to the mountains you'll get what you expect I promise you if you're a true Christian you'll want to be in church the ones that said amen I believe them one of y'all that didn't I don't know about that so let's that's your confession with the what with your mouth all right let's look at we're going to talk about the Phil phelian Church age tonight if they'll pull it up on the screen we will uh begin to read here in Revelations 1:10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write it in a book thank God he put it together so that we can have it today 2,000 years after it was written and it's accurate there's a lot of things been written 2,000 years ago not very accurate this is accurate this is eternal unto Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thara Sardis we're now in the Philadelphian Church age and unto Leota now we live in the lean age and we'll get to that a little bit later on and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with the Garment down to the foot and G about the PS with a golden girdle you may be seated and I'll read this I was thinking uh when Brother Richard was speaking there on Saturday brother John there was a lot of different denominations sitting in that room and some of the denomination of their own self so you know so when brother when Brother Richard started talking about Son of God and the son of man I'm sure they probably it just went amen listen but we're required we're required to be under the son of man Ministry if you're in the end time and you're in the message of the hour you got to understand that that word is going to be made flesh in me and you not somebody else not somebody to come but in me and you all right if you don't believe that then we need to get in the Altar and start praying we need to go outside maybe in the uh in the quietness of the of the woods or something and just pray and say God I don't understand this show it to me and you know what if you got the Holy Ghost he is obligated to show you an answer and he's going to put somebody in the pull pit to give you that answer all right so just remember though that God is a dispensationalist and remember I was thinking today we're going through all these Church ages now we we're here in we went through Sardis which was what that was the age of justification all right the just shall live by faith your justification is you got to believe that God did away with all your past sins if you don't believe that you can't move to sanctification you can't believe it you got to be a believer to believe that he don't even he don't even know about him anymore amen putting the Sea of God's forgetfulness never to be remembered again but now remember that same old demon is still there he just got a black eye he's not dead he just got a black eye and you're moving on toward God and that's when Martin Luther said the just shall live by faith not Penance not works not what the Bible says lest any man should boast I did this and I did that no the just shall live by faith it didn't matter I looking at some quotes of brother brandham he said you know God could have give everything to cus but he gave it to a fisherman he couldn't even write his name gave Peter the keys to the kingdom he could have gave it to Kus but he didn't he could have give all these great things to these other great people but he didn't he gave it to the lowly he gave it to the meek he gave it to the ones that are that what that are that are open that open say hey just God give it to tell me whatever you got right all right and remember the things that they needed God already give it to them right am Gideon had that Ox goat around him the whole time cuz he was poking his cattle and whatever else around he just didn't know he was going to whip about 300 Philistines with that or whoever it was he got tired he got sick and tired of being run over are we going to be sick and tired of being run over by the devil or we just going to keep like brother J said Wy Wy wo just keep going over and over living this thing over again somewhere there's got to be a victory there is victory in the message of the hour but there's more Victory in Jesus Christ amen the the victory is in Jesus Christ and then this is just this is the icing on the cake right the cake is Jesus Christ the message is the icing on the cake amen Cake's pretty good but I like some icing on it like a lot like all that stuff y'all fixed this past weekend had to buy some new clothes I was allergic to it it made me swell that's my story or June either put it in the dryer too long but no the food I mean we're still eating it and we sure appreciate all that and it was it was if it was if if it wasn't good we wouldn't tell you but it's it was delicious it was absolutely delicious and we keep eating and I told Josh we were at my house a minute ago and I opened up the we have one in the back a refrigerator in the back with freezer and I it up and I said this like a restaurant we got all kind of stuff in them trays you know stacked on top of each other in the refrigerator so but but thank God that we had all that to eat and and fed all those people and and had some left over and we sure appreciate that Revelations 3:7 now we're going to get into Philadelphia Church age now that church age is getting really close to leosa where we are now this church age is going to bump right up against the lotan church age all right and we'll read when it starts and when it ends tonight and we won't be won't be too long so Revelations 3:7 says to the angel of the Church of Philadelphia now who was the angel we know that was John Wesley all right we'll get to that in a second a man that preached eight I ain't going to tell you Ain no8 800 sermons like a month or a year or 800 sermons a year 4800 sermons I think in a stretch of time he got up at 5:00 in the morning he slept 6 hours got up at 5:00 in the morning started preaching some of y'all do too but it might not be very well until the angel the church in Phil philadelph who all morning in people around here yeah that's what I thought one these things sayith he that is Holy he that is true he that had the Key of David he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door we're going to see that this is one of the greatest missionary ages it wasn't just remember it was it was mainly Martin Luther but then Martin Luther they start they ma they made a print press so Martin Luther could put his words in on a paper but then what John Wesley did John Wesley started sending people out with that message the Bible was already put together by Luther so the print and presses and all these different things of Transportation was getting better and all these different things so this was brother R said the greatest missionary age it had to get the word out all right and remember this is the age of sanctification cuz if we go through just justification you can die and go to hell come on somebody you can go you can be Sanctified die and go to hell but you can't have the new birth and not die and go to hell but you got to have each one to get the new birth all right I know th works that's why that I'm spending more time on this Three Ages because brother BR said they complete the birth your birth is justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost all right everybody with me all right no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength now little strength and H has kept my word and not denied my name behold I will make them of the synagogue of Satan which say they are Jews and are not they're Liars but they do lie behold I will make them to come in worship before thy feet and to know that I have loved thee because thou Hast kept the word of my patience also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation we need that now which shall come upon all all the world now the hour of Temptation has come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the Earth and listen I'm going to tell you something this is the trying time right you better know that you know that you know now remember we don't shut the door God opened it God shut it in in Noah's time Noah didn't shut the door God shut the door all right behold I come quickly and hold that fast which thou Hast that no man take thy Crown to him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God which is New Jerusalem which cometh down out of Heaven from my God and I will write upon him my new name he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the churches so we're we're in the we're in the age of 1 2 3 4 five six Church age which is Wesley we've seen Luther Luther is going to carry over into Wesley the porter for that age is Wesley he comes in that overlap time we'll we'll tell you his birth and death in a minute but he was born at like 1701 and died in the middle of that somewhere so he was right in the middle of that church age so some of that carried over brother R will we'll verify that and just a just a little bit but that we're now almost at the last Church age but brother Brown makes a statement I'll read it to you just a little bit later I want you to think in your mind he said the last three ages completes the birth now that doesn't mean they weren't born again back here right all right they were born again back here they had the new birth just like you do it's just it was held down and bound by the word that they held that's right okay everybody with me same way with me and you I mean we can bind it too even with the Holy Ghost you can grieve it yeah brother BR said to go out and go on the limb out and sit out there and say all right I'll come back when you clean up a little bit amen I'm not coming out of your soul because you're born again but you at Spirit realm you have been H doing some things you really shouldn't be doing amen I'm sorry that just happens to me if it doesn't happen to you guys that's okay pray for me one day we're going to have to cut that limb off y keep him from going out there as we keep him in US Body Spirit and soul all right so we got now we're almost in we are in the man anointing this is where this thing always gets stuck Jo guess what we're going to start over again Tada technology if I have my notes this wouldn't happen I'm like Louise you know you get your notes and I want you to watch we've been talking about a dominating female about the church I want you to know that that we're not talking about the female as far as you sisters because you type the bride just like we do all right but if you got your position you're not a dominating female all right you have your place you have your position but if you dominate The Man and that's what's been doing the the church the the female part of the church has been trying doin denominate they did but dominate the male which is Jesus Christ all right so it happened in all the ages but now you see we come down and we when we get to Lea Lea is a woman's age it's a woman's number a woman runs everything in this age why it's come to the Apex of dominating it's a dominating they don't want Jesus Christ listen the Bible tells us in the Old Testament the Bible says uh uh let us take your name seven women seven churches take hold of one man Jesus Christ and said hey let us take your name but we're not going to do what you tell us to do come on we're not going to do what you tell us to do we're going to have our own way I mean me I'll do it my way and you just let us call us miss Jesus well that's what they're doing Nowa but they're wretched blind miserable naked and don't know it and so are we until the Revelation comes of the end time message to open up the full entire Bible or the opening of the seals as we see here so remember the the opening of the seals we're going to get back to it when brother randam preaches them when we get into that church age but remember everything we've been talking about has been talking about a loosing there's something been bound but there's a loosing brother CLA and I were talking the other day you know he talk about those uh 200,000,000 demons that were released into the world and then brother Brown said they're released on me and you what to do though not to destroy us but to drive us back to the Homeland cuz that's what happened in ikan and Hitler are different ones but 200,000,000 demons that were withheld just for this age just for me and you but we will overcome amen cuz we have the word we have the open book The Devil can't hide behind the true word of God he can hide behind a fable he can hide behind a false religion that's why God hates false Doctrine cuz Satan can hide behind it because he's the author of anything false God's never the author of anything false he's all true everything he says is true he don't have to ever take it back praise God we don't have to make excuses for this message we don't have to make excuses for the way we live in this Bible amen you make excuses you never had an experience right amen right so let's let's not preach let's just go back to teaching a little bit here so the opening of the first three seals we see that there was a Ministry loosed a horse went out but also when that horse went out there was already someone standing there or there was a lion anointing already standing there cuz he said John come and see and then out goes the white horse rider right then we look and see that we keep on going that he bluffed his way through the the church it became a saying then a deed then a Doctrine and I go back to where James says when lust is conceived it brings forth sin when sin's finished it brings forth death it's death to begin with but we're all born in sin we were all we all born Sinners right but there's a way out if you continue in sin Paul said do we continue in sin that Grace May abound where just Grace covers everything no there's no grease in Grace there's no greasy Grace there is Grace but they're not greasy graay but he bluffed his way through the true church then we come to the next seal when it opened the second beast which is the ox it comes out and says hey come and see John because there's something coming a little bit different he's changed his horse or he's changed his power all right so the second beast the ox beast in the fourth Church age all right everybody with me fourth Church age was that Ox anointing of Labor longest Church age there was we just got finished with it they just barely had enough strength to make it through if they called oursel a Christian they died so that's why that horse was red and power was given and what happened God allowed Satan to then have a voice or a sword or something to use or a Doctrine see tonight and all of true ministers they're they're taking that sword and they're trying to cut that bad out of you they're trying to cut that bad out of all of us and then let us heal by the word of God cut that bad thing out that we've been doing but they should kill one another what a great killing 68 million population of California and Texas was obliterated by the Catholic church because you called yourself a Christian so now we are here in the next in the fifth Church age it starts as a man anointing because look the man anointing during that time is intelligence it's up here intelligence all right and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast which was the man anointing tell John come and see and I beheld it was a black horse and he that set on him had a pair of balances and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beast and thank God for Jesus Christ because that's Jesus Christ telling us that's not the one of the four beasts that's not John if you'll read your church book brother R said that was Jesus Christ screaming out saying hey don't hurt the oil and wine don't hurt my people and there was enough hurt going on right now the black horse rider was the Antichrist but the one was speaking at that age was represented as man and that's the wisdom smart shrewd man started doing making inventions I read you the whole thing about it so the sardian church age remember it started out I know your works you got a name that you but you're dead right I have not found thy works perfect remember as we talked about Luther this is what brother Bown said as Luther crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith they held Works think about a man though one man he goes against the whole system it's kind of like Moses going against Egypt there's not a chance in the world that you would get any kind of odds in your favor but Moses destroyed a whole nation with a stick right and so did Luther he destroyed a whole Doctrine now he didn't kill it he heard it but he didn't kill it right but he heard it enough to where he pulled out and started reforming or starting the work of restoration in that church age number five and as the freed Christians glorified the son remember Roman Catholics they they just they love Mary if you'll just keep reading about Mary they they just rever Mary and they don't even talk about Jesus Christ how horrible is that now you about a dominating female now Mary herself was not not a dominating female but they've made her one by their doctrin and that's what a Doctrine does it makes something false seem true is that right but it's the doctrine absolutely Babylonians one of the son carrying The Mother We already covered that remember Martin Luther brother R said Martin Luther was one of the Great uh preachers of the time because what did he do he stood up against this whole system he stood up against every Church on every corner he stood up against every Catholicism Doctrine every time a priest would come he would blast them remember they put a head out on him and they would have killed him if God hadn't hadn't saved him they were going to take him out but they couldn't do it listen Satan can't take you out until God's done with you if you're a Christian if Brother Richard said this weekend if's a big word if you're a Christian you never will end your journey until God says I'm done with you because remember I don't know if you know this or not God never makes a mistake somebody ought to preach that every once in a while so Martin Luther stood and said the just shall live by faith not by this not by this doctrine that I'm that I I was a part of it listen if you were in a system you were part of it too you believe there was three gods or or Trinity you were believed in a different baptism I say some of you that went through the through the Baptist Church and Methodist Church and different ones we all had that same thing but we had to stand one day and see that true justification was that just shall live by faith not by that work that they're telling us to do so Martin Luther said this is what I'm preaching and this is what God was perfect listen God's always perfect but he was perfect in what Luther was saying Luther was telling them the truth now he had other things that were different that that he had a false baptism and different things but God winked at that God wasn't looking at that at that time he wasn't expecting Perfection at that time this a now this age he is expecting Perfection cuz we can look back to Luther see the mistakes he made see that his justification is mine and your justification in a baby form right and we got to have that just to get our journey started right not to get Born Again by for there in the righteousness of God is revealed from Faith to Faith that it is written the just shall live by faith for the wrath of God is revealed from Heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who hold the truth and unrighteousness that's what Luther Luther was reading this same thing cuz he's the one it took it in Latin and put it into uh German at one time and then they put it into English right right so he was reading this and he said the just shall live by faith Galatians 3 says but that no man is justified by the law in the sight of God it is evident for the just shall live by faith Hebrews 10:38 now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him in other words if you draw back into that old thing you've been doing that old doctrine that you've been doing that old thing you've been doing in the past if you go back to that listen God don't go back now he will show you where you started but he's not going to keep you there your Journey's up here right but we are not of them who draw back into predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul now they were reformers they were not restorers God promised us that we would be restored but he had to do it with reformers because remember when Luther preached this I praise God every time I I read this brother Aaron I look over here at our prophet in the end time he was not a reformer right he didn't try to make them better by saying something no the power of God was on that man to take and deliver you from what you were up against and he delivered he didn't do it but God through him thousands and hundreds of thousands of people were saved filled with the Holy Ghost and healed through their Natural Body by that man's words God used that man amen that's right so Luther was against works as means of Salvation and baptism as means of regeneration he talked the mediation of Christ apart from man as was the original and Pentecostal concept because what did they do they had already took it and put it in a pope or put it in their Bishops or put it in their you know you do so many noveni and you you go confess and I've always said that's why the that's why the U Mafia loved to be Catholics every one of them's Catholic why they go to Convention and say look man I'm going to take this guy out tomorrow and the priest goes well bless you you know say 25 hell marriage and put about $50,000 under the table and you'll be fine right Le you know what we laugh they believed it right amen they believed it all the way to hell but thank God we've come out of that what stirred his heart by the Holy Ghost which was the little green shoot as we were explaining the other week the two little shoes that is corn it's the life of the Corn but it's not the full grain it's part of it piece of it all right so we're trying to get it back to the church at Pentecost because that Holy Ghost fell on Sons it fell on mature people that was with Jesus for three and A2 years that was a full corn of ear of corn in that church age the first church age but what happened is God had to let it die and go on the ground cuz he'd already said it and then you got Joel Joel would have never Joel would have never been brought into being the Book of Joel where it says what I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh but he said what I'm going to restore I'm going to restore everything back that's why brother brandom was restoration not Reformation all right and praise God we're part of that I love being associated with it I don't know about you but I was proud to be a a Believer to time message this past weekend sitting there listening to Brother Richard and different ones speaking and and uh Josh's friend Doug he he got out of the service and he told Josh he said wow I never seen that before well he' been to a funeral to where they just you know they you know speak or say a few words and play a couple of songs and and Ashes the ashes dust the dust and I told them I said you ain't going to see you he was surprised they it was a sermon we got a sermon preached to us on on on Saturday Brother Richard preached a sermon and we responded to it I mean most time you don't get that but you know what get it while you can they were there preach to them they can't say they never heard it now when you start talking about a body change you talk about taking that body and making it Eternal you talk about going into another dimension you talk about all those and it it's just weird to them but to me and you we shouted amen cuz we knew what he was talking about we knew who the scripture was talking about all those things right amen so praise God it's not it shouldn't make your head swell up it shouldn't make you you sat there with your head down going God why me and why not them amen but thank God God for little two little shoots cuz remember when you got born again that's all you had right you had two little shoots you were just struggling to get out of the ground and you had two shoots but you had life in you potentially you had the wheat cor the wheat corn the kernel right remember potentially but remember if you'll read in the Bible Jesus talks about the tears and all these different things putting the seed into this kind of ground that kind of ground you can actually you can't have your salvation taken away from you all right is everybody with me but you can lose the joy of it for one thing and for another thing if you just get Justified and you don't keep going on you're going to hell anyway you won't go to hell for the sins you did before cuz God is just that's why it's called justification just to forgive you for that because you asked him God I didn't mean to do that amen that's right forgive me Lord and he's just to forgive you put it away not ever remember it again but the next day there's another recording turned on right all right that's why Luther's justification in this age will not get you to heaven now if you died you understand deathbed confession and all this some I y'all I don't have to explain all this if you're alive today and you're listening to me or you're listening to somebody else you can't you can't say God I don't know any difference I just was justified but I'll be right back to doing what I was doing no you can't do that cuz God's going to hit play and he's going to play a tape where somebody's going to say you need to be Sanctified you need to be filled with the Holy Ghost amen I thank God for all the baptism we've had and all the different things but I want the Holy Ghost to come on people I want the Holy Ghost to be inside of you doing the work not just sitting here in a church just paying attention sometimes luk will ever forever be known as the instrument in the hand of God who revived this truth he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith it's been called by the historians the period of reformation that is exactly right that is what it is it had to be that for Martin Luther was a reformer not a prophet now what does a prophet do a prophet restores back what was lost right amen that's right amen he restores back what was lost all those years that were lost according to Joel the different canw and BW and all that brother random stood in a time to where he brought every bit of that back right he was a prophet he was not a reformer he was a restorer of the word of God he didn't bring anything different he was stored back what have been lost that's right then there's a a revealing of the Seven Seals that nobody had in till the end time yeah we'll get into that so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like the Apostle Paul now remember you got your book ends you got Alpha and Omega Paul and brother brandham they had to have the same message but Paul didn't have a message that's what Thrills my soul Paul didn't have a message to turn your body back Paul didn't have a message he preached about Resurrection he preached about the change of the body but he knew he wasn't going to come to it it had to be in the end time so he was able to lead the church back was not able to lead him back to the whole truth as was a man like brother brandham that's why we rever him as a prophet behold I will send you Elijah the prophet right right not Elijah the whoever Elijah the prophet and then Elisha was a prophet also but we'll get into that a little bit later when we start into brother brandom Ministry we'll talk about how that Elisha and Elijah um came about Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God in other words the word does not call to Restoration but it's called Reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been another Pentecostal age but but it wasn't they held on to a lot of different doctrines even Martin Luther held on to a lot of doctrines that were false the best that could be said of it strengthen that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing yes there was certainly there certainly was this age had justification but it missed sanctification now look if you take that now there's there's people in the message a long time ago not so now around when Dad was coming up different on said that that that you know Luther didn't have anything Wesley didn't cuz brother RH says right here they had justification but they missed sanctification now remember their justification was the new birth for their time that's right right it was time for full res restoration it was time to reform the people to at least get their mindset listen God's perfect he knows how to Lead Me And You from One thing to the next thing to the next thing and to the next thing and if it was different he'd have made it different you see I can understand then you got a problem cuz God wrote this so every every person on the face of the Earth can get Born Again by this right here if you can't you're not born again right but you have a chance to get born again get in the Bible if you can't understand the prophet's message read your Bible then ask God to direct you to where brother random give you the Amplified version of it come on somebody they didn't have this in any other age we've got all kind of information that we can get to on you I don't have one I'm not I'm not this it'd just be something else I'd mess up till I get an Apple watch but I see y'all sometimes you do this and what it is is you watch turned on and you got a message you're reading the message and on your phone on your uh hello somebody am I telling the truth or am I telling the LIE hello thank you you don't have to do this when the phone goes off you do that when your arm goes off and you start reading the text and you're doing this you know anyway but we have this information so why not use the information for God instead of for the devil amen all right that's the reason there's a church it's the temple of God filled with God even the Holy Ghost The Same Spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do the mighty Works which he did came back on the church at Pentecost he couldn't be different but what happened at Pentecost after Pentecost man started getting their own ideas in it and just tore the word apart amen so there had to be a start of re Reformation to ease e us out EAS us into sanctification EAS us into the new birth all right everybody with me listen or God would have done it another way we've got to depend from about a month or two ago I said you just got to depend on what God said if you can't depend on what God Said who else you going to depend on let me have his name number and let me have his website and his email address I'd like to talk to that person but nobody but God has all the answers this age did not have those words oh they had the written word but not the revealed word that was the Reformation period but fear not little F flock what he say I'm going to restore and this reform was going to be the start of it he was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depths of Satan in the dark ages to the the depths of God that they had at Pentecost now who you talking about he talking about his age in the first few years of existence of the church so you know you know what the meaning of not perfect is it's unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age why they didn't have enough word to do this right here and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her church come out of her my people if you hear his voice you will come out if you're his people not everybody is his people you got to know that you know that you know that you're that person that you be not partakers of her sin at that point in time he's really not worried about yours he's worried about what you coming out of God forgive me for thinking like that forgive me if you ever like Brother D said many times before if you ever thank God for what you got that he's took you out a false doctrine that other people are sitting in it right and they're what they're giving their life for it right for her sin reached into heaven and God hath remembered her iniquity remember God hates yes God hates God hates false Doctrine he's nowhere around it he can't stand it he hates niotis he hates denominations he hates all that stuff but he loves his bride amen he loves the part of the word that we are now the holy spirit's been bound by the denominations all these 2,000 years we find out notice the Sabbath seven sabbaths they couldn't get all the way out now we'll explain this a little bit more when we get into the the part where brother Brian brings a message because as we been as we've been talking we're sitting here today in a loud of CNA is everybody all right with that we're sitting here lazy I don't want to say the word fat but we have need of nothing think about that I pulled up in a car that was worth more than the first two houses I had bought when we and June got me and June got married so we're hurting yeah right but the holy spirit's been bound by the what by the denominations for 2,000 years and we notice the Sabbath now what was seven Sabbath seven sabbaths every seventh Sabbath there was a release right so Paul comes up he is in one part of the church AG there was a release but you couldn't go all the way cuz it was only seven but the Bible according to Luke I me according to Leviticus 258 you got to have seven of those sabbaths seven of those sabbaths seven of those Church ages to have your golden Jubilee that's right cuz if you stay in sevens 7 time 7 is 49 so 49 is not the golden jubilee you and I when you got born again you entered into that golden jubilee by the soul that's right but you got to realize that what you got in your soul today is what's going to take you out of here it's what's going to take you either in another dimension if you need to go or it's going to change your body right here amen that's right but they couldn't get all the way out in other words they didn't have enough word to get everything out of that denomination same way with John Wesley I'll read you a quote here in just a minute he was scared that when he died they'd make a denomination out of what he had he was scared now we know brother Ram said every time they died they denominated Martin Luther before he died I mean John Wesley before he died he said I am afraid they're going to make this a denomination scared him to death is what they said so I will restore so the first three ages had the pure word of God all right Satan was still there but the power of the word took over then in the fourth CH Church age it went into the ground it actually died they killed them 68 million of them but according to John 12 if it didn't go in the ground the son of man wouldn't be able to come back in the end time that's right so thank God you this is kind of weird thank God for those Martyrs they had to go in the ground they had to give their life for the gospel they had to do it because me and you are standing right here now right amen cuz when is the son of man glorified in the end time but that son of man before Paul comes on the scene the son of man was standing on the Earth right right he had to go in the ground and die literally come back to life and then he poured himself out in the church ages or poured itself out in the first three ages and then it began began to what the worms the four worms started eating it down right by denominational ideas and then what happened I will restore to you the years that the and let me say this false Doctrine eight in the church ages the false Shepherds the false teaching the false churches they eat away at the word of God my great Army i s among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied look when all this restoration this is what we're getting and praise the name of the Lord your God that have dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed if you are listen if you're ashamed of this gospel you need to get born again if you're ashamed to walk in Walmart with your his clothes on brother Chris long I hope he's not watching but he'll be here tomorrow he's coming in early he's said Brother Jules preaching tonight but he told me he said you know he went with us when we went on that um fishing trip and stayed in Helen he said I'm going to take Joanna tomorrow and let her look around in Helen it's going to be 99° some of y'all that's been there I told I told brother Chris I said you better put you on some sunglasses cuz I'll promise you you going to probably see 10,000 people and they ain't going to be clothed as much as sister Joanna about as much material she got on it' be 10,000 that don't have them on but that's the world and they don't mind they just go do whatever they want to do and it doesn't matter to them it doesn't bother them it don't bother you know you know the old man going the river going down the river but he just wanted to show her actually you know why he's going you know the do y'all know the movie have you ever seen the movie I'll climb the highest mountain Google it GE I thought y'all was some man do anybody know what I'm talking about come on it's a good black and white movie ain't got no cussing in it ain't got no fussing in it it's 100 years old but they made it in Helen the church the white church is that one right up there at Robert toown sitting right there where all the um where the zip line and all that is that white church is the church that that guy pastored what it was is I think his son died or something if you go back to nor M the gr mail right there on the side of the road where the water comes down that's where the little boy drowns so anyway praise the Lord some people I'll guarantee you you'll know what superhero was on the movies about a month or two ago but you don't know about to climb the highest mountain but it's about a minister coming and then that's all it's all filmed in Helen and it was filmed probably back in the 50s but anyway he wanted to take Joan and show him show her because they'd watched the movie praise the Lord somebody did I mean it probably wasn't a top 10 but it was a movie made up there and it had some religious connotations it was a minister and his wife and you know going up there to a country church and and just watch it it'll be okay y'all watch something else color ain't got people ain't got no clothes on but you want to watch his in black and white myet said I will make up to you the years God says I'm I God said I've not wasted it You' wasted it right you've wasted those years but I'm going to be gracious and make them up for you I'm going to make them up to you The New American Bible says and I will repay you for the years but he had to wait and stop now God don't stop we know that but the word had to stop him enough to where that could go in the ground and die so it could come back up and what bring forth much fruit so in the end time the son of man's got to come back just like he was over here so it had to come the same way that's right now remember Ezekiel 47 we see that Luther now we see we have enough we have enough of his writings and and Wesley's writings they preached a progressive revelation that's why I thank God and I know all the other ministers like Brother Richard and and brother excuse me brother Harris that's what dad was known for sure he was known for being intellect but and all those other bad things but it's just people didn't understand him you know why they were lazy they preach hair and dress and God sent a prophet that's all there was more to that he read Ezekiel Lord progressive revelation ankles we love ankle deep water but you can't do a lot with it then you got water to the knees then you got water to the loins crustification sanctification loins the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's where the reproduction is everybody with me then The Headstone comes the water was where you can swim in it that's what we need we need so much Revelation till it'll almost drown you if you don't want it then I'm sorry you're in the wrong place but my dad preached the progressive revelation and he preached where Brother Richard could see it and all the different ones that listen to him and all the thousand thousands that he'll never know that hurt him over overseas but it's a progressive revelation that real listen I'm going to say this whether you like it or not real true genuine Born Again end time Believers lives on progressive revelation you can be Sanctified and just have a glory brother brand brother brand brother brandom and die and go to hell but you listen you can't have Progressive true progressive revelation and it not be of God right amen and you not be of God he's not going to waste his Revelation on the devil's kids right well you get quiet if you want to but it's the truth anyhow I stand here today on the foundation that we've got to move that we've got to progress that we've got to do like brother Dale in that in that um Vision that he had helping the people up get them in get them up into the what in the astronaut age get them up where we can get out of here cuz that Spates shift left right and we were in it we're going to get out of here whether you like it or not I like it I'm 64 I like it a lot more than I did when I was 54 but the fifth age all right it went the ground in the fourth age fifth age what happened two little shoots come up it was a true message remember God don't have faults but Luther had only enough to get the the life of those two shoots up out of the ground all right God was happy and pleased with that he loved it CU if you didn't have them two and the photosynthesis and the what the growth if that seed would have stayed in the ground Jesus told us if it stayed in the ground and died it abide alone but if it comes forth it'll bring forth what Luther Wesley Pentecost and then you people that are sitting here today am but they couldn't get all the way out they listen they drug some baggage with them they drug some ideas that were not God's revelation right but God winked at that and said okay that's all right cuz every age I'm going to shed that off I'm going to shed it off right I'm going to get my people HED as brother ROM said the honing age is now the honing age was not Luther's age not Wesley's age not Pentecost age it's this age you say what age you talking about I'm talking about the bride age I'm talking about that 50 getting us out of the church ages if you got a church age mentality you're going to die spiritually we got to move up now brother Brown tells us on to stard E in church AG now the three elements that worked in those three Church ages three elements what justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost that's what it takes to constitute the full birth that's why me and you are standing here today we constitute the full birth we are the wheat at the end of the plant well if I don't excite you then you need to find something to excite you then get a shot of something well you get happy at ball game you get happy when you see a friend you had seen for a long time well maybe not but you do if you like them a lot we get excited about a lot of things but when you preach the word of God it's just they just sit there there's something inside of you ought to boil up and at least go amen right do you know what amen does Amen breaks the airwaves and pushes it back toward me but if not then you're just sucking air back that way but when you say Amen you have you are you are expand you're pushing out some some what some some air with an amen behind it an amen means so be it I believe what you're saying I believe what you're saying that's what it takes to constitute full birth they were only conceived as a little germ in the womb of the mother that's right the holy ghost coming to birth the last three Church ages forms the complete birth all right now not that they listen not that they didn't have the complete birth over here but Luther had justification he smoked a pipe and drank a beer now some things you you think boy that's kind of evil it's really it is now but back then he was a German Germans even now drank beer like we drink tea right but he SM he didn't have anything to carry him further he just honed in on the just shall live by faith get out of that system and I'm sure if you heard him preach he probably preached in Revelations come out of her my people but pieces of that stayed in him not in his soul right but in his Spirit realm Satan was still riding come on Satan was still riding that Dark Horse sorry that's why it had to be exposed in the end time where it was coming from who it was and what's going on that's right anything contrary to the word of God is the devil there's no second person or third person right let's skip some of this so justification is the outer court and remember what about the outer court now look the outer court if you look at it when you go out the door and turn to the left you'll see the the uh situation of the Tabernacle the outer Court was just walls up but it was no cover over it if it was dark it was dark if it was raining it was raining if it was 99 degrees it was 99 degrees right that's the way justification is but you got to push your come on people you got to push your way into the next realm you got to push your way into sanctification you got to push yourself into the new birth you got to walk from one to the other to the other when you get in that second realm which is the the the realm of sanctification you do have a cover over you but remember the light is still artificial the light is still candles it can go out but you're closer to God right you don't have to worry about the sun and the moon and the stars and the sky you're inside of a place that just you and a few other priest can go in and out but remember you got to go on back to the next one where it's just you and God by yourself right you and God alone nobody else not your preacher not brother brandham you got to go back there byy yourself that's why I want to caution you do not ever put your experience on somebody else's right well brother D had it that's fine I need it amen right I don't get it cuz he's got it am what I said many times I've seen many many many times in the message when a pastor dies or a pastor moves somewhere else a lot of the people leave or they get cold why there Holy Ghost left amen I'm going to preach anyway I'm standing here your Holy Ghost left you put so much on that person you know what God will do he'll take that person out of the way that's right amen God does not share his glory with nobody I put my trust in Jesus Christ through a Ministry that we are sinting under that we're going to continue under as long as I'm here we're going to continue under that but don't you ever put your faith in me you put your faith in us both contacting God together everybody with me contacting God together yeah put your faith in that cuz I'll fail you I promise you I I'm a human but God will never fail as long as I tell you the truth Chris Long said you preach the word of God and they can't they can't they can but they can't talk about you not preaching the word of God CU you know if I'm over here doing something else not bad but I mean something you don't like remember we all got things we don't like but right here is where the sacred comes right amen that's right I stand in the holy of holies before you get there but don't put your sights on me to get you back there now through us through the ministry we'll get somewhere but don't ever put your put your holy ghost on a person except Jesus Christ if you'll put your it doesn't matter cuz you know what God's going to shake this thing and he's already shaking it he's going to shake us he's going to do as the old man said he's going to sh shake you in the liver he going to make your liver Shake that's right he's going to shake this thing to find out who's in and who's out right but don't put your confidence in anybody but Jesus Christ amen you can put your confidence in a fivefold Ministry but that's fivefolds that's a team we're working as a team together and you're working as a team together you have a Ministry just like I do all right I've got to do the first thing though I got to take of the first fruits and give it out to you but the what do you do with it well that's fine that's great brother Wayne you got it I know you got it no you don't I can be the biggest deceiver standing here today you ever see in your life but you better be able to discern it you better be able to discern whether I am or not that's what I put my faith in when I sit under brother Dale's Ministry I'm looking at me to make sure I'm right and that I can receive what God has through a person we're only vessels we're only somebody God uses and when he's finished with us he takes us out of the way but until that we're still going to fight we're going to fight with everything we got there's many people today that's never went any further than the outer Court what they depend on something else right yet they are Christians oh brother brandom be careful I'm telling you what he said by the millions what the confession Bible says confess with your mouth believe in your heart that Jesus Christ has come to save you then you'll be saved all right believe that John 3:16 that's baby baby justification but if you continue to walk further you got to have another experience called sanctification cuz you can't go meet God as an unclean vessel amen that's why we got to get into John Wesley to where he preached all the time sanctification right he was an Englishman he come to the fact that hey dude y'all can sit there and drink tea all day if you want to it has no value to it at all you know what he was saying you're wasting your time sitting having a tea party when you ought to be at church listen to the word of God I say the same thing my people don't come to church half the time they got all all the other things they got to do if you become a real good Christian I promise you you won't have to I'm sorry why do why do we why do we we strive to come to church and others don't why there's something different amen God don't make exceptions well you can get quiet if you want to right but it's a truth that's right they enjy look watch they enjoy Christ in an outward form amen good preaching brother but go home and don't live it they go to church with a consolation of knowing they belong to spoken word church but they have never become hid away with him in the inner Court I'm just reading you the meage what the message said brother Ram's telling us brother Ram said in the hidden life he said you got sunlight some days are cloudy some days the sun don't shine at all some days it's dark now that's in the outer court but remember as brother Brown always said don't take sunny days as God's approval of what you're doing but also don't take the dark dreary days that God's left you CU he'll never leave you you may leave him but he'll never leave you so we read the Philadelphia and church AG watch a couple of points here and then we'll get to Martin Luther we'll be done I'm John Wesley he that hath the Key of David now watch he that openeth and no man shutteth and shutteth and no man openeth I Know Thy Works behold I have set before thee an open door now that wasn't true in the fifth Church age this is the sixth Church ages this is the Philadelphian Church age this is going to be the age that Livingston David Livingston you've you read about Stanley and Livingston well David Livingston was a really great great great missionary I think he got killed over there too didn't he a didn't get killed over in Africa doing work or wherever it was India he got killed somewhere doing work but anyway it was a great missionary age you see all these other different things Calvin swingley you hear these names D Moody and all the names that you hear they were of God but some of them were still in the re Reformation though they weren't in the restoration they were in the Reformation if Moody was a trinitarian he wasn't a restorer now he might be a great man of God for his time do you hear me brother R said Moody said Millions to heaven so I'll say he'll probably be there too but he didn't have a restoring message he had a reforming message that's why brother R had to come but they they were stacked up and brother Ram just stood right there on top of them he said I I preach what Paul preached he said I didn't preach what dght Moody preached he kept referring to I preach what Paul preached I preach what Paul preached he gave honor to all those other ones but he was a restoring Prophet to restore us back to the fa faith of the fathers for thou Hast a little strength and H has kept my word and Hast not denied my name behold I will make of them the of them the synagogue of Satan we'll talk about that maybe a little bit later so we'll continue on down I want to get to this right here the AG starting 1750 to 1906 and that Philadelphia actually means love of Brethren or brotherly love all right Revelations 3:8 I Know Thy works now watch behold I have set before thee an Open Door so in other words there's a door open now look that's an open door to the missionary that's not an open door to the seals the seals didn't open under Martin Luther I mean John Wesley so it was an open door for the people to get the Salvation message of Jesus Christ to the world and no man can shut it for thou Hast a little strength and has has kept my name it didn't say it was full strength had a little strength and that's not denied my name a little strength listen this was still an unfulfilled age Martin Luther was John Wesley was an unfulfilled age Pentecost was an unfulfilled age this age right here is the only age if you've called out of it there going to be a very filled fulfilled age all right now listen the first phrase of this verse I know that works is analyzed in the rest of the verse for The Works had to do with the open door little strength word in the name in order to understand the wealth of the meaning involved and behold I set before the open door and no man can shut it we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another he's talking about the lap over we've been talking about this for a long time there is an overlap a melting are Fading Into rather than an Abrupt end and a clear-cut start this age particularly flows into the next age and not only does that age overflow into the last age talking about our age you know why it had to we need sanctification we need John Wesley's sanctification the seventh age a very short age gathers up into itself for one quick work all the evil of every age and all the reality though of Pentecost once the Philadelphian age has about run its course the lot ofan age quickly comes in bringing forth both the tears and wheat to harvest you can't bring it to harvest like this right that's Luther you can't bring bring it to harvest as as as Wesley the shot are coming up you can't do it as a shuck shuck just covers or or covers over the real wheat you and I are the real wheat but Pentecost was the cover we'll get into that a little bit later because there is a Pentecost L just like it was in Paul's age there's going to be one in this age all right real quick remember please that the sard Ean age started the Reformation that must still go on until the grain that was planted at Pentecost goes through the full cycle of planting watering nourishing until it comes right back to an original seed while this is going on the tears that were sown will have to go through their cycle too listen brother ROM come and preached the powerfulest message since Jesus Christ does everybody agree with that the most powerful message ever been preached since Jesus Christ he didn't destroy one denomination that was 900 and something when he's preaching there 13,000 now amen but he got into a heart of a group of people sir that's what he was looking for he wasn't looking for a great big church on the side of the road a big denominational church he was looking for individual people right I want you to see something here God works in threes doesn't he it was in the third or pergami and age that the church was married to the state now he went way back to the third age that the church was married to the state the Deeds of the nicians had become the doctrine of the nicians that age was the open door for the false fine okay once it was backed up by the power of the state it became actually a world system even though it bore the name Christian thus it spread like wildfire but now Three Ages later now that was the third age fourth fifth sixth everybody with me brother 1 2 3 4 5 6 we're going to see an open door for the truth now listen brother brandom walked through that door amen remember the Bible says he op and nobody can shut it so once the true word was open they had a little bit of it but brother Ram walked that's why he said you got to have Luther s justification you got to have Wesley sanctification you got to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost as the Pentecostal had it right we can't have furtherance of the word without about that that four stage has got to be the culmination of those three plus somebody say Amen you didn't understand that I'll explain it to you again four bugs eat it right four bugs according to Joel I can't remember them all but it's the same bug in different stages four of them so four life Messengers had to bring it back right so you had the lion ox man and Eagle all right everybody with me then you had Luther Wesley Pentecost and then the full word restored through brother Brown's Ministry so it exactly is in those four stages we are now in the the not the this not the that not the not the shuck full grain after a long and hard struggle of Faith here comes the open door to the truth truth the word of the Lord now has its day of course the fifth age had set the stage for this Mighty move as that age give us exploration colonization printing of books Etc so now John Wesley was born in 1703 to 1791 I'll read this just real quick and then we'll close the messenger to this age was without doubt John Wesley John Wesley was born in Epworth in England June 17 1703 and was one of 19 children well praise Lord how did he have find time to preach his daddy his daddy's name was Samuel and Susanna Wesley his father was a chaplain in the Church of England but it is more than likely that the religious turn of John's mind was based upon his mother's exemplary life than upon his father's theology John was a brilliant scholar it was while he was at Oxford that he and Charles remember Charles is his brother all right everybody with me on that became part of a group who was spiritually exercised to worship on the basis of experimentally living the truth rather than making Doctrine their standard now watch why this is why that's why he's he's called the move it's called a Methodist move it is a method of worship that they didn't have in the other age right all right if you'll go to Methodist Church don't be scared if you go to Methodist Church they'll have it in their song book you can open their song book up and it'll say Say it'll tell you what John Wesley told them to do they don't do it they drew up a spiritual guide of works such as giving to the poor B in the sick and the imprison for this they were called Methodist in other words they had a method to do things and other derisive derive titles now John was sufficiently U ued by his vision of the need of religion now watch this John thought he was born again it'll prove to you right John thought he's born again he was going to America he actually colonized Savannah he come into Savannah stayed several years Charles did too Charles got in trouble well that's a whole another thing he went to Florida that was his first trouble nothing against Florida but I'm glad it's below us where was I so he went he went to America as a missionary amongst the Indians he was going to go to and and and take his new birth his Christianity and he was was going to give it to the Indians boy did he get Awakening if you read his whole story it was one Calamity after another they didn't like that man um James Edward othor that founded Savannah he was a buddy of John Wesley or he'd have shipped him back a lot sooner than that but he tried to send him over here and it wouldn't work tried to send him why that wasn't his job at that time John Wesley wasn't even born again he found out all right on his way there he found that many of the ship's passengers were moravians he was deeply impressed by their meekness peace and courage in all circumstances in other words there was a big storm came up and they were all having a hisy fit and the moravians were downstairs singing and praying John was impressed with that his labors in Georgia in spite of self-denials and hard work was a failure he returned to England I went to America America to convert the Indians but oh who shall convert me back in London he again met the moravians it was Paul boiler who showed him the way of Salvation he was truly Born Again much to the dis dismay if you'll read the book Charles got angry because Charles was like he built his listen I'm telling you one more time he built his experience on John's amen he said John you're already born again you're already this John whon amen but watch this he was angry because what he was saying was he was saying John you're denying this is your Born Again experience which he was who can not understand how such a spiritual man as John should say he was not formerly right with God it was however not long after that Charles too was saved by grace the work soon took on such proportions that he he began sending out numerous Layman that's the open door to preach the word this seemed like a parallel to Pentecost where the spirit raised up men with power to preach and teach the word of God almost overnight so here's your missionary age that was violent opposition to his work but God was with him let's stand our feet come on musicians we'll stop right there um there was a time when John Wesley got kicked out of all the churches he even got kicked out of his daddies he'll keep reading in the in the uh in his history and he couldn't preach anywhere they wouldn't even let him in the building to preach and his poor old Daddy had passed away and they made a mle lium of it you know put him about that high off the ground didn't bury him but put a granite thing he walked out there and he told Charles he said put my pull pit on my daddy's grave they put the pull pit on daddy's grave Charles did and he started preaching somebody came up and said something he said uh-uh he said my daddy owns this land I'm standing on my daddy's land I'm not standing on your land I'm standing on my daddy's land and while I'm here you can't knock me off and he preached I mean there would be hundreds and then thousands would be you saw the power of God working in a man's life but what did he do he absolutely one more time he preached a year he preached 800 sermons a year he traveled 4500 miles one year by horse we can't get to church on time horse he had to feed that thing he had to wire it he had to bathe it he had to pray for it one time it broke his leg he had to pray for it to get his leg healed back up so but that's the power of God in a man that yielded himself to the work of god let's yield ourself now we're in the open door we're now in the open book that's right we have no excuse to not have the power of God working in our life we have no excuse whatsoever if they can have it I can have it if they can have it you can have it let's sing a song God bless you if you have a need real quick amazing gra How Sweet the Sound that like me oh you love the Lord I was lost you remember your journey but now I found I was but now I see thank the Lord for the truth was Grace that my heart

that old John Newton I think it was or one what was his name Aaron what was his name the guy that wrote John Newton that wrote Amazing Grace yeah yeah he sat up on a ship and he looked down and he watched the slaves they were bound they were going away from a home that they didn't even know anything about they were going to America to be slaves they were Chained and Shackled up they didn't sing those words they sang a song with that tune to it that's right John Newton the inspiration struck him and he wrote those words and there's several other verses there like six or seven verses of this of Amazing Grace that he wrote Because he saw something in those people that were enslaved that were being taken from their home that were being taken from their family very families were torn apart but John Newton looked down in that in that boat and he could look down and see the slaves and they weren't grumbling I'm just going to say it they weren't grumbling that's right they weren't a wowy wowy woo they were singing a praise song in the b in the bottom of that boat going to a place they didn't know anything about and going to be who knows where they were going to end up Georgia Louisiana Florida South Carolina they were just going to be dispersed everywhere but they didn't let it bother them their present situation only made them stronger and I thank God for that if you're a real true Christian that's what will happen let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord thank you for this day You' give us thank you for the time you you've given us Lord to speak to the to the
