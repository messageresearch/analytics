have you take your seats just for for a moment and before i get into the word first of all i want to bring greetings from my pastor brother biskell and all the saints up in cloverdale brother sam's been up there and brother ed still has whatever we talk about coming down to georgia he still remembers the the convention that uh that you sponsored there and that was one of the best conventions that we've ever ever had and it had a dramatic impact on missions all over the world because that was the focus for the convention and uh i'm thrilled to be back in the dale's house and they told me that bedroom has got my name on it and i'll tell you what that bed sleeps as good as any bed i've ever been on and it's so wonderful to see the whole dale family and the extended family and the new ones that i haven't seen since the last ones i've been here and it's good to see all your faces i want to give it a testimony real real quickly i don't want to take away from the word but you know there are days that take place in your life that literally transform your surroundings that transform literally transform your future and i had one of those experiences and it was a while ago brother sam had asked me to come down and speak at one of the fellowship meetings and at first you know i was i was ready willing and able and by faith i was going to come but as the time approached my feet were not cooperating and uh you know i i'd been stricken for for quite a while and had a real a real challenge and every day of that challenge i was just confessing and believing and i i believed that god was going to supernaturally touch my feet in the meantime i was doing everything that i could i was going to every doctor that i could and some of the people from my church they dragged me to some practitioners that i would not recommend to anybody if anybody ever suggests you get you get acupuncture make sure you get all the details before you before you go through it but anyways so uh i called brother sam and told him i would not be able to come and uh so we were talking and he was asking you know what was the problem so i told him and at that point brother sam said you know he said brother gary atkins he's been fighting the same condition with his feet for over 11 years and so to make a long story short brother gary called me and we began to talk and you know he told me everything that he had been through and i told him what i've been through and you know it was like my book was his book and his book was my book but only i hadn't gone through it for 11 years and so he told me that that just recently he had gotten relief he told his podiatrist that the medic medication that she had prescribed wasn't working and so she said well i don't know much about pain but i can give you a referral to a pain clinic and so he went to the pain clinic and for the first time i think he had told me he went to about 25 doctors but for the first time he met a doctor who understood pain and understood what brother gary was going through and he was able to prescribe him some some medication so brother gary was kind enough to take some of the medication it was a medicated cream and it was made up of four different ingredients and so he sent some to me and i put it on my feet and for the first time in about nine months for the first time i could feel my feet again it was it was it was just like i mean it was you know to me it was a miracle cream because my feet were ice cold and they were numb and when i walked it was like walking on pins and needles so just going from from my bedroom to the bathroom that was a challenge going to the kitchen it was like going to war to try to get to the kitchen and uh you know get something but i'm so thankful for the saints in my assembly because they brought over food that could have fed 10 people and my phone was ringing and i had visitors and you know i'm just so thankful for the family of god and like brother branham said in the last days the only place that true love would be found was in the bride so brother gary told me he said brother ernie's i'm gonna send you this this cream and it worked for me and he said now uh he said you need to find a pain clinic in your area like like i find you need to find a doctor in your area like my doctor in georgia and he said now you're going to have to go through some hoops and hurdles because you just can't call up the pain clinic and say i want to come in i i tried that i tried to call the pain clinic and the lady she sounded like she thought i was nuts she said she said she says you can't call here make an appointment i said why not you're a doctor she said you need a referral so i go to my doctor and and i tell them and my doctor uh you know he says well he said you're going to have to make sure your insurance company is going to cover it so i called my insurance company they said we want you to see one of our doctors so uh you know and i just got this insurance company because when obamacare came came in my insurance company of 32 years my health insurance company told me they wrote me a beautiful letter beautiful but at the end it said we're so sorry we cannot cover you anymore because we cannot provide the coverage that's mandated by obamacare and so so i just got this insurance company and they said well we want you to go to one of our doctors and i did and then with his doctor's or his uh prognosis was we want you to go and get a sonogram from your knees down to your feet to make sure that it's not something else and then after he found out it wasn't something else he said well i want you to go to the doctor and get your feet checked electronically and so they put all kinds of gadgets on me check out no it wasn't that i knew what it was and so finally they gave me a referral go to the pain clinic and thank god i found the doctor like brother gary was saying that understood pain understood what i was going through and he was able to to to write me up a prescription for that cream and you know everything everything has changed since then and i'm so thankful to brother gary and and sister rebecca i believe that she went to the post office i don't know how many times it went to the post office because every time brother gary had a little extra cream while i was going through the hoops and hurdles he would send it to me and uh well my secretary she was getting my mail whenever she would tell me that the package had arrived from brother gary it's rebecca i mean it was it was like hallelujah sunday so i want to thank i want to thank i want to thank brother sam for the invitation to come here today and like i say there are some days that change your life and that day the brother sam put me in contact with brother gary and the day brother gary called me radically and dramatically changed my life because i mean i i was in a situation where there was nothing i could do i tried everything and and nothing worked and so i knew there was an answer out there somewhere either supernaturally or medically and i'm back on my feet again this is my first i've you know i've been preaching locally in washington made a couple of trips down to california but this is my first trip cross country and um i've been in this this sunday will be 10 meetings that i've had over the last two weeks and i feel stronger now than i did when i left my house and uh you know you know when when you believe you can do it is one thing but when you actually go out and do it then you've got that locked in you say i can do it and there's nothing that's going to hold me back so god bless you brother sam god bless you brother gary thank you sister rebecca god bless you hallelujah so now i'd like to ask you to to stand to your feet and i'd like to invite you to go to the book of esther and while you're turning to the book of esther i'd like to make a couple of comments that the book of esther is a very unusual book it's a remarkable book it's one of only two books in the bible that are named after a woman now one other thing this may surprise you and if for some it won't but some it will the the surprising thing about the book of esther is that the name god is not mentioned one time in the entire book and prayer is not mentioned one time in in the entire book and uh what we're going to start reading is about a pagan feast with a pagan king and his name is a hosp but actually his real name was xerxes because the haucerus was a title like pharaoh or caesar and so we'll start reading at verse 1 and let's pray before we read father how thankful we are to know what we know to see what we see and to hear what we hear and to know that we have the punctuation of thus saith the lord in the message we read in the life that we live and we know that it's you who's living through us lord i i shudder to think where i would have been had i missed the connection that day that you sent somebody by my way and shared with me that god had sent a vindicated prophet in this day lord i'm so thankful for the opportunity to be able to speak to the believers in the congregation today and lord a congregation this size we know that there are many needs that are present various needs physical financial decisions that have to be made each one of us i'm sure has those that we that we love our family members and those that we come in contact with that we want the token to be proactive in our lives so it can be proactive in their lives father so i pray that you would you would bless each one here in divine presence i pray that you would give them great faith to be able to say today i am going to exercise my faith upon this need whether it's in my body whether it's in my family lord whatever it is let this be a red letter day and i pray that you had helped me lord to move myself out of the way and let only the holy ghost be heard and we ask that you had blessed the reading of the word i pray that each one would be able to walk out of this building today and say it was great to be in the house of god today amen god bless you chapter one verse one now it came to pass in the days of ahacerous this is a hosp which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over a hundred and seven and twenty provinces now if it you know when when you're able to spend a lot of time you know brother branham he says uh in the message redemption he says do you like to read between the lines he said why the best part of the bible is wrote between the lines and so i love to read between the lines and as brother sam was saying at the meeting if you can't see jesus in every scripture he said go back and read it again and you know one thing i do if i can't you know if i can't understand a verse i'll go to the verse above it or the verse below it if i still can't understand it i'll go to the beginning of the chapter and i'll read it all the way to the end of the chapter because there is a revelation that god has in every chapter of that bible something for our edification and so one of the things that i found out was that it's a hostarous he was reigning over somewhere around a hundred million people this was the medes in persia the second great empire after the babylonian empire he said that in those days when the king of hosters sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shusha on the palace in the third year of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and his servants the power of persia and media the nobles and princes of the provinces being before him when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honor of his excellent majesty many days even a hundred and four score days so this is a hundred and eighty day feast this was a banquet to end all banquets there was sumptuous food there was drink there was everything that you can imagine and it just went on and on and on and on but there was a motive as we'll find out why this king had this great banquet said when he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom in the honor of his excellent majesty many days even a hundred and four score days and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were present in shushan the palace in other words this was for his noble men his princes from all the 127 provinces they all came in and now in the last seven days he invited all the local people that wanted to come in to join in the feast both under great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace god bless you you can you can have your seats and i just want to continue a little bit he says where were white green and blue hangings fastened with the cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble the beds the beds were of gold and silver how many ever slept on a gold bed or a silver bed upon a pavement of red and blue and white and black marble and they gave them drink in vessels of gold the vessels being diverse one from another and royal wine in abundance according to the state of the king and the drinking was according to the law none did compel for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house that they should do according to every man's pleasure now the the feast that was going on it was for a purpose and a hausaurus he wanted to rule the world that was his great desire and he had this feast he brought all his princes and noblemen brought them in here for one purpose and that was to show him he said i have got the goods to fight this war he wanted to go to war and he wanted to wipe out the greeks he wanted to take over that that you know that that part of his empire and so he had to bring these men in and he had to show them his glorious wealth and and the pageantry of everything that was before them and it gave them confidence that hey this this guy he's you know he's got the anointing upon him you know it wasn't a holy anointing but you know it was it was an anointing and these people you know it's like you know i remember one time a brother was saying he said you know if right now if the pope in all his pageantry you know came you know came uh running by the front of your house you know you would want to go there and you'd want to look because they know how to put on the dog so to speak and so that's what a hostas was doing and so now it says in vashti the queen she made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to the king a hospital so she's having her own feasts the men and the women they could not come together at that time and so she's having her feasts for the women and and basically she's a woman's liber and uh you know we'll see down here on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine in other words he was drunk he had been drinking for 187 days and uh you know everybody around there was probably a little bit fuzzy so now the king he makes a mistake he makes a mistake and that is i am going to show all my kings all my princes all all my noblemen i'm going to show them my crown jewel and he calls for vashti the queen to come in now vashti when she hears this she said hey this this is not according to the law he should not be doing this he doesn't have a right to do that and she knew you know she knew her husband real well she knew what he was up to and so she had a choice she could either go in and do what he wanted her to do it would have probably humiliated her it probably would have been a spectacle and you know and all the people looking and glaring and all these drunk people and probably lusting you know lusting after her but but he had the most beautiful girl in the kingdom vashti means beautiful and so she had that choice and the choice she made is i am not going in now if she had made the choice to go in she probably would have suffered some you know some embarrassment some humiliation but eventually she would have got over it she would have continued to be the queen and uh you know they they could have just wrote another chapter but she dug in her heels and she said i am not going in now you can imagine if you're the king and you've got all your noblemen from 127 provinces and you make the proclamation and he probably said bring in the queen i want to show my queen's beauty to everybody so now it was heard that vashti's not coming in you want to talk about gossip you know what they say the definition of gossip gossip is a dainty morsel eaten with great relish see and so now you can imagine the buzz that was going through you know this great convention whoa wow this is this is never seen anything like this before what's the king gonna do now why is she not coming in see and so so so now it says in verse 12 but the queen vashti refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlain's therefore was the king very roth and his anger had burned in him so now on on the seventh day if we go back here to to chapter or verse 10 on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded muhuman bitha habana biktha abatha zethar and carcass now remember that that carcass now these people these these seven chamberlains they were eunuchs in other words they were so committed to the king and his kingdom that they had had themselves you know that their manhood was taken away from them because you know that this is a don't mistake this as any part of a spiritual feast or any religion this is a pagan heathen feast and who knows you know what was going on at this feast but these seven seven chamberlains they were the men that the king could trust in all of his harems and all the concubines that he had and that last one his name was carcass and we know where the carcass is the eagles will gather so now when vashti wouldn't come in the king was very roth and his anger burned in him and the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and judgment and the next unto him was karshena shethar admitted tarshish mers marcina and mameokin the seven princes of persia and media which saw the king's face these guys knew the king and now they're they're looking they're looking at his face and he is not a happy camper he is mad he's drunk and he's mad dangerous combination you know the word anger if you take the word anger and you put the letter d before anger you got danger and the d is the devil you know you know i can remember 20 years ago we never heard the the term road rage but now you get on the highway and you see it every five minutes and sometimes you see it more than that and people get all kinds of signs and signals and horns beeping you know i mean you know they're just going if you're not going 85 miles an hour down the freeway they're right on right on your bumper and and so now the king he is really really upset then the king said to the wise men which knew the times for so was the king's manna taught all that new law and judgment and the next unto him was karshina shether admither tarshish murs mashina and manukin now that that fellow mamukin i just want to give him a name this is milk toast mamukan and and i'll i'll show you why the seven princes of persian media who saw the king's face and which sat uh the first in the kingdom now the question is put forth what shall we do unto the queen vashti according to the law because she had not performed the commandment by king of hostas by the chamberlain's and mammookin milk toast mamukin he steps up and he says he answered before the king and the mukin answered before the king and the princes vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes and to all the people that are in the provinces of king of hosurus for the deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes when it shall be reported that king of hostas commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not so what he's saying is hey you know i don't want any problems here i don't want you know i don't want these women you know to to get empowered and say hey if the queen doesn't have to obey uh the king why do i have to obey my husband and mamookin he's probably saying i got enough problems trying to keep my wife under control because he was the first one to step up you know he says he says you know we've got to do something about this because not only has vashti insulted the king but we're going to have big problems all over the kingdom when the women find out that that the queen disobeyed the king and so he said likewise shall the ladies of persia and media say this day unto all the king's princes which have heard of all the deeds of the queen thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath he said i don't want any wrath in my house i don't want any contempt in my house i want the status quo i want things to stay the way that they are now where the the man he has rule over his house he said this is going to upset the apple cart so to speak he said never please the king let there be a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of the purge and the medes that it be not altered that vashti come no more before king of hospitals and let the king give her royal estate unto another that is better than she and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all his empire that word all a-l-l all his empire 127 provinces for it is great all the wives shall give to their husbands honor both to great and small and the same pleas the king and the princes and the king did according to the word of mammookin now here's where you know read a little bit between the lines so the first thing that has to happen is the king decides okay we're going to make this this commandment and then he gets his signet ring and he takes that and he seals that and it cannot be altered and then the scribes have to be called in and this is a big job because you've got many many languages and many dialects throughout this 127 provinces and so all the scribes had to come in and each scribe had to write this decree out in his language or in in his dialect so it was a massive massive project they didn't have printers and computers they couldn't take their email address list and put it on there and zap it out to everybody it was a very labor-intensive very time-consuming project and so now once the scribes once they got their job done then they had to call in all the runners all the messengers and they had to call in the horses and the camels and the mules and this project had to go forth and it would took a long time for them to reach all into the kingdom of a hundred million people over the 127 provinces for he sent letters unto all the king's provinces into every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that it should be published according to the language of every people now in in chapter 2 it says after these things and the first thing that we would think of is after these things after the queen had refused to come in to to see the king so that's what you know my mind when i read esther many many times but as i had a lot of time on my hand and this is one of my favorite books because you know the theologians they don't even know why this book is in the bible because god's not mentioned because prayer is not mentioned and because it was it was named after a woman it was the last book to go into the canon of scriptures and so now you know but but god's hand is in this book in such a miraculous way so i began to read and i i began to go into every commentary i could find and to go online and and i found out that between this time that esther had refused to go in to see the king and the king sent that proclamation that esther could no more come in that the the motive for him having the feast in the first place was put into action and he went to war and he went to war with the greeks and he had this that they say somewhere the estimates range wildly it goes for anywhere from 100 to 150 000 men up to a million men that were under his control and he mobilized these forces and he went out and he fought the battle and the name of the battle is it's thermop thermopylae t-h-e-r and uh when he went out to fight this battle he thought because he had such a an abundance of soldiers that he could go there and he knew that the greeks didn't have anywheres near the men that he had but what he didn't know were the greeks they were ferocious warriors and it was said that one of these greek soldiers could take out ten of ahostarus's men because they knew war they knew battle they they they they were armored but but you know the the the the soldiers of the medes and persia they had never been in a battle with with ferocious soldiers like that and so the king he suffered a most embarrassing and a humiliating defeat lost his troops he had over 300 ships that were sunk during this battle and so now he's back and he's sitting in his throne and he's he's humiliated and now it says it says that the king after these things after this incredible humiliating battle when the wrath of the king of hostrus was appeased he remembered vashti and what she had done and what was decreed against her now you know what he remembered he remembered that vashti was beautiful vashti was my queen vashti was the love of my life and in a drunken stupor i made a horrible mistake and and i called her in which i shouldn't have done and now i've made this decree and i'm never going to be able to see her again i'm never going to be able to see the love of my life again he remembered what vashti had done and he remembered the decree that vashti the queen who would not come in she can never come in again and he signed it could not be altered then said the king's servants that ministered unto him because they could see they could see the king he was in a deep dark dungeon of depression and despondency and the disillusionment and despair and disappointment and you know the horror of of what he had just experienced and to be alone in the kingdom it were before he remembered his life prior to that and how he and vashti had had just a wonderful life and now he's alone defeated wounded scarred emotionally i'm talking about he's wounded he's scarred he's bruised you know and and now his men they see that they say we got to do something here we got to do something to shake up shake up what's going on around here then said the king's service that ministered unto him let there be fair young virgins sought for the king and let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom that's all the provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all a-l-l all the fair young virgins on the shouse on the palate to the house of the women under the custody of hagee the king's chamberlain keeper of the women and let their things for purification be given them and let the maiden which please the king be made queen instead of vashti and the thing pleased the king and he did so now you know what happened at this time all the scribes had to be brought back in and every one of them had to sit down and they had to write out the new decree and then after they got all the language and dialects done they had to call in the runners and the messengers and the horses and the mules and and all those things had to be brought in and again a massive time-consuming labor-intensive project goes underway because all the kingdoms have got to be notified that all the fair young virgins are invited in to a royal beauty contest and if you win the contest you're gonna be the queen and so i mean you know all the all the beautiful girls that that that were you know that were fair to look upon they were brought in and there were probably thousands of them that were brought in of 127 problems if there was only 10 out of each province uh you know that would be over a thousand and so now they're brought in and they're given all their things for for purification now in shushan the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai now the word mordecai it means a little man okay and uh i think you probably know where i'm going with this mordecai the little man the son of jair the son of shimaya the son of kish of benjamin who was carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away from zechariah king of judah whom nebuchadnezzar the king of babylon had carried away so now there were some that went back but many preferred to stay because it was comfortable it was a good light they enjoyed it and it's estimated that there were approximately 15 million jews that were in a hospital's kingdom and he brought up hadassah that is esther and the word esther means a star his uncle's daughter so actually mordecai and esther were cousins but mordecai was older for she had neither father nor mother and the maid was fair and beautiful whom mordecai when her father and mother were dead took for his own daughter so it came to pass when the king's commandment and his decree was heard and when many maidens were gathered together unto shushon the palace to the custody of hagai that esther was brought also under the king's house to the custody of hagai keeper of the woman now friends at this point in time the supernatural has to be evident because mordecai has just taken esther a jewish girl he's now taken her and entered her into a pagan beauty contest to become the queen of a heathen kingdom okay so an esther and and so now and the maiden pleased him and she obtained kindness of him and he speedily gave her things for purification with such things as belonging to her and seven maidens which shall meet to be given to her in other words so she was you know she was given some some special treatment because everywhere she went she found favor with all the people probably her humility and her kindness and you know probably soft-spoken and so everybody that met her even the king's keepers of the concubines and the harems she found favor with them now verse 10 esther had not showed her people nor her kingdom for mordecai had charged her that she should show it and now now when you have a peace when you have the kind of peace the bible talks about that passes all understanding you just sit back and you rest and you wait but the bible says that mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's house to know how esther did and what should become of her so he's just walking back and forth he said oh my esther's in there there's a thousand other girls in there and what's going to become of her and you know when's it going to be her time you know he's kind of out of the loop while he's out there everything's going on behind the behind the walls all does he know that esther's in there with all these other ones and there's only going to be one chosen to be the queen now when every maid's turn was come to gwen the king of hospitals after that she had been 12 months according to the manner of women for so were the days of their purification accomplished to win six months with oil of myrrh and six months with sweet odors and with other things for the purifying of the women so again they did not get in a hurry all these women went through a year of getting bubble baths and maybe getting their manicures and their pedicures and you know getting their getting their hair done and conditioned and softened i mean when you got a whole year and and you know and and everything that you want there was nothing held back from these women they could get any treatment that they wanted and you know believe me back in these days a lot of people think you know they they were backroads people this was a sophisticated kingdom in iran persia is modern-day iran now now here's where it gets really really dicey he said thus whenever thus then thus came every maiden under the king whatsoever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women under the king's house now listen this is where reading between the lines it really kind it kind of gives you a spiritual shock sometimes you know when you realize what's going on here says in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned under the second house of the women to the custody of shagaz the king's chamberlain which kept the concubines she came in unto the king no more except the king delighteth in her and that she recalled by name so basically each one of these women they had a one-night stand you know what a one-night stand is you know some drunk people meet out of the bar room or out of the nightclub or something like that and they're either drunk or on drugs or they find each other attractive and they wind up in a hotel somewhere or his house or her house or something and then they wake up the next morning and he looks at her and she looks at him and you know he didn't look so he doesn't look so attractive in the morning as he did when they are out there dancing on the on the dance floor the night before with his hair all slicked back and she doesn't look so good uh her makeup's probably you know running down there and her hair is all frizzed out and so maybe they say hey you know it was nice knowing you but see you later that's a one-night stand and that's what every one of these maidens got they got a one night stand with the king now if the king if the king did not find pleasure in her she became a concubine for the rest of her life so these people were willing they were willing to take that opportunity for one night with the king to impress the king to become the queen but if she didn't do it to the concubines you go and so mordecai had had entered esther into this kind of a beauty contest where there was a thousand women there she had one out of a thousand chance of becoming the queen of a pagan heathen kingdom and if she didn't make it his cousin who he had raised up who was a jew was going to become a pagan heathen concubine for the rest of her life mordecai had to be he was a man of god he was a man of faith and i believe that he was led of god to do what he did he had i believe in my own heart i believe he had thus saith the lord because of the way everything unfolds after that said now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for the daughter was come to go in unto the king she required nothing but what hagiai the king's chamberlain's the keeper of the women appointed so in other words she didn't need all the lipstick she didn't need all the max factor of their day she didn't need she didn't need a tight you know a tight skirt she didn't need high heels she didn't need all those things she was a radiant beauty and and so she needed nothing other than what the chamberlains and remember the chamberlain there were seven chamberlains and each one of those seven chamberlains had had sacrificed their manhood so they could be trusted in other words they had no seed of their own all as they had was the king's commandments and so these seven chamberlains are a perfect type of the seven church age messenger and the last chamberlain was named was carcass and where the carcasses the eagles will be gathered and mordecai is the little man and esther is the star and esther goes in when esther goes in and the king loved esther above all the women and she obtained grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins so that he set the royal crown upon her head and made her queen instead of vashti so at this time now another royal proclamation has gone out hey the beauty contest is over all you fair young maidens that have come from far away you can go back to where you came from all you other ones that that came for a one night stand you know enjoy your life as a concubine but i have found my queen and my queen is is esther so now what happens is this proclamation goes out then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his servants even esther's feasts and he made a release of the province and gave gifts according to the state of the king so so so now here comes another proclamation and the scribes have to come in and they've got to write out the great feasts of esther and the runners and the messengers and the horses and the camels it's again labor intensive time intensive and it goes out and esther's feast is made and when the virgins were gathered together the second time when mordecai sat in the king's gate esther had not showed her kindred nor her people as mordecai had charged her and i loved this part for esther did the commandment of mordecai like as when she was brought up with him so she had absolute confidence in mordecai the little man whatever he said she did it and when she went in to see the king she didn't need anything except what the chamberlains had provided for her and each church age messenger from paul's church church age to iranians to martin to columbus to martin luther to john wesley right up to to our day with william branham each one of the bride of that day who was made queen in that day they needed nothing other than what their church age messenger had given them whatever their whatever their message was for that day they received it and they were brought in and they were made queen each one is is a queen to the king jesus christ for that day and that age now here's some drama in those days when mordecai was in the king's gate two of the king's chamberlain's big tha and teresh of which kept the door where roth and sought to lay hands on the king now just to uh just to preach expository for a little while uh while mordecai was out there and and he's watching and he's waiting and he's looking and listening and he uncovers a plot there's a plot assassination attempt against the king and mordecai finds out he tells esther and esther tells the king and the king has it checked out and if they find out these guys are guilty and they were taken and they were hanged and it was written in the chronicles they didn't have newspapers in those days but they did have every every province had people who wrote whatever outstanding news had taken place in the kingdom they wrote it down and especially everything that happened in the king's court but everything was meticulously wrote down and so they wrote down and mordecai you know he saved the king's life he exposed the plot and they wrote it down and the book was closed and it was put in the closet now we we have a new character enter on the scene and that is haman after those days the king of hospitals promote haman the son of hamadatha the aggite and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes that were with him now this this this next verse shows the kind of power that he had and all the king's servants that were in the king's gate bowed and reverenced haman for the king had so commanded concerning him so everywhere haman went he loved it he was a glory hog and he was decked out all the way and everywhere he went people was oh bow down the great haman is here and haman loved it he just sucked it up you know everywhere he went everybody bowed down and the bible says all everybody bowed down everywhere he is like is you ever see a uh at a football game or a sports game they have what they call the wave you know and and it's like everybody you know they they go through it and it's like a wave sweeping through there well when mordecai i mean when haman come walking through there it was a wave everybody bowing down giving honor and reverence but the bible says mordecai the jew bowed not right he didn't bow he said i'm not going to bend and i'm not going to bow and haman was absolutely furious everybody in the whole kingdom bow wherever he went but mordecai the jew would not bow down before him now we know that that that the somebody who has this kind of a character he's uh egomaniac narcissistic so now here comes the buzz again here comes the gossip and the king's servants which are in the king's gate they said in the mordecai why transgresses thou the king's commandment so that commandment again they had to make a big deal all the scribes came in it was put in motion again that haman was the prime minister and everybody in the whole kingdom when you see him you bow down and you give him honor and glory and reverence so now the men are saying mordecai why why are you going against the king's commandment why are you not going to bow and so now they they they bring it up to the king's prince and they want to say hey are you going to let this stand are you going to let this proclamation that the king made are you going to let this one guy defy everything that that has been said in verse five of chapter two three and when haman saw that mordecai bowed not nor did him reverence then it was haman full of wrath and he thought scorn to lay hands on mordeca he loved to have grabbed him by the he loved to squeeze the life out of him he loved to lay hands on mordecai and he sought to lay hands on mordecai alone he wanted to do it himself he didn't want anybody else to do it for they had showed him the people of mordecai now here's where we see the first time that it was known that mordecai was a jew it says because he had showed him the people of mordecai wherefore haman sought to destroy all the jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of ahosaurus even the people of mordecai so now they get all the important men they probably got the soothsayers and all those people and they were trying to find what was the perfect date to to have the proclamation to go out and kill all the jews now this has taken place in january and they find out that the best date is the 13th date the 13th day of december so it's the 12th month of december so there's a little bit of time here between when this where this proclamation is going to be made and when they actually carry it out to kill every jew so now haman goes in now you want to talk about about guile and deceit deception and haman said unto a hospital there's a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed throughout and abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom and their ways are diverse from all people neither keep they the king's laws therefore it is not for the king's prophet to suffer them now you know there's a hundred million people in the kingdom approximately we we can't be exact but but haman goes in and says there's a whole group of people here and their ways are different their laws are different and they're not obeying your law actually there was one man in the whole kingdom there was one man that wasn't bowing down out of all the 127 provinces but haman makes it like you know there's a whole group of people out there and they're a danger they're a danger to your kingdom he says if it please the king let it be written that they may be destroyed and i will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of this business yeah all the hitmen all the button men all the guys that go out there and kill and assassinate and wipe out whoever the king and the king's uh princes say to do it so i'm gonna give money to the hands of those that have the charge of the business to bring it unto the king's treasuries and the king took his ring from his hands and gave it unto haman the son of hamadatha the agait the jews enemy and the king said unto haman the silver he says i don't want your money the silver is given to thee the people also to do with them as it seemeth good to thee in other words hey you're my prime minister i trust you you say these people are a danger you say they need to be wiped out no matter where they are he said i'm giving you permission to wipe them out you do whatever you think is right for them and they signed it and the signet ring went down and it was made and that law could not be altered now i think you can guess what happened the scribes had to come in and everyone had the right and and then the runners and the messengers and the horses and the cam the whole procedure all over again then were the king's scribes called on the 13th day of the first month and there was written according to all that haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants and to the governors that were over every province and to the rulers of every people of uh every people of every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after their language in the name of the king of hospitals was a written and sealed with the king's ring and of course the letters were were sent out all over unlike in verse 15 it said the post went out being hastened by the king in other words haman said this is a 9-1-1 project this is not a regular this is not a regular program he says the scribes you better work faster and you runners you better run faster you messengers you better get the horses and the mules and the camels and get them ready and put them into high gear get your whip ready and just get that this is an important proclamation that has to go out so the post went out being hastened by the king's commandment and the decree was given to shush on the palace and the king and haman sat down to drink so they sat down as okay let's have a toast our enemy and the kingdom are going to be wiped out it's been done it's been sealed it cannot be changed so on the 13th day of december we will not have these enemies in our kingdom anymore and our kingdom will be safer and a greater kingdom now when mordecai he finds out all that's going on and so he goes before the king's gate and he he just rips his clothes and he's got sackcloth and ashes and he's just gone before and he's wailing and moaning and so now esther she finds out you know the men down there they get word to the people who take care of esther and they say hey look uh mordecai he's out in front of the king's gate and he is making a fool out of himself and it's going to come back to you esther and so she sends clothes and and she sends the messengers down there and she said mordecai get next to yourself you know what's wrong with you straighten up you know you you can't you can't be acting like this so they sent down brand new clothes for them and mordecai saw them i'm not taking these clothes i'm in sackcloth and i'm here for a purpose and he sends he sends the the proclamation that the jews are going to be wiped out he sends the proclamation back to esther and he said esther you've got to do something about this he said you got to go in you got to go into the king and you've got to show your kindred and you've got to save the people now esther she was enjoying being queen brother wade she was enjoying all you know the luxury the beds and and you know the clothes she had and the food she ate and everywhere she went everybody admired her because now she was the most beautiful woman in the land and she was loving it she was living the high life and all of a sudden mordecai comes and said you've got to go in and you've got to tell the king that you're a jew remember this is a pagan heathen kingdom and a hosters knew nothing about his wife being a jew and so now esther she says she said hey she said i'm not going in there don't you know that there is a proclamation that's been made that nobody can go in to see the king into the inner court unless they're invited and if they're not invited and they walk in and if the king does not hold out the golden scepter it's off with their head she says and i haven't been invited and so i'm not going in too dangerous i like my head and so she sends that back to mordecai and mordecai sends a proclamation back he said esther how do you know that you have not been raised up for such a time as this and you know he says esther don't if you don't go in i love morning he said esther if you don't go in deliverance will rise up from another quarter in other words god has other ways to save the people he's given you the opportunity he said how do you know that you haven't been raised up for such a time as this and so esther god gave her a backbone she stiffened up she said i've always obeyed mordecai i've always trusted mordecai i'm gonna do what he says and she says call the people and have them fast and i'm going to go in and if i perish i perish if i lose my head i lose my head but i'm going to see the king and so she got all dressed up put on her favorite clothes and she walked in and she's probably her knees are probably shaking and her heart's probably beaten you know probably you know double what is normally to beaten and she's trying to keep her composure and she does what is totally against every law the biggest in fact the biggest law is nobody can go into the inner court to see the king unless they're invited and if they're not invited man it's big-time trouble and so she comes walking in against every law and she comes walking in and and the king sees her and he says esther my queen what is it that you want you can have anything even up to the half of my kingdom so esther comes in and she touches the golden scepter and she knows that that all is okay because the king held out the scepter and offers her half of the kingdom and so she says if it please the king i'd like to have a feast made and just you and me and haman will go in and we'll have a feast and so the king says let it be done notify haman that that we're going to have a feast and it's just myself and my queen and haman are going to be there now haman the glory hog he's just i mean he's just eating it up and he's telling all his friends you know not only has all this glory been given unto me and everything's going my way and now the king has invited me in for a banquet and it's only going to be him and the queen and me i mean things can't get much better but then he sees mordecai the jew and mordecai the jew he's just sitting there in his sackcloth and ashes and he ain't to bend and he's not going to bow so haman he just kind of you know gets next to himself and and and he goes on his way so now plans are are being made plans are being formulated for for them to to go in and so esther now it came to pass on the third day that esther put on the royal apparel and stood in the inner court of the king's house over against uh over against the king's house and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house over against the gate of the house so when the so and it was so when the king saw esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor in his sight and the king held out to esther the golden scepter that was in her hand so esther drew near and touched the top of the scepter so now they come in for the banquet that esther had asked for and then went haman forth that day joyful with a glad heart but when haman saw mordecai in the king's gate that he stood not up nor moved for him he was full of wrath and dignity indignation against mordecai nevertheless haman refrained himself and when he came home he sent and called for his friends and zarash's wife now he tells them he tells him about all his glory all the power he's got everybody in the kingdom is bowing down and giving me honor and giving me homage and now even the king i went into the banquet last night and now the king has asked me to go in for another banquet and and he says things couldn't get better i mean i i'm the most important man in the kingdom everybody knows it but all these things they don't do me one bit of good as long as that mordecai the jew that little man he won't bow down to me and it just it just galls me everything it means nothing until i get rid of those jews so now varash verash is haman's wife now i'm sure you figured out that haman is the perfect type of the devil got all the power get all the pageantry everybody's bowing down to him except the little man mordecai see and so now verash and the name varash means she who works behind the scenes and so varash says well you know what what you ought to do is you ought to have a gallows made 50 cubits high now mordechai is a little man and she says make a gallows 50 cubits high and take take uh mordecai and hang them on the gallows and so uh hamos that's a great idea and all of his advisors and all the men they all agreed that's the way to go that's the way to go now he's getting ready to go in and and make this proposal that he can hang mordecai before he can kill this jew before december the 13th so now that night the king is tossing and turning and tossing and turning because god is shaking them and shaking them and you you're not going you're not going to sleep tonight king i i got something that you need to see and so the king couldn't sleep and so he wakes up and he says he says well have the scribes come in and have them read me what's going on in my kingdom lately and so they're reading and reading and reading and they say and mordecai the jew uncovered the plot against the king and the king was saved and the men were found guilty and they were hanged and he kept start of the glory and the king said wait a minute what did we do to mordecai the jew to reward him for what he did and they said well nothing nothing was done no reward was given to him nothing and the king said you know who who's out in the who's out in the court out there i need one of my one of my noble men and so here comes haman haman's coming in to get the king to sign doc the the document and to have him seal it on his ring that he can take mordecai and hang him on the gallows 50 cubits high and so here he comes he he's a man on a mission he's like a heat-seeking missile he is bound and determined that he's going to wipe out this guy once and for all and the king said he said uh he said heyman i'm glad you're here i got a question for you he said here's my question he said what should be done to the man that the king desires to honor and mordechai said well you know who would the king who would the king more want to honor than myself i mean you know he's given me everything he's probably just want to pile on a little more honor he's pleased with the way things are going everybody's bowing down except mordecai the jew but you know i'm gonna i'm gonna fix that up so so he says now what should be done to the man the king desires to honor and haman said oh king probably put on his humble his humble act he said o king to the man that you desire to honor he said let the horse your horse let it be brought and let the clothes the royal clothes that used to wear let them be put upon that man and let the crown royal be placed upon his head and then have one of your most noble men come and put that man on the horse and have a celebration a big parade the whole kingdom of shushan the palace should know that you want to honor this man and the king said he said haman you're a genius i love that idea he said everything that you have said he said don't hesitate don't just make haste do everything that you just told me to mordecai the jew i mean you know if he didn't have a strong heart he probably would have gone over right then he's there to hang him he's there to hang him and the king is going to have him honor him so now he has to go it was his idea and and the king has told them i want you to do it i want you to honor him so he goes and gets the horse gets the clothes gets the crown and he gets he gets mordecai and he went through the kingdom now you know he was expecting to be on the horse and he was expecting somebody to be saying thus shall it be done to the man the king desires to honor but instead he said thus shall it be done to the man the king desires to honor thus shall it be done to the man the king desires to honor and when it was all over mordecai goes back sackcloth and ashes and here goes haman he goes back and he says he said their ash and all this advice he said you won't believe what happened i went there to get the document ready to hang mordecai 50 cubits high on the gallows and i got tricked he said somehow that mordecai has found favor with the king and i had to go i had to get them all decked out had to bring them through town he said my he said he said everything is going sideways and varash says well he said now she's the one who helped plan to hang mordecai and she said well you know look honey if the king has desire to honor the man that you've decided to come against you're in big trouble and so he's sitting there contemplating it and here comes the man says amen it's time for the for the feast and so he said well you know at least i got the feast to go to and so he goes there and he probably got there with the king he probably slugged back a few you know just to maybe calm himself down and you know forget about the day's events and now the king's there and here comes esther all decked out all beautiful and the king for the third time now the king says esther my queen what is it that you want even up to the half of my kingdom and esther says if it pleased the king he said i'm here i'm interceding for my people for we are sold we're going to be killed as a proclamation gone out and the king you could imagine the king somebody's saying somebody's out to get your queen and out to get all these people and the king says who is he and where is he that would dare come against my queen and her people and esther says he said the culprit is that wicked haman sitting right there right there now the king is shocked this right-hand man remember lucifer was the right-hand man once and he led a rebellion led a third of the angels away so now the bible said now the king he he goes out to the palace court maybe they had a little garden court out there and he's probably going out there trying to compose himself because he's shocked stunned staggered at this proclamation that has gone out against his queen and her people and so now haman he knows that his goose is cooked and now he's there and he he's esther esther please esther please have mercy on me no i didn't mean esther i didn't mean it for you and now so the king the king comes walking in and all as he can see is haman pawing at the queen he's down there he's pawing at the queen and so the king says what's he trying to do is he gonna take her right here in my court and the men came forward and they said behold the gallows 50 cubits high that that haman has built to hang mordecai and the king said take him out and hang him on his own gallows oh my so now just in conclusion esther comes and again she makes a proclamation or makes a request that this proclamation for the jews to be killed you know reverse it king said i can't do it right when i make one of those proclamations it is it's sealed cannot be changed he said but what i can do i can make a new proclamation and i can make a new date and that proclamation will say anybody who was plotting and planning against the jews there was a lot of activity going on there you know because those people were told that whatever jew you kill you can keep his property keep all his goods they were going around there and say well what jew has the most wealth what jew has the biggest house you know and they were trying to pinpoint that and no doubt there was a lot of scorn during this time and they probably say listen jew your days are numbered we're going to get you and so the jews they were all you know shaken up about this and they knew they pretty much knew who their enemies were and who was plotted and this plot was in 127 provinces scattered around about 100 million people and so the king he makes a new decree and the date is set and on that date all the jews were permitted to go out against any of their enemies and just in one in one day seventy five 000 were killed in one day enemies of the jews then in shush on the palace they had another wipeout of all the people and these were province i mean i mean the princes of the provinces especially close to the king right there in shushan and they were wiped out and they took they took haman and his ten songs and they hang them on the gallows and they took the ring that haman used to wear and they put it on mordecai's finger and mordecai he was given all the property of haman and and he grew more he grew more and more powerful and the jews became more and more accepted and they had a they had a a special place in the king's heart because his wife was a jew i can tell you just now just a real quick conclusion friends this book god's not mentioned prayer is not mentioned but god's hand god's supernatural hand is all through that book from the king from the queen the one who wouldn't come in that is now the world council of churches and vashti the fair young virgin i mean esther the fur young virgin who was educated by mordecai she's brought in she's made queen instead of esther because she followed everything the little man told her when she went in to see the king she need nothing but what the seven chamberlains ordered and she was made the queen and she was able to intercede for her people and save about 15 million jews that were in that province all through the provinces that day and now every every year it's marks 13 and 14 is the feast of purim it's a jewish feast and they celebrate and they come to the temple and they read they read the entire book of esther to the congregation and they're all dressed up it's like a costume a costume party and they get dressed up with their finest clothes and they read the whole book and every time the rabbi he says every time he says esther hey esther hey esther and every time the the the rabbi says mordecai oh mordecai hey mordecai and every time he says haman they say boo boo haman boo boo and they exchange gifts they have a celebration it's a party it's a day of deliverance for them the day when when when the enemies of god's people were wiped out friends that that book to me it is the bride's revival you can see yourself in that book you can see god in the book you see the seven church age messengers there you see the king the queen the chamberlain's you see haman you see the little man everything is there and even though god's not mentioned that sovereign supernatural plan of god is woven throughout the whole book that theologians say we don't even know why this book is in the bible i know why it's there brother sam i know it's there for me i know it's there for you for every one of you god bless you let's stand to our feet i i would encourage you that when you get a little time that you that you sit alone somewhere and get that book of esther and just read it you know just just just ev every line to me it it it it it's a it's a dainty morsel not the kind of a gossip that's a dainty morsel but i'm talking about a a dainty eternal supernatural morsel to this bible it it is a supernatural multiplication of inspiration and revelation for communication with god and when you take that station of creation in your imagination that dream machine of excitement and enchantment and ecstasy and you're able to see yourself and identify yourself and you know that there's over seven billion people on the planet now you know i i if if if only one percent of the people on this planet if they knew and followed this message just one percent that would be 70 million one percent of 7 billion is 70 million now friends there's not that many not that many friends but you're you're here and you've been chosen and selected and protected and one day you'll be ejected out of this world into a world with a faster dimension a faith civilization and you're going to say it was worth everything i had to go through and i encourage each one of you value that election that
