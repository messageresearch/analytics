========================================

pray amen amen you be seated ha thought you was not going to get to hear me today huh what do you mean yeah now uh I want to thank brother Aaron for taking care of Brother Richard and they kind of stayed up a little partying last night with that moth so uh so they're uh they're recuperating today so brother Aaron I told him I would do it Sunday School class so if you turn to the book of Galatians we just want to start there be being today is the uh 52nd anniversary uh we had um looked into you know doing something about the Jubilee but the Jubilee year is a 50th so we're actually into the into the we're we're we should already be free and now that we are coming into Independence Day which will be on Tuesday our founding fathers wanted to get away from tyranny and and oppression and wanted to have freedom so they came over here and July the 4th 1776 we became a nation here or uh we are celebrating our independence so let's talk about freedom because freedom in God now listen You'll never be free in man right no there's always going to be a boss there's always going to be this there's always going to be that so there's there we just need to see that there's freedom in the Lord Jesus all right don't worry about that other Freedom it's all right we got to have bosses we got to be bosses we got to have um people that tell us what to do and you got to have a preacher to stand up here and and you know tell you good and tell you you're bad all right amen right brother Richard that's right amen that's what our job all right but you can be free in the Lord or you can be sitting here today and be bound now I'm not going to try to preach I'm going to try to teach so I got 30 minutes maybe longer I can take whatever time no I'm just kidding Galatians 4: 29 let's read that but as many then now this is Paul talking to the Galatians let's talk about being free and having freedom and liberty but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit even so it is now all right he's talking about Jacob and Esau amen all right he's also talking about the different the the contrast and and you know the the Bond woman you also this we'll read here now verse 30 is talking about um Sarah and Hagar amen all right now God promised Abraham a child all right but he didn't promise him a child from the Bond woman amen now remember Hagar was in the house and she was was you know she was there and and um uh Sarah said uh look I can't bear child's here you need to fulfill that's why women should not be preaching just want to bring that to uh to your point that they just shouldn't be doing that um and there's a reason behind it not just because we don't we should be the men and we stand up here no there's a reason behind it because they get into emotion and and and Sarah blessed her heart she was emotional she wanted to have a baby she wanted to produce what God Said isn't that what brother rown said that that Eve wanted right Eve wanted to help God and he says okay she says okay you know that let me let me let me handle the plan will you see what happened so what happened in this Union between Abraham though and Hagar It produced a Bond woman and a bond child now we don't want to be bound today right we want to be free so we don't want to be in the bound part we want to be in the Free Part all right now nevertheless what saith the scripture cast out the Bond woman and her son remember God told him cast them out but now remember he didn't forget them he didn't forget it he said ishmail you'll be a wild child in other words though I'll bless you I'm going give you land I'm going give you all these things but you're always going to be the bond child and so when you're born into this world by your natural birth you are a bond child you are bound you are bound by this thing but we want to be HS as it says here shall not be the son of the Bond woman shall not be Heir with the son of the free woman all right so the free woman was Sarah who it was supposed to happen to to begin with and when they produced a child they produced Isaac all right so when you're born again you move from that Bond woman child you're now a free woman you you're born from a free woman all right so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but of the free all right so Paul's telling us we're going to be Bond over here but we're going to be free over here all right so there's two things right like I like I was preaching the other day you know Paul says the life I now live that means he lived a different life but the life I now live I live by the faith of the Son of God he didn't before no sir he went by his own word right amen he interpreted the Old Testament his own way right Paul dead Saul did but when God struck him down he became part of the free woman and he's and he's preaching right here and he's telling you I once was bound but now I'm free all right so then brethren we are not children of the Bond woman but the free now don't let me start preaching Brother Richard don't be doing that stand fast look Stand Fast in the what Liberty we love the Liberty Bell the Statue of Liberty and Liberty what about Liberty in God hallelujah but now remember there's one problem with this Satan can bind you and make you think you're free come on now read Revelations 3:14 blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it all right that's the blindness of the Bond woman that's the BL the bind The Binding of the one over here but we want to be part of the free we want to what have our eyes open amen our natural eyes our spiritual eyes Stand Fast therefore in the what Liberty where with Christ has made us free and be not entangled I like that I don't like that word but that's a good word to use you remember Satan will always trip you up he will always entangle you in in the things of the world he'll always keep you busy he will always keep you busy we have more time now we should we got quick this quick that quick this quick that and we don't have time for God There It Is Well that's our yoke of bondage be not entangled again with the Yoke of bondage our problem is us because we still live in this Bond woman Tabernacle of flesh but inside that free woman we want the we want the son of the free woman to be let out all right that's why want to see watch let's go to Romans 5 verse 12 now right here is going to totally explain your salvation amen totally explain from the beginning of time till today what God's plan and purpose is coming from a master builder called Paul amen so we take Paul as a master builder so he must know how to build a house that's right all right so here he begins to build Romans 5: 12 12 wherefore as by one man's sin entered into the world all right who's that Adam Adam by one man sin not Eve right listen Adam is the one that sold us out Adam now I know brother R many many times talks about you know the grave sits and all the things you know it's because of a of a woman well that's okay and that's true but Adam is the one that stepped forward and said I'll take her sin right don't kill her I'll take her sin because she's part of me so that destroyed the whole human race that's Adam's seed did nothing but destroy and we're all sitting here today part of Adam's seed amen all right sure you got the beast in there somewhere but I like to think that I at least got something right you know at the beginning so wherefore as by one man now watch one if one man cre made the sand one man all right and death by sin so death passed upon all men now look for all have sinned all right there's none good know not one God as our brother said God's not a respector of person that's right right now the only way you've got anything that was as Brother Richard was talking to other night last night about before the foundation of the world is that God knew by for knowledge that when you got here you'd want it he laid it right there but you know what he laid it out Adolf Hitler one day he laid it out to John Dillinger one day he's John Dillinger is going to stand before God at the Judgment Day and he's going to say I I don't he's going to say I'll tell you the day the hour and the minute I called you and you turned me down that's right the difference in you and these brothers and sisters that are standing behind me is they accepted me and you didn't well now God can't change his mind then well if he already saw listen God already saw judgment that's exactly right he's finished with the day of judgment and his mind is done we just got to act it out everybody with me and we're here to act it out by choice we still have a choice sir Adam made a choice even God made a choice that's right right God said I want to save everybody but he's only going to save those that He Saw wanted to be saved all right so let's keep that straight I don't believe in predestination that God pulled you through a tube and made made you become a Christian that's true no like our brother said but God sought us cuz he saw us before the foundation of the world and he can't get us out of his mind you know you we do things we go through life they certain things you can't get out of your mind God can't get you out of his mind cuz he can't change his mind so he can't change that he can't get you out and like I've always said I'm going to start preaching if God if God ever loved you he can't un love you that's right if he ever loved you and poured out his love on you he never can UNL you he can't say oh you've done so bad we're at the end of your life and you've done so horrible I just I just made a mistake God don't make one mistake that's exactly right he started this thing with Redemption before the foundation of the world where were you as as Brother Richard talking about where were you come on in so death passed upon all men for that all have sinned for un the law look sin was in the world but sin is not imputed when there is no law there it is so there had to be a law that's exactly even when Adam fell God had already a law in place he said I got to kill a lamb amen God came down his and killed a lamb threw the Skins back in the in the bushes as the prophet said and said put these on Amen because blood is what's going to have to cover you listen brother rown said one second in front of God with sin he'll destroy you so there had to be something made in the mind of God that he never saw Adam sin Hallelujah with his physical eyes so there's a separation there but yet God never forgot Adam Adam's not going to be in Hell Adam's going to be in heaven he's going to be right there with us I'd like to talk to him about a few things but still remember we'll get together on that but still God so entrusted Adam till even today Adam's impact is being felt right bad and good cuz he named all the animals remember if he said elephant it's still an elephant amen 6,000 years later Adam said that big old gray thing with a trunk on it that' be an elephant right there and nobody said no and God didn't say no son I wasn't thinking that no he said boy that's exactly what I was think amen so that's the way he wants to be with us because Paul tells us to have the mind of Christ but when he tells us to have the mind of Christ then we need the mind of Christ because our carnal mind come on in brother have a seat yes sir all right now listen nevertheless death reigned look from Adam to Moses now why did he say Adam to Moses cuz there was no law the law was not there man just pretty much did whatever they wanted to do but remember you had a righteous group though that came from Abel Seth all the way down that tried to keep it straight but then God said oh I got to give them a law because they going to have to live by something they can't just do this running around and like same way today we can't do this slopping around and marrying whoever you want to and and um so anyway we got to keep it clean God wanted it clean so we going to keep it clean all right that's why we there's certain things that as I was saying the other day about godliness we say well we can't be Godly well brother Brown said you can God said you can right right you say how can I be Godly live what he wrote pretty simple live what he wrote he told you women not to cut your hair you don't cut your hair he told you women not to wear pants you don't wear pants he tells us not to divorce and marry and divorce and marry we don't do that all right so we're living more Godly than the world is living in the nominal Christian world sorry to say it's become just a smorgus board of whatever you want to do out there Holiness and godliness has went out the door am amen that's right wearing shorts to church I mean you know you say well you're just being legalistic you know when I was growing up coming to church was a sacred thing amen that's the truth you put on your best you acted your best right even even the ones we knew were sinning in the community come on somebody they walked in that church they had on their Sunday Best okay they made an effort God wants us to make an effort why do we come to church make an effort we come here to worship God we didn't come here to see people we didn't come here to listen to me or brother Mike olte or anybody else you came here to hear from God now whether he picked this vessel or that vessel or the one coming all right or yours all right I got off I'm on a rabbit Trail I'm coming back here Aaron Aaron I'm back all right sorry about that I'm supposed to be teaching Sunday school kind of hard today nevertheless death reigned from Adam to Moses watch even over them that had not sinned after the similitude of Adam's transgression who is the figure of him now who's the one to come Christ Christ is the one to come listen Adam portrayed Christ to a degree but remember when Adam took took Eve in the garden and said God don't kill her she's part of me I I don't want you to kill her I'm going to I'm going to take her and take her sin now God didn't get angry about that God did put a division or or or he did he did put enmity between God and man we couldn't we couldn't go go down in the cool of the evening and talk to Adam face to face talk to Eve face to face right but he did set a provision amen amen so Christ ever how bad we are as his bride come on he's not going to let us die as Brother Richard said we win regardless of whatever Revelations 19 said his wife had made herself ready I'm just reading you the Bible amen so but we do have some work to do cuz it says she made herself ready she didn't sit on her can and not anyway not do anything she got ready we're one day closer to the Rapture y'all believe that all right tomorrow will be one day closer and the next day but there's going to be a time when God's going to shut the door of the Ark yes sir so we need to get in all right but not as the offense what was the offense Adam sin so also is the free gift now here's we're talking about freedom and talking about July the 4th and and and proclaiming our freedom listen the United States of America I've been in several countries United States of America as bad as it is I don't mind living here right amen bad as it is and as bad as they're going to it's going to happen but remember it's going to happen to the United States after we're gone all right for turning in and turning down and rejecting the prophet they're going to get their due but yes is after about 3 weeks in the Philippines and I love the Philippines and they're not a total third world country or communist country I about kiss the ground when I got off the airplane on now there a sign that says there's no place like home now that ain't in the Bible but it is ain't no place like home amen we're going to a Heavenly home but while we got an Earthly home I like to sleep in my bed with my pillow amen so that was life lesson 773 but not as the offense so also is the free gift for if through the offense of one many be dead all right and Adam all died then saying Eve that's right we always throw on Eve but in Adam all die all right much more the grace of God praise God the gift by Grace what is the gift eternal life and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost right in in Acts repent that's a problem we missed that part you got to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ show me anywhere in the Bible anybody ever been baptized in titles of father son Holy Ghost father son Holy Ghost is not even a name it's titles to a name exactly right Peter took on the day of Pentecost and he said exactly what Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 that's exactly right cuz this is a name Jesus was looking forward and said in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you don't sign your checkbook father do you no sir yet you are one I could sign mine son son of Samuel Dale you know how far that go from here to the door right right they say I want to know who you are oh I'm Samuel wait there little second oh now we know who you are so let's baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ go that's who that's who I'm identified with amen for if through the offense of one many be dead much more the grace of God and the gift by Grace which is by one man Jesus Christ hath abounded unto man and not as it was by one that sinned so is the gift all right so the gift was not given by sin it was given for sin amen everybody with me it was given for sin all right for the Judgment was by one to condemnation you eat this you die that's right that's right amen you eat this you die and like many have said before if it was an apple or an orange or an apricot we need to hand them out again cuz they done got naked but we know it wasn't that it was the control of the Beast over Eve and having relations with him we know that CU you see what it produced right that you know serpent SE was easy for me to see when I got about 16 years old think about that I knew what my trouble was so I knew what Adam and Eve's trouble was but the free gift is of many offenses under justification so to have a testimony you got to go through the test right that's the first four letters of testimony t s t so you got to go through the test get the testimony you you got to overcome the Bible says we are what Overcomers that's right so we're going to have these many offenses but if you're Justified you're already glorified for If by one man's offense death reigned by one that one person cuz remember Adam tried to save Eve but he wasn't a savior so he couldn't save her he just had to take her and protect her right now God our Adam can save us God he can save us he's got that salvation power he's able to take his soul and put it into you by the baptism of the Holy Ghost Adam couldn't do that sure he was an amateure God but he wasn't the God he wasn't the Redeemer he had no title Redeemer he had title of first man on the Earth right and he was God of the Earth all right but he wasn't god of the Soul we serve the god of the Soul that's where the free man comes in all right is everybody with me for If by one man's offense death Reign by one much more they oh I like this much more that they which receive a abundance of Grace that's me I'm like Brother Richard I need a lot of Grace cuz I'm pretty big guy and he's a big guy too need a lot of Grace all right and of the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one now we know one thing for sure we've got a five-fold Ministry we've had a prophet com in the end time according to Malachi 4 but Jesus Christ is the man amen amen he's the only one that can save your soul nobody else on this Earth everybody else that went through the womb come through the Matrix is lost that's exactly right right now Jesus came through the Matrix but he didn't have a daddy down here his daddy was from above amen it was a supernatural birth right we all come natural birth it is right some of y'all must not of you not amen therefore as by the offense of one judgment Came Upon all men so so when Adam sinned all died all right even so by the righteousness of one the free gift I like what Paul's saying free gift Freedom Liberty free free free free free amen you know you can have all the gold in the world and it'll never save you it will definitely hinder you but it will not save you but if you'll come up here today and ask Jesus Christ in your heart free gift worth 10,000 worlds 10,000 Brother Richard is like it's like brother Lis you know he's got the little podcast 10,000 worlds and brother Bob was saying I was thinking about that the other day he said man just one world would be enough amen if he saved my soul like one world that'd be plenty but 10,000 think about it it's more valuable your soul than 10,000 worlds 10,000 of these worlds so take 10,000 of all that of all the gold and all the things in this world and multiply it by 10,000 it's not worth your soul you come up here and get a free gift all right so one the free gift came upon all men unto justification of life we know that came from the second Adam all right now in the first Adam all die second Adam all live amen thank you Jesus for as by one man's Disobedience what Adam disobeyed the word of God many were made Sinners that's all of us so by The Obedience of one shall many be made righteous we have Grace we have a we have a way out all right in the pawn shop in other words can't get yourself out you can't pay yourself out of a pawn shop somebody's got to come and get you out so we know who came and got us out the Lord Jesus came and got us out amen but listen let's don't jump back in the pawn shop right let's stay free Let's Stay Free is this coming up July the 4th I know it's one day but you should every day like I've said many times before we celebrate Easter in one little part no to a Christian really every day is a resurrection but we honor it every week by coming to church all right we honor the resurrection so every Sunday's an Easter to us it's a resurrection time moreover the law entered now what that the offense offense might abound so they had something now to say do this don't do this you know Ten Commandments all right but where sin abounded Grace much more about hallu we can't lose we got to win Grace much more abound prise the Lord amen that as Sin hath rained unto death even so might grace Reign through the righteousness unto eternal life by Jesus Christ Our Lord Romans 6:16 know you not that this is a continuation of Paul's thought you know I love and it's okay for people to put uh chapters in in verses but this is a letter that Paul wrote he wrote a complete letter man just put Romans 6:16 in there but really it was a letter that he wrote to the Romans and he handed it to them and said here take this and read it to them so this is a continuation of his thought in Romans 5 know you not that to whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants you are to whom you obey right now remember we we talked about a couple of years ago it was our 50th Jubilee and remember if you heard that trumpet sound and you didn't go free you were taken into the into the uh synagogue and they bored your ear right amen there's a lot of ear boring going on in this country this world right you can believe what you want to but you you wear any kind of ear rings and all kind of rings that means Hey listen even that ring come on I'm bound to her that's right all right and that's okay but when you got them things in your nose and your ears and everywhere else you have been bored in the ear with an awe and remember you become a slave stay a slave never to be set free again all right so we don't want that we want out we want to be when that trumpet sounds we go hey I want to go free I'm I'm I'm I'm able I'm in my seventh year I'm going free amen you love the Lord let's read verse 18 real quick cuz I don't want to be over time cuz I don't want them to be over time when they're teaching so being then made free from sin you became the Servants of righteousness amen all right that's why they call it a conversion come on it is you are converted that's right from being a a a a slave of sin yes to being the righteousness of God right amen all right let me keeping going up for when you were the servant of sin you were free from righteousness think about that you were cuz you weren't covered that's right but now being made free from sin and become servants to God you have your fruit under Holiness and the end everlasting life like what Brother Richard said we can preach a message we can preach all this and do all this but if we don't live it that's right right our fruit is what we bear I cannot tell one tree from another except for what it's fruit amen come on musicians hallelujah praise God so the fruit is what we're looking at amen all right for the wages of sin is death but the gift of God free gift Hallelujah is eternal life through Jesus Christ yes our Lord God bless you
