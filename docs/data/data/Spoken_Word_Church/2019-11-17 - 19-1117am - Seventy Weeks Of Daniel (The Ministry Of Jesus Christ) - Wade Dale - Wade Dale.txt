some beech trees South Carolina so Beach Island but also one more thing sister Jill Fleeman you saw the brother here Wednesday night the young man tall guy that's his her son but sister Jill Fleeman from South Carolina sent some wristbands that has two scriptures on them I've got mine on on my hand one of them is by stripes I'm healed and they come in these little packets right here okay your reason in a minute and then something's 118 I shall not die but live and declare the works of the Lord she sent these as a reminder of God's healing promises and for you to pray for her she's battling breast cancer so if you want one see brother Joseph and we need to if we can support that and what money that goes to that will be used for her treatment but it's a bowel thing mister cancer will not make it to the millennium I'll promise you no he will not make it he's not he's he's dead already either don't know it I'm like I think about every time I see that word I think a brother uh that Scott and his dad died of long battle with cancer and brother does says I hope God lets me put my foot on the head of that cancer Damon and squash him to death for what he did to my for what he did to my dad so and you know what we have that overcoming power we have the ability to do that here we have the ability to take care of things and this little bracelet is just a reminder that I'm heading towards 60 years old and they some things in my body that needs to be healed and there's things in your body that needs to be healed so let's support that with our prayers number one and if you'd like one see brother Joseph they come in this little packet here and it's a little wristband that you can wear and she has other things on her website she has a website Judah sprays dot-com and you can order things like she's got shirts that says boo devil some of the things that we say that our message related you know she puts them on a shirt so so check her website down so for you got your Bibles or pull the screen up we'll go to the last part of this is going to be I told you we've been through the 70 weeks of Daniel and for those of you that that have not been here then just just to endure it for a little while or go back and watch and listen or or just pray that God would give you spiritual insight cuz I can't give you a revelation anyway guess the only God can do it okay and I want to give you one more little one more little tidbit of notes when I get finished with this series I've been something came to me the other day remember what brother Dale has been preaching on he said sometimes you know a preacher will get up and steal start preaching and he'll be preaching something all of a sudden God will take you off into another direction another thought brother Harris was preaching mold man long time ago and I was having problems with predestination a little bit so I was sitting right there and buddy he was preaching away had nothing to do didn't even read a scripture that had predestination in it but God opened predestination just like I opened the book and just handed it to me just like this and it just kept unfolding so you know God can do that but uh I've been thinking on as I was sitting here the other day listening to to brother Dale in the word revival came into my heart and the word word revival came into my heart so I have been if you want to look them up yourself there's twenty five hundred and seventy one quotes in the message I'm on quote 2000 I've been reading them all so we're gonna see if we can start and it starts with the people brother Graham said even a preacher can't start a revival it has to be started by God but it has to be started by the people want one alright so we will cover now we'll start a series on the word revival so just keep that in your heart but today if you'll look we've been speaking on Daniel seventy weeks giving you the dates giving you the times and the things going from the Gentiles to the Jews to the Gentiles in fact the Jews and then into the millennium and we'll get to that in just a minute but if you're seeing what my topic is today the Ministry of Jesus Christ all right so I want you to make sure that you remember that is the most important part of Daniel seventy weeks is to remember that without the Ministry of Jesus Christ there is nothing that three-and-a-half-year message of Jesus Christ has lasted us over 2,000 years three and a half years - three and a half years has left us 2,000 years and then brother Branham comes along God since it's a prophet and he preaches eleven hundred and something sermons I've out of those three and a half years sermons so it's a very important thing so I want us to look now and focus on the Ministry of Jesus Christ because it's all the Ministry of Jesus Christ but a lot of it is you know seventy weeks and all these things but we'll read it where they build the city we'll see that has nothing to do with us but it has part to do with Daniel seventy weeks because it comes to the series and through the scripture so let's let's bow our heads before we get started dear lord thank you for this day that you give us it truly is a time of Thanksgiving that we thank you Lord for all the things we look in this world and we see people that are just going through life with with nothing just an empty vessel walking through life and father don't let that happen to us Lord even the prophet of God told us even Christians can become dark in certain places because they don't use the gift that God give them Lord we pray that you would break that forth today that you would be Lord the one that is the active participant in the service as always you'd be the one that does the speaking you'd be the one that does the revealing father we pray for the sick that you'll heal them father that you'll be with the sister of their Lord in in South Carolina that you'll just release that demon of cancer from her body in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ all these things are done and the Bride of Christ says amen Daniel 9:24 seventy weeks are determined upon by people and the holy city there's two things to do six things to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring an everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy now see the three-and-a-half-year message of Jesus Christ is what does those six things without that we have no redemption without that we have no salvation without that we have no reconciling and end of sins yet there's no end of sin without the Ministry of Jesus Christ none zero all right know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem but to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore in two weeks the street shall be built again in the wall even in troublous times and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city in the sanctuary we know that Titus and the end therefore shall be with a flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even unto the consummation and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word I'm gonna they're gonna bring one up on the board not yet but I just want to went back to the to the skeleton drawing here so we'll start with that in just a little while we don't have any second service I've got a full bottle of water we'll be here a while at least it's not to bottle setting up here you know what happened when I was at a church and they gave me two bottles kind of scary huh alright so here we go let's read quote number one just for a little bit of background we're gonna fly through this pretty quick because we've been on this series for those G's not being here we've been on this series for several months and bring up quote number one the six fold purpose okay now I want you to know friends they're striking on these things I'm certainly leaving out weeks of teaching but just kind of hitting it so when the weather cools or later when we get into the seventh seal seven vials seven trumpets and all these things I can refer back and we're going to refer back to this because what today is today we're going to cover and go through what we've been preaching them and then the last six or seven quotes that we're going to bring are going to seem totally contrary to what we've been preaching but listen remember one thing brother Branham was a word prophet he was not a false prophet it had to fit it has to fit in the word the word doesn't fit his message his message fits the word and face final resting places where in the Word of God all right so we're not we're not doing away with the word we're not doing away your brother Browns message we're trying to bring this clarity to the message that we've been through for all this period of time 50 something years since the prophets left and try to help you - I always if you have a question about something that you're kind of a little fearful you have a little fear when you have a question about something you know you use something because when you ask you a question you're not getting the answer or you don't have the answer so there's that little dark spot in there you know but now I believe that God brought us all this light and here we are covering it all by God no lights light brother Branham was the prophet in the end time he was the vindicated prophet he was the messenger to this hour he has been vindicated authenticated and his words right amen and it compares with the Bible every time so we're gonna read some quotes though that you're gonna say well why did he say that if he was a word prophet because this is what the Bible says well we'll let's just see everybody all right so let's read the red part in these seventy weeks of Daniel cover now what if you don't get this quote right you're gonna make him say so ladies not saying because what and these 70 weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church unto the coming back of the church now where do we go up we go up right here this is the church ages we go up right here and it covers until we come by well he's condensed it into that one week and these 70 weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church for the coming back of the church that space is when it covers now watch he says now not all seven two weeks and daniel part of it because you have all this part over here that you got to set up with thereby okay with that alright because you got one two three if I good with that we don't been through this so if you if you don't know what I'm talking about go back what's tape cuz you got one week nine or seven or you got a seven of what seven 62 and seven so that makes 69 and then 70 weeks equals 490 years because one week equals seven years seven times seven is what 490 there Bay got that same am right seventy weeks its 490 years well what 69 times seven its 483 years now that leaves seven years where's that out right here everybody got that cuz brother Brown we're going to read here in a minute where he says it's broken up into three periods one a seven week period where they build the temple a 62 week where Jesus comes on the scene and he starts history and a half your message right here because remember the church ages are here this is the seven church age Azure the Gentile AIDS or the engrafting of what the wild olive tree now God doesn't deal with Israel and us at the same time right cannot does not will not because he deals with us as individuals he deals with Israel as a nation jesus said I came to my own in my own receiving me not he came to all of Israel to save them right here but what did they do they turned him down they cut him off and then what he turned right straight to Gentile bride then now the Gentile bride is gonna take a rapture right here not too far from now nobody believes that nobody ain't Mandy I'm looking for a resurrection than a rapture I'm getting older door y'all hey man some of you real it'll be one so Gentiles going around her and then God what does he do he turns right back and starts dealing with the Jews again but now watch what he does I drew that room he deals with the Jews for three and a half years amen he dealt right here three and a half years Blue Devil where's that t-shirt at I hate these mechanical thing that's better how's that okay so he dealt with he come on the scene and preach three and a half years we proved that the other day right so he preached three and a half years here that was Jesus himself and then he comes back through two witnesses and preaches three and a half years right here according to revelations 11 will not read it will skip through it revelations 11 brings 1 in 11 1 brings two witnesses that prophesy twelve hundred and sixty days which is three and a half years not according to 365 and a quarter days because that's our calendar that's because the world is wobbling it was tilted it Noah's age I just it was tilted in Noah's time because all the IceCaps and all the other things to come about and they ate the dates and the times and they're all the seasons and everything but now God's always dealt with 360 days because that's exactly 30 days to a month or as melchizedek comes to abraham and he says Abraham about the cycle or about the time of life Sarah's gonna have a baby so ladies you understand what I'm saying there's a 30-day cycle to nature and there's a 30-day cycle to you all right so that's how God deals with 360 days so 360 days at three and a half years is 1260 days so the Bible is correct but now remember he preached 1260 there were three and a half years over here that's Jesus's ministry now listen here's where we we may not we're just going a different way I guess then I thought we were going so anyway good to have Kendrick with us today I just saw him looking at me from the back of my head I felt it but we come here too and we look at today and we want to see the Ministry of Jesus Christ so what's the Ministry of Jesus Christ he preached physically preached three and a half years that's the first four books of the Bible first four books of the not the New Testament but the first books they're talking about what Jesus did while he was here then what happened he was cut off at Calvary and the Jews said let his blood be on us and our children so he quit dealing with the Jews he started dealing with a Gentile bride that's me and you know watch what how long did Jacob remember Jacob because remember one thing right here when Jesus came to earth he knew though that Israel was going to cut him off but he had to say I am coming he said don't even go to the Gentiles go to my people America that was his people now we know he went to jail we know he went to Gentile he was Almighty God but still the Bible says he came to his own and his own received him not so anyways so he came and preached three-and-a-half years to try to get Israel to see who he was now what's he gonna do right he's gonna come and preach through two prophets three-and-a-half years to get Israel to see who he is that all rights Amen alright so now what happened was what's this to make the continuity of the scripture go correct Jacob where we get over in Genesis I believe it is Genesis 29 we get where Jacob served seven years for Rachel and then seven for and he got Leah but any search seven years for Rachel and he got hurt nobody got that same in all right because in Genesis 29 that's where brother Branham got we're one week equal seven years ago the Bible says he fulfilled her week all right so when he fulfilled her week now what did he fulfill our week he fulfilled our week right here through seven Church ages to get Rachel the young one but he's working what three and a half here and three and a half year he's working seven years to get Leah works out perfect leah was the older which is that type of Israel he worked seven years for her and then he worked seven years to get us so he's got to do when he redeems Israel is right here right Israel is potentially everybody's redeemed at Calvary okay but remember it's got to be applied it's got to be applied when it's applied is over here on this 1260 days that two prophets preached and like I told y'all before we had two great Gentile prophets we had Paul and brother Branham God sent us two great prophets one to begin it and one to end it because they got so many loose ends in here that's why I was talking we were talking about or I was talking me and God was talking to each other the other day about a word revival and that's what we were talking about you you can't have a word revival with loose ends you can have a partial revival or a Reformation but a Reformation is not a revival a revival is reviving what you already have enough you've got faults in you you can't revive that or you can revive that because the devil also has a revival whoa yeah every revival produces what twins all right so that's what happened here the revival produce twins and what happened in here it all got muddled up and Father Son Holy Ghost baptism but that wasn't true right here no they had two pure unadulterated word right here no denomination no other idea no three gods no Trinitarian no Father Son Holy Ghost baptism but what happened was that it got right in here but what happened at the end God sent a prophet to put all them loose ends back together to bring a word revival that would take us in a rapture I love that how that all works together it's just a beautiful picture once you see it how God has dealt with tried to deal with Israel because remember they rejected him but I'll promise you one thing he was the Messiah whether they said he was or not that was the Messiah message the Messiah message he was the Anointed Messiah he was Christ Jesus Christ and he preached three-and-a-half years whether they liked him or not doesn't matter he was who he was and he's into what they've done though what they done remember brother Branham comes right here and he said I indict this generation for the second crucifixion of Christ what they do they took that Christ and they put him back on the cross you look at people today my lord people that claim to be Christians today them they have no form of Christianity kurz like a sailor drink like a fish what is that that's unbelievable but there yeah you're right about that but you know what though they're blind you and I have not been blinded you and I have the full light today and that's what's gonna take us in a rapture cuz we didn't put him on a cross that wandered on the crowds on the crosses inside of me and you today we know exactly where he is all right I wasn't gonna do that make that look like that but guess what there anyway let's go to number two if you don't mind mm-hmm talking about the six fold purpose here quote number two keep going past that we already read that but we already quoted it now the six fold purpose we find out in the six full purpose to anoint the most holy we find out the most holy always represents the church the tabernacle and the last thing was to be done was to anoint the most holy that's the Millennial tabernacle that he'll live in during the millennium millennial that we live in so that's right here right this is a millennium nobody got that wit done through this chart ten times so pay attention number three the 70th week of Daniel watch this now let's outline Daniel seventy of weeks now I might repeat here again ministers of the gospel if you disagree which a lot of them didn't still do they are divided into three periods now watch how distinct it is three periods as we find out in Daniel 9 three pitch first a seven week period if I got that same am alright and to listen y'all can Amen and shout and praise God you ain't gotta save it for me this afternoon all you got to do is save me to eat let's see spiritual food first and then you can go eat natural food amen alright then a threescore into when I watched three scored three times twenty is sixty sixty two week period is number two and which is sixty two and then a one week period number three one week not not half week one week because you gotta add seven and sixty-two and 69 and one makes 70 that puts us right where we need to be now that's according to the Bible that cannot and will not change God's Word can change all right now number four number four quote is for brother Branham I don't want you to think I come up with it but brother Brown said look one week equals seven years so one week equals seven years then he talks about the blackboard he puts it up cuz he drew this pretty much the exact same chart and most of you have got that chart if you don't you can have one we've got plenty of them around here somewhere alright let's go to number five now we're told from the going forth of the commandment now here's where the trouble is told from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild the city to Messiah and Messiah was Christ shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks making sixty-nine weeks we already said that and seven times sixty-nine makes 483 years we already said that so we were just letting him verify that we've read this quote before now now you getting it down if you want me to run over it again I'll be glad to now we're told from the going forth of the commandment to rebuild the city to the Messiah shall be 7-7 that's first right here seven it took him 49 years to build that temple we prove that the other day all right with NEMA coming in with an edict to go forth and not just build the now I just build the temple but they had to build the walls and the sidewalks and the walls because a government is not a government without defense and a way to move transportation all right we don't have a wall in America but we have a defense system all right so that made civil government come back to Israel not that just that they built the temple and set it out in the middle of the in the middle of the desert no you can't do that the Bible says the walls will be built in trouble sometimes alright and seven weeks and threescore to make 62 and seven and 69 69 weeks seven times 69 makes 483 years that puts us right here all right the right therefore because when I read these other quotes you're gonna go really remember the Bible's right therefore and tell them a sign that were coming up to this part here he puts a cross right here and this is this is where Jesus started his ministry he was born four BC died in a t30 until the Mossad there's got to be 483 years everybody got that same man so that now that's 483 years no half years in there anywhere four years in 483 we've got to get to 490 so there's got to be one week are seven years because one week equals seven years all right left for the Jews now look here's what I want - we'll pull that chart up in a minute but remember one thing back to the ministry of Jesus Christ you can't have Redemption you can't have salvation without that Ministry of Jesus Christ can I have that alright that okay say Amen we gotta have the Ministry of Jesus Christ now what happens is we as Gentiles needed that back again we needed that ministry back again look the Ministry of William Branham coming up from 1962 to about 65 which is last about three and a half years that was his message not in the years of preparation sure he preached from 47 to 1965 but his message was to bring those seals Jesus's message was to bring the seals it was so covered till nobody knew anything about it but God sent us a prophet and he said in spoken word original seed he said as of yet Malachi 4 I said 1962 has not been fulfilled well he started in Malachi 4 we know that but the fulfillment of his message was that last three-and-a-half years when the seals broke all the way up to when God took him off the scene everybody got that which lasted about three and a half years and that had to come back because of the same ministry remember he always said he say this is the same Ministry of Jesus Christ on the earth with the signs with the wonders with the discernment with the things that that's coming and things that are now here that came right here to us to us we're recipients of that and then what the Jews are so blinded God still got his big hand over their eyes but when we leave because of because we remember Jesus preached and then he took a rapture guess what Jesus is gonna preach again he's gonna become so visible among us he'll raise the dead that's a quote by brother Branham and we'll go in the rapture who's going on the rapture wait Dale no Jesus Christ is going in the rapture I'm just part of him and I got to go with him amen because the ones that are part of the devil guess where they're gonna go they're gonna stay here all right because we're going to go in the rapture and then God promised one more time of 1260 days to redeem Israel but you got to bring in all the city and all those things also that's why there's got to be not just 1260 days but there's got to be seven years after the rapture of the church I'm going to read it to you now it's going to see him in a minute when I read these quotes to you that he contradicted himself but he did not remember he cannot contradict the Bible everybody got that all right so now let's go to number six and he even says he's draw it out here on the blackboard we've got the picture if anybody wants some of this is a certified verified by sister Rebecca Branham that this is what she took off of the book of blackboard and she made me grafted off this is actually in her one of the not the original but he came off the original brother George Smith have indicated it for us so we know for sure that that was on the tabernacle blackboard they didn't have these in 1960 - they had blackboards kids y'all no wonder by morning it's Kauai taking the tablet and turning it off and writing on it cuz that's what y'all are dealing with in school y'all dealing with tablets now so turn the tablet off you've got a black screen don't do it cuz the teacher will kill you take some chop and start writing on it well that's what the blackboard was well this was on the blackboard at the tabernacle according to what brother Brown saying now what's he doing he's gonna put it up to explain that you might understand what I'm trying to speak up because remember we get a lot but not much from preaching and teaching and talking but when you can make it visual the percentage goes way up that you comprehend that in your head okay is that right that right says Tran okay all right look over to your sister and go she just did that she in said that was right but she looked over there but look now watch now he's explaining it this we've been over this I mean I don't know how many sermons we've been through this he did it in three sermons but there was a lottery left out but that's okay there was a lot for us to to get almost I've been since the end of the week I've been trying to find out what words to say for this it's got to compare with the rest of the Bible that's my whole quote this has got to compare this has got to compare with the rest of the Bible every quote he quoted has got to compare with the Bible you just can't take it just one scripture and make an understanding then say well this is what it says and then turn around and say well but over here it says something else contradicts this it can't do that it's got to say the same thing all the time if you don't why then you're wrong kind of playing in it you're wrong so now let's go to number 7 we're just going to go through this real quick because we covered this last Sunday and I even went back to the commentaries and commentators and did the same thing the issue was given on the 14th day of March BC 4:45 the issue went forth to build rebuild the temple which is right here right here 445 BC they built the temple 49 years everybody got that saying man we already covered this you understand as the people have read the scripture then until it was completed it took 49 years to complete the temple and the city to rebuild it as the Bible said here Daniel speaking of their angel to Daniel that the walls we built in trouble sometimes than many of us remember when it was built they had a mortar block in one hand and a sword in the other hand to watch the enemy so now let's look at Nehemiah let's drop all the way down to Nehemiah we read all that scripture about how brother Branham came up with that date right remember Nehemiah was the cupbearer for for what's his name the king so he had he was armor he was a cup bearer so he would only go in in the month listen according to near my 2:1 in the twentieth year of artaxerxes the king that wine was before him in the only served wine during the Passover which was 14 days if you'll go back and figure your Passover is 14 days after the first day of the month so that's where brother Branham came up with March the 14th so precise BC 445 that wine was before him and I took the wine and give it unto the king now the King saw that Nehemiah was he's very sad so he let him go build a temple let's go through there might go to near my 417 mm-hmm go to 17 they which building on the wall and they that bear burdens with those that laded and every one with one hand rock of the word and the other will held a weapon so what they were doing they were building the wall and you had another group of people with swords because nobody wanted to rebuild the temple there may got that this is just a filler to show where we're coming up to okay all right so let's go to number eight now we've done building the temple and then there's a 62 week period and the Messiah's gonna show up during that time there buddy got that this is the Messiah he's showing up and he's preaching he was born we see again he was at 4 in 4 BC according to all of your commentaries except for two or three and you'll see where brother bottom does say a t-33 sometimes but you got to remember I'll read you a quote number nine on the sixth seal but let's read this right here now Jesus the Messiah wrote into the city of Jerusalem triumphal on the back of a white mule on Palm Sunday April the 2nd ad 30 Jesus wrote in Jerusalem on Palm Sunday on ad 30 now this is a t30 when he was killed everybody got that that's when he was cut off that's not when he started his message that's when he got cut off alright so you say well brother branham how in the world you get that well let's go to the sixth seal now if we say if you say if they say if whoever says that brother branham got greater understanding when the seal is open then because there's a lot of people tell you that it was a t-33 but what's this and I went back to the Bible and found another good no yet but we'll save that for later now let's stop there these three verses now what is brother Ramon the sixth seal he has gone to Matthew 24 to bring all six seals into the Bible he goes to Matthew 24 and starts preaching the seals but they ask him three questions now these three verses that took place actually on Tuesday afternoon April the 4th 80 30 now he just said he wrote into Palm Sunday April the 2nd which was Sunday Monday Tuesday 4th pretty precise now this gets even better and the first two verses took place in the afternoon now that I won't get he's a prophet I believe what he said ok the afternoon of April the 4th is a t30 the third verse took place on Tuesday even in the same day I just I don't know I just believe what he said but that's just to clarify that was Jesus died in a t30 because if he's born in 4bc and he was 33 years old when he died 84 to 80 30 you say that's 34 years you can't have a zero year it's 4 3 2 1 1 2 3 4 up to 30 right everybody got their what I've been through this there's no zero year so you cancel that year out and go 1 2 1 ending up with something that's just perfect the words perfect the word of God is perfect if you look at it real good everything else will be perfect now let's read number 10 cuz now look he'd look back here he died he's crucified he's left the scene he's come back on the day of Pentecost and he has now started working in a Gentile bride for 2,000 years then he's going to take us in a rapture and to fulfill the 490 years there's got to be seven years left are one week there buddy got that same man because the Bible in Daniel 9:27 says he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week one week equal 7 years everybody got that same n right amen now watch now we come up and we get them up here to the rejection of the Messiah from the rejecting of the Messiah when he comes up to the rejection of the Messiah you got the last week from the projecting the size of lap Masada last week now I want to stop right here just a minute and explain this that when they rejected the Messiah was when they of course rejected Jesus as Savior and crucified him so where's you saying right here 80 30 which would have been about April the 6th if you're going by your dates Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday they killed him on Friday so it'd be the 6 or 7 somewhere in there cuz remember Jewish days don't end like our days Jewish days end at 6 o'clock when it comes to 6 o'clock in Israel that starts another day that's why they had to get Jesus Christ off the cross before that hour of 6:00 o'clock hit because that was a Passover and it was the high Passover because it came on a Sabbath day and it was the Passover came on the same day so they had to get him off the crop so they would have to left him 24 more hours hanging on the cross but according to the Bible that couldn't do that so they had to get him off the crops before 6 o'clock which starts a new day in Israel that's why the Bible says the evening and the morning was the first thing y'all learn something you stay awake or was that you remember over here how the city should be cut off but not for himself Messiah the Prince now think I'll close that prophecy hit I want to get this drilled into you want y'all to realize one thing going through this Daniel 70 week series brother branham is so positive he's so positive how can people say he was wrong he's so positive he wants to get this drilled into you then if that prophecy hit exactly to the day exactly to the time and we're talking about 80 30 and exactly the way it said it would this other seven this one seven weeks left or one week left if I got that one seven years rather seven days seven years will hit exactly according to the scripture so is he talking about three and a half or seven talk about seven there's seven years left to make 490 483 years Christ was cut off and he took a Gentile bride listen brothers and sister if he didn't if they had not done all this over here to him this would have all slid right here together and it would have just been a continuous God coming right here and then coming right straight to them but he had to get a Gentile bride that's me and you oh man come on that's me in you I you know I thank God he blinded Israel but he knew he had to to get us cuz you know what when he lifts his hands brother reggae bro when he lifts his hands they're going to see him in three and a half years a hundred and forty four thousand people are going to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it took two thousand years almost for us to get that many people why because of all of our isms and all this other stuff listen these Jews right here knew that Messiah was one God but God had to blind them so that you and I could come in but all he promised he'll come back lift his hands off of them they say Oh where'd you get those scars he'll say in the house of my friends through those two prophets alright stop preaching Daniel 9:27 we'll get through this hey all right all right this is the last or this is number 3 this is the third period we just went through one in two and got 483 years doesn't count in here Gentile time you know you and I don't have a time time shall be no longer but they've got when we leave here they've got 1260 days to receive Christ but they've got a seven-year period to get us into the Millenium this is where you're gonna have to really pay attention okay Daniel 9:27 he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week now who's that he that he is not Christ Christ does not break covenants amen that's the Antichrist because he's only gonna come on the scene sure he's here with us now but he's going to incarnate a beast when we leave the man he's going to incarnate a person the beast is going to incarnate the Pope and in the midst of the week which is what what's the middle of 7 class three and a half and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease what happens is God has took the 1260 he's give them the Ministry of Messiah he's given the masai message like he did over here he's given three-and-a-half-year my site message and when they see it they're gonna leave now that doesn't mean this right here is over there's still time we already proved that because he's gonna walk in the temple he he the Antichrist and say hey I'm the god you're looking for they're Jews are gonna go no you're not so then there's gonna be a battle of Armageddon and it's going to destroy this place because you got to fulfil the last part of the six fold purpose to bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy in the North the most holy all right so now let's go to number 11 we're gonna read 11 12 and 13 and then we're gonna click it off for just a second now we find out that down through these ages we have the Holy Spirit come in and then God back in the beginning began to tell them that the rejection of Christ God showed John exactly what would take place during the Gentile reign he's talking about John the Revelator revelations 1 through 3 Israel is the church ages right all right during the Gentile right now you haven't got any limited time like the Jews but we got a sign we got a signpost now whose brother bran tell us what our signpost is watch Israel it's this Israel Israel's the timepiece well God did with the Jews just exactly what he said he would do in them 69 years or 483 years 69 weeks and one week left one weeks yet determined everybody got that same man one week is yet determined all right number 12 he's talking about somebody applied it 144,000 to be the bride and in 1917 there was gonna be a rapture and somebody preached that I don't know who it was but but it wasn't true but let's go down to the to the red and we see now all this stuff was to take place was over in this time of the 70th week now look they appear not in the third chapter what's the third chapter revelations that's us their own over in the scripture further and then we see that all this stuff was to take place was over in this time of the 70th week the last week now if they've already had 69 weeks and lived it exactly the way God said they would do said they did and it happened exactly the way God said it would do then there's one more week promised to the Jews everybody got that same man one more week promised to the Jews after we leave after revelations three is over revelations for one remember we go in the rapture and brother Brown said what covers that revelations forward to revelations 19 and it does that every bit happens right here in this last week not this life's three and a half years there's one full week left after we leave to finish the 70 weeks of Daniel there's one more week promised to the Jews nobody got that same in number thirteen what's going down to the save time where are we at right here I believe you pointed right here so that's we're in that seventh Church age we're right here ready to go up where did the Messiah get cut off exactly where the word said where the Messiah get cut off right here right where will that 70th week begin exactly after this church is cut off then God returns to the Jews now where'd you point that now 70th week right nobody got that and the Bob now this is cording to the Bible and the prophets message now I want to ask you a question when I read these next scriptures I don't want the butterflies to start churning okay because when I read you these next quotes you're butterflies are gonna start churning because you're gonna go what in the world is going on let me tell you something I can't change the Bible and brother Branham was right and if brother Branham was wrong god corrected him and then brother Branham came to the pulpit and told us that God corrected him right all during the seals he thought - mm-hmm he thought the wild horse rider was a Holy Ghost he come right out here and he said contrary to what I believe this is the way it is all the way through the seals he said fifth seal Jew he thought maybe that was a martyred souls down through the church ages that was not correct he come right out here and said that was wrong and then all the things that he needed corrected God corrected William Branham William Branham corrected itself and then we accept that a man if you correct William Branham you have inserted yourself between God and him and I don't know there's not a place for that well there is but remember if you got to hello you got to one's got to be the devil okay hello somebody thank your sister well that 70th week began exactly after this church is cut off so when we leave this world there's one more week to fulfill our seven years to fulfill Daniel seventy weeks of 490 years if I got that say man I've read enough quotes and I read enough Bible now we're gonna read hold on here's where the butterflies start now when I ask you a question again many people in their mind they think that before 1963 the brother Brian did say some things that were wrong and and he did because he preached a while was writer was the Holy Ghost okay but under his revelation at the time he was right that's all he had don't throw the baby out with the bathwater but his progress his revelation come on up to a time to where God said that's not right you've come to a place of adoption to where they're gonna have to listen to you every word of what you're saying and you're going to tell them right you're gonna tell them the correct way this is the correct way that's why look was there any error and this is three and a half you're missing was there any error in a massage message no it was perfect so that perfect word had to come back in the end time and that same perfect words gonna take that bail off with the Jews and show them aside if I got that same in pretty simple so now one more time Bible says you've got seven weeks sixty-two weeks and one week that's sixty two and seven sixty ninety one because seventy weeks is what's determined to finish those six things in Revelations not I mean Daniel not everybody got that say man all right here we go ready for the butterflies now watch watch the date on this one right here the reason I'm saying this is everybody said well he was confused and then maybe he was confused in the seventy weeks of Daniel because it was 1962 I mean look who told who told you who told you that brother Branham was confused yeah it's that guy in between who told you he was confused that's why I can't stand about these people leave the message brother Branham was confused so that meant they weren't see what I mean see what I mean but they said he was confused then he was wasted three sermons I guess on Daniel seventy weeks and then God straightened him out over here when he started preaching the seals when I don't told you again I want you to bring me one quote where brother Graham said I was wrong in Daniel seventy weeks and now I'm correcting them he did not he kept saying we're gonna have to get this out of the way so we can get to the seals now watch this this is in not though the next quote this is in 1955 hey buddy wake Lord don't go sleep at 11:30 in the morning II I know it's rough it 2 o'clock in the afternoon but you just got up some of you all right number 14 watch this this is 1955 we're doing pretty good I thought we'd go over or not now watch now then all these visions now this is 1955 like I said again watch his thought in 1955 because he comes up to 62 and he preaches the 70 weeks of Daniel then he comes over and I'm gonna show you some quotes during the seals that seems totally contrary but they're not just where the nation's would be standing he showed them how that there was so many years depending yet on the Jews what's he doing he's he's basically commenting on Daniel 9 he said to myself shall come he will prophesy in the 70th week which is three and a half years and the amidst event he will be cut off which is seven years 70 weeks is determined for the people seven years remaining approximately to the Jews this is 1955 and the Messiah the Prince shall come and prophesy in the midst of the seven weeks now the Bible does not say that the Bible doesn't say that the bible says nowhere that Messiah be cut off in the middle of week but watch what he's saying watch what he's saying what brother Branham has done if you'll stop right there bring that up can you bring that chart up brother Joe cuz look what Messiah Messiah Messiah Messiah remember that word what Messiah only preached reading half here then Messiah is going to come back three preached three and a half more years for the 1260 days as everybody got that same in now he preached three and a half years this is a brother Bob black did this chart and it is amazing and he just keeps adding stuff to it every time we've been preaching on it and I couldn't bring it because watch scroll that thing across that thing would cover that wall it just keeps going doc doc all right so go back but thank God brother Bob did that but I watched wolf stop right there Jesus preached three and a half years of a message from 80 26 to 80 30 and then he was cut off now go scroll over to about the middle of it Joe please god bless you thank you now one week of Jesus's ministry was not the 70th week everybody got that because you split it up you got three and a half years over here and you got three and a half years over here now what his brother branham doing guys brother branham is not wrong he's telling you he is taking the whole 70 weeks of Daniel all those dates all those times and all those things that are going to happen Gentile church age whatever more he's pulled all that out and made it just one week and it's three and a half years of Jesus's ministry right here and three and a half years of Jesus's ministry right here now go that way but that's inside of that 70th week it's not the hole it's not the whole week Bible says there's one week left when we leave oh I love it we're going to wait and suffer it Bob did a good job that didn't get ba ba ba Han Bob down in Mobile Alabama today with us with his family I told him I said don't put bombs and stuff in there dude just he's gonna put a Tomic bomb and all the other stuff going on anyway but he brought a good that's the Millennial temple according to Ezekiel 42 44 it's got to be built right in here this is wonderful I love it if you wanted I'm out but I'm telling you it's gonna have to be on a piece of paper about that big or it's gonna be so condensed you're gonna need a scope to see it so that's why they put it on here so we've condensed this and so his brother branham look at this shout boys Trump I love that dude he's good all right go back over that way he even puts the horse riders in there see him down at the bottom white horse first three Church ages red horse black horse pale horse Dome of the rock was completed in six 891 AD 325 and ICN council Titus is coming in right here and destroying Jerusalem in AD 70 so now brother branham has got to be talking about another week not another week apart from 70 weeks but another week inside of the 70 weeks of Daniel or he's wrong everybody got that and he's not but you can't place it without using this one week of Jesus's ministry three and a half years over here and three and a half years over here he was cut off in the midst of the week for who for us but he wasn't cut off in the midst of the whole 70 weeks of Daniel he was only cut off after he preached three and a half years because while I'm gonna read you a couple quotes here where brother Branham says talks about the seventy weeks of Daniel he says that's seven years so he condenses that whole all that we've draw we've drawn over here he's condensed it to one week of Messiah ministry three and a half years here that he preached himself and then through two prophets he preaches three and a half years more here for them to go in the rapture go back over that way you ever make those little rabbit wake up a little bit you didn't know we were gonna eat off but you ready here you feel better now but there's still one week left after the rapture you cannot get away from the Bible and what brother Brown said there's the 70th week which is the six fold purpose but there's only three and a half years of Jesus's ministry here see how Bob's got it drawn over to here and then there's only three and a half here Messiah does get cut off he gets cut off but it never says in the Bible he gets cut off in the midst of the week read it find it it's not in there read the item is telling us about this mysterious wheat because hey that was a mysterious time nobody knew who he was just the clean of us we were talking about people in the message versus people that are in world not even expect on the beach Jesus was not a speck on the beach in the world brother Brad said 100 that 1% even knew he was on the earth 12 we're his friends what I'm was the devil and when he hung on Calvary guess how many he friends he had zero all right but the greatest most powerful message ever to hit this earth and he was rejected well he's going to be accepted back over here you and I accept him through here we get this strand 1/2 your message right over there that's what we're we're living under that right now they weren't living under that in here because it wasn't all perfect it wasn't the perfect message they all had what their flaws the red horse rider came the black horse rider came all these different riders which was the Antichrist what that was him having his revival while God was having his revival all right the other Cross is having a revival I'll promise you go look outside you'll see it all right so now he will prophesy leave that up and we'll read the quote but leave that up he will prophesy in the 70th week which is three and a half years and in the midst of it he will be cut off which is seven years seven two weeks is determined for thy people seven years approximately to the Jews so he came and preached to him here they rejected him he got cut off and they're gonna come back over here and preach the same message over here everybody got that right there which is right here and right here that's the Ministry of Jesus Christ all this other all this other is inclusive but not all of it you know we that's history now we don't have to worry about the building of the temple we just put that up there to show you how perfect the word was and we're not gonna even be here when this happens but I'm doing this to show you that brother Browns not wrong the Bible's not wrong of all this contention in the message that there's only three and a half years of Jesus's ministry left yes there's only three-and-a-half years of tribulation yes but there's one week left to finish the 70 weeks of Daniel according to the Bible according to the prophets message I just read you quote where will that 70th we begin he's after after the church is cut off but in 1955 that's what he says right there let's keep reading now let's go back to the quote so you see where the seven years is three and a half and three and a half that's a seven year of Jesus's ministry alright let's go back to the quote which Messiah come Jesus he preached he's actually three and a half years and was cut off for a sacrifice alright now let's go to number 15 this is the evening messenger 1963 this would be after the seals has been preached I mean no this is right before I'm sorry right before the seals I was trying to work up to it this is right before the seals were preached in January of 1963 the seals were preached in March of 63 right that right March 63 okay notice that the Gentile church has to be taken away first for the Jews then the end of the 70 weeks of Daniel takes place the three and a half year Messiah prophesied and then he was cut off the prince in the middle of the 70th week and then there's three and a half weeks left yet that looks kind of confusing because he's not getting cut off right here he's getting cut off right here three and a half years he gets cut off and then he's gonna preach three and a half years more everybody got that if you know then you've made him wrong y'all sit there all day and in your head and go well he must be wrong well then you need to go find you another church if he's wrong you need to go find you another place and then your souls involved in this I don't hang my soul and William Brennan but I do hang my soul on what he said I hang my soul on Jesus Christ now if they're dead you hear what I'm saying if his mid brother Browns message the different than Christ's message then I'm wrong and so are you amen but he's not wrong he's right he's telling us he's condensing this whole 70 weeks of Daniel to one week of Jesus's message if not then he's wrong and he's not he's condensed all this 70 weeks down to take us out to that three and a half year message here and the three and a half year he keeps saying over and over at my side I'm gonna read this next quote on the first seal he says the maasai doctrine yeah all right so let's go where we have let's go to number 16 this is on the first seal now look Malachi 4 he's a prophet whoa and restores the original faith of the fathers at the end time when the Tribulation Period comes now here's a little thing we're going to reverse back a minute or two three and a half years or Daniel 7 two weeks the last half of Daniels 70 weeks which is three and a half years everybody got that and not the last half of that week however Mina remembers that from the search ages he's never said in here anywhere that he's been he's wrong good listen this is this is me I don't have a quote for it but brother Branham preached this it's like brother Dale has always said you have to look there it's a sa it's a parable with an underlying meaning the whole underlying meaning of Daniel 7 2 weeks is Redemption and it only came by Jesus preaching three and a half years and we accepted it and they turned it down and then he comes back and preaches three and a half more years they accept it and they go on the rapture all right to me that's all of Daniels 70 weeks not all the dates and the times and the seasons so now brother Branham is honing in on the message the Messiah doctrine watch what he says I remember that from the church ages see them there's 70 weeks determined look how perfect it was Messiah will come and he'll be cut off sacrifice in the midst of the week now the Bible doesn't say that find it but he's not wrong he's telling you about that one week of Messiah message Messiah Messiah watch how many times he says Messiah he will be cut off for sacrifice in the midst of the week and the obligation will cease then they're still three and a half years waited for the maasai doctrine to the Jews just like what we just said three and a half he was cut off and then there's three and a half more there but I got that same am no side doctrine there watch number 17 now you remember that was prophesying the work this is the fifth seal we're all clan reading a scripture and they prophesied these two witnesses prophesied the time of Daniels second half of the 70 weeks seventy weeks not 70th seventy weeks that's the last three and a half years which is right here it's the last three and a half years of that Messiah week not the last three and a half year you can't place it it won't go in the Bible everybody got that the Bible's right you remember how he took Daniel 70 weeks I said we would need it when we get in here I didn't know why but I something told me we need it in here we are see see he's not saying I was wrong back then he was saying we need it now notice in the time of Daniel now remember Daniel was told that the Messiah would come to Prentiss the Messiah rather and he would prophesy scrolled up please Israel still had 70 weeks left now Israel didn't have 70 weeks less this was no house in two weeks left 69 of it was but fulfilled back here according to the Bible what's he talking about what and in the midst of the 70 week he's condensed it down to one week every bit of it he's condensed to one week in the midst of the seven to eight the Messiah would be cut off and the daily sacrifice taken wait but there was still three and a half weeks determined in this block he takes the Gentile bride now she goes up and then when she goes up two prophets arrive to Israel all right so everybody got that now let's go to the sixth seal and this is where he brings it pretty plain right here all right notice these messengers now these messengers revelation 12 these two prophets they're going to preach the kingdom as a ham kingdom heaven is to be set up the time last three and a half years of Daniels 70th week promised to the Jews now remember now that to prove that that this is Daniels last part of the 70th we know what you know talking about this 70th week right here or he's wrong because the Bible's right if I got that now read you all these other clothes so don't turn around and go well we'll take these and not these who are you to do that I'm looking at all of you who are you to do that who are you to take quotes out and throw them away and put other ones in you've got to understand what our prophet said our Wheaton why do you think that when people start leaving the message this is the first thing they hit he was so wrong in Daniel 70 weeks well if he was then we need to lead - yeah hello I got a question on that for DeMarre see now 70 weeks was promised look which was seven years seventy weeks was promised which was seven years he condensed every bit of this right here down to a three and a half year message here and a three and a half year message here you and I are not even included we shouldn't even have this in here you and I are not included in this I put that in there because it is in the spreads the week out because so don't worry about that you got three and a half years here you got three and a half years here so this is the first half and this is the second half or the last half of the Messiah week of the ministry of Jesus Christ everybody got that now seventy weeks was promised which was seven years and in the midst of the seven weeks the Messiah was to be cut off - made a sacrifice war was that right here not over here this guy that makes this covenant in this last period he's not Christ he's the Antichrist he would prophesy three and a half years and then he'd be cut off he prophesied three and a half years cut off and then that three and a half years are still determined for Israel I don't have a problem with that that's what he said all right let's go to number 19 this is where he said it again in the sixth seal notice we find out sometime last I said three and a half years of Daniel seventy weeks now let me explain that a little closer now because I see somebody here that's always watch that now I want to try to make myself clear a teacher notice when the seventy weeks come in when Daniels seen division of the time coming and the ending of the Jews watch but he said there was determined 70 weeks that's seven years he took all that 490 years and condensed it down to one week because if you don't vote you've got a false prophet cuz I just read you these other quotes quote eleven twelve and thirteen when does that 70th we begin brother Branham he says after the church is gone and that's exactly right according to the Bible and he would be cut off for a sacrifice now let's go to number 20 we got 20 number 20 and we'll be done so this is the continuation they asked him this question this is where everybody goes to all the preachers go to this and say well he was wrong in dang of 70 weeks but this is where he was right well I done told you if you can tell me the brother Branham was wrong you have inserted yourself between God and him and you are the devil and be quiet if you won't do we either got to believe this thing is number one a I mean stamped right or we need to go find a Baptist good Baptist Church like them other people ain't got the Holy Ghost goes out to the Baptist Church and just lives like they won't - brother Branham when you give the message on the 70 Church ages 70 weeks party this is a question I believe that you mentioned that the fall last week or last seven years will begin when the bride was taken in a rapture now that's exactly right that's what he said but he's mind is not on this whole chart his mind is on the three and a half years of Jesus is preaching here and the three and a half years of Jesus is preaching here again or he's wrong cuz he's the full last week or last seven years we'll begin when the bride was taking the rapture he says no no no let me go back to read you a quote 70th week number thirteen where did my son get cut off exactly what the word said where will that 70 wings begin he's actually after this church is cut off that's exactly right now watch what he is talking about you say well who are you well who are you no no nenene you got that wrong not the full seven weeks the week started when Jesus came on earth no what huh the week started he's convinced this whole thing down to when Jesus came on earth he said the Messiah Prince shall come and prophesy what brother branham is thinking in his mind is when that guy asks a question he's thinking the whole seven years of Jesus's ministry is right here and that's not true but there's got to be one week left after the rapture Church or the Bible is wrong Lord if we got the Bible wrong then we need to just go find a bar amen he'll be cut off and Jesus preached exactly three and a half years now he's going to the preaching the Ministry of Jesus Christ he's not talking about walls being built he's not going about all these other things about a Millennial temple he's talking about Jesus preaching three and a half years which is half of the 70 weeks the seven days week week days and there's three and a half years left what there's three and a half years of Jesus's ministry left now let's go down a little bit further where's my this is the last it will be done for him let's go to paragraph 299 keep going up right there wolf since then it seemed like the first three and a half years was fulfilled during the ministry this is the question he continues on with the question well here you got it right here of Jesus but the expression midst of the week seems to be applied only to lanta cross breaking his covenant with a know that Antichrist breaks his covenant at the end of the last three and a half years what the last three and a half years of Jesus's ministry he's condensed it down to the Ministry of Jesus Christ because you can't have that Antichrist being right here I mean right here and have just three and a half years left he makes the Covenant the Bible says for one week which is seven years everybody got that now the Antichrist brakes is coming at the end of the last three and a half years what is the life straight I hear of Jesus's ministry there's not seven years of Jesus's ministry left there's only three and a half as I understood Daniel Tate the first 69 weeks into when Jesus wrote in Jerusalem 1830 so that three and a half years of his ministry would be included in the 69 weeks and the full last week before last week or seven years would still be fulfilled to begin at the rapture please clarify this for me now this is his answer you know brother sister EVER who it is asked this question very fine well I believe he got a little mixed up on what I said when Jesus came into Jerusalem that's exactly right that was the end of the see he went right straight in from there and was crucified and he did prophesy half of the 70 weeks he didn't say 70 I mean seven he said he prophesied half of the 70 weeks well he didn't prophesy half for the 70 weeks if you take it exactly purely like what we're talking about he did prophesy half for the 70 weeks which is what three and a half years and was cut off soul was made of sacrifice in this last day there's three and a half years still promised to the Jews and that's exactly correct but that's inside of the 70 weeks of Daniel everybody got that if you don't then you know what call brother Brown what you want to I just read you two different quotes that look wrong I said look wrong they seem to be totally opposite and they're not they're not that Messiah week is inside the 70 weeks of Daniel covers from 80 445 BC I mean 445 BC until they come back and bring this millennial temple in according to the Bible to finish 490 years but inside of that is a three and a half year Ministry of Jesus Christ and another three and a half year ministry of Jesus Christ you bring them up like Bob put them and put them right here he prophesied three and a half he was cut off in the last half of the Messiah week he prophesized but you cannot put that in the Bible if you don't put it the way I just told you somebody's got to be wrong and I contend today that the Bible is right and brother Browns message is right hey man I mean I just my if you didn't get up this morning thinking who's coming to the right church why'd you come o for the turkey and dressing that's what it was you think I was gonna quit and not talk about you one more time I'm talking to you Rachel sister Rachel sorry brother Dale set out for years years and years to take all this message that seemed to be wrong parts of the message that seemed to be your what I said seemed to be wrong he comes through those ministers meetings hey they had ministers meetings on this in the 70s right in the 70s contending that brother Branham was wrong until the seals open and then all of a sudden that's not true there's only but look you can't change the Bob you cannot change the Bible the Bible says there 70 weeks determined there's a one as a seven-year 62 me a seven week a sixty two week and a one week period there's no half weeks in that 70 weeks of Daniel the half weeks are when the Messiah comes and prophesized the first half of his Messiah ministry and then the second half of Messiah ministry comes and then God takes them in a rapture and then you have to fulfill the rest of the six fold purpose right we proved that so you know I'm like I was reading a couple of quotes for brother Branham was talking about revival he said we said um he said even God can start a revival God is a gentleman he said God can't start a revival he said a revival has to start with the people he said a preacher can't even start a rumor a minister cannot even start a revival he says the people have to start a revival they have to get it in their mind Israel finally got it in their mind they'd had enough of Egypt so they wanted a revival so they called for a revival then God sent Moses on the scene all right so that's what you and I that from now this from this point forward I'm gonna pray for a revival I'm gonna pray for a word revival and I'm going to read you where you say walk and we're gonna be shouting speaking in tongues that's okay that can happen but a word revival is reviving what words you already got inside of you all right and then that'll break forth into all the happiness and brother Branham said always supernatural things happen at the time of a revival and we'll go through that we'll start in the Old Testament and bring it all the way up through so let's stand there to your feet god bless you for paying attention or or at least enduring it but if we don't if we don't get anything get one thing brother Branham is right and the Bible's right and they absolutely dovetail with each other you say well what about this quote and what about that quote what about Jesus walking up everyone Dan said look unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have an apartment come on up here and we'll sing a song thank you Richard yeah sisters go down and get ready for them for the meal but come on let's sing a song and just give them a little time of to get this stuff ready we will we will be all eating together today mmm god bless you like sitting in for paying attention weep we've tried in this church we don't we don't contend it anything is wrong that the Prophet preached or the Bible we just we know one thing's for sure if Jesus stood up and said eat my flesh and drink my blood I got a quote now where Jesus said right here you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood now how many of people that had a revelation did that we took communion they took communion by that one quote that's verbatim Danny brother if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood you'll have no part with me nobody I'll guarantee you they was a group remember that 70 that was around him that couldn't handle that and they left why because they took him literal if you take literal quotes by brother Branham you can pick it apart but if you'll take the Bible and the prophets message and take the Holy Ghost you supposed to have and put it together it's got to fit it can't not fit how in the world can you take the Holy Ghost the Word of God that that the Holy Ghost wrote the Word of God and you look at the word of God and your Holy Ghost says I don't think that's right you can't do that you just can't or you can but you won't be the Christ you'll be the Antichrist and I don't want us to do that I wants to be happy in the Lord let's say a couple of songs god bless you like I said be praying we're gonna have we're gonna have a word revival we're gonna try our best to get this thing I mean not listen and the revival doesn't start because things are wrong a revival starts because you just want to revive what you've already got inside of me man go ahead change we're bleeding stride [Music] let's pray and in their trade oh my let me begin teasing to change world and they were free I bless your name I bless your name you love him I give you give me a break you are the love the truth the way I bless your name I bless your listen to this saw midnight if you found yourself in that place you could find you're in afraid not shackled by natural chain shackle bomb in your head [Music] next thing you know lift the heads up those change and they will fall and they into it in Jesus name [Applause] hybl it's your name I bless your name I gave you I give you brain [Applause] Thank You me day you are larger I bless your name you know we were not given a truth we were given the truth there's a truce different ones but this is the truth we've been given the truth I bless your name [Music] not gave you brain [Applause] [Music] [Applause] the truth the way I bless your name I'm sure listen God's not the author of confusion he will not confuse you if you're confused it is the devil that's not you but if you ever ask God you know right when you get down to that Nazi and council back in 325 AD they they come with an idea started as an idea that Jesus was not God but they were so overwhelmed by the doctrine of that day that they came and said no no no that's not right Jesus Jesus was God same substance it took 300 years for the devil all that saying just kept going that didn't that didn't satisfy some people and it wasn't of God and we know that because look what it turned into 300 years later that Jesus was a like substance the demigod and then there was a father son Holy Ghost baptism and then there's all these other things that the Catholic Church instituted but it took 300 years Satan you know what Satan is just as patient as God is it took him three hundred more years and now look 2,000 years it's to the devil since Jesus left the scene it took 2,000 years for the devil through all them horse riders to come to this very end time with a pale horse but what do you do he started over here with false doctrine come all the way through well now what's he doing he's letting people go to church and do all these different things and do whatever they want to do but then well yeah I was saved when I was 11 years old I went to the altar what are you doing now well I I still drink and curse and smoke and do all the things I used to do like I've told the story before and I tell it again I I just got converted I ran with a bunch of guys that you didn't have to you'd have to carry a gun to kill them with I could kill them with my mouth you know you can kill about somebody with your mouth walk working again it's easy to shoot somebody with a gun but you kill their influence brother Brian said you kill the man you kill influence so that was my problem but I got converted and I had a banker friend of mine I had a business in town I had a banker friend of mine we were out to boat fishing John knew something happened cuz I wasn't acting the way I used to I they used to bring all their dirty magazines and dirty movies and they played all weekend we'd go fishing and have a beer and I'm just telling you the truth told him I didn't want to do that no more I went over in a different place and sat down well me and John got in the boat in that fishing he's big bank president up in Gainesville I said John I don't he you know they always want had you a beer don't matter if they ever never seen you before they buddy up there said no John I don't do that no more I said I got saved just a few months ago he raised his beer and he said what's great so am i you don't like that and I said I said John we're out here in this boat I said what does save mean and he just kind of looked at me I said now if I took you and threw you off for this boat into that water you'd need saving but if I saved you I would pick you up I like water that you're drowning in and I'd set you in the boat now what's changed something's changed you're not in that water anymore you're saved from what you once did and of course you get that faraway stare they just look at you you know I said I don't do those things anymore because I got saved and I just look to him I said John would you get saved from if you were saved I said what you get saved from and he never did say another word just laughed and went on you know but that's the way the world is yeah that's why says think about this revival brother Ram talks about revivals of different ages and we'll go through them because I think it's I think it's some important that we go through and see how look what happened to brother Branham I don't know if it was Billy Sunday or somebody one of them died another one came on the scene Smith Wigglesworth died or somebody died and brother Branham came on the scene I mean just the fair few days and we'll show it we'll see it during the through the history of revival but we need a revival we need a revival to get us out and get us up get us out of our self and get us up into God it's a late hour folks ready okay all right so late hour so god bless you you pray for us if you don't understand what I just said you know ask question don't go off and don't go off the light brother Dale says disgusted everybody else you need to discuss it with whoever you don't you have a something against or a problem with but I'm like brother Dale I'm down to the place now where I'm just gonna turn the Daniel 9:24 and I'm gonna let you read it if you can't read with the Bible you're sure not gonna agree with any quote but you're just gonna I'm just gonna let you read the Bible explain that to me of both three periods and then try to put all this other together but I think God's done it for us I'm am well thank you for coming god bless you eat all you want but as I said before this is another buffet that you can take things home with you you eat
