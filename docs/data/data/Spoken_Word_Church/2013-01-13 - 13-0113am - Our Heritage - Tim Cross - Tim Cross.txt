they've been here before the visit okay all right we'll we'll talk to you after the service though but uh brother dale's not here this morning and that's a shocker i don't think i've been here for 10 11 years and never seen him not come to the service so he's sick so just keep him in your prayers him and mom and richard all of our families pretty much had it except me and i don't want it so i'm not able to have it and i'm sure they didn't want it either but somehow y'all gave it to them everybody's doing the knuckle bumps and the elbow smash and all that stuff instead of shaking hands so but um don't do that to the visitors they'll think we're strange but good to be in the house with the lord good to have brother tim cross and his and his wife with us today and they're just a blessing to us and a blessing to the bride around the world um he can play the piano uh pretty good and she can sing very well so they're going to do that for you today and just knowing them for a long time and just seen them grow up in the lord so we we appreciate them coming just keep all the ones in in prayer brother ray and sister kathy and i i couldn't we probably got 30 people out today that are sick and off um doing things um you know out so the dean's probably preaching somewhere and his brother's preaching okay sister milk is sick so just lord just be with each one just completely clean us out sterling's sterling got his cleaning out he got dumped off of a four-wheeler so just pray for him and remember this afternoon we have the uh shower for amy and well not jeffrey but amy jeffrey yeah he can't go but you love the lord thank you good to be in the house with lord this morning let's sing open the eyes of my heart lord as brother tim cross comes from he's used to being north carolinian now he's a south carolinian so now he's a southerner he was a northerner then now he's a southerner now so open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart open me open the eyes of my heart is i am oh amen god bless each of you this morning and it's it's good to be here it's good to um have an opportunity on this side of eternity together with you again because we believe um like the job said one time the lord spoke to him said where were you when the morning stars sing together and the sons of god shout out for joy that's right so each time we have um this opportunity to me it's it's like a rehearsal it's like a a pre-family reunion to the great family reunion the wedding second and meredith suffered amen you can be seated this morning and um someone had requested that my wife sing so i just invite her to come at this time and we just to worship the lord together and whoever's keeping track of my time preaching don't start the clock just yet um not this morning as far as i know um through so many dangers and toils of this life i have already come but he keeps the grace is is i just can't beside me intentions i've had sometimes my stream just says is is i'm oh my god me through going back amen but we're not going by feeling this morning one by faith in the promise faith in his word faith in faith in a faithful god who is faithful he that has to be done in good work perform it until the day of jesus christ amen and um we used to sing a little song when i was growing up i know whom i have believed and then persuaded he is able to keep that which i have committed unto him against that day amen let's stand this morning and turn with me in your bibles to psalm chapter 61 and while you're turning around i do counted a tremendous honor and privilege to have this opportunity to speak to you this morning and i appreciate brother samuel by the way um the ministry that that is here the government of this church and each of you who make up this portion of the body of the bride of jesus christ um never take things for granted and if i stood here this morning for one moment relying on my own ability or my own understanding or learning i i would step down from this pulpit right now and turn it over someone else because i that would be the most dangerous thing that i would ever do to you or myself i ask you to hold me in your prayers this morning that the lord would speak that he would move brother tim aside and just use a vessel that i've tried to consecrate to him for his service amen um we remember brother samuel in prayer this morning that's right and uh sister dale lord of bless them and touch them and also i bring you greetings this morning from my pastor brother joel hughes and all of the believers there the saints that make up that portion of the body of jesus christ and uh from grace coveted tabernacle amen let's read this morning in psalm 61 you pray for my voice also the lord will just give us strength let's read beginning at verse 1 down through verse 8. hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer from the end of the earth will i cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than i for thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy i will abide in thy tabernacle forever i will trust in the covert of thy wings for thou o god hast heard my vows thou has given me the heritage of those that fear thy name that's right thou wilt prolong the king's life and his years as many generations he shall abide before god forever oh prepare mercy and truth which may preserve him so will i sing praise unto thy name forever that i may daily perform my vows i mean let's go to the author of the word in prayer this morning if you have a need in your life a burden upon your heart something you desire from the lord this morning hold that there as we approach him in prayer this morning lord jesus we come humbly before that throne of mercy and grace this morning and we come boldly father as queen esther lord could approach the king realizing it was life or death but at the same time believing father there was a relationship there there was a bond that you would extend favor lord as your bride this morning we believe that you are conscious of the needs of every soul present in this building this morning and even those fathers who are not here perhaps lord in a in a natural body that we could see or touch feel or hear but lord in spirit they're here this morning because their desire is to be here but their body wasn't able and we're burdened for them this morning lord and we lift them up before you in prayer i don't know each name but you know each one lord god who lord the enemy may have hindered this morning through sickness or affliction weakness lord or just being at a low place perhaps father along their christian journey but we ask you lord that the holy spirit will go and minister healing lord and strength edify thy body lord which is still here upon this earth and pray lord our prayer this morning is that you will come and speak in this service lord and minister to each need that's present lord and move me aside father and have thy perfect will and way we ask that you'll grant it lord in jesus name we pray amen amen amen you may be seated i want to speak this morning on a subject or the title of this message i would title our heritage and i take this from verse 5 of psalm 61 in the second portion of that verse the psalmist david says thou hast given me the heritage of those that hear thy name and when i read this verse of scripture it seemed like inspiration came to me and so i want to look at that this morning our heritage and what was david seeing that inspired him god moved upon his heart to write this verse in the holy writ in the scripture and how perhaps you and i could also see what david saw and draw strength from that amen right turn with me this morning also to the book of colossians i'd like to read colossians chapter one and verses 9 through 14. just to get a little foundation this morning paul says here as he addresses the colossians he says in verse 9 for this cause we also since the day we heard it do not cease to pray for you and to desire that he might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding that he might walk worthy of the lord unto all pleasing being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of god right there's a big there's a vast difference between the knowledge of god and the knowledge that comes from the tree of knowledge of good and evil which is imparted by lucifer that's right but paul is dealing with the knowledge of god in verse 11 he continues strengthened with almighty according to his glorious power unto all patience and long-suffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the father which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in life amen there's a there's a a a great similarity between an inheritance and a heritage david speaks of a heritage paul speaks of an inheritance and he says in verse 13 who hath delivered us from the power of darkness and speaking in present tense terms and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear son right there is a transition that paul is describing or our translation paul is describing here in verse 13 that i believe applies to each and every son and daughter of god yes sir amen from the power of darkness into the kingdom of his dear son in whom verse 14 we have redemption through his blood even the forgiveness of sins that's right amen amen now i always like to begin this thought by sharing a story from my teenage years and i might have shared it here before but i was about 14 years old or so and one day i believe it was on maybe a friday or saturday probably a friday because um my dad was a mail carrier and his days off he was always off on sunday and then his days off through the week rotated monday tuesday wednesday thursday and then when he got to friday he would get friday and saturday and sunday was a long weekend next week he'd work all six days but we were going down my dad my granddad myself being the oldest of uh my dad's first three boys all three of us boys are in the back seat of the car we're driving down to the coast to go fishing you know um believers don't go to the beach they go to the coast you gotta be careful now to use these terms so we're driving to the coast to go fishing and um my granddaddy who is now going on passed on my dad's father would begin to tell us a story about a time years years ago they had a family reunion and granddaddy and my dad's side of the family was from the eastern part of north carolina down around the wilmington and elizabethton area and so at this family reunion uh one of my uncles or one of my dad's uncles or one of my granddad's uncles was there and his name was john and he was bound to a wheelchair and i i would guess he was up in years and you know just there and and seated in the wheelchair and you know how it is a defending reunion all sitting around maybe in the living room just reminiscing sharing stories and someone noticed that um that john uncle john was crying and he had tears coming out of his eyes and streaming down his face and so you know how it is sometimes when a person is maybe in pain or something they can't i'll can't always say it so they saw this song in crying and so i i suppose it was one of my answer uh because someone spoke to him said john said is everything okay everything's fine are you hurting or anything need anything to know and uh the way my granddaddy tells the told the story was that someone else spoke up and said oh that's just that's just crosses said when when a cross is happy they cry that's that's one way they express their joy and and so um said he's there's nothing wrong with him he's just he's just a cross and that's what crosses do when they get happy is they cry and so granddaddy went on and told whatever well that that story that my granddaddy told stuck with me because it helped me to understand something about myself right i'm a cross right i would be three or four generations perhaps from this uncle right but it runs in my genes it runs in my the dna that i inherit from my father you also receive things using traits good or bad from your parents but i remember because as all of you know when you're going through your teenage years um it's a transition time from childhood into adulthood right and you know when you're a child you cry usually because you're mad or you're hurting or you're hungry or your diaper needs to be changed and so usually crying is an expression of some form of pain grief discontentment suffering right but now i was in my teenage years and we were also going through a lot because we had left the church that i had been raised in for almost 10 years and i found myself now going to another church visiting and i was very very resentful because i did not understand why we had left this other church i did you know there was a lot of issues there but i didn't see all those issues and i wasn't old enough to understand and really for my father to share with me all the reasons and but in the church i was raised in and i've probably shared this before so i apologize if i'm rehashing it but i i just gotta follow what i feel is the leadership of the lord the church i was in was a message believing church but the only other churches we had fellowship with were far away uh one was in new mexico uh for a time there it was like we would reach out and from time to time we'd have fellowship with someone maybe in another state or you know in another territory but it wouldn't take too long before we realized they were off the word and we were we were right and we had to move forward and pray for them you know and we we had missions work in india you know there were believers in india that we knew of there were believers in new mexico that we knew of and um just the the impression that i got whether it was implied or inferred was that our little church was the bride of christ in in north carolina right and maybe maybe on the east coast yeah i mean this was this was the 80s and we had 200 plus people we were at the church the church at that time was one of the larger groups of believers in the area we had people moving up from florida they were seeing the light we had people moving from all over the place coming in was like a revival so i'm thinking if we're leaving this and we're leaving this teaching i believe that my pastor was the joshua that god had raised up to take us on into the promise right after the death of the prophet moses you know i believe this i was 14 years old i believe this so i'm thinking we're lost we're i believe this in my heart we're going to hell we're going out here fellowshipping with these serpent seeds and buzzards and foolish virgins and unregenerates and why is my dad doing this to me so i i was rebellious against my dad because i thought he was sending our entire family to the pits of hell but then i go amongst these believers and they begin worshiping and they're singing the same songs we sing they're reading the same quotes we read wow and they're they they pretty much believe the same thing wow now they don't believe it's okay for men to have two three four five or six wives but well maybe i just need to go read the message again because what i'm feeling when i'm amongst these other believers i'm feeling loved they they know i came out of a church that practiced and condoned and promoted polygamy but they still love me this is really giving me a as a paradox because i'm thinking if they knew what i just came out of they wouldn't love me so much they would kind of you know keep me at arm's length keep that distance or treat me like i've got maybe a communicable disease or something like that because i mean we've been taught you do carry spirits you know it's like they're not afraid of me they're embracing me right and i played the piano i started playing the piano when i was about eight years old and i played for my mother and uh she sings just like an angel you know every child thinks that about their mother i know but it's true in in my case but i was so rebellious that i didn't even want to play the piano i didn't want to play for mom i just resented it because i thought we're just wasting our time here amongst all these bullish virgins yeah i mean i was being graceful to call the foolish virgins there is a chance for foolish virgins although we had been taught there wasn't i knew there was because brother ben said they're right anyway you see the the situation i was in but when i would be in those services we had not been taught a whole lot or i had not learned a whole lot about the movement of the holy spirit right and the baptism of the holy ghost and the need to be converted right so i was in these these other rogue churches and i was feeling something that made something on the inside of me won't felt like it was boiling over right amen something on the inside like uh it was a pressure right it really is a literal pressure i feel like i'm gonna burst amen so i'm standing here amongst strange people in a strange church with strange colors on the walls and theater seating and all these i remember exactly where i was when this was happening to me i don't think god how do i express how do i let this out i've got a bit right somehow and i wanted to shout i really didn't want to just scream because something is that working on the inside i wanted to scream right but nobody else around me was screaming so oh my i don't want to break church order you right i wanted to run right but nobody else around me was running so i thought well i don't want to break church or you know i'll be a weirdo these people don't think i'm even more weird because he believes polygamy but he's a pentecostal too you know so all i could do brother sister was just stand there kind of frozen and stiff and then the tears would just start pouring out of my eyes and it was just that outlet right but when my granddaddy told me that i realized that's okay yeah that's normal right that's who i am it's okay to cry it would be okay to shout right i would learn later it would be okay to run around as long as it run over somebody but you understand i when you learn who you are come on brother it's a it's a process of maturity that's right when you learn who you are then you can accept who you are then be who you are be comfortable in your own skin then you can just relax and you can enjoy who you actually are amen now this applies to the natural and it also applies to the spirit i have to be guarded against certain things that are traits that were passed to me by my father and mother right i have to be careful how i come across right i have to be careful how people take me right because people can misunderstand me believe it or not sometimes i'm joking and people don't realize i'm joking my wife a wife or a husband helps you see a side of yourself that otherwise you would not see that's a good thing about a companion they help you see a side of yourself that otherwise you're blind to right yeah you know everyone has a blind side sure that's right you don't have none of you have 360 degree vision so your companion helps cover your blind side right helps show you hey how many of you ever been in the hospital yeah man yeah how many of you ever had to wear a hospital down hospital gals have a blind side and sometimes you're under medication and you're not quite getting on all eight summers anyway so it's really nice to have a companion that can kind of help you see your blind side right now now you all might not want that to go out on the web it's too late anyway by the way you all right you know in formation flying the the blue angels the thunderbirds every pilot has a blind side that's right that's what the teammates there right that's what the wing runs there for right right it's the cover is six right the cover is nine right to cover is three o'clock the sides you can't see because the wing keeps you from seeing the enemy right that's why we need each other these folks that are trying to make a rapture living on an island by themselves with no pastor no brother no sister nobody i i don't know i i wouldn't want to be there that's right i need the family of god amen i need you amen i need you you need me i need a pastor yes sir i need a deacon in my life that's right amen the church meets trustees we all need these things god set in the church gifts right ministries every church perhaps don't have the same needs but god places in the body all of the organs all the members all the everything that's needed to edify that body amen now i've got to get going here with this sermon or the dye pack is going to burst yeah that's right and if you don't understand that don't worry about it i know it but if you do then you get a chuckling on that hearing my granddaddy tell me about who our family is a little just a little glimpse of our family helped me to understand who i am david said in psalm 61 thou has given me the heritage of those that fear thy name amen now what is a heritage if you look it up in the dictionary it'll say it's a property that descends to an heir right that's something that you inherit or you obtain by your birth right by the lineage you're born into right that's right i am not i it's very unlikely that i am in brother samuel dale's will right because my last name is cross it's very unlikely that brother wade is in brother cross's will that's right if we are probably yeah but because not by my choice but by god's forward nation i'm born to the larry cross he's born to samuel del therefore by your birth right you are automatically entitled to certain things that come as a result of your lineage or your predecessor amen right all right so then the second definition something transmitted by or acquired from a predecessor right right definition c something possessed as a result of one's natural situation or birth right now we have in a modern society adoption i can go adopt a child that is not my biological child or offspring but i can make that child that's right right my uh inher inherits give that child inheritance amen i can make that child a beneficiary right of my wealth or poverty there you go amen right through adoption all right right so then as we read in colossians paul said he hath made us to be meat which is able right made us able to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints amen in life paul's not talking about dead people that's right paul's talking about a lineage paul is talking about a bloodline we call it the royal sea amen it is not a natural bloodline if any of you in here are left your turban on the doorstep this is not a the muslims got it wrong right it's not natural it's spiritual right it's by faith it's the faith seed of abraham amen is the royal seed of abraham amen amen it's something that is and it comes down through your bloodline your literature it's something that is passed down from generation to generation that's right now it can be traits or characteristics that are unique to that specific family yes sir i walk a certain way and my brother matthew and i'm you know they all know we all laugh about this in our family and we gotta we've got a crosswalk we hold our head a certain way we bob a certain way and then when we go to take a seat we don't sit down like a normal person most people walk up to the seat turn around and then just sit down and sit around but here's how the crosses do it we do it like landing an airplane we walk and as we get closer we start sort of slide right in now isn't that funny that is the funniest thing but you know what i never went to school to learn how to do that my dad never said now boys you've reached the age i'm going to send you down to the cross reformatory story to teach you how to walk how to you know all the odd and peculiar behaviors of a cross he was born in amen amen he was i didn't even choose it that's right in some ways i might wish i could do something about it if i did i would just be trying to reinvent myself right and i would make myself even more of an oddball trying to become something that i'm i'm just not right right so there's there and you know every family has little little peculiarities about it and they don't all together like them or love them but at some point you just accepted that's who i am right now the same thing with the christian family there are things that are born and bred into you by your birth that you can fight you can hate you can dislike you can try to cover it up with all the all the refinement or makeup or whatever it is you choose but the bottom line is it's who you are right by your birth and you just be better off just to accept that this is the way i am that's why i believe brother brown said or we're tall i don't i can't i don't have a quote for it pick a bible character yeah right that you can identify with that's right it helps you because you have one or a combination of characteristics that are inherited through your spiritual birth amen some people are going to have really strong on the elijah side right they're going to be very bold very adamant very you know my way or the highway oh okay uh she bears come out and kill them all that's that's the elijah strain others are gonna have a milder more tactful more diplomatic more political approach doesn't mean they're a hypocrite right just means they got another strength from their spiritual heritage but you connect with the bible character now i think the uh some of the denominations like the catholics or the presbyterians do this thing with like ordination and you i don't i don't understand how it all works but that there's something they go through where you pick a character and you take a 14 course and you study the life of this character and then you are ordained into the church as john the baptist that becomes your new spiritual identity because that's the character you connect with and so brother wade decides i'm john the baptist when i approach brother john not by the way but your brother john because my spiritual brother in christ and i would be brother who brother timothy brother paul if y'all picking y'all want to pick a name you know what i'm saying they they find a character and and they're probably a little bit off balance on that right yeah yeah but you know i know i know message churches where people come in and they change their entire name first middle and last name to gain a new identity it's a form of brainwashing right exactly sure it's a form of brainwashing but you see they're taking something that has a balanced application right and they're taking it to an extremely way off facebook and i and you know i suppose if they change churches again they're gonna change names and now when you meet him you don't know what name to call him right because you don't know if he's brother harry or brother jonathan or brother zechariah you know what i'm saying but you do i believe that's why the prophet said find a character right you identify with because what you're actually doing there is you're seeing your family tree right right i think that's what david did right david just began to look back over the path in the course of his life and watch how he was confronted with situations he was tempted he was tested he was tried things things were thrown in him that he didn't ask for right he didn't choose and you know sometimes when you just get thrown right in the middle of something you don't have time to plan your reaction right right that's correct you don't have time to think through how am i going to deal with this you just act right it just and then the real you shows out your instincts take over uh your genetics all of these things take over and sometimes when you look back you like the what you see and sometimes you you wish you could relive that right at least the portion of those commands that's right but i believe that david could look back over his life and say i never asked to be king right i never asked for a lion to attack i never requested a bear right right i never requested uh a bathsheba right i never re we would have never prescribed right life's trials for ourselves that's right if god could have given us arrest and said abc or d do you want to have to contend with adultery drug addiction immoral living bank robbery thieving lying stealing whatever right now you get to pick your temptation we would have all gone for the easiest option all right or we would have gone for the fill in the blank right yeah and we just said i want to be tempted to lay out a church when i you know when when the the masters are on yeah i can beat that one yeah i can beat that one or maybe maybe not everybody right but you know what i'm saying you would pick the one you know you could conquer but we don't get to pick that right god picks up right god for ordains even our trials right our test god knows before he permits satan to throw that at you he knows what your reaction's going to be you're not proving anything to god right he's on missions he's infinite you are proving to the devil and you are proving to yourself right amen who you really are right amen job didn't prove anything to god right god never questioned right it was satan that had the question satan said if you do a b and c job will do x y z and god said no he won't he will not because god knew his his his genetic composition right right god knew what was really on the inside of job satan was looking at the shell satan was looking at the riches and the wealth and the and the modern wife and all these things and satan said corrupt this take that away defile that remove the family take take all of the peripheral away and the heart of job will curse you we'll curse you god and god said no he won't amen i know his heart right i gave him his heart all right he knew who his father was but satan was the one that needed needed to be it needed to be demonstrated to you brother and sister satan's a doubter he's the doubter right he's the source of all doubt he's the source of all fear he's the source of all sickness the prophet of god taught these things he's the originator of all of this and you're caught in the middle right amen that's right you are caught in the middle between both voices satan will tell you oh you're just living this way because your parents thought it to you yeah i know he says that because he told me that right right you're just an actor you're just a hypocrite you're a two-face you're one person at church and another person at work and satan was right i was a hypocrite but i was easily influenced right i was easily persuaded when i was in church i loved what i was feeling i believed what i was hearing i wanted to be a christian with all of my heart but i didn't want to believe that all my coworkers was bound for hell either right and so i'm thinking how can i relate to them how can i be a friend to them without going over the line there was a time in my life i believed if i watched the television i was going to hell i learned later that wasn't true but i believed this in my childish mind and we didn't have television growing up i thank the lord we've never had it in our home uh our parents was you know we were we were very strict we were raised strict and i thank god for that i'm not condemning any what it does i just tell you my experience amen but i believe that looking at television was a sin and sin the wages of sin is death and and sin leads you to hell right well on thanksgiving we had to go to my aunt's house and my uncle's house and and we had a friend in our family who was a doctor and they all had they had tvs in every room yeah and on thanksgiving day this christian holiday which is the the last bastion of christianity in american culture and the day that's designed to give thanks and praise unto god for this glorious bounty that he's bestowed upon us and we take the natural and see it through the spiritual for the rest so we thank god for this newfound land right the baptism of the holy so but here we are now i know on on wednesday nights little tim is in church he's saying god and i know that tomorrow i'm going to have to face the devil he's a 36 inch devil and my uncle's gonna be watching him and my aunt's gonna be watching it and my cousins are gonna be watching it and i can't pry my eyes off of it and it's just a football game but there's them commercials on there and there's all that demonic and i know all of that stuff but you understand the predicament and and really this would have been a great time to be a catholic yeah because i could have just bought an indulgence yeah i could have went ahead and pre-paid for my sin and been had a clear conscience but we weren't taught catholicism so therefore i'm trying to repent right i'm trying to get grace and strength encourage god i'm serious i was saying lord jesus help me never look at that tv tomorrow that was my desire i didn't want to look at it well they also had a pinball machine the doctor was a man of modest wealth and had a pinball machine well that was the devil too yeah because it it had a kind of uh semi-provocative woman up on it it made all these sounds old-timey pinholes she did the buzz and all skydivers falling all these demonic voices that came out of it i love to play that game but that was the devil too well he did have a tuba but i couldn't play the tuba so what am i going to do you understand i don't know where i'm even going with this way i want to live now but this this is the predicament that you're in and i know tomorrow i'm going to go there and i'm going to i'm going to end up watching that tv and i'm going to end up playing that pinball game and then i got to go back to church and ask god forgiveness and i think why would god even forgive me yeah when i knew i was gonna do it before i asked pre-forgiveness for what i was gonna do and i ended up doing exactly what i do i was gonna accept i only watched it longer i skipped dessert and played pinball because i had it to myself remember i've got four brothers and two sisters and we were all wanting to play the pinball game yeah so little tim could play it while everybody else was eating their dessert they think well i'm not getting fat but i am indulging at the same time it was sinful you we're really not dealing with the evils we're dealing with something that's in here something that needs to die right something that needs to be extinguished something that needs to have a proper burial right and a funeral service and and maybe even a cremation i don't know something that needs to completely die and then you know what once that change takes place and god gives you that birth right and you recognize who you are there ain't enough televisions in the world to change that there ain't enough pinball machines in the world they're in enough football games they're gonna ill dress ill-fated stripteases in the world i am a son of god i am a daughter of god that is disgusting that is repulsive to me amen it might catch my eye for a second and it might be fascinating to walk into walmart and see uh ice age on the computer on the tv there but i know i'm not going to hell because ice age caught my attention i'm going to heaven because before the foundation of the world god had me in his mind and i'm just an expression of his here on earth to be tempted tested tried and battled with sin but really god sees the end from the beginning and knows that in the end i'll overcome i'll conquer it i'll come out on topic man satan will be down there i'll be up there and so when god brings us to that it puts us at ease yes sir we can be comfortable in our own escape right brother sister i did not have all this in my notes i hope it's helpful this morning all right but now there's folks that take predestination yeah come on and they'll go out there and they'll fill every room in their house with the television they'll do it all man they got grace grace we believe in predestination i'll have you to know i'm not going to hell because i've got a television they're exactly right all right i'll have you know i'm not going to hell because uh i've got olympic sized swimming pool that's exactly right yeah that swimming pool ain't gonna send you to that right but see i went to brother's home one time he's got a pool table pool table's not going to send you to help right right he's got a ping-pong table ping-pong table's not going to send you the hat that's right hey man he's got a slot machine uh-oh nope the slot machine is not going to send them to hell right but the slot machine and the pool table and the swimming pool and all of these other things are saying something about what's going on in that man's heart right right because the prophet said apply the token right clean out the trash all right there are some things that will never have any edifying value right right and what may be okay for brother wade to do right might not be okay for you to do because you can't hold it in balance right right that's right but where do you draw the line right i draw the line at the slot machine some people draw the line at the pool table right some people draw the line at the swimming pool but a lot of it is not necessarily we've got our list of 10 commandments from william bratton a lot of is what's evil to you and that doesn't put us on that slippery slope of what's evil to me oh my it's not evil to me to go to gab go to vegas and go gambling that's wrong that's right amen gambling is against the bible gambling is contrary to the scripture amen there are some things that are very black and white right and there's some things that are great area but the main thing is knowing who you are and then i think sometimes we have to ask ourselves the question all right there's a desire there's a desire here i've got a desire i love to fly airplanes i don't mean the little remote control i like to fly real planes man is that a sid no but now if i go plunk down ten thousand dollars and reserve myself a flight instructor and he says tim here's how we'll do this to get you to private pilot as quickly as possible we're gonna what's your work schedule i said we're monday through friday 7 30 to 5 and i get off at 2 30 on friday he says all right here's the deal we can get you to private pilot in eight weeks we'll start friday afternoon at 5pm we'll fly friday evening eight hours on saturday and eight hours on sunday we got a problem flying is not a sin right aviation is not a sin skipping church to indulge myself in a personal interest becomes a problem fill in the blank right golf basketball basket weaving doesn't matter i'm trying to hit the brothers and the sisters soccer practice academics well i'm studying for the s.a.t trust god god will not ask you to forfeit his commandment and his will for your life in order for you to achieve what may just be a personal goal and not the lord's will for your life right amen you are not you know you hear people say oh well he lost his religion well it's probably a good thing because if you've got a religion that you can lose or lay down right you've got a religion because a true covering is not something you could put on or take off that's a costume when god dresses his bride to close her in his righteousness and he says do not edit it right do not alter it do not take it off do not amend it do not revise it do not update it amen we got a lot of people trying to update the bible trying to update the message trying to say i know brother brown said but that's a goat that's right a goat says buck a sheep says amen amen if the prophet of god said if the bible said it god stands behind it i say amen amen amen the prophet of god never gave us room or permission to tailor our dress spiritually or naturally according to fashions if the fashions of the world influence or dictate even if we're just a few notches down if we move up a few notches when the world moves up a few notches and we're following the wrong leadership right remember the church of the usa and the right one had her eyes one had her eyes on the worldly church the other had her eyes on the prophet right man where you're looking has a very large bearing upon where you're going right amen i like to ride motorcycles there you go i got you i got you those two-wheel demons i got that from my dad he rides motorcycles you know where i got flying from my granddad he was an air force engineer on bombers he never flew active duty never flew combat he trained other engineers to ship them overseas to do combat duty motorcycling is not a seat but i learned something in motorcycling when you're going around a curve you've got to look where you want to go that's right right that's right you don't look right and where you're going to end up somewhere else than where you wanted to be right right because when you lay that bike over it doesn't matter how fast you're going you don't have to be flying you can be doing 35 miles an hour when you lay that bike over you either want to hug the yellow line or the white line or somewhere in the middle and actually where you focus your eyes is where those tires are aligned that's the truth i learned that reading magazines i was following a friend of mine one time a neighbor he had a ninja and i had a a honda 650 uh vx it was uh just a cruiser like and he really knew how to carve those turrets and he got me in a turn i was following we weren't going fast at all there's a little tiny winding kind of back road and the next thing i know i was on the white line and i was inches away from grass which is wipeout right yes sir and training had to kick you right you do not panic right you do not jam on the brakes you do not even make a huge throttle adjustment you look and lean right came up to jesus and lean on jesus you have to end up right where you want to go amen you're looking at at the signpost or you're looking at the warning sign or you're looking over off to the south shore i said oh god i'm going to crash you're going to crash right because you went where you were looking right right amen even if you all died i know young or all that things you get your eyes on the things your attention gets fixated on end up drawing you right into it right like a moth to a light right right amen so we can sing the song right now turn your eyes on jesus seek ye first the kingdom of god amen do you know that as long as the desire of your heart in no way conflicts with god's word i believe if you live long enough and you obey god well enough and you keep your priorities right i believe god will allow you to enjoy those little luxuries right those little pleasantries those little things that i don't know that will happen in the millennium or the future hall yeah but here brother brendan liked to hunt right brother ben liked to fish nothing wrong with those couldn't let it get in the way of his ministry that's right he had to allocate time to ministry and he had to allocate time to hunting and fishing right and he kept the two very well managed right we've got to do the same thing right i believe the time should go on long enough i could i can become a private pilot i could do anything pretty much i desire to do as long as my desires don't conflict like the will of god or the word of god or is playing for my life but you also have to realize keep your priorities straight right now right because if you get them out of balance you're going to end up going way off here out in orbit right and you're going to get scarred you're going to get hurt you're going to lose precious years of your life that you can never re-live and not because your desires were evil but because you didn't know how to react to those desires right right and let god's leadership right be first and foremost amen that's right wow i i where am i going from here this is truth right it's simple but it's true and it's good and it's wholesome this just seems to be my ministry i have a difficult time laying out point a b and c and building a bridge and getting everybody from here to there and i just have to go with whatever the lord leads right and then stop when it's time to stop amen all right these are things that are bred into you and you can't help it these are tendencies that never had to be taught trained schooled learned i never had to go to cross reform seminary right uh i wish i could have gone to another school to unlearn some of the things they're there by your natural growth uh now maybe i'll i'll cover this and we'll come to a stopping place that's the great thing about morning and evening services you just stop and pick up where you left off right right with certain families you know you hear these names um rockefeller yeah rockefeller you know there's people that try to make their last name rockefeller just to be associated with wealth they're imposters right but they want to change their last name because that's a that's a well-known name we're having brother timothy rockefeller to speak bling bling bling in your mind just to sound cash registers amen just cashing in rockefeller kennedy uh there's so there's uh what's the guy's name now the guy is all old uh boone t boone pickett yeah you hear the name he's like wow yeah you know right johnson some of these names dale yeah oh my god wow yeah whatever i'm being silly now but there is name association and with that name comes certain uh pre-formed conclusions right amen wealth prosperity banking right oil uh gold mining whatever it may be you know politics uh liquor business cigarettes right whatever it is there's name association so people there and then these these are what we would call dynasties right these are dynasties right and i want to tell you within those families we see this in the royal dynasty of england britain right man do you know how much they would love to change prince harry's last name that guy yeah man he's got a whole team of people to to wipe to to go behind him and clean up his mess that's the truth public relations he's got a whole team of people that are keeping the media at bay right keeping the cameras at bay keeping the tabloid just feeding them a little bit to give them something but you know what i'm saying they're trying to cover up because this guy's royalty but he's not acting like him right right he's royalty but the schools have not been effective right in changing his conduct and his heart to act like royals amen so instead they're taking all of these measures to try to enforce royal behavior or at least project a royal image out to the world and brother they've got they've got wealth that will never be exhausted right so they can spend millions upon millions of dollars to buy off the media to buy off the news outlets to buy off everybody to say keep this little prince harry in this glass bubble where people can shake it and snow will fall but eventually everything settles and he's still a prince yeah we don't get that luxury that's right amen but oh how we will try yeah with little johnny and we raised them in the message church and we told them all the principles all the precepts we train them up in the ways you go and all of a sudden little johnny one day all of the training all of the reform all of the legalism it's evident it's not working yeah and we're scared to even submit a prayer request because it's going to crush the whole church's image of little johnny or little susie and what we as perfect parents raise them to be and now it's like there's a worm that's got an end there a virus and it's defecting the whole software system and they're crashing and we're keep trying to prop them up yeah pop them up and eventually you realize as a parrot you can't right and you feel like a failure you feel like you failed that child you failed that son and you failed that dollar you didn't right it's just their genetics caught up with them right their genetics caught up with them and now they need another set of genetics right that's right and they'll catch up with amen yes sir oh god's arms are longer right right than your legs you can run but you can't hide that's right you can run prodigal you can run simpson you can run and run and run and run and one but one day amen mama's prayers is gonna catch you amen daddy's prayers is gonna catch you it might be in a bar room it might be in a federal prison it might be down in a crack house it might be up in new york amen with a homosexual and an ivory tower i don't care where it is that's right one day amen mama's prayers betty's prayers amen because the prophet of god said amen apply the token right amen he didn't say send them off to message seminary he didn't say send them off to reform school he didn't even say send them off to private education he said apply the token apply the token to your home apply the token to your life apply the token to everything you do and claim your loved one amen and god will grant your request that is your inheritance amen yes sir hallelujah brother tim can preach right now that is your inheritance it's not something you deserve it's not something you merit it's not something you build enough points to where you can cash in and claim your loved ones but it's god's word and by faith and his promise you just hold that token right there yes sir god i'm holding that token over johnny that's right god i'm holding that token over susie i don't care how lost i don't care how wrecked in sin i don't care how addicted i don't care how vile how wretched were it not for the grace of god that would be me where it not for the grace of god that would be you but the grace of god caught you brought you and kept you and the same grace that you needed amen amen don't lose faith that it can also right yes sir bring them back yes sir save them amen even if it's on their deathbed sure absolutely at some point but until you don't have any children why are you why are you saying it's because it's true i can speak truth even if i don't have experience at some point you cannot do any more for that child that's correct place them in the hands of god and say god thy will be done amen and god give me the grace to stay out of your way all right so you finish your perfect work in your life right you know what that'll help that child yeah and it'll help you too right your faith is being built right your faith is being streamed you're not as perfect as you might have thought you were that's right and the flaws that you're seeing now those cracks that are becoming so evident that they cannot be covered up with all the pace mortar in the world right are many times a reflection of the flaws that were in your life right and you realize they need grace yeah man that's right he doesn't excuse their behavior nope doesn't excuse their actions it doesn't excuse yours either right but we hold on gracious amen yes sir and we have to be just as willing to meet it out right as we are just scooping in amen that's right oh we love grace i'm grace yeah i need grace i need chris brother jones needs grace but brother jones i gave him grace 10 years ago and he steal this give him grace i need the benefit of the doubt right so does sister mcgillicuddy right give the same grace and give the same benefit of the doubt that you like to indulge in yourself right we'll be you know setting yourself up as a judge is a miserable place to be right amen because to properly judge you've got to have all the evidence right and none of us aren't privileged in that right only god knows all right only god holds all the evidence right so if we start judging we're judging based on limited evidence which which hinders our ability to judge fairly right or just that's right so the best thing is is to be your own judge right because you've got more evidence on yourself than anybody else that's right and the bottom line at the end of the day commit the judgment to god right say god i'm in your hands right you judge me right right and none of us won't judge me we don't want god's justice we like his mercy amen mercy grace as well all right can we stand on our feet woman i didn't even get a third of the way through this but i don't want the dye packet to burst so we'll just resume this evening if the lord amen really amen yes sir do you love the lord this morning amen i hope that in this if you take nothing else away from the service this morning i hope it at least put your soul at peace right to realize god has it all in control right right god knows the end from the beginning we're somewhere in the middle right and many times we only by his grace get lifted up to get a little glimpse say oh it's gonna be okay right but if he doesn't it doesn't allow that or permit that we just have to have faith right all right it's going to be okay amen that's right amen i wonder if we could sing that little song out of the key of f i believe that sister uh learning to leave learning to lean on jesus amen let's just worship the lord here i'm finding more i'm learning to believe that's page number 482. i'd like to see that verse i want to sing it with now they have songbucks pictures already too you know no matter how old or how young we are this morning in natural years we're all god's children we're all as children even if you say brother i'm coming by adoption still makes you a son or daughter of god you know part of parenting is teaching your child to trust you i remember when i was a child we go out on the back porch which is about four or five feet off the ground and daddy would stand about two feet away he said jump jump he wanted you to trust that when you jumped and you couldn't help yourself you couldn't save yourself he would catch you all right everybody god might be asking us this morning right just to leave just put a little more weight you'll find more power right and leaning then you will try to stand on your two feet that's right you'll find more faith and jump and taking that leap and trusting that his open arms would catch you then you're going to stand in there try to god give me the plan tell me everything tell me you'll catch me yeah tell me you'll save me he don't want to tell you all right he wants you to trust him he wants you to jump right prove your faith in him and he will turn through his faithfulness right amen that's right all sad broken i found peace is me there i'm filing more power is you know it says learning you gotta learn to do it you can't naturally do it you gotta learn is we're learning oh this morning um i am i'm i'm while they're praying you pray in your heart for somebody that you know is sick right now somebody that's not with us somebody that's sick that's at home remember your pastor and his wife just pray for them now the holy spirit's here give you freedom to pray then pray just in in prayer pray for somebody i

learning to lean the learning process yes my brother tim you know it may have been a uh may have been a lot of stories told today about his life but you know what that's part of his journey that's part of his experience that's part of his journey from from where he was to where he is now you know what we all have the same one you put your name to it yeah it's the same journey we didn't just come into this message and know everything that's true we didn't just walk in a church and and you know and just be full so full of the holy ghost until we didn't need it anymore no god knows if he dumped it all on us that we'd go crazy because he was a human one time too and he knew that we needed a journey that's true he took a journey we're on a journey but he said i'll never leave you and i'll never forsake you you might think god's so far away but he's right there that's right enjoy the message you might be getting a little older usually jumps around and screams and shouts and hollers and runs all over the place so maybe he's settling down a little bit and using this using this energy for uh for this coming service coming up so just be in prayer for him be back at two o'clock lord bless each and every one of you just remember to greet each one in the name of the lord and remember these that are not here i'm telling you if you weren't here if i was in the bed sick i wouldn't
