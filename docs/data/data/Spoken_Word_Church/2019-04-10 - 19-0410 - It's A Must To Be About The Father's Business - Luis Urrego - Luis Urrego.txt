uh when we got there the day we got there it snowed about five or six inches and uh and they said they they they had been about two or three weeks since they had gotten any snow of course they they had already were you go around they say I'm so tired of this snow that's what people tell you you know but then they had not gotten about two or three two or three weeks they had not it had not snowed even though it been cold temperatures and they said well you came from Georgia and you must have brought snow with you I said from where but at least I got to see some snow this year I had to go to Canada to see it cuz you sure didn't see it this year Harley so uh maybe some of you that live closer here to the mountains probably but not up there in brazzleton and those areas we didn't get anything so but it was nice and so we certainly enjoyed our the trip you know visiting my wife's family and seeing the little the the little baby that new family member that's come and uh she's healthy she's doing good and my sister-in-law she's doing good they're all doing doing good and uh I was able to uh I got to uh preach at brother John Dana church over there uh in Toronto and we really had a good time we had a we had a it was a blessing and uh I certainly think that the Lord you know uh he speaks you know you not knowing anything CU you don't go to the church that's right and he's he he speaks and for you know directly to needs that need to be met so we appreciate the Lord for doing that and so we certainly had a good time those people up there you know it's just majority of them are Africans so you know they're oh yeah they they love worship so you just you get along with you get along in there with you and you just get right on in amen there's no way for you to stay still but we had a good time and they all send greetings to you all amen praise the lord well let's uh let's go to the word this afternoon and uh I'm going to try my best not to keep you too long tonight but uh I have a little something I want to bring out and uh I hope that you enjoy it and that may get a blessing out of it amen amen so sometimes it's difficult for me to there's some messages you know that you just preach you'll preach but then some you know you just kind of wrestle with but uh I got this uh I just started thinking on this thought coming back from Canada I was listening to the seed is not air with a Shook and uh I just Lord just put this thought on my heart so you pray for me and see how the Lord how the Lord leads Amen in Luke chapter 2 verse 40 uh start at verse 40 it says and the child grew and waxed strong in spirit speaking of Jesus Christ filled with with wisdom and the grace of God was upon him now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the Feast of the past Passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus carried behind in Jerusalem and Joseph and his mother knew not of it am that's really strange that's their their child and they knew not where he was at and they knew that he wasn't just any child Mary knew what what because the angel came to her and told him this son is going to be conceived by the Holy Ghost it wasn't even wasn't even Joseph's uh uh son amen but they supposing him to have been in the company went a Day's Journey a Day's Journey and they sought him among their kins folk and acquaintance and when they found him not they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days so now we're about about four days here right cuz if it was a Day's Journey when they realized that that that they had lost him then it's a Day's Journey going back to Jerusalem and then they got to Jerusalem they couldn't find him then 3 days later they found him and after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why H has thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee Sorrowing and he said unto them how is it that you sought me wish ye not that I must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them and he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these saying in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man praise the lord lord add a blessing to the reading of the word let's just pray before we get seated our heavenly father we thank you Lord Jesus for this for the word Lord that you uh allowed us to read tonight father now Lord I just give myself father God to you Lord that you speak father God what needs to be spoken and Lord you say father God the things that need to be said Lord to edify the body of Christ Lord and to bring you glory and honor father God I'm subject to you lord I can't do nothing unless you you're the one that does it father and so Lord I ask father that you would just also be in in our midst and meet every need amongst us and we commit the service into your hands open our ears of our understanding that we may understand your word this evening in Jesus Christ Christ's name we pray amen you may be seated tonight praise the Lord amen I just want to title this if I give it a title it's a must to be about the father's business it's a must because it's what Jesus said I must be about my father's business right amen and so we see here that in in in starting here at verse 42 that that Jesus was 12 years old very young amen and I have a 12-year-old daughter and and I can imagine you know how you know Jesus at that age was already growing and and had a certain knowledge because remember he came amen he came uh he came already he was the Messiah amen H but we know that he he he was anointed amen at the River Jordan amen but he was God the whole time amen and so we see here that at 12 years old he was already manifesting this to the people amen even to his parents and it says here in verse 42 and when he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem after the custom of the feast in other words they went to church amen that's right and they took their children to church too you see and they took Jesus to church amen they they were there doing exactly what they what needed what what they needed to do amen amen and um and so in verse 43 it says and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the Child Jesus J carried behind in Jerusalem amen and Joseph and his mother knew not where uh knew not of it amen praise the lord it's it astonishes me that they didn't realize that what at one moment Jesus was with them and then in the next moment it wasn't with him no that's right and so we we we see because in the next verse we see that they were trying to search with him because what happened during that time and I'll show you a map here in just a moment but during that time people would travel long ways in in almost like Caravans and the reason why they would do that was because there were so many thieves and so many robbers and so many people that would want to hurt if you traveled individually you might get robbed you might you might get you know a lady might get raped or something you know something wrong would happen but if they would travel uh in in a caravan right we hear that word a lot nowadays a caravan amongst amongst a group of people then the people would feel much safer so it must have been a lot of people that were traveling with them because they were traveling with uh maybe Joseph's and maybe Mary's family members they were all going to Jerusalem to partake of of the feast and so all of a sudden they did what they did needed to do in Jerusalem and as they were traveling back to Nazareth they traveled the whole day and Jesus was not around so Joseph and Mary started looking for him amen their son started looking for him and sometimes Saints I wonder if if uh if they if they could do that with with Jesus amen how much how much sometimes are our our own children if we don't pay attention to what's going on in their lives right amen right sometimes if we don't if we're not if we're not involved in our in our in our children's lives right they're lost and you don't even realize it because you're consumed by what by by by by your own goal oh yeah you have a goal in mind oh my children are fine but you don't realize something Satan might be working behind the scenes you think everything is fine and dandy but Satan might be working behind the scenes right and so they started looking for Jesus amongst their kin folks and amongst their acquaintance looking among the Caravan where is Jesus where is he have you seen him isn't he I thought I thought I thought when we left he was right there walking behind you well he was but then all of a sudden he's not yeah well so they they they were searching they were probably got frantic so frantic that they the Bible says that they return back to Jerusalem to look for him right righten amen praise the Lord so just moving along amen so we see here that when they got to Jerusalem that after 3 days amen after three days they found him in the temple right right amen sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions right amen now I like that because you know Jesus wasn't just there just just just to talk to them amen he wasn't just there just wanting to give every you know he's the one who's got I'm I'm God so you got to listen to me no he was there asking questions and listening right amen praise God and you know what Saints if you want people to listen to you you listen to them right you want people to respect you and to listen to you listen to them amen but sometimes we're so stuck on our word and what you know and we don't let nobody else say anything while we're while we're talking with them you know and and and and it's just it's just what I what I think and then when it's time for us to give uh what we want to say well you can't because they're overriding you but Jesus that wasn't Jesus right Jesus was right here he was listening and asking questions amen but of course the Bible says here in verse 47 and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers which must have me meant that he was also being asked questions and he was giving them them answers right praise the Lord that's right now going back to verse 45 and they found him uh back to verse 45 and when they found him not when they were amongst their the the looking amongst their kin folks they turned back again to Jerusalem seeking him amen I wonder sometimes saints that if you know uh uh uh with our own with our own children or with our own you know we've given them to the Lord you know we've we've committed them to the Lord this just goes for all all of our parent all the parents you know including me because Saints you know I'm I'm not if my if my children they don't have their own experience with God I can't I can't I can't lead them I I can lead them up to a certain point but they have to have their own experience with God Amen but don't think because they come to Lula that they're going to just automatically get the Holy Ghost or because they go to a to a to a youth camp that that's it you know God's going to I I I I am for anything that will help them get closer to God God Amen youth camps including everything you see bring them to church amen do whatever you need to do amen but it's ultimately up to them to serve the Lord and make that decision you can't make that decision for them and you can't be their Holy Ghost the the rest of their life amen sometimes sometimes we we we we get so so comfortable in our ways and and and forget that our children need God right amen our children need the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their life that they need a new birth just like you and I had to get a new birth amen oh my here comes brother Luis again oh we were so it was fine when brother Dell and brother Wade we were But Here Comes brother Luis now oh I got to preach whatever God puts in my heart right amen so it's uh it's our responsibility I was telling the church up there saints that you know God has given us the responsibility of our children you see he's given them to us right to nurture them to take care of them to train them in the way that they should go and God you're going to answer to God if you don't that's right if you don't train them in the ways of the Bible if you don't train them in the ways of the word you're going to have to answer for that right right amen but if you've done everything you could and they still go astray then that's between them and God you see that's between them and God they'll have to answer for that amen so I'm not saying here that nothing like that would ever happen to my to my daughters it could but I'm just putting them in the hands of God and that's all we can do as parents and do everything we can on our part to help them grow in in in in in in God Amen to let you know get them involved in things that that that would help them grow in the Lord amen you see what I'm saying I said last time I said you know brother Joe I appreciate what he's doing with these tape quizzes right that's awesome but really really how many how many of you are really involved doing these tape quizzes with your children amen so it's up to you Saints to to realize and to understand what are your kids in involved amen right because I because God gave them to us and so oh well I I got to give them their space I I got to give them their their their time you know their space and and and they have to have you know you know what as long as they're living in your house Saints yeah you do what I do here what I do here and if you don't like it you go find your own place if you can that's right if you can because I'm the one who has to answer for you amen before God you see you go astray because of me no no you're not going astray because of me amen you go astray because you want to go astray right but as long as you're here amongst our home amen you're going to do what the things that we do at our home right amen that's the then that's the way it should go because Saints we've gone Satan's gone to one extreme right he's gone to the he's gone to the Other Extreme and we are we need to go to the Other Extreme amen right Amen in order to protect our children amen the most that we can praise God Amen and so let's just continue reading here and when they saw him in verse 48 and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why H has thou thus dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee Sorrowing amen um the brother brother Joe if you could or some whoever's back there can can you bring up the map that and you apologize Saints I'm going back and forth different things but I just want you to get a visual to show you how long Nazareth is from Jerusalem here's Nazareth this is where they started from and this is Jerusalem right down here now the Bible said now according to Google Maps that's about 95 and a half miles and it's in car you can get there in about an hour and 45 minutes but they didn't have cars back then obviously so you see they had to go through mountains and really from the things that I was reading a lot of them they they avoided they would avoid going through Samaria because they didn't they didn't want to have anything to do with the Samaritans so they would take long ways to get to uh usually around this route to get to Jerusalem so that's the reason why the Bible says that they had already went a day Journey so really probably they might have traveled even longer than than a than a day I don't know maybe a Day's Journey uh walking and riding on on on on donkeys could have been just right here to Ephraim you see so they they traveled a long way but a Day's Journey they traveled and they had left Jesus behind I wonder how many sometimes Saints if we're traveling on this road and we and we forget that we left Jesus behind brother traveling on this uh you know to our goal our goal is heaven right our goal is to be like Christ am our goal is to be more like this word am and we forget the the the basics of this word amen the the the things that that really matter because we get so consumed with everything else and I'll get consumed with the things that really matter that's going to help us grow and and one of those things is coming to church amen one of those things is coming to church every day I mean every you come to church every day that'd be great but but whenever these Church doors are open how are you going to grow in Christ Prophet said read the Bible and pray every day right amen listen to the word praise God not just not just one day out one day out of the year amen but every every single day be engaged in the word Brothers can turn that off amen so 92 and2 miles that they traveled amen so we see here that Jesus even as a child as a child he was putting a higher priority in his father's business right over his even over his mom and dad's business now that doesn't mean that that he didn't obey them and he didn't respect them because we see there in later on in scriptures that he he obeyed them in in in everything he was subject to them right but he had something to do there in Jerusalem right that he needed to stay back and listen and and and be there to what to be about his father's business right amen now his father wasn't Joseph right his father was Goden the Holy Ghost right amen amen praise God glory and so we need to understand Saints what is the father's business amen right because whatever the father's business is that must mean that that's his will right right amen whatever the father's business is that must mean that that's his will and what is his will is his word right amen so when you are involved in the father's business that means you must be for you must must be involved in something having to do with the word amen and that's all Jesus cared about even at 12 years old all about fulfilling the father's business right well you say well I'm not when I get to be 16 years old I'll I'll be about my father's business no oh well Jesus did that at 12 years old because he was God you've been trained properly yeah you know better better and like I said before I know I've been around young people and I know young people who have said the exact same thing oh yeah I'll serve God later and two years later they were in a jail cell right I know that's for a fat y they were in a jail cell and in the jail cell they they they said they said I you know now okay you were right the whole time or my parents were right the whole time and it was too late then yeah you see don't wait to that young young people don't wait till you commit some atrocity in your life or something happens to you for you to go serve God right amen you need to serve God now while he while he can still be found amen well he can still yet be found you are you're you're alive and you're breathing and you're here because God of his because of God's mercy and Grace on you amen it's because you have something to fulfill y you have something to do Jesus at 12 years old he was in the father's business amen so at 12 years old amen I believe a kid can be in the father's business as well amen amen obviously we can't push them amen but we can train them in the way they should go right exactly amen praise the Lord and create and and allow those atmospheres for them to be in those atmospheres that will help them to be in the father's business right amen so in order for you to be able to uh uh partake in the father's business or to be able to tell others about the father's business uh you know let's like let's say for example you were trying to sell a product you know and uh and you're trying to sell it to the people and you're trying to tell them how great this product is and oh it's wonderful TR try it but you have never tried it yourself yeah come on brother amen how in the world are you going to be uh uh um how are you going to uh uh let them realize that this product is wonderful if you have never tried the product yourself amen you need to test him for yourself amen you as a parent need to test God for yourself amen before you can say well you know I I've I've I've preached in different churches and and you see reactions and you say something and you're you're going a certain line and all of a sudden you see a a a mom or or a father I was on they look over at their child yeah oh yeah and the child and and yeah and and you know that they LED them to that place wherever whatever it is there it was their fault that they're in that position the parents fault it wasn't their fault but they're over there looking at them yeah it happened to me this past Sunday and you and you're like my goodness and and you know it was that's what brother Brown said it's parent delinquency parent delinquency it's what US parents lack to do we we we we we we're not involved with with the word like we should but we expect our children to see how can you tell them about the product when you haven't even tried the product yourself that's right how can you tell them that you must be about the father's business when you haven't you're not even in the father's business at all amen praise the Lord so again we know that the father's business is his will amen and his will glory is his word amen right now Jesus said uh to his disciples in in John chapter 20 in verse vers 21 he says as the father sent me so send I you amen and um I want to stay with this thought you know about the father's business but I want to switch gears here just a moment I just wanted to encourage the parents there for just for just a moment just taking that story but I want to stay within the same story but I want to I want to address something amen because Saints we're living in an hour that uh uh it's a Sly the spirit that that is creeping in amen it's very Sly Amen in this hour you know we live in the in the age of the pel horse rider right and he's mixed and you don't know what's what and what's what you know it's hard to decipher you see it's a very difficult thing in this hour and that's the reason why people are going straight I you know if you knew some of the things that I've that I've that I've uh that I've realized and and and that I've come to find out uh people are just just dying spiritually like flies and people that you don't think that that that would that would go certain directions and and yet they're in that that's right yeah and uh and so I was talking to a brother up in Canada and he he was telling me how you know he he he a he was an African brother and uh he lived in in in Hong Kong for a while and and uh he told me he was telling me how there's some there there's I thought that there was only just one church over there which was brother Ro's church but apparently he said that there was there was other there was two other churches there but but they were churches they were uh churches that uh they were tape churches and so and so wherever wherever I go you know there's there seems like it seems like you know churches that seem to be established yeah now going to a certain direction they don't they don't go to they don't go to church anymore and so it's a very sight spirit in this hour saints that is is not only it's say Saints it's attacking the messag in the name of the messag it's exactly what it's doing amen yeah and uh you know and I the Saints I'm not here to attack individuals and that's not what that's not my purpose and I'm you know I'm not here no name calling or anything like that but I'm here to attack spirits and expose Spirits amen and uh because Saints this is right now it seems to me that this is probably one of the most prevalent Spirit that's going on right now you know doctrines that have come and gone from the 70s and the 80s and brother Dale you've you you've you've experienced some of these things um they've come in gone yeah you don't hear much about you know Thunders and and the Thunder movement and all these different things now it's it's about just staying with the tapes staying with the tapes and I hope I'm not overstepping my boundaries but I want to get I want to I want I want to make a point amen amen that I believe I believe in staying with the tapes I believe in in in in listening to the tapes amen amen cuz that's the message amen praise God and one of the things that they seem they seem to to to to use as a quote in in the church age book I believe it's in the sardan age where brother randam talks about that every a uh that at the last day the messenger came in the last day to restore back everything that the that the five-fold ministry had gone astray in and and uh and that that that restoration you know that that that meant that that needed for us to stay just exclusively with the with with with the tapes but say I you know if it was a complete restoration back to the word and if it was a complete restoration back to what Paul preached Paul believed in preaching so he believed in preaching and so and so that's the reason if it was a restoration back to the word of God Amen it wasn't a restoration to do something that's that's outside of the word of God amen no praise the Lord amen so it's a SL it's a Sly spirit in this hour and you know the Bible says saints that in this in this day there they would they would kill you yep thinking that they're doing God a service amen that's not the Catholic church in this hour that's not a Baptist and that's not a Pentecostal no I believe it's within the same same ranks am and you and you don't believe me you go to YouTube you go to uh some of these websites and they just attacking churches that have a five-fold Ministry like like it's gone out of style yeah like it's gone out of style it's it's incredible to me but we see that all it is Saints here we are here we see people leaving the message right saying that that brother Brandon was not a prophet and that and that he's uh you know false and all these things uh attacking the message yeah but then here's another group that try staying saying with the message but yet attacking it at the same time because that's not what brother Brandon preached completely misconstruing quotes to fit their own agendas man yes so to me it takes away from the scriptures am you have to get away from the scriptures in order for you to believe a certain thing like that that's right you you have to you have to deny certain scriptures one of the scriptures I'm going to say right now is 1 Timothy chap 2 verse one amen if they want to bring that up this is Paul speaking to Timothy thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Christ Jesus and the things that thou Hast heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to Faithful Men amen who shall be able to teach others also amen right so Paul was saying in other words Paul was saying whatever I'm preaching Timothy I want you to go uh commit uh these things to Faithful Men to faithful witnesses to preach these same things that I was preaching y right and obviously they didn't have any tapes back then so they couldn't play what Paul was saying it was for them to go out and preach the word and teach the word right who shall be able to teach others also thou therefore endure hardness as good soldier of Jesus Christ no man that worth entangleth himself with the Affairs of this life that he may please him who ha chosen him to be a soldier so Saints one that's really Waring for the Lord in other words he's in the father's business doesn't entangle himself with things like this amen doesn't entangle himself with the things of this world Amen you know I respect you more if you say I don't believe this message anymore and you just go out and don't serve the Lord anymore that's right but when you come and you and you come against this message and that 24/7 that's all you do online yeah I I guess you you have you have nothing else to do that's right you must live a pretty boring life yeah amen amen and that's what some of these people do but saints that is that is the spirit of this hour that's attacking the the the message amen that's attacking the word of God coming from this Ang from this side people leaving the word and saying oh because of preachers such and such they uh I I got I got uh my mom was beat up and I got beat up and and and and this this and that and the other but then here's on this side because of preachers such and such we have to stay home and just listen to tapes it's the same Spirit that's right it's the same Spirit just working in different angles one of them just has more of a smile that's right the other one just has more of a grading of the tea oh yeah that's right brother amen that's right look what brother brandom says here in the in the message we would see Jesus they would bring that up that we you know saints that like I said we're not we're we don't fight these web you know do doctrines anymore and the and these things that you know but this is the thing right now that that's that's prevalent in this hour and and Saints it sounds so good it sounds so enticing oh yeah oh yeah that's that's that's right yeah I could just stay at home and just I go to church I could just hit play man that's what leads to it leads to laziness that's right amen now let's see what he did let's follow his ministry just a few moments we find him the first thing after John had baptized him the Holy Spirit coming from heaven and descending upon him and remaining in him John said upon whom Thou shalt see the spirit descending and remain he is the one that will baptize with the Holy Ghost and now notice we find immediately after his temptation he went straight to the father's business exactly what was the business preaching the gospel and Healing The Sick amen if any day any age right amen that now that's just one of the the the the one some of the ones that I got here amen if they if they go question and answers on Hebrews next one I appreciate them I I gave them these these things and and I didn't give them in in the in the outline that that that we usually give him so brother Joe I appreciate he's always he always has my back all of our back father it is noted that when you were 12 years old you were found in the temple with the scribes and the sages discussing with them the scriptures and they were they were astonished at a man of old and well-trained in the scriptures and yet see a little boy of about 12 years old could just confounding in the in the explaining of the scriptures you was about your father's business right that's right again he he he he he's he's he's referring to the explaining of the scriptures right amen amen because Saints as I said before I you know I've traveled different parts of the world and people have the same message that you do but they some they don't they don't understand it the same way that that maybe God has revealed it to you why because they don't have somebody there to explain it to them to teach it to them sir and maybe the pastor or the the minister uh has gotten up to a certain Revelation and that's as far as they can they can go and maybe maybe some maybe uh God sent you or God sent brother Wade to go to the Philippines Amen to bring certain things out that helped amen that's that's what a minister does is to take the the scale out out of our eyes amen so that we can see the scriptures better that's right but taking the word of God that brother Brandon preached amen taking the message Amen to them and just opening that up a bit more to them amen but you can't give him the Revelation I can't reveal nothing to you neither can brother Dale nobody can reveal anything to you it has to take God to reveal it to you amen through the explaining of the scriptures amen praise God Amen so we see here saints that um you turn that off for just a moment now we know that that when the angel Gabriel came to came to Mary and we know that he was the messenger right Angel uh came to Mary and to give her the message the word for that day right amen of what she needed to to to hear amen and uh neither the angel messenger nor the message he gave her could do nothing for her unless she believed it y she had to receive it amen exactly and believe it even though she couldn't explain it yeah that's right now remember she said to him how can this be sin that I know not a man she she did question it and she had all the right to because that had never happened before amen it wasn't anywhere in the Scripture it was only in the Old Testament as a prophecy but they the describes and the Pharisees and all of them that they couldn't they couldn't explain it and so she questioned and said how can this be I've not not been a man and so the angel proceeds to explain to her that the Holy Ghost will overshadowed you amen and that that Holy thing that is to be that is to be birthed in you amen is of the Holy Ghost amen praise the Lord so we see there we see there that that messenger came and gave her amen the message amen she had to have faith in it and accept it the way it was brought right right amen right and I totally agree that we need to accept and receive the way the message was brought to us amen yes sir amen I I I believe it with all my heart amen but that doesn't the message doesn't go override the Bible amen it goes along with the Bible you can't say I believe the message and then and then it's in some way or another it's overriding the Bible it can't amen and that's what's happening in this hour the the people preaching these things or preaching saying these things or admonishing the people of these things it's what they're saying you you've got to override the Bible in order to believe that way right brother you because that is not what brother brandham taught no it's not amen it's not what brother brandham taught no that you know the tapes only and and and and that's it and and that the five-fold ministry has there's no use for the fful ministry then you just like brother Dale I said before let's just take that page out of the Bible let's just take that out of the Bible because it doesn't need to be there there's no use for the fal Ministry anymore let's close up and let's just go home yeah why but you can you know there's lemonade at your house and you can sit back and let's just listen to a tape you don't need to be here amen but now Saints when the seed was placed uh in Mary by God which is the Holy Ghost the scripture I'm trying to go slow so that we can get what I'm saying we know that brother bam spoke about Mary being the carrier of that seed amen she carried that that that that that son in her amen and in this hour of saints amen there's a bride that is to give birth to the son amen this bride is carrying the son amen that has been that that that God has placed in her amen by the by the Holy Ghost amen and it has to come through the word of God Amen again I cannot give you a revelation brother Dale brother Wade brother Bob brother Aaron nobody can give you a revelation no man it has to be God himself to give the Revelation and even not even brother brandham can give you a revelation through through the tapes that's the reason why the people out there amen they listen to the message but some things they cannot explain but then here comes a brother that God has given him some uh uh some some I guess some light into the into the word taking the message amen right and shed and they can shed some light to the people amen and yet we don't want that to go out to the people that really need it right no just you you don't need that just stay home and listen to the tapes so that son Saints it was being formed in her right just as the son is being formed in this bride today amen now I want you to look at this amen because she she get she she was pregnant with the word right right she's pregnant with the word absolutely now Joseph the Bible says that Joseph was going to was going to tell her uh you know I I don't want to live with you I I don't want to marry you right right but if it wasn't for a dream that and a that that God gave him amen he was going to he was going to uh uh uh uh privately let her go that's right amen not to make an example of her Amen to the public so Joseph he continued and stayed with her married her and everything right right now Joseph amen obviously and you just think about this obviously Mary had to tell Joseph what the angel had told her her right sure exactly and so just as much as Mary had to believe that Joseph had to believe that as well especially if it was part of the word amen exactly right if it was part of the word my yeah because I Joseph knows I didn't have anything to do with it right you see amen so he had to also believe it supernaturally as well that it was a Supernatural event that had taken place in his wife's uh uh body amen and so here they go and it's almost time they go to to get to get taxed and so she Joseph had to nurture her had to help her that's right had to had to minister to her there you go Amen on brother just as much as I had to do it when my wife was pregnant yeah yeah that's right I don't think he just kind of you just let he just left her you know and didn't didn't you just f for your own no because the Bible says that when they were traveling to go get taxed she was on top of a beast right that represented to me represents the Holy Ghost Joseph pulling her Joseph wasn't doing the Joseph was not the one doing the work she was riding on top of that Beast amen but it was the Beast that was had the power to carry her amen where she needed to go all Joseph was doing was just kind of stir leading her to where she needed to go right pregnant with this with this word of God amen amen right now we know that brother brandom spoke about the same thing this almost the same thing when he spoke about Rebecca when elzer came to her right and he said listen uh you want to go meet Isaac and she said yes I do so she got on top of the camel and brother Brown mentions this and says that represented the holy spirit that power amen eler all he was there was just guiding the the the the the the the bride that was on top of the camel guiding it to to take her to Isaac amen but he was not doing the work it was the camel the the Beast that was actually doing the he the heavy work amen and it's the Holy Ghost in you in this hour that's doing the heavy work amen right but there needs to be a minister in the in the midst right not just one minister right it's a five-fold Ministry amen amen amen so there was Mary she needed to be ministered too she needed to be encouraged because sometimes I'm sure as you s some of you sisters who have who have had children have gotten to a point like I don't know if I could have this baby or not oh God help help me oh help me and Joseph had to be right there Listen sweetheart listen honey you can do it amen remember what the what the angel said the the word of God says this and you are the one to fulfill this you are the one to come to this position to give birth to this son right isn't that what the fful ministry is doing in this hour amen amen we're not adding anything to the word or anything to the message we're just complimenting to out make you uh uh uh bring the message to you to remember amen praise God so if we were if we are doing this amen why are we being attacked yeah just because some some ministers some preachers went astray and and took five wives and and did this and did that that doesn't mean that all the ministers are like that there's some bad apples that's right that but that doesn't doesn't mean but they're still good apples amen that that that that doesn't mean that the whole batch you just need to throw away the whole batch amen because that means you just have to throw away the word of God you know there's things in the word of God that talk about about the ministry amen that's right praise the Lord so let's let's look at Luke chapter 2 verse 48 amen we we already read this or just go back brother Joe this is the beginning the the the scripture at the beginning I'll just read it and he'll pull it up and he says and when they saw him they were amazed this is going back to the story of when Jesus was being sought after their mom and dad and his Mo and his mother said unto him son why H has thou dealt with us Behold thy father and I have sought thee Sorrowing now here is Mary saying that Joseph was Jesus's father yeah now think about this Mary Mary it went through what she did the angel spoke to her Joseph know what what what the angel said but here's here's Mary saying or or or or proclaiming that Joseph was her father and so Jesus says and he said unto them how is it that ye sought me Wiis ye not that I must be about my father's business amen and so that's how the Mary of today which is the bride of Christ Saints who is supposed to know that the father of Jesus Christ is Jehovah God Amen the Holy Spirit amen and that her father is Jesus Christ a husband amen they are now looking for another father they they know who the father is now they're looking for for for for somebody else to lead them along yeah knowing who the who who the father really is amen instead of staying with the leading of the holy spirit amen right through the message that God already gave us through the prophet amen right amen they're looking at somebody else they're looking at they're they're looking at at a Joseph to be in the father think about that Saints I'll let you I'll let you chew on that for a little while as as Mary knew who the real father was you see and now she's proclaiming here that that that that Joseph is the father now look what brother brandham says here in the message Shalom 1964 this is after the seals the brothers will bring it up notice how Mary is so wrong but his word is so perfect am yeah she said to him when she found him in the temple at 12 discussing with the theologians he astounded them as a 12-year-old boy not even in school or if it is we have no record of it but a 12-year-old lad confounding the sages in the temple at his wisdom she said thy father and I have sought thee with tears thy father the mother herself supposingly said thy father Joseph and I have sought thee with tears what did he say to her know ye not that I must be about my father's business if he had been about Joseph's business he'd have been making houses or in a carpenter shop but he wasn't Joseph's son amen I about my father's business correcting these denominations and Creeds and things I hear of and let me tell you saints that these things are going on today is just as much denomination amen that's right as any other denomination yes yes abolutely if you say if you say just do this and that's it that's a denomination to me brother see I'm about my father's business he never admitted Joseph was his father but Mary did and he turned back around and straightened her out she said your father and I have sought you he said I'm about my father's business business showing Joseph wasn't his father am his words are perfect see but Mary and them listen to this but Mary and them just presuming that well see what it was she got carried away I believe that's what's happening in this hour yeah people are getting carried away with the spirit of the hour right man and if you're not careful Saints you'll be right there with that oh yeah you're right don't need Ephesians chapter 5 why is that in the Bible and Mary was was the whole time believing and walking and and believing that the right thing all of a sudden things changed well see what it was she got carried away she got she wanted to show before these priests and things that that she wasn't the type of woman in other words uh that she that she she didn't begot Jesus you know in a in a out of wedlock and she endured doing that she absolutely tore the foundation out from under her testimony after she had testified that an angel had come to her and said Thou shalt conceive and bear a son knowing no man a virgin born son and here before the high Sanhedrin she says Jose of your father here and I have sought you and that 12-year-old boy said I'm about my father's business he rebuked her that isn't my father right that's right keep going see the church today carried away with counsels and things of the world now she's blacked out and God is rebuking her exactly believe that amen now I believe God there I believe in every denomination and in every movement and every God has children of God Amen I'm not saying that people who who believe this way are lost or nothing like that right amen may may be going through a phase amen but it's it's it's it's interesting amen that that they are believing in and and saying these things in the name of the message oh yeah completely distorting what the me what the messenger said right amen amen and call and saying that I guess the call that brother Dale received in his life and that brother Wade received it I guess it's fake [Laughter] then the minister that have that have they preaching this word the pastors that are that are preaching word around the world I guess that's not a real call and then we should only just listen to one man and look up North but you know what Saints I I I I'm I'm I'm totally against that amen because that's not that's not Bible based whatsoever and that's not what brother Brandon preached that's right that's that now there's even splits among them there's even splits among them well should should we play the tape that they're playing up there or should we listen to our own thing you know all these things now yeah must stay with the word of God am stay with the message amen come back to the message come back to the word amen the pure word amen praise God Amen in the message God's word calls for a total separation from unbelief they want to pull that up brother Bram says here as I said last night of Jesus when he was only 12 years old and being a mistake of his mother who is claimed by people to be the mother of God and how that the woman said why thy father I have sought thee with tears and quickly he being the word said knowest thou not that I must be about my father's business see she was was declaring him to be Joseph's son but he wasn't Joseph's son if he'd been Joseph's son he'd been with him that's right but he was his but but he was with the father about his business so the word is always corrective and always right amen it says the word he said the word is always corrective and always right amen I don't care who it is that's right it's always the word is always right amen amen and the word will correct every wrong always am yes sir amen I believe that's that's wrong amen I don't I don't believe that to be correct it's a spirit it's a spirit that that again it's taking the people away from the from the EST from the foundational things of the word of God and Paul was completely for ministers amen preaching yeah but that gospel is taking that away from the people oh yeah it's it's taking it away from the people I agree that there's bad apples in the batch yeah I totally do but there's good apples too amen that we need to listen to amen that we should listen to amen now we know in Revelations chapter 10 I want you to look at this we're almost finished Revelations chap 10 verse verse 7 we start at verse 7 no actually verse eight start at verse eight but we'll read verse 7 here in just a moment I want you to notice something here and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the earth I want you to pay attention to that because that angel is the angel that was in verse one that's right corre in verse one if you read the ver verse one it says the I saw another Mighty Angel come down amen with a open book amen and we know that that was Christ the message declares that that was Christ brother brandham said that that was Christ amen that wasn't that wasn't brother Brandon no that was Christ now we know that that that that later on in verse 7 as we read as we read as we read there we we're very familiar with this scripture in verse 7 we know what it says but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel right but now let's read here in verse 9 Revelation 109 and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me he said unto me take it and eat it up you take it and eat it up he said said unto me who is that he it wasn't it wasn't Revelation 10:7 that wasn't that he no it was that Mighty Angel right still speaking to John and we know that John brother Brown said John represents the bride amen amen speaking to John in verse n go back back down to verse 8 and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again and said go take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book it's almost like you know he told him to take the book but then a angel uh John interpreted as oh I got to go ask for the book it's almost kind of like what we do yeah he tells us to take the book do what you need to do with the word take the word take all the word in but we we just kind of beg for the word yeah that's what John did gave me the little book and he said unto me that same voice take it and eat it up and it shall make thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand that's correct who who what Angel is that the mighty Angel and ate it up amen was the book that was open in his hand wasn't open in the in the Angel's hand of Revelation 10:7 cuz he couldn't have opened it it had to be that the uh that the mighty angel had already opened it and given it to the the angel of Revelation 10:7 right and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was bitter now watch verse 11 now it it it's so interesting that this is verse 11 the 11th Hour workers and he said unto me he said unto me he the mighty the angel said unto me John who represents the bride amen thou must prophesy again before many peoples why did he not say and he said unto me in the voice of the in the days of the voice of the seventh angel shall prophesy again but it doesn't say that does it no it does no amen says and he said unto me thou must Pro prophesy again before many peoples and Nations and tongues and Kings amen so there is a work that you and I need to do in this hour saints that to me that's the bride of Christ amen but that's after they've taken the book and eaten the book that's right amen that's not going out and do anything on your own it's not your own thing it's doing what the book amen amen says to do praise God Amen and so saints that that is the father's business in this hour amen that is the father's business as it was in the father's business in the day of Jesus when he was 12 years old there at the temple telling Mary and Joseph to do what they were doing I must be about my father's business then you and I must be about the father's business in this hour must be about the father's business right amen to me that's a business to do go prophesy to Kings and Nations amen now now I want I want you to to to to look at what that word prophesy means brother brother Joe if you could if you could bring that meaning up it's the word in in Greek it's day it says it is necessary there is need of it behooves is right and proper right necessity lying in the nature of the case necessity in reference to what is required to attain in some end it's a necessity you must a necessity of Law and command of Duty Equity necessity established by the councel and decree of God especially by that purpose of his which relates to the Salvation of Man by the intervention of Christ and which is disclosed in the Old Testament prophecies now we know that in the Old Testament there's prophecies in Daniel if you read in Daniel about the saints that taken that taken the you can read that I believe it's in Daniel 11 so the prophecies are there amen now somebody's got to go and fulfill Revelations 10:11 right somebody got to do it because otherwise then then that's just there just to just just for fluff and that doesn't make sense amen and it didn't say that that that angel that spoke to John was the angel of Revelations 10:7 and neither that what that angel said was what was uh uh was that the uh uh you know of what the what the re what the angel of Revelation 107 was to do was to happen again he did his part Revelation 10:7 did his part amen now the bride's got to go do her part amen amen amen you and I have a part to fulfill in this hour amen praise God and the Bible clearly says amen through the ministry of Apostles prophets pastors teachers amen for what for the Perfection of the Saints amen until we all come to the Unity of Christ amen amen praise the Lord Jesus amen now I'll finish with this brother brandom said this in the message the seed is not air with the Shu and this is what this is where I got inspired to preach this amen you love the Lord amen amen I'm not mad at anybody I'm just mad at Satan that's right amen right amen I love the people amen and whatever I can do to help them I I I want to I want to help them you know but the word always rebukes the error amen the word always rebukes where there is error it has to be rebuked yes amen it has to be it has to it has to be exposed yeah amen amen notice there will be no more carrier mother churches denominations after this carry Shu right there's nothing after this right amen because after the Shu there is no more nothing left by then but just the grain that's right is that right it's got to be the grain I want you to pay attention to the Saints don't fall asleep on them we're almost done it's got to be the same kind that went into the ground Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a Spirit come upon on the bride right to do the same things that he did exactly right amen the grain the original grain that grain is reproducing see it's the reproducing again of the grain righten the word yet young let's scroll it up the word yet young spake for itself and know and know not that I must be about my father's business huh he says there is the secret of the message now just exactly the father's business what is the father's business could you think of what the father's business was in him to fulfill what Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive scroll it up fulfill what Isaiah said again fulfill what Isaiah said again the lame shall leap like a heart right and all these things would take place like Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet among you like unto me it was the father's business to fulfill that word that's right well if that come down through them stalks of them Natural Women what about these stalks of these Spiritual Church women churches means women women means churches rather is that right then what is it now we must be about the father's business the wheat would cry back the grain yes sir what must it do vindicate Malachi 4 amen vindicate Luke 17:30 vindicate Hebrews 138 vindicate St John 14:12 vindicate all of his word all of his word vindicate Hebrews I mean Revelation the 10th chapter of the opening of The Seven Seals and the mysteries of God even to serpent seed and all would be manifested marriage and divorce and all these other Mysteries that's been hid under the pillars for all these years from the theologians and so forth but it's now the hour that's the father's business exactly right now is the hour and Saints to vindicate because Saints what brother we are vindicating what brother Brandon preached amen exctly I mean we are the manifestation of what brother Brandon preached we are the manifestation of what God wrote in the word about us in Revelation 1011 Revelation 101 is right here amongst his bride we are the Vindication of that word amen that's right so brother brandham is saying vindicating all these things oh well brother brandham did that you know Malachi 4 and all these things I I I believe that but what about the rest of the word right amen what about Revelations 10:11 who's going to vindicate that it can't be brother brandom coming back no no thou must prophesy again just as Jesus said I must be about my father's business you must be about the father's business think they would receive it they want to be dignified and say our denomination don't teach us that but the Bible does amen that's right God vindicates it to be true sure it is fulfill in this age when the Seven Seals are just proven the denominations has just been carried that's another one of the father's business to prove and the father's business now is to show you that them denominations is not his there are man-made systems that deny the word right amen again you have in order to accept something like that you have to deny the word that's right right Amen to accept something like that you have to deny the word you have to go over the word and and and take out certain scriptures of the Bible Amen to to say that we don't need preachers anymore that's right amen that that's that you know and in one place brother Brandon says no mechanical devices is going to can can can take you amen nothing like that it has to be the holy spirit it's it's the holy spirit in this bride that's moving this bride in this hour amen yes amen and and and so much is going on and and I'm just I I just wanted to just put that out there Saints to for you just to be careful in this hour amen yeah because wherever I wherever I go I've been to several countries and you hear the exact same thing well brother such and such they were they were a powerful Ministry they had ministers and everything like that and now they just sit around and play tapes yeah and you don't you don't hear from them like you're you're not invited by them to to go minister to them no right but at one point they they they were for the ministering of the word and then all of a sudden that changed I don't you know again you have to leave the word of God in order for you to go that way amen I'm sorry amen but so Saints we we must be about our father's business in this hour that is the father's business in this hour it's for us the bride of Christ to fulfill the word of God in this hour amen again brother brandom did his part y you and I are here that we must do our part Saints there's a part that you and I must fulfill amen right amen find the part that you need to fulfill amen that's right stay in the word amen stay in the message because the message and the word are the same thing amen no nothing different nothing separate it's the exact same thing amen every time I put on a tape and listen to brother brandom I always get I always get uh it draws me closer to Jesus Christ and it should not draw you you to some other man should not even draw you to brother brandom himself right it should draw you to Jesus Christ and I wholly believe that that's what brother brandom's intentions were brother brandom's know look the first time I even heard the message it was it was in Colombia South America I opened the book the the the the message uh uh Jesus Christ is the mystery of God revealed and I was reading it in Spanish and this is it wasn't in English I KN I knew how to speak English but I mean I was reading in Spanish and just reading that that message I was I was saying something's different about this man speaking here and every single thing that I was going to was drawing me that I was reading it was drawing me as was closer to Jesus Christ not at one point I was still in the Baptist Church at the time not at one point was I thinking I need to go worship this man yeah or I need to go I need I need to uh you know no the whole time I was being led to Jesus Christ so I what is the spirit in this hour that oh that puts brother brandham up here in this way and the five-fold ministry down here what is that Spirit but then there's the other Spirit I've mentioned before that that that puts the fful ministry up here and brother brandom down here and I think that's wrong too right there has to be a balance Saints God is a god of balance God is a god of balance so it's not one over the other amen it's the word of God in the message amen and you are here to vindicate this word in this hour amen how many love the Lord tonight amen praise the Lord let's stand to our feet am amen let's sing this song we were made more than conquerors amen as the musicians come what page what page is that we were made more than conquerors where's that

apologize if if anything if anything like if he that I said uh you know if you took it in the wrong way or an offensive way that wasn't my intention but you know Saints uh you hear things like this and uh it just Rises something in you amen that uh that is almost as a warning to you all that uh you know be careful stay with the word stay with the message stay with what already been preached amen and uh you can't go wrong that way amen praise the Lord but the word of God amen is clear on what it says about them and and and and if you just if you go that other direction if you go that way you know you you just have you have to override the word of God there's just no way no way right well I don't like hearing that but that's the truth amen it's the truth in this hour we don't fight Flesh and Blood the Bible says the spirits and powers in the air amen right that are causing amen all these all these confusion and if it was of God it wouldn't be confusing right that's right amen that's right there's no there's no confusion in God the message is perfect so there's no confusion there amen praise God but why are we why are we you know these things bring confusion and desire Saints amen
