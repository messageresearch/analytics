========================================

the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversation in time past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of Wrath even at other but God who is rich in mercy for with his great love with his great love wherewith he loved us father God help me one more time - you're my body my mind and my spirit my soul to you God trust Lord that you would help me to get out of the way Lord now father in the name of Jesus Christ I they give you all my scrip for this service in Jesus Christ's holy name we pray amen god bless you you may be seated one moment praise God we thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening I just thank the Lord for I looked at I was hurry but say God formed man out of just utter earth and breathed into man and man became a living soul and I looked at the scripture then I find out here over here we find in in the book of all our you feed and to refine out here that that living soul right now that we see that God breathed into a man we looking at here the Bible say he walked according to the course of the world through the lusts of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the mind and out of flesh my title reels the atmosphere within the body and I took that title because I realized today we feel that we are fighting a battle on the outside but really we fighting from the inside how do we find out here that death when Paul was right in Ephesians he was not writing about something on the outside he did fulfilling that his are that of my the lust of the flesh every datum was in from the inside out so the atmosphere that we in war with it from the inside how do we you know today we come we said do you say well the devil made me do it Holly we're together first so how could the devil make you do it how do we need this damn baby from her he can't control of the mind and that's how you do it so I'm gonna take a like that uh everything within the body go say the rudest thing this earth that you live in this body that you live in I'll do it right now till you're born in the Spirit of God you are in Satan to

body back so our body is part of this earth as Satan is the god I deserve let me read a quotation not a future home to count a bag of I'm coming from in the future when we say Adam was to multiply and replenish the earth everywhere we should have been come on Lily with earth that never got sick earth that never had a headache your body shall be perfect without any old age Adam should have multiplied and the life that was on the inside of you should have been the same life that was Anatomy there's right no then he said that's right nor was after that that nor was that the new earth was

her if you get a change the word God do not dis score the planet Earth he only played discord atmosphere and all the demonic power the earth is a trying to have to be to God we will so we're gonna

for that which I do I like not for what ah what they're not that do I not but what I hate I mean I'll tell you what you don't love ladies I hate I find myself doing Harley you know you don't you know we read sometimes we get under a little pressure we tell a little white lie you think man I shouldn't have told it but really ain't a white lie but we make it look that way it sounds better if we can make it look like a little teeny teeny teeny life but when God look at it do the magnified it's just a lot same thing you know I bet I know some little teeny we were you say your preacher huh now I got to go to the Calvary like you teenie teenies we are so we be honey into a lady never to use ain't never told you I would you come to the altar right now captured all right there so we can get that spirit of you how do we know the words you born - but I told myself my grandson is to be a lawyer he he he could've been in law school for two years and and then well and I told my wife I said big deal I needed him at to go to school to be a lawyer you were born a liar I guess you got to give papers belong here we are then then I do that which he said what I hate yeah birth 16 then I do that

body that was chosen is a fake right girl ha Louise a he's a it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth in me not up her home I said no you'll see it's right girl how do you see that dwelling in me I leave the 18 verse it says for I know that in me that is in my what my flesh and I take a bath in I used the best cologne don't take a bath for two days you'll find out how bad it is but here we are I don't care what you think and get rotten hellooo you never read he said he said so Danny my flood well him know what good day forward to willing is present but how to perform that which is good I finally not so there's no faith there's nothing you can do to save it you got to get born again from another realm Oh your holy word Oh your goodness are you a your own bread alone huh me and Wornall ahead and dress you like me I can like me that don't save you now we should do that cup with a whole do we should be present ourself it's Christmas but don't put your revelation I'm saving myself I wear dread I'd say myself I don't do this I don't do that that's all flip you saved by the grace of God how do you say by the Holy Ghost well first of May 19 okay forever with her for the good that I would I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do suppose it's the bottom it's a choice every day you go it's a war every time you wake up how do you got a better first day you wait I wish to say this on when I wake up in the morning first and I've got a battle Satan all day long in eight until your nitro it's the supernatural you fighting against he says now the 21st verse he said it he's uh I find that in I find that a law that when I would do what he was were you can't get away from it you cannot get away from it my prefer within watch what Paul says for I delight in the law of God I don't know what I'm happy for not something natural but the supernatural I mean I did light in the supernatural goddess in me so beginning to look here we think of your so you say brother why do I have trial why do I have tribulation Holly while walking I just live with life I'll do a perfect piece on the mountain and live in the millennium married a pervy husband called a purpose that we never had one battle but did your one we never had about he must be dead it's a tube in a way well if we think we're gonna find this perfect it Romeo a perfect Juliet to drop out of the sky you got the wrong revelation we all were only thing that perfect is the blood of Jesus Christ Holly but I'm gonna deal with a few things this morning I just even adjust to kind of waiting just to bring it to he who is that perfect God I'd be like in the Spirit of God is within me hey I wrote down here what's up Dana wrote to see you to spirit Jesus say my words they are spirit and life only thing that quicken that body is the divine power or the whole ego that dwell on inside of it but you're still gonna walk is this you still got a war against this with when you win the battle I probably say it's the chief said quit dog win it switch when you feed the most hi Louie don't work cuz you fighting against a spiritual war it's an atmosphere going on now what you know you're I'm gonna deal with this Ralph I want to read a quote from trials for a few minutes because realizing what people don't want your trials I do not get up and start praying for a trial I had one brother of mine he didn't have about it in such a while he started praying for God to send the devil he want a trial I say what you say would you say about that he domina not him he go forever God owns a guy you know when I'm ready how do you know when I'm ready to take this job but in a way he got it how all of a sudden the pain hit him so bad they had to rush him to the hospital and they never did find out what was wrong with him only person he knew with me he didn't want to act for it he got it I'm not a god drive about the god nursing but God will you see me worthy enough to give me the trial Holly I'll be strong enough to face it let me read him a message of God in His Word the proper preacher he says and he is not a is not a grand feeling to know what God Grace has carried carried some of you some of you here through 20 and 30 years of trials 20 or 30 years of trials something you got a lot more neck and something you've got a lot more net how do you know 20 or 30 years of trials and number guaranteed ain't nobody in here to say they've been trial free have you ain't nobody in here can say did he find that okay oh man that's all right man like that yeah oh he's into it so yeah that's it right there twenty or thirty years of trials and persecutions you have to trace Church Smith how do we do people reject it I didn't seen all this stuff I've got told I didn't wanna come and since I've been in the message I didn't see people turning issue ain't got nothing to do with you I didn't have my share of the trials and persecuted so God did it for you to show them that you were they what then why you still in church today if you would have been a real child of God you've been out of here Oh how'd it go some trials are coming to snatch you right out of here I lose some temptation to go how what pressure you gonna probably have no counter pressure time that your pressure or this pressure on that brother pressure your job but you find yourself still serving God that is not you got referring you and he's and he has taken you into his fellowship some day into and some day some day in the face of all OH has criticized you you'll be glorified and made a body like unto his glorious body okay it is coming wait we wait for the Blessed hope so now he talked he said now he's speaking either you will be made into his glorious body I'm killed in till we're just until your party chain deal with this you say definitely gonna get good but every man had trials before you ever man go ahead of trials after you so don't let trial throw you out of the mud missing you but look what's going on around here man Holly that's what's going on around the master that might be calling around the message but ain't going on inside of me I believe it I'll give somebody could talk you out of your revelation you never had a revelation Holly revelation okay why Eve I said they say the message though hold it don't matter I know what God done for me I know what God done for me I'm not gonna be involved in those like I want to don't let me preach so I begin to go here I begin to live here I'm gonna think about a few trials for a few minutes you ain't done in one hair trials sisters Bible being wrote in a big number the book of ups and down the trial how do you prove we were a new God no no way I can prove that their son of God but gotta go I gotta let him go through the fire I gotta let you up to prove to the devil I got a people on the face in here I don't care how many demons a fight I don't care how hard the battle get they will not give up man cuz when you been think about all the years you seen people fall away normally they fall away because of something happened they feel like somebody don't lock up in church somebody tell ya you know exist old people fall away for every day how do i how I'm gonna go find me a church with a bit more revelation and all kind of stuff people got any mind but the point of it is you don't need one revelation Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory that feel Lord to fulfill the whole thing but the point is if you're at the ferry right you know where if the wrong Atma thrown inside of you the wrong manifestation go come on the outside so he goes in there it says here I'm gonna deal with some trial before you how do I begin to think about when we think about trying to get ourselves up on my let get away from what we think about ourselves with me and then look at other people that went down before they had tried before look at look at look at job look at his trials God try Joe to prove that here son of God he tried God Joe when the devil couldn't even get to him when he gave this router Joe a hedge was around Joker Joe had to talk it over his house Holly ever implying everything that the law required the blood was there all the toker was there he had everyday so the devil said he would God stop the devil a beginning of his have his cover we say he had I say had you considered had you considered Joe Satan knew would Joe was his I've been going to him for a nerve he'd say he'd say yep I didn't seem joke I watch him but I can't get through that taupe and he got there I can't get through those angels they've been watching over here Oh My gods all right I would tell what I knew but he thought well let you know right now I'm gonna let you jump well let you to have Joe what does st. Nashville say say what will a man give for his lunch because Santa knew who you claimed was given a God in his flesh he said what when a man give what his flesh for flesh but God said I'll see you go work on this flesh he's all right since you're gonna do this got one thing I want you to let you know you can't do you can't take his life because he's saving the one that he would have healed if we could have put a disease he could have killed that flesh in today but God said nope I'm putting your own permission he said you got permission to do it but you got permission to take his life ha loser
