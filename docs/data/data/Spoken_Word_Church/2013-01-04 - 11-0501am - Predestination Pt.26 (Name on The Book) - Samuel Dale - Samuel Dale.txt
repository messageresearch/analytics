the house of the Lord glad to have Brother Dean back with us appreciate God for being with him and taking care of him and just keep praying for him and Lord will hold him up remember brother Tom he's the doctor says he's doing better but he's still battling that fluid so we just pray that the Lord will take care of that you know and take it away from him so just remember all of these are sick we really had a good time for the past last weekend with brother Pinkston enjoyed that and then with brother Samuel RZ I pronounced it perz but he knows what his name is but maybe everybody else don't but but I'm sorry about that I have trouble with names but we we really had a good time and appreciate each one of them now remember the uh fellowship meeting will be here on the third Saturday which is the 21st brother forny will be preaching for the weekend but remember now this coming up Saturday will be the Bible study because it fell you know being this is the first Sunday in May so you know this coming Saturday will be the first Saturday remember the Bible study remember the fellowship uh the ministers meeting will be the second Saturday and so yeah be two weeks away and then the fellowship meeting so remember that it's hard to keep this month right because it falling on the on the first but just remember that and pray that the Lord would be with us I think I've covered all announcements anything else any announcements I need to make huh just don't blow your nose for me today and wipe your eyes cuz I got enough trouble doing my own so we'll just don't have to worry about it but just keep praying that the Lord would would guide each one we appreciate the Lord taking away all of the weather from this area and the people because that's what we prayed dark uh the other day when the storms were coming you know we just asked the Lord to move it away from us you say well you moved it to somebody else well I can't help that that's right I mean I'm not being nasty I can't help that if I ask him to move it away I just can't tell him where to send it you know you just have to to let that alone you know but so we did pray and that's the way it happened you know we didn't have any trouble cuz I was talking to Brother Richard I think it's 30 something people killed in Tennessee and right down 10 mi from them towards Jonesboro off going back to Greenville there that it went through there you know destroyed a lot of things but uh we thank God for all of his protection to take care of us amen you like turn in your scriptures turn when we've been reading in Ephesians 1 and then we'll go to Revelations 13 so we've had a good time you've had a rest from my style of preaching and my my you know uh talking real slow and being slow and I hope you've enjoyed these brothers coming in and and everything and all and we appreciate the five-fold ministry cuz I believe in it I don't believe in a onefold I believe in a five-fold Ministry I believe there was one Prophet come to bring the message but there's a five-fold Ministry to break that message down to the people and that's what what I depend upon okay Ephesians 1 Revelations 13 father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day and the hour that we're living thank you for all things Lord that you've given unto us and you give un to us freely and I pray that you would just Lord direct each one of us into the right understanding because that's what we desire cuz you said with the restoration of the word would come restoration of power well we've had the word in written form is called the Bible in many years and then we've had now many years the the message or the hour that we called the the Spoken Word by the prophet but now we need it revealed unto each one of us because that to me is what I believe he's talking about with the restoration of the revealed word there's always to be power so we pray that you'd bless and guide each one now and just have your way in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians 1 we'll just read 3 through 3-6 because we've been trying to read all of it now we're just taking basically uh parts of this that we've been reading on you know for a while and using it for the scriptural part says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings work in Heavenly places in Christ now that's the main thing make sure you follow everything in Christ cuz it says according as he had chosen us were in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame L before him in love now let's read it like this you know let's just turn your Bible you know just hit me turn your Bible to Revelations U 13 okay and let's read the scripture this way all right cuz I believe that's what it's saying I believe all that is the Bible okay you got it so let's read it this way verse four from Ephesians according as he had chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in Love Now Revelations 138 all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world all right so you see we're getting it all together now back to verse 5 in Ephesians having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein Heath made us accepted in the Beloved amen you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word because that's what we're we're going to be dealing with is when we get to it in a little bit is to try to talk about you know how they were chosen in him and uh but I want to make sure now I preached a message and I know it's been about that was week ago this past Wednesday that I preached a message on inheritance and I want to make sure that's understood I was going to continue on into uh the message like picking up this evening and then going on from there but it it just keeps bearing on me to make sure that we understand this about the inheritance and you know what it is and we covered as I said a whole message on it now so some of this will be repeats some of it will be added quotes from the prophet and things but I want us to understand the The Inheritance that we're talking about is eternal life right and the scripture says it comes through Jesus Christ right all right now but yet the prophet would say that Jesus never left you an inheritance all right so now if that's not understood there's not much need of going on to this evening's message where that we want to talk about uh the the predestinated uh you know and how that it takes place in doing that but tonight I mean the title today is predestinated all right name on the book predestinated and then put in parentheses name on the book this is message number 26 I think according to my numbers of predestination but see I want us to understand how that we receive an inheritance and what that inheritance is all right now there's only one inheritance I want that's right I don't care about the world it's falling apart I don't care about all these other things we're here we live we do what we can while we're here we enjoy the things of life and all of that while we're here in the world and all of that's well and good and there's nothing wrong with being rich and you know nothing wrong with being poor unless you're trying your best to be poor you know I just mean it like I say it that's the way to go with it but I don't care about this existence we're happy here I love to be in America at least we do until this time how the freedom and things that others doesn't have but if I inherited all of America had it at my feet what good would it do me because 71 I couldn't last very much longer sister Trudy was talking about something there you know of Finance in a home and 73 years old and then finan a home for for uh 30 years she said I sure hope the Lord comes well I do it too because we're going to all be in bad shape but anyhow you know just a little fun out of it I get a tickled at us around here sometimes you know brother dick was saying there while ago and he didn't even notice and he said so the lost his job praise the Lord he was we get it all but Brother Richard won said a lot of times he said everybody going to die and go to hell said praise the Lord you know it doesn't mean it wrong folks out there we just we just you know we just say what we mean and forget the rest of it but now listen see what kind of inheritance would we want see I want eternal life right that's the only inheritance that I care about is eternal life and like I've always said once you get it it's the one thing that you'll try your best to give away is eternal life I mean you'll just try your best to give it to everybody else cuz you so want them to have it and that's why to me I believe Paul was saying it the way he meant it I believe that's what he meant when he said that I'd even and be a cast away right in other words i' give my eternal life to my people to save them I believe he meant that I don't think he was just you know hyp Hazard running his words I believe he meant it that he'd be willing to give it up if you could give it to somebody else cuz see that's when you get eternal life you got to remember somebody did have to give it up right for us to have it all right now that's what we want to talk about today but I want to make sure you as I said that you understand what I'm saying and what brother random is saying to to under you know to follow the the the line up and and to see what kind of an inheritance is I said do you want well if it's eternal life yeah and eternal life could never have a beginning or never have an ending but I don't agree with the people of the message you know that and they're quoting brother randam and that's all right but you take a quote by itself and it'll kill you and but they're saying well always was eternal well I agree with that if you have eternal life in the same message see if you have eternal life the eternal life you have always was eternal but there was a time you didn't have eternal life right all right and you had to receive eternal life by Jesus Christ if not then he died in vain and all this is just a you know halfhazard thing I'll get to it in a minute and repeat it again even God could not bring eternal life and just broadcast it over a world of people and it just fall on certain ones you know and as we think he couldn't even do that right man see he had to make a way that's right for us to receive that inheritance cuz that's what I want to talk about see I just want to make sure you understand me and you know and forgive me if I just repeat myself a lot but you know I I believe we need it but look at look at the notes I gave you off of the uh message adoption preached in 1960 and 522 the morning service and and listen to what your Prophet said right now you remember the number one in the line mean it's the continuation of reading I don't care if the paragraph changes a lot you just read on down it'll be the same I make sure that right oh brother Neville forgive me for taking this time that word inheritance oh God I know you it's My Kinsman brother I don't I hope I'm not crazy I I just I don't think I am now to somebody on the Internet or something I'm reading exactly the way that he does and I try to do that and I know I misread a lot but forgive me go back to the quote but oh my a what an inheritance we have obtained an inheritance somebody has to leave you something God before the foundation of the world left you something want you amen a name written on the book amen that when the lamb would be slain you'd be recognized with it right now listen which came first now I know this is a hypothetic iCal point of what I'm making but still get to Point the book was written and then the lamb was slain right it wasn't the lamb was slain and then the book was written the will was written first the book which is the Bible all right so come on down it comes to the Bible all right see it's not just a book it's a book of names the Bible is a book of names all right and and see then when you get over into the seals and things you get into the book being t and all and and and you know just remember the whole thing is talking about the Bible now it's not talking about uh all of these versions that's why we believe and go with and stay with what we can of what is known as the King James version because that was the one the prophet used now he read other translations I do too I check out things compare them and all and that's well and good but we go go by the King James version because now I'm going to say it the best way I know how to say it brother random didn't read a modern you know good news for Modern Man and then God come behind him and back it up but he read the King James verse and God come right behind and backed it up now he said that the ends and butts is in the right place right all right then you turn around and say now this word here should have been translated to this that's fine cuz he's not changing it see he's just giving you a better understand standing and that's what all these other versions can do if you keep it correct now you can believe what you want to but I believe now the King James version not the modern King James version where they take out edit do a little bit of things and you can't even find scull fields and stuff like that in the 1611 you might as well forget it go ahead and try it you can't get it CU you might find somebody that had an old Bible somewh way back but as far as I know Scofield have never even put out 1611 right all right right I have the 1611 there's very little difference between it and the old uh I like the 19 and what it 9 or 19 one6 or something and basically we use the 1917 all right because that's but they're all listed King James versions you know but what I'm getting at is I believe the original word is what was written in heaven right amen and I believe we have the word correct amen I'm not looking for other translations to change the meaning of these I'm looking to God to reveal all right now because if it's not revealed what good is any translation or all the translations righten you remember the man said we we can only understand it to brother random which was a good Baptist we can only understand it when we get everything in the perfect order he said well there was arguing over one mark in a word there you know in the original back there in 3:25 and is they got it all messed up using the King James version you know see but it wasn't 1611 till later so come on you get what I'm talking about all the Bible was put together come down to to be the best all right now but see he left you something a name written on the book when the lamb would be slain you'd be recognized with it so now we'll get to it in a minute and read it on down in in the message which came first the inheritance are say the inheritors right right you know the people who had received it naturally they was doing all right then it was a will written out so we go down to court and we going to leave our family this that or the other we write out a wheel all right technically you wait until death to give the inheritance but you can go down and give it you can write a will and say I want to divide up all of this which is the most sful way right but people don't care about that part but it's better to give your kids and families and all your money now than it is to let the government E you do you know I mean I'm just playing so you know but that's all right you do what you want to with your money cuz I ain't concerned about it except you pay you TI right and I don't give a hoot where you do that or not cuz that's between you and God cuz this church has never operated off of begging for anything right amen I'll give it to you instead you give it to me that's that's never been anything else I get in trouble with people trying to explain that but I sure have seen God vindicate so I don't worry about it I do whatever I'm led to do myself all right but now listen the prophet said then your inheritance was your name written in and he'll call it Book of Life and then he'll call it Lamb's Book of Life now we know the difference right we know that the book of life there are sections of the Book of Life there sections that where the foolish virgins are dealt with in the book of life but there's also a place called an eternal section of the book of life that is dealing only with the bride all right and that way see the whole Plan of Redemption is there it's not that that it's all written to us it is but yet there's other people get the benefits from it to receive eternal life at later dates and things all right and their name is in the book all right so all names were written in the Book of Life before the foundation of the world Amen now Judas could be rised out cu the Book of Life your name can be taken out but now if it's in the Eternal section it cannot be so we're talking about the bride and the Lamb's Book of Life The Eternal section okay amen all right you understand what I'm talking about that's what we're dealing with on what we're talking about cuz he left you something a name written on the book amen all right now the Bible said he' deceive everybody except who's names were written so it's going to deceive those that's got their names in the book but it's not going to deceive those whose names were written in the Lamb's Book of Life The Eternal right amen all all of it's the book all right so watch what he says Okay jump down to the next paragraph what how do you get this inheritance how did we get it because walked up right how do you get this inheritance because we were predestinated am now we've been so far on doing it how does God predestinate by his for knowledge so for knowledge preceded his predestination and he knows but there is a bride that's predestinated right all right and we'll get to that more this afternoon what he said we my Armenian Brothers I know this really that's awfully hard I don't mean to hurt but it just does me so good to know it you read all the rest in between look on down an inheritance now watch oh my be in what kind being what kind of an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will all right so now he could predestinate a bride to be conformed to His Image sure we have a part to do with it because we must receive eternal life as I said it's not a blanket thing throw it out we must receive it God could not just before the world just sprinkle it down and just every who reaches up somewhere and grabs it no but it's according to his will cuz his will is his word all right now we get to it this evening what is it not the person that comes predestinated eternally but the word are seed that's right okay now so what are we going to listen to what he says when he before he was Papa before he was God before he was a savior before he was a Healer before all this he predestinated put the Lamb's name on the book now what look down through by his for knowledge that's right and seeing your name put seeing your name put it on there too what is it and after a while we come in the world born by sinful parents we walk around on the world you know first thing you know like that Little Hook noos Jew Paul you know and and he was carrying out now you know what Paul was doing and the first thing something said here here here here now we know what happened to Paul don't we right see God contacted him amen all right now watch you say they bring it on down with us oh AB a father here we begin to come see predestinated us to our inheritance in him there is no predestination of any inheritance unless it comes through Jesus Christ amen now we got to get that right because he never died to leave us an inheritance all right so we'll get to that in a minute now which predestinated us to our inheritance in him which was predestinated to us we we inherited it before the foundation of the world see oh for this his own purpose to work out his own good will that's exactly to be a God and savior amen now here's what basically people say see oh I always was eternal what was the purpose of Jesus Christ ever coming into the world and coming down the way if you always was eternal right now the eternal life you receive today always was eternal because there not but one form of eternal life so you get it like that and you're getting into these doctrines that's right of mankind of the message that believes this but see this ain't going to change none of them right I'm talking to you to make sure you don't get fallen into a trap right I preach to you not those out there has to listen and somebody else is their Pastor right if they want to hear it those on the internet that's fine but just go back and check it see you said but my pastor believes so and so well but said your pastor's ordained to lead you through so you better find it but he said if your pastor gets off the word get off away from your pastor now that's his words but you you don't want to hear that oh it's too far to travel it's too much to do I've been here with these wonderful people for a long time well if them wonderful people's going to hell evidently you going with them right you know that's pling why play right amen you know they don't play with me right so why play all right well look he said we inherited The Inheritance before the foundation of the world that's right right now we'll read in a minute I think it's in the next one where he says your inheritance was first all right that's right if if your inheritance is eternal life your eternal life was first right now when he's saying before he was God before he was Papa before he was a savior he's not talking about that he didn't have those attributes in him he's talking about before he displayed them anywhere right then he always had that see so if my inheritance is eternal life then the eternal life that I received by the new birth always was eternal right cuz it's his own life now we'll get to that in a minute or this afternoon's message how did you get in the body of Christ am you answer the question right now let's go on and reading those were paragraph 170 through 172 then we jump over to paragraph 177 and the sign message inheritance by predestination I inherited something what inheritance they had to be somebody to leave me an inheritance now we're getting on to the understanding see that Jesus Jesus never died to give you an inheritance right he died to bring you to your inheritance in the natural it's it's generally that somebody dies then they bring out the whe they read it or something like that then you give you inheritance but now we'll get to it in a minute I got it wrote down here I agree wholeheartedly God can't die God in spirit form can't die he had to do something else right all right we know that's true but watch what he says there had to be somebody leave you an inheritance why you say Jesus left you an inheritance he said beg your pardon Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you to your inheritance now that's what Jesus come to do to bring us to The Inheritance he's not just a reader of the will that's what you do you know you go in to don't make him just a reader of the will brother brandom would have been the reader of the will the prophets would be the readers of the will right right but see somebody had to get that set up all right to where that the reader of the will could do it a preacher say I can only read you the will I can't bring the will to you I can't make it manifest to you that's right I can only read that your inheritance is die that's a reader of the will so there's got to be somebody in between the reader of the will and the one who made the will right all right but see we always connect death right to a will being read all right now we're going to get to that that's what Jesus Christ done through his death but the inheritance was first that's right your name written in the book L's Book of Life right predestinated on there predestinated by his for knowledge that he knew you would accepted right right amen but his word is what come predestinated eternally so we'll get to that later watch see Jesus never left me an inheritance Jesus never left you an inheritance he only came down and paid for your inheritance brought you too y your inheritance but your name was put on the L Book of Life before the foundation of the world God give you your inheritance your inheritance was first right Jesus only come and here's what most people believe you know like a lot here's the way they try to make it God said well there's a lot of people lost I don't want them he said be saved so I'll send Jesus down and perhaps maybe he'll somebody feel sorry and know what I've done and get saved oh mercy I wouldn't run my office like that even as poor as I do right flip over this continual reading right on there God by his for knowledge seen exactly who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved He sent Jesus to save those that he had already chosen didn't Paul say five verses behind this did he chose us in him be before there even was a world that's our inheritance right God chose us and let Jesus come and pay the price the what his shedding of his blood that no sin would be counted unto us nothing you do then he goes on to explain if you sin willfully explains what that is he goes on down and says they never receive the truth they receive the knowledge of the truth right see you can receive a knowledge of the truth that don't set you free right knowledge of the truth don't save you that's right that's exactly what the children of Israel had amen that's what Nicodemus had Etc knowledge of the truth but he never had the truth revealed to him all right so now he goes to the evening service on adoption 5:22 the evening service number four of adoption now a little further now on that 11th verse in whom also we have obtained an inheritance an inheritance somebody has to leave you something to inherit it is that right an inheritance what inheritance do we have what what inheritance did I have I didn't have any but God left me an inheritance when he put my name on the L book of life before the foundation of the world oh you say now wait a minute brother Jesus did that when he died for you no he never Jesus come to purchase right that inheritance for me read the next verse and you very next line see read it in whom we also have obtained apparent which is in there goes back he said obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will see Jesus never come to give you an inheritance that's right Amen in this line someone had to pay the price or a range away to deliver the will to the people right now I said a reader the Will's fine the lawyer reads you the will but he don't have what to give law give me my money he say right here I get $10,000 I want it right now laer just look at you say hey Budd you ain't dealing with me you got to go deal with these people over here these people over here is want to make the arrangement and they tell you where the banks at they tell you who to go see and they'll take care of it but I ain't giving you a dime I'm charging you yeah right see he's just a reader of the will but see there's got to be somebody that can transmit that wheel down right and to do that what would it take all right so you say well Jesus did that when he died for you no no he never Jesus has come to purchase that inheritance for me read the next verse he come to deliver to transmit to bring it down to you right right he came to be the party between the one that wrote the will and the one that would receive the inheritance he there has to be a way to be able to do that then so then what happened go on reading let's just read what he says just continue reading because I like to do that which paragraph 74 God before the foundation of the world as we've took it down through the lesson you people see you people how we seen God with self-existence how that in him was love and him was God was to to be God there was nothing to worship him and him was to to be father there was he was by himself in him was to be savior nothing lost in him was to be a Healer that's the attributes of him there was nothing there so his ownership his own Good Counsel produced these things that he might through this one man Christ Jesus gather it all together again or the eyes have not seen and all talking about the mysterious wonders so watch what he said keep on reading part 75 look has predestinated us unto this inheritance if I'm a right inheritance of something if God is knocking at my heart and saying William brandom I called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel I have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life now God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me that's right because there was nothing I could do to inherit it it was blank it was valid there's nothing I can do see he's explain what we can't do anything right not that the will is blank not at the thing it's all about what we could do but in the fullness of time God sent in his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance to be what what inheritance to sunship to be a Son of God right all right amen now see then the will was written first y right the will the Bible Etc was written and in that Bible it explains that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation War so Redemption I the people told me when I come into the message you know there in in' 67 and uh along in that area of time there was preaching that you couldn't be saved after 63 cuz Redemption was over when the seals broke you know you couldn't get saved at 63 I said well I'm sorry bless him but along about 69 I really did argue with them because I said and they were still saying that I said you can argue all you want to I've got the experience that's it right there I don't give a hoot what you think that's right you can say redemption was over I said according to my Bible right and the prophet I believe Redemption was over before the world ever begun right amen and that's what I read on the scripture Redemption was over before the world began right cuz he only come to save those that was redeemable am amen well it's no problem see it's just no see I'm might a smart etic because of those things but what's wrong with being a smart etic about the truth I'd rather be a smart EIC about the truth than a dummy I tried to use it not use that other word cuz Josiah got on to me about using stupid and I don't need to use that I use dummy josi now maybe help he said it didn't sound good so out of the mouth of a baby I guess you learn wisdom but now listen then Jesus Christ never gave me an inheritance right all right but then let me lay down a what is that big old word I like in this modern day language is I never do understand I'm have to look up the dictionary but let let's lay down what is that word to use scenario which mean let's just lay out something in front of you to look at you know well let's lay out something now Jesus could not give us an inheritance he come to bring us to it right Amen to pay the price to do the things we know that all right now let me say it this way where you'll understand there could never be an eternal inheritance coming from any flesh right number one right flesh can't give you an eternal inheritance our flesh is going to be redeemed it is already purchased taken care of Etc but one day it will be totally redeemed all right right no even Jesus's body had to be redeemed not that it was sinful because it had a beginning I got to quote in here but I'm laying down a good case in front of you to look at but it's also Jesus could not give you an inheritance right now follow my line but God could not give you that inheritance without it being done the way he done it right right cuz he cannot is I said to sprinkle eternal life and every who happens to be under the water as it falls you know or whatever you want to call it or some form you know all these great preachers they make it and you you just feel so good in your body and you just Oh Glory Hallelujah I happen to be under the spout but I'm sorry brother collie you wouldn't under the spout you say you got saved after 63 well I'm sorry one brother in this message I don't call his name but he preached that real strong you know that you couldn't be saved after 63 but it goes back back to this church and I'm not making it a comical I'm making it a truth he preached it in his church well that he went back the next year ever sister in the church was either pregnant and already had a baby now I'm not joking I know the story well what was he going to do he done preach the year before nobody could be saved after then so he made him a good Doctrine you're saved in your parents oh my well that might be all right cu the ones that was in the parents you know that's comical but those that been born out of That's Got of problem but you see people always got a away and everybody loves that you know brother said something to me one time this brother said something and he said well I can see that I said I can't cuz it ain't in the Bible that's it right there well I know I'm smart e it ugly and hateful but can't do much about ugly I guess I change hateful but but now listen so God cannot just sprinkle down eternal life no he made a way to receive eternal life right if you don't want it it's not for you right what do you mean always was eternal you mean you got it without the death of Jesus Christ so he died in vain right so you know what I feel about that that's garbage kids but you know that's the popularity of the message something to make you feel so wonderful I feel wonderful about the revealed word right and I'm not throwing off on nobody I love to hear people that rejoice and make me feel good but it don't make me feel good for somebody to come along say all a on the camera but stay here all left-handed people are ser see more people just Glory Hallelujah Hallelujah all ain't that a wonderful Revelation but you better believe you're not left-handed right right I mean you back on that y 80y old man said we don't believe in have in having babies anymore so he's 80 years old you he's doctrines that's right but people are sitting there today instead of listening to the truth right right oh we're ready for the Rapture we're ready for the Rapture yeah all right I just try to I try to make it comical when I'm getting serious about stuff cuz you'll remember it longer so with other people that hear is it you'll remember it for a longer time but now listen Jesus came to make a way that I could get my inheritance right yep that's right everybody agree with that amen I don't T you amen or heart or whatever just you agree with it Jesus came to make a way cuz it couldn't be done right without him making a way right or else all is in vain of the Bible and all the things God just it out just every who happened to fall at the F got it you know no he couldn't do it that way right he made a way if you don't receive eternal life God cannot override your free more AG and make you take it that's Catholic you can do what you want to with you say well what about Paul he didn't make him receive eternal life he just slapped him off the horse where he could talk to him right he had to receive eternal life yes sir amen all right now watch then then if Jesus come to pay the price see then what he was doing was making a way that God could transmit eternal life will you go with me yes now when know for certain we don't believe in two Gods three Gods Etc so as your Prophet said it was necessary we'll read this where it be on the table go God would not send a son would you send one of your sons if a debt had to be paid you know you know somebody going to die he okay take the kids leave me alone now what kind of a daddy is that garbage kin Daddy no God didn't do it that way and he wouldn't do it that way he didn't send another he came himself right well now you're one that no sorry about that true Oneness yes right because to me Jesus was either almighty God in human flesh which meant as the prophet said in body he was a man a creation spoken into existence for the purpose of dying to be the kinsman redeemer that in body he was a man that in Soul and Spirit he was almighty God right now that's not Oneness that is not Oneness Doctrine that's right and I go on to believe cuz Oneness is like your finger and that's they say that's the last form of God I differ with you because the Bride of Jesus Christ is the last form of God right so I'm not that form of Oneness I believe I'm true Oneness amen but it would be necessary then that the person that would come could not be just a man as the River Jordan people are saying amen but would be the man not the first person second person or third person cuz if he's the first person that means there could be more brother brother said he is the person right that's right so it had to be almighty God the only way that your inheritance could come to you us would have to be that that inheritance would have to now listen what I'm saying that inheritance would have to come in a human vessel right yeah so the Bible said God's in Christ reconciled in the world and himself amen so it would mean my inheritance is not up in heaven right my inheritance came to Earth because I was chosen in him or I won't be chosen right so when Jesus Christ came to Earth that was God Almighty Emmanuel right God With Us right not just a man until the River Jordan and then he becomes God Amen no the Bible said he was born Lord to Christ if he become a man I mean if he was just a man body spirit and soul and then he become God then what have you got right amen you're worse than Oneness that's Tess a got no plain language or sense that's Tess and I'll read to you some things in here in a minute that the man wrote In the book himself and he turned around later and said I wish I hadn't wrote it that way why because it's contrary to his two Lords yeah because he believes in two persons yeah I wouldn't say that if I heard him he said Jesus was a person and God was a person that's right of course I know he's got a great following that's all right I know I have no arguments I'm not trying to get his following I don't want his following you know why it take me a long time to preach out of them the junk right that he's done to put in them that's right amen is that plain enough amen that's just the way I am see because I I put up with you a long time and I hope you put up with me a long time to maybe get out of all of us what they put in us before we got here I hope Brother D you think you're something no it's exactly what I am if it's a truth tell me if it ain't coming tell me right but you better bring the prophet's message don't come to me and say oh I don't believe you you better believe that he's going to be lay in front of you that's right I started that way I'll end that way first man come in this message said we ain't got the Holy Ghost I said read the book yeah right they called me to your Theologian I said read the book there at late he said the Holy Ghost come on theusa street was the same baptism of the Holy Ghost that come in the book of Acts he finally said what do you think's wrong I said I think a lot of people don't have the Holy Ghost I'll read in a minute where the Prophet says about the New Birth cuz if you don't have the new birth forget it right instead of elel Israel right right can be now watch let's just read a little bit now look at number four when you notes GES instructions Daniel 61730 paragraph 56 now we find that he was our kinsman redeemer and he took the book out of the hand of the original owner and you know that's in Revelations 5 and going on over right to break the seals okay it is a title deed to Redemption we found that you remember that study the study it's a title deed of redemption it's an abstract deed with it that God required life for death in the Garden of Eden then Jesus the righteous one died and took a title deed and was able to break the seals reveal what was in them and give the inheritance that belonged to him to his people eternal life that he inherited by doing that now if you're going to deal with the flesh by the time the Book of Revelations and revelation life his body was eternal and he was the lamb that could take the book and break the seals all right he passed his own life back at Calvary and divided it Among Us by the Holy Ghost amen no man has never been able to come and even think of that love that that was what he done amen but you see that's why we were in him when he walked the shores of Galilee right amen not as little bitty people running around in there oh it was in his blood and it dropped out on the earth messed all that up right how was we in him he had my inheritance he was bringing it to me right he was delivering amen my inheritance my inheritance is eternal life my name was written on the book which would mean that I'd come to be saved he was coming to deliver it on the day of Pentecost he delivered that right that's right right he delivered the inheritance that he had in him there was only one person that had eternal life dwelling as a human being now did you understand me human being right Adam was given eternal life right he never lost it and went to hell right amen but he never lived Eternal in body that's right right but here come one that had eternal life born with eternal life did they say well he didn't get it to the River Jordan well I differ with that I'm sorry just forget it he when to call him the Lord the Christ amen I believe in body he was a man in spirit he was God in Soul he was God and I'm quoting brother R that's what I believe and that's what what I've always tried to teach because I believe what the prophet had to say about it but look what he said what he what he had we must have cuz he come to pass it on to us amen and to do that he had to die right now God didn't die righten right the body amen is what died amen that's right so the prophet said on Calvary God ripped right out his own life so evidently his life was still left in me Calvary right and the way they teach River Jordan is life that left him in the garden and he just want to for a man yeah well see you don't even have any eternal life whatsoever doing it that way of course those people are real popular right see that's fine I don't have no problem with popularity I'm trying my best to to see me and you saved popularity don't have anything to do with this thing right cuz remember brother R said money women in popularity was the three things to get of a Preacher if they wouldn't careful well I don't have much popularity so I lost St I give away all my money I'm sure it's 71 years old don't need no women amen I said it the way I meant it when me right that's right so it ought to be all over with amen but now listen brother BR said eternal life that he inherited by doing it amen absolutely amen now Jesus inherited now listen what did he inherit he was almighty God or else he was the biggest liar in the world what did he inherit eternal life in body right right yep that's right he never inherited eternal life in Soul but dying he died to release the life that was in him God rele brought out of that body that Soul and Spirit come out of that body hanging on Calvary that's almighty God Amen but that body was still a body amen that's right I gave you one quote in your somewhere he had a beginning his body had a beginning anything's got a beginning got to have an ended to it his body had to be made Eternal he inherited right but the inheritance was inside of him amen I just don't understand that do you have eternal life you your inheritance inside of you right right right and you know what that means the body's got to follow it okay that's right now I'll say something and maybe make you want to come back this evening I believe there's a time when Time and Eternity catches up to each other and I believe that's this time time many eternity is going to come together am listen let's just read a little bit so what' he say eternal life that he had he that he inherited by doing that he passed his own life back at Calvary and divided Among Us by the Holy Ghost okay going down Choice the father 63 606 he talking about the law penalties and the thing had to be done you then you eat there you die so it had to be a law okay God could not send another person to take the place it would be unjust again for me to make this brother die for what this brother done would be wrong God had to come himself and the only way he could do it was be come in his own flesh which was his own Creative Body that he made himself that he could suffer death amen right there in the gospel in the P there is the gospel in the power I like that that's go God manifested In the Flesh Emmanuel to take away the sins of the world Y and in that blood we trust not in the BL not in the the Jew or Gentile but in the blood of God which was Jesus Christ that's the reason he said I come I and my father are one my father dwelleth in me it was the father in him that day on Calvary 19692 paragraph 56 God required it no man was worthy no man was able no man could do it now if you remember not saying there was anything wrong with Jesus like a lot of people want to preach but just remember Jesus said in the flesh there's nothing any good that's right the flesh can't give you eternal life that's why Jesus never gave you an inheritance he couldn't give it to you you had power to forgive sins he had a lot of things but he couldn't give you eternal life right he had to die to do that cuz the eternal life was in him right God could not send another person to take his place he'd be unjust again for me to make this brother die for what this brother done he said it'd be wrong so going down now that day on Calvary God had required it no man was worthy no man was able no man could do it you remember in the Book of Revelation asked for a man right why don't somebody jump up and preach some things if you're going to preach it I believe I can preach era better than most people and try to preach truth why don't you go over there and say Jesus jump up there here I am no it didn't do it right it was a lamb that jumped up and said onto it right which was Jesus that's right going to give him in the right place right God had required it no man was worthy no man could do it and God came himself and was made known and lived in a human life under human desires and was crucified at Calvary and Di when Satan thought he wouldn't do it listen he wouldn't go through with it you remember he thought he thought he wouldn't do it he went to getsy and every Temptation that any man ever stood he went to it just like all men but he paid the price that's what blacked the Earth out like an anesthestic where they say it for an operation the doctor gives you gives a man an an he first knocks him out before he can do it right and when God gave the the operation for the church the world got an anistic nature for a convulsion no wonder God in human flesh was dying that's right okay now where's your River Jordan people right it was the hour that the world had looked for yet many of them did not know it like it is today many look for these things and yet they don't recognize them they don't recognize the way out they still trying to seek pleasures and things of the world trying to find their way out Christ The Mystery of God revealed 63 3 7:28 prph 235 what is it is Christ being revealed and he is the word and the when the word is revealed it expresses itself see that's God's purpose for Jesus was to express himself to take his own laws and live by his laws come and fulfill his law by death and Christ God died in flesh in order to condemn sin in the flesh that he might bring to himself a glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only the word of God and swap not swap it like he did for intellectual conceptions of men you see it that's Christ's idea that's God's idea the new birth reveals it right so it's not revealed to me it's not revealed to you we don't have new birth right case closed amen listen now I'd like to preach on this part right here for about 2 weeks but I want spoken words Original Seed 1962 318 paragraph 124 because I'm like this you got Baptist this message you got Methodist this message you got Presbyterians you got Church of God you got congregational Holiness you got you got Pentecostal right and they're not going to change right right so don't worry about it it is going to be fear not little for right not Lula around the world that's right all right but listen to what he says that's what the matter today with Pentecostals he says they're trying to manufacture something that's what he's coming down to show you y That's what's the matter with Pentecostals today they're manufacturing some they can't wait oh God they just can't wait so they commit adultery now what's committing adultery with a Pentecostal committing adultery that's he talking about literal adultery that happens but what's he talking about spiritual adultery right lacking the new birth they don't have it to commit spiritual adultery they can't wait oh God they just can't wait so they commit adultery amen tires to manufacture something and what does it bring forth like it did the first time the first bride that couldn't wait she brought death through a bastard born child which we are all children of but God Came In the Flesh to give us another birth to bring us back to original Sons and Daughters of God see there you are the life sperm of Eve never happened now that's what I said i' like to preach her for a while cuz I've always quoted it myself always quoted and it's right but listen I've always quoted the r sperm of Eve never happened that's the way we' always quoted it you better go check it it doesn't say that the L perm see we're looking at the r firm as since she got together and I preached it that way and I'm sorry that she brought down the wrong egg see we quoted the right sperm of Eve never happened no he said the life sperm right a lot of difference in the Life sperm of Eve and the r sperm the r sperm of Eve didn't come down because there was no way for her to bring down anything right with intercourse and intercourse brings the sperm you know the you know what I'm talking about the Egg of the woman he ain't talking about the right the man's got the sperm you know what I'm talking about see the life sperm of Eve never happened why cuz she wi could never did why she mingled it kept it away instead of Adam coming to her for a bride when the time appointed would be just like Christ will would have come to the group Christ would have come to his church he promised to do it God promise to multiply them but they had to wait until God's time all right the what he goes on I'm trying to read in the hurry getting late uh Paradox 1964 418 for if I if I had the jurisdiction over you as God had over everything I'd say well I'll tell you what anybody looks at that light is going to die like take the tree and the first thing you know this brother sitting here this would look at that I feel sorry for him I don't want him to die so I have to Terry Terry so I'll have Terry here to that that wouldn't be right no well if I had my own son to to do it that wouldn't be right there's only one way I can be just and that's take his place you see I know these things okay a lot of people don't and God could not take a human's Place being his spirit all right so God didn't die right Spirit God can't die in spirit form he can't die he had to come in flesh form to be able to die to release the life that was in him which was our inheritance that's right right are you following me God could not take a human God could not take a human's Place being he is spirit so he created a blood cell which was his own son Jesus Christ and God came in and lived in there and lived identified himself in Christ that was God Emmanuel Jesus said I and my father are one my father dwells in me see God in Christ reconciled in the world Jesus was the body the Tabernacle God was the spirit that lived in him all right so we agree God in spirit form can't die no in spirit form he didn't die on Calvary he pulled that life come outen that's right had not the life left out of the body they could have cut in a million pieces it would still been living but he released the life but you know that life came back to pick up that same body then he made that body Eternal so he inherited eternal life himself in body now he's capable of being able to bring us to eternal life in body which is what Adam could not come to because of the sin right okay now I hope I'm going to refice so it's up to you this is p one 19 it's p 1920 know through in the church A's book The revelation of Jesus Christ this is the one the brother said these years are things he said he wished had and written why because it's contrary to his Doctrine y 1 Timothy 3:16 without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifest in flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles now I'd like to spay a week on that where did he preach to the gentille he told him not to go right he's now preaching to the Gentiles he preach to the Gentiles from the church agent is coming on down because it's a gentile dispensation through his bride that's why I don't believe in Oneness I believe in true Oneness he's still manifesting himself believed on in the world received up in the glory that's what the Bible said it doesn't say a thing about a first or second or third person here it said God was manifest in flesh one God that one God was manifest in flesh that ought to settle it God came in human in a human form y that didn't make him another God he was God the same God it was a revelation then and it's Revelation now one God look back in the Bible and see what he was in the beginning according to the Revelation he gave him himself the great Jehovah appeared to Israel in a pillar of fire an angel of the Covenant he lived in that Pillar of Fire and L Israel daily at the temple he announced his coming with a great Cloud then one day he was manifested in a virgin born body that was prepared for him the god that tabernacled above the tents of Israel now took on himself a tent of Flesh and tabernacled as a man amongst men but he was the same God right the Bible teaches that God was in Christ the body was Jesus in him dwell all the fullness of the godhead bodily nothing can be pler than that mystery yes but actual truth it can't be plainer so if he wasn't three people then he can't be three now one God and this same God was made flesh continual reading Jesus said number 10 on your note I came from God and I go back to God John 16:27 28 that is exactly what happened he disappeared from Earth by way of his death burial resurrection and Ascension then Paul met him on the road to Damascus and he spoke to Paul and said now I want to stop here and pray sa sa why persecuted th me now according to Paul and according to the Bible that was Jesus I thought Jesus was just a man I thought God just used Jesus just to dumped him somewhere TR scanned him or done something with him you know it's odd this fill our fire that I'm Jesus right whom got persecuted right then when you lete for years and I have for years on it but people ain't going to listen to you so why all saw why persecutest thou me Paul said who art thy Lord he said I am Jesus he was a pillar of fire blinding light it turned back exactly like he said he would back to the same form that he was before he took on a tabernacle of Flesh and exactly how John saw it John 1:18 no man has seen God at any time the only begotten which is in the bosom of the father he had declared him and brought him out in the opy notice where John says that Jesus is is in the bosom of the father now we read from God rich in Mercy 65119 paragraph 104 then God rich in Mercy sent forth A Savior Jesus Christ he sent forth Jesus to be both Savior and healer he said as Moses lifted up the brass serpent in the wilderness so must the son of man be lifted up for the same purpose he the atonement that's why he what we have claim upon nothing but the atonement but Jesus purchased by his blood that's what we have claims upon and the Bible said he was wounded for our transgressions Bru for our iniquity the chasti of our peace was upon him and with his stripes were healed that's what we claim because that's what that's what the atonement that we stand for ordered for us God rich in Mercy this has to be an eternal atonement because he came himself God came himself in the form of sinful flesh to make a a a an eternal atonement and suffered in flesh and made the atonement and returned back in the form of the Holy Ghost to confirm that atonement for no bright serent and no trouble Waters could do it that's right it all pointed to that perfect atonement God rich in Mercy future home this is just to get to the point see what happened at River Jordan and here descending Out of Heaven future home paragraph 310 1964 802 and here come descending Out of Heaven the form of a dove and a voice saying this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed and from this part of the earth I'll redeem the rest of it amen for he has made my word he for he is my word made manifest the life when anybody has to know it got a little sense reading it anything has a beginning has an ending so the body of Jesus had a beginning the body of Jesus had an ending the body of Jesus had to be made Eternal at the resurrection so he inherited eternal life but in doing it he got something and in doing it I got something right cuz he made a way amen that God could come and live in you and I that's right in the new birth to release that life so Jesus never gave me an inheritance the flesh can't do it and while he had it within him he could not give eternal life to anyone right you believe that while he was on Earth Jesus walking here in flesh he couldn't give that to anyone I know come on I know the scriptures and I know what the prophet says to where he comes over breathes on them and said receive you the Holy Ghost brother said they didn't get it till the day of Pentecost that was just a promise all right so we're still in the message I like to do it that way cuz somebody sitting that there their computer clicking you know oh but this quote go this quote this quote this quote well I like quote with go it right see God the only way he could deliver our inheritance remember they had to be one between God the spirit God and the reader of the will the reader of the will is a person on Earth that tells you what's in that will he has nothing to do with the will whatsoever he's paid to read it that's the preachers that's the prophet but there had to be one in between y That's right to be able to turn around and say here it is I have the ability to lay my life down I have the ability to keep it in other words I'm not going to do it where you can have what I've got within me I'm going to die and I love that where it says we're join ours with Jesus Christ because you see he got eternal life and body y in the resurrection right amen a body that had a beginning was made Eternal am but in doing all of that he transmitted his own life down to where you and I could have eternal life now what are we doing waiting the Redemption of the body right we've read it there in Acts enough un the purchase the you know the purchase possession is done yep see all this is not finished yet right you can comb your hair different and that's what certain man done years ago way back he started letting his high grow out and boy he was doing bill and he was preaching immortality In the Flesh you know what he died right that's not a joke he died right but you don't what they probably a lot of people still preaching you know brother so and so T more immortal in Flex let's go down to his grave today and put some flowers on come we thank him for telling us this no no no he did right he evidently didn't understand it you know but you see one day Time and Eternity will meet that's right and immortality will be here right it's only because you start your eternal life by receiving the new birth right what's wrong with most of the people this message reading are not not preaching the truth they don't have the new birth that's just plain language it's can be argue with me about it that's right amen I'm not going to argue with you all I'm just going to tell you what brother R said Jesus Christ come to release that life that was in him that you might be able to receive it he was the one between God and man the man in Christ Jesus that's why he's our Advocate amen you see why we can keep on preaching too L come on Brothers you can't it's hard to preach this message not it's hard to stop it's hard to just quit you just have to quit start over again you know but thank God for the truth right you say but my God didn't die you better change your thoughts we know God didn't die but we know God In the Flesh died that's right that's it that's what your Prophet said right you better believe that body wasn't just a body brought by Mary and Joseph right and it wasn't brought by Mary and God right right it was brought by almighty God speaking the word the egg the sperm or you say those things was put together by God himself man had nothing to do with it but in that body a purpose for death was was brought into the world that he could die for us and release that life that's why he's my brother he's not only my savior my God my all and all he's my brother and one day I'll have a body like a his glorified body that's what scripture say his own glorious body let me put it right cuz this body will be made Eternal amen then we can Fellowship that's right A Stand Together number seven in this fire book number seven in this fire book anybody have a need we don't want to leave without praying aming heaven soul from I that down we are benar of the Resurrection we had an Easter weekend Resurrection now we're benary of that Resurrection because he raised I can raise my brother be my K he's my sa he's my God he's my Jesus I will s saor water like how how was a a good give us so many that's what we are to thank him let and praise him oh tomorrow got good you are so BL what we are more today more tomorrow got you
