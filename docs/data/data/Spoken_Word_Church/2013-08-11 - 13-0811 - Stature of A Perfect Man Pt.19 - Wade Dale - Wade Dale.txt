========================================

study instead of us just talking about first one thing and another at responsive reading just I think it kind of Mellows everybody out gets us with our mind so that we can start cuz uh it's hard enough doing this with uh with you know with the right attitude and the right spirit and that's all of us so Hebrews chapter 11 this is the uh great faith chapter and I want to watch these people and watch the character istics of these people now remember these people that we're going to talk about today only had a promise they had a promise but they didn't attain unto the promise they didn't receive the Holy Ghost everybody understand that people in the Old Testament did not have the new birth baptism of the Holy Ghost like you and I in the soul everybody got that that everybody understand that it's been taught to you for years because even the Bible in John 5 says the Holy Ghost was not given because Jesus had not been glorified or he had not released that life he was Jehovah God that had all these attributes in him but Jehovah God had to become Jesus Remember Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new so the Holy Ghost was withholden in the Old Testament cu the blood of bulls and goats can't do it in other words there's a flip side to all these people Noah had great faith Noah built an ark Noah saved his children Noah did a lot of things he did what God told him to do totally contrary to what scientists said but he died a drunk Solomon the greatest man that ever walked on the face of the Earth so the Bible says had all wisdom and prudence and wealth to women got him to serve Idols at the end of his life he would have had the new birth that wouldn't happened David a man after God's Own Heart had his best friend killed now that's not brotherly kind of had his best friend killed so he could cover up he'd already committed adultery with the man's wife but to cover it up she found out she was pregnant so he knew one thing for sure he had to get rid of that guy now what a scoundrel what a rascal but remember the blood blood of bulls and goats could not do away with sin how many times brother R say that it can't do away it covered it and pushed it to Calvary now when Calvary comes Paul looks back into the Old Testament and says Abraham was strong in faith receiving the promise well he didn't look at Abraham giving away his wife twice or trying to you understand what I'm saying laughed at God all these people in the Old Testament had human flaws human flaws but they did not have an indwelling of the Holy Ghost to burn out the old man they had an anointing just like the anointed ones at the end time it's the same identical anointing because remember the anointed ones at the end time is not anointing with a false anointing it's the true baptism of the Holy Ghost anointing someone's body and spirit or Spirit basically because the body just does what the spirit tells you but inside they're black well now that's the way it was with Moses look at Moses he was a murderer right murdered an Egyptian did a lot of things contrary to what God wanted him to do he was he was he was flawed in a sense because he couldn't go to Across the promised land in a type that that that's the promised land of the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that's why Joshua is the type of the of the believer or the new the new birth Earth in the end time or in the seven Church ages everybody got that there's no way God could clean out an individual totally Body Spirit and soul in the Old Testament because when Adam did what he did in the Garden of Eden that blocked all the Sons and Daughters of God from being born at that moment got it cuz remember God won't dwell in an unclean vessel Eve became unclean so that stopped it didn't stop it just it just hindered God's program nothing ever hinders God it just hindered the program that we're looking at backwards see it never hindered God God knew all that was going to happen but he made provision in the Old Testament to make sacrifices and offerings and things so that the believer it's like you hear many times he said he'll he'll put the Lamb on on the altar heel he he believed see there go back to Faith he believed that when that lamb died that he would that lamb was taking his place right but there was no way that the blood of that lamb the life right there was no way that literal life of that lamb could come over into the believer and say I've washed you that's right no I've just covered you that's right until I come and do the work right cuz Jehovah God was God above us Jesus was God With Us now it's God in us that's right why why wasn't it God in the first Adam sold out the human race so that no Sons and Daughters of God could be born the way God wanted them to be born to Genesis 1: 126 and 27 man right cuz we were supposed to come and multiply under plenish the Earth but I'm trying to set about background cuz a lot of people even maybe on the internet uh most people in the message believe that they had the new birth or had the Holy Ghost in their soul in the Old Testament there is no way that can happen right no way look at how they acted all of them but God was showing in tight how that like you come up and you still got the old adamic nature but once God Burns that inside old man out the only way that can happen is is the life of that sacrifice the life in that blood had to come on not on the believer but in The Believer got it right lamb could only Capo cover got it but the man still went out and if he was a uh you know I don't know I just say he was a liar and he said God forgive me but see there was no way that's why that David God loved David because he had an honest and contrite heart he could look into the very part of David and say David I'm just carnal like my dad David I'm sorry that I can't get in your soul cuz if I could get in your soul we'd have a party you understand what I'm talking about we'd have a time right but he but but he knew if David had the Holy Ghost see there go back to predestination again he knew if all these Old Testament people could receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost well Lord they'd have been mightier than are were here because the life would have went with the actions see they had the actions the Holy Ghost would come down and anoint David and he would just speaking the first person but now when that anointing came off of him now when that anointing was on him he didn't go kill UAH or have relations with bash Sheba right even Jesus himself had an anointing my God my God why has Thou forsaken me he knew that anointing wasn't on him anymore but he was wasn't the Holy Ghost leaving him it was anointing for his message for his ministry that he brought but in this chapter we see these people that through these flaws though you and I can see the character building that we need in the end time I say in the end time cuz we're here okay they needed it in the first church age and had it all the way through but it's been sort of eroded and that's why the statute of a perfect man is so important because it's a step remember we read where brother said this is in other words got the Daniel 70 week statue of a perfect man then going into the seals if you're not a walking breathing instrumentality of God sealed in by that top Holy Spirit up there God cannot reveal the seals to you the way he wants to do you understand what I'm saying yeah you can get a partial light you can get a partial understanding but until all those virtues are working in your life there is a part missing there's a part missing you don't have have brotherly kindness there's a part missing so we got to see that once we take this pyramid and we're we're still at Faith on number about 18 or so but faith is the key for all these things you say well I can't do it well then you can't God made Provisions for you to do it he give you the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost has those things in it let me just put it way it's like I said about the pill but remember with that pill it's layers it's gelatin right or yeah gel the pill and it a a slow release pill you used to take slow release pill you know and and you take one it last you all day why there was coating on that pill well there was just enough of what you needed for one hour and then it would dissolve and then the second layer would dissolve and then you got seven layers of appe pill that God gave you called The Holy G it's there see virtue doesn't have to come from above that's what we're looking for sometimes I think we we go to to praying and and even fasting and saying God I want virtue God I want virtue and he said it's in you you've just got to exercise it you got to put it in the right environment to learn that's all that's all you got to do so temples like brother Ron was talking about the orchestra and and the symphony Friday night at the at the camp meeting and it was really wonderful that you got all these players in the different parts of the world and then they all come together to make one great Symphony and you can't be off and he said it's like you know the little triangle that guy may only have one note and then he's done practiced for years to to be in this great Symphony Orchestra and he looks down and he's got one note when he looks and sees that note realizes it's his and he DS he's done but then you got the ones that play the first chair second chair third chair I was thinking about the all the pieces in a symphony well that's kind of want you get the new birth you've got the you've got the tools to do what you need to do with but it takes a five-fold m Ministry mystery fivefold min Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints so you've got to you can't just get virtue sting it home by yourself but what happens is is you we're the ones we the five-fold ministry is supposed to like brother R said take the blinders off your eyes that the devil's put on you and said hey you can't do that well some way somebody's got to contact God to contact you to say hey you got it already in you don't look for it to come from somewhere else now it's in the word of God it's in the prophet's message right you just got to be here right to get it that's right and praying and fasting and all is good but what does that do that gets you out of the way that's right that means you put a capsule around it that God can't get to remember he's a gentleman he's not going to bust through your free moral agency what brother Dale has been preaching he's not going he's not going to just come in and start cleaning your house out he's going to ask you or he's going to tell you through a five-fold Ministry what to do and if you don't do it then that you the door knobs on your side so I feel like there's a a big difference between believing in faith because the Old Testament people truly believed God because of the things that happened and what they were able to but Fai the revelation of his word and Who We Are that's that's the important thing because remember like this treaty was saying Abraham I don't believe Abraham got up one day and and God spoke to him and he said man I need to go live this life because somebody 2,000 years ago going to no they just got up and did what they were supposed to do God said get up leave so he got him left but now remember he's still human he took lot with him God didn't tell take anybody with him he said you didn't say you and your family so lot's first mistake was but now still God honored that right he still he didn't go away from Adam Abraham and say oh Abraham you didn't do what I said no he did part of what he said but he knew Abraham was going to continue the journey that's the difference that's the difference in every one of these people and the billions of people that were on the face of the Earth during this time these people people did something nobody else did they believed and kept on believing brother BR said Abraham the Reason God spoke to Abraham God knew that Abraham would take what he got from God and give it to his family now that's what he said you all the great things Abraham done God knew Abraham was going to sit down with his children and say hey this is what happened this is what's going on and then they could take it on down through the generation so let's start with by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of his gift of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh all right we're just going to kind of run through a few of these make a few more comments by faith Enoch was translated that's like the brother said the other night Enoch pleased God in the Old Testament didn't say a thing about him being translated he said God took him but Paul having the inward holy ghost that was there with Enoch right same one that was right there with Enoch comes over here in Hebrews and says it was translated in other words he was changed and taken up right that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him for before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God right but in Genesis just said Enoch walk with God and was not that was it now how you going to read into all that you got to have somebody come and break it down for you Paul came and broke it down down and said it was translated that he should not see death but without faith it is impossible okay without the Holy Ghost it's impossible to please God why cuz you're contrary that's right your nature is contrary you were born contrary to God that's right you were born contrary to his perfect will you were born contrary to his nature that's what we're talking about that's why these things cuz the things that we have in normal that's why brother R said a lot of these virtues people have them out there why because it's just in the nature part of of people to have P some people have a lot of patience some do not but once you become a Christian you can't fall back on that excuse and say well I didn't have Temperance then so I'm not going to have Temperance now now that's uhuh that's a cop out and God will not accept that one more time once you become a Christian once you become a Christian those are requirements not something that you say well that's just not my nature everybody understand that though being contrary a lot of that contrary still you must have these virtues to be sealed in by the Holy Ghost and to receive an adoption when you come to a position requirements that's right not well I I'm I didn't have patience before and I ain't got a whole lot now okay maybe so but it's required that you have patience but the Holy Ghost has patience everybody understand where I'm going with this it's not something out there you got to get right it's right here and you're the one that keeps it encapsulated or are are um in a Cell jail cell keep keep the you keep it keep the door closed you keep the door closed right but the goods in there you're the one free moreal agency go back to free moreal agency you're the one that can s okay God I've never had patience in my life with nobody but God you promise me that's promise you promis me that if you give me the new birth that that is in there and if it's a requirement you know what you're going to have to tell God God you're going to have to do it but God I'm going to allow you to do it you oh allow God yeah that's goes back to fre more agency you allow God to get in that door that's right but see God knows that if you're stubborn you're not going to have patience so guess what Temperance is where you're going to stop at and you're going to have to go by the grave die before the Rapture takes place that's just sorry that's just the way it is the only people's going to take a body change is going to have that headstone of love that's right cuz I believe brother Brown had that headstone of love and he still died so there's going to be a group of people that's got to have that so totally in them of course we know why brother rown had to go off the scene uh he couldn't be here because the of the uh next coming of Elijah two two Elijah you know you understand he's the fourth coming of Elijah and he had to go off the scene so the fifth coming of Elijah could come the Jew so he knew his time was short but you and I don't have I mean we don't have to worry about having an Elijah anointing or or being Elijah that's right we're a bride that says that we'll be changed in a moment 20 of the night right but you get the Holy Ghost and you got an automatic change change starts here then it works its way out that way you got a question I was just say I was just thinking if we know to say I know I have a problem with temper to say that I mean shouldn't we exercise our try to try to daily exercise like our self will I mean control to yes so it comes automatically we shouldn't just sit around and wait for that magic to appear and we should that's what I mean about about having to go get something you don't have to go get something it's already there you've got to exercise your faith and you know this kind of borderlines and I want to make this point real quick CU I got to go hook up brother George um this borderlines on the power of positive thinking but if you don't have the power of positive thinking for this see they have the power of positive thinking out there if you got you know you go to these motivational seminars well you know where it comes from it may not come from the word of God the guy may be the biggest sinner in the world but they they have a knowledge that the human body needs a certain kind of positive something to get it motivated okay if they would take the word of God and do that they'd be a lot better off cuz you just motivate a sinner and he's still a center right but you motivate a Christian you motivate a Christian what's going to happen is is everything's going to point back to the word patience is a virtue brother Brown said the first thing you got to have is patience with who god wow patience with your brother nope he said you got to have patience with God that he will do what he said he would do what he said he would do all right so let's read just a few more and then we'll go but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God cometh ongoing not just one time he that cometh that God must believe that he is is what all of it God just is he just is he's just he's just all of it he's before after during he he just is right and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him and there's your answer to your question you can have a spirit of of temperance and never be able to break that unless you ask God to break it you got a temper brother R said you still now remember even getting the Holy Ghost you're going to have a temper okay you got have a temper but it's how you make that temper act I said you make that temper act you have to to be real careful because it really is the power of positive thinking but you got to be positive on on faith faith to me is the most positive of positive of positive Faith cuz it's the substance of things hoped for the evidence of something you can't even see show me your Holy Ghost take it out and show it to me I see it by the reflection of what's on the outside to know whether you have it or not okay and you can fake it enough that's right you can than it enough to a point that's right these people that are going off you know these these Bel well they're not Believers but they believe in something but these people that are going off and going out come leaving the message and saying it's wrong and this that and the other they never had Faith they never had the baptism of the Holy Ghost CU brother R said you're contrary to the word until you get the Holy Ghost right you see why I'm not contrary to the word clud called me the other day and he's doing a great thing out there he's showing in the Bible listen to me now he's showing in the Bible the flaws of the Old Testament people but even the flaws of the New Testament people he is trying to prove to them people that they don't have the Holy Ghost he's trying to prove how many times has daddy said that he got it from Daddy how many times has daddy said I wished I could preach so hard that you all realize you didn't have the Holy Ghost because you can fake it right you can be an anointed one and be as lost as lost can be that's right but if you can ever find somebody that comes to a point that says God I can't go that way cuz I've got to I'm stopped I can't go that way the preacher has preached me that's what God wants today he's going to preach him in a corner he going to preach them in a corner and see how they get out you say that's pretty rough if it gets the results I wouldn't care what he done if he can get his 40 people to see they're all lost and he can preach the new birth and they all have a Revival and get the Holy Ghost that's what the problem in our churches are because the great people of Ephesus there was 12 people in the whole church all 12 had the new birth what a church to preach to right right I mean what what a great powerful group that's why brother R said it was one of the most powerful churches to ever be 12 people but they all had the Holy Ghost working in their life virtues remember group of Ephesus was a very mature group so they were versed in The Virtue knowledge temper patience because remember Peter was there Paul was there all the ones were there that had these virtues and they were teaching the people so Claus's doing a good thing I think he's doing well he he just said the Lord impressed on me he said I'm going to tell you he said I'm going to prove to you you don't have it you got to prove to me you do you say well boy that would be rough you know what if I found out I didn't have it right and I could then turn and seek it seeking you shall find that's right if I could turn around and seek it then what more the better that's right then for us to go through life like Daddy says go through life thinking we had it and we didn't have it ever pretty tough but by faith read the rest of this and we'll finish up this chapter we need to go so I can put brother que up so Lord bless you have a good week you are let's have
