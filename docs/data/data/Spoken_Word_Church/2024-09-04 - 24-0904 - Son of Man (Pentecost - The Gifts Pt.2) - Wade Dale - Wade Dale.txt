everybody there's 50 ideas in here right now because there's 50 people so like the quote we were saying you know a while back that uh you can't do anything about it but if whatever whatever tragedy you're in treat it as if it was something you thought of doing you know and it makes it a whole lot different so let's just keep these ones that are sick in prayer and let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you for the Lord Jesus Christ that saved our soul lord that sent us from a world of sin to a world of victory and father now Lord on the winning team Lord we want to hear more about you and you gave gifts in the church Lord ministers to to speak the word to the people so that they can understand you better father I pray that you be on that are sick they're not here we've had a many many that's not been here for a while Lord I pray that you'd touch their touch their body Lord and and touch their touch their heart Lord that they can believe that you are the Healer and they've already been healed before the found foundation of the world they just got to believe it father I pray that you'd be with the ones Lord that are here today that you would bind all the brokenhearted Lord that you would Lord set the captive free Save The Lost father break out amongst the people here Lord and and give us a Revival just in this little building father that we can't contain father we know there's one thing for sure you're God and you change not and you said if we'll ask we'll receive so father in the name of the Lord Lord Jesus I ask that you'd be with us tonight in the speaking and the hearing of this word Lord just bless it in Jesus name amen we're on the uh son of man we're talking about the day of Pentecost 1906 Aza Street and this will be the gifts part two so let's go to the Book of Joel Joel 228 said it shall come to pass afterward that I'll pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy now remember this is after the bugs already eat everything down he's going to restore all this and he's going to bring everything back and he's going to do it by listen there's a lot of spirits out there but listen you and I should be acquainted with the Holy One all right everybody with me there's many spirits out there but there's only one Holy Spirit and it acts different than any other Spirit you've ever seen in your life all right cuz it's holy and it's perfect so just remember that I'll pour out my Spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men will dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit you may be seated in the Lord by his Blessing to the reading of the word Acts 2 verse1 in the Bible this is when the Holy Ghost falls for the first time on a group of people to make them Sons and Daughters of God are are are bride you know I thinking today that began the Genesis 1 126 man all right most you Bible readers know what God back in the beginning in Genesis 1 he said let us make man our own image that wasn't all mankind that was his children that was his progeny and guess what brother Donnie we've come to the almost to the very end of all that being fulfilled all the Genesis 126 people that are on the Earth right now is it there's not another generation there's not another church to rise up this is it the ones that have gone on that is what they're they're in that sixth Dimension that is that Genesis 126 man that theophany of God that he imparted on the day of Pentecost 120 times right and then 3,000 times downstairs and you when you became born again so you fulfilled that Genesis I just Ryan I'm back to cutting grass and preaching again so I was doing that today and I thought you know that Genesis 126 man we preached on it so long till there's a large group of people in that Genesis 126 which is the Bride of Jesus Christ the ones that Rees the new birth not just an anointing the new birth not foolish virgin I'll I'll amen myself amen so but now brother Aaron we're down here at this very end of all this stuff of all this Genesis when he said let us make man in our image we're down to the very end because look when the last one comes in it's the one he saw before the foundation of the world and that closes up that Genesis 126 that's the whole theophany of God that he wanted to pour out on the day of Pentecost and now in isza Street 1906 and now tonight if you'll ask him to all right problem is sometimes we get scared of spirits you should be scared of spirits except the Holy One right we'll talk about that in just a few minutes cuz we got to learn we got to learn to let me put it this way we're going to have to learn as a church and as a body to handle the Holy Spirit we got to learn to handle it okay everybody with me so when the day of Pentecost was fully come now this is this is 2,000 years ago in ad30 just as when Jesus left the Earth he said go and wait until be you be endued with power from on high and pent Pentecost was Penta means five all right so on the 50th day after the Passover which Jesus was killed on the Passover cuz he was the Passover Lamb I believe this if y'all don't and when the day of Pentecost was fully come so that was the 50th day he said go Terry until you be endued with power from on high not from power from anywhere else power from Caiaphas or or any of those people on the Earth it came from what on high all right and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it set upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance and if you um what we were dwelling on this this past weekend was it's Pentecost Pentecostal experiences or denominations depend on the speaking that's right now on the day of Pentecost it was all in the hearing everybody with me Faith doesn't come by speaking in tongues where there's tongues they'll ceas hello where there's prophecy they'll cease right it was the hearing they heard each other in their own language what a miracle it would be if if we had you know four or five e ethnic group sitting here today that didn't speak English but all of a sudden I'm here speaking there's nobody interpreting and they're saying amen just as soon as you do that's the miracle of hearing the word of God in your own language cuz you know what let me let you in a little secret for eternity that's the way you're going to hear God that's right believe that we won't need an interpreter over there but I'll speak in English and if you spoke English here I believe you'll be able to hear me but if someone is we have our Hispanic Brethren they'll say Amen just as soon as they y'all say amen amen I just believe that cuz it's in the hearing not in the speaking so faith comes by hearing but that's why they put a lot of emphasis on the gifts and I'll read you a little commentary maybe this later tonight where it the speaking in tongues comes from from the lips coming out and and there's something that changes you know you think about a lot things but if you don't speak it how's it going to come to pass right remember brother B said what it was a thought God had a thought first then that thought developed into a word well you know what God's got a tongue shocker God's a man he's not a thing he's a man and he has a tongue he has a brain better than ours a tongue better than ours eyes better than ours but he were we were made in His image so you're looking at the image of God sitting here tonight right God wasn't a monkey god wasn't a bear God wasn't a leopard God was a man you know why I know God was a man cuz when the first person first thing he made that was human was a human mortal man that looked just like him and that's what sons and daughters are doing now we're being born as we were talking about Sunday by the Breath of God but it's not changing our outside form it's IMM morphing us IM inm morphy or moving changing our form back to that image that we were before listen Jesus Christ looked 50 years old on the earth he was only 30 we know that but he looked 50 everybody with me but what was inside of that man was that young guyy God has never been an old man right I don't serve a God that can't get up out of a chair hello that's hard for me to do but how many depictions of God have you saw as a young boy none think of it every time God is depicted it's an old gray-headed man with a cane or some kind of something it looks like he's all kind of feeble no my God's young always been Young Forever is he young amen you know why because you and I are going to be forever we're going to be young we might have to come down here and develop in our sin body and what I was talking about Sunday in this body cast that we're in but inside of this guy tonight you see there is a young boy about 18 to 20 years old am that's right well I'm going to buy me an amen recorder our sister may not know whether y'all believe it or not y'all not saying nobody saying amen it's don't strike your heart nothing else will you just sitting here like a bump on a pickle you know what a bump on a Pickle's worth not a whole lot they're only there to hold it so anyway on the day of Pentecost think about that on the day of Pentecost there was a sound of a mighty rushing wind it was a holy spirit that went into the people and what did it do it made them act like holy people all right everybody with me so if that's what happened on the day of Pentecost here then guess what God doesn't change he's the same he never does change thank God he's the only person that don't change his mind so you come down here to the end time to the lay out of sin Church age and he does the same identical thing he's starts it with a gift of speaking in tongues or a gift of Prophecy and we you know we when we read that about the isusa street there was a lot done with the tongues and interpretations but there was a lot of Miracles there was a lot of of uh wisdom and and all those different things that came into the church if you'll read those um that sister and older brother that they did the interview in on YouTube they'll tell you there was gifts every everywhere there was just gifts working all over the place everybody was in love and everything was just hunky dory and they were black white green purple and all other kind of people there I don't know about the green ones but or the purple ones either but there was people of all the nations come to Asuza to get under that an anointing of the Holy Ghost now listen some just got anointed cuz they proved it but some got the real true Holy Ghost and moved on with it and that's what you and I need to do today we need to get a refreshing to know that we have the Holy Ghost cuz I'm going to read you here in just a little while where the Bible tells us to grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed to the day of your Redemption so you can grieve it brother R I'll read you about six quotes he said God's timid he said the Holy Ghost is timid he said don't move he said have everything in order he said because if you don't the holy spirit will leave all right we think man he's just this real rugged guy no he makes you rugged right he makes you rugged when he goes inside of you he makes you rugged he makes you bald ain't that what he done with Peter and them on the day of Pentecost it made them bold so Jesus you know we read the Bible in Daniel thinking about this a few minutes ago says by his knowledge in Isaiah 53 he who who Jesus Christ shall my righteous servant Jesus Christ or God talking about Jesus we know that same person he just imorph it over into a body of Flesh my righteous servant justify many listen he had to be righteous if he wasn't righteous you're not righteous If he if we can't believe he was the sinless one the righteous one the righteous judge now remember in the Book of Daniel this is where the people get all this old old man look to God cuz he's called the wigged one or the Ancient of Days listen if you're Eternal if you're the Ancient of Days it don't matter what age you are you're going to be 18 years old because you're not going to move one way or the other but for us to see that he's a righteous judge that he puts on that white wig to show that he's the judge he's the jury if you don't get on his side he's the Executioner but remember that Holy Ghost is your Advocate though right he's the one that comes right here for you and if he's righteous and the judge is righteous and the jury's righteous what's the Bible say if God be for us who can be against us come on we got to realize that if God's for us if we're in on the right in the right place at the right time God's got to do something for us but remember you can have the Holy Ghost and still grieve it right okay you you are the one you are the one that if you go out to door and say well we had a real dry service today well it ain't my fault praise the Lord anyway God bless you Sister we it's the way we talk here sorry we just plain so we got a righteous God a righteous judge we got a righteous Advocate we got somebody that does not make a mistake on our side and he ain't just on our side he's in us on the day of Pentecost he didn't just go with them people he'd been with them for three and a half years he went inside of them to where when their hand mve God hands move when their feet move God's feet move right everybody with me so he justified many for he shall bear their iniquities in other words like we were talking before you were born in sin shapen in iniquity a spouse from your mother's womb a liar that's several scriptures put together but you were doomed and on your way to hell that's right this guy okay because of what happened in the fall in the garden someone had to become what Adam couldn't be Adam couldn't be the just one Adam fell Adam had a flaw right hello but God said hang on a minute I'll put in my I can't see you like I used to see you Adam but I'm not going to I'm not going to leave you I'm going to come back in the woman have a put a seed in the woman I'm going to have a I'm going to have a body I'm going to have a body cast I'm going to be born with a naval just like you are see Adam didn't have one so Adam couldn't be our brother he couldn't be our Advocate that Adam does I was there when he was born that Adam has a has a belly button but the first Adam does not I'm pointing to Adam back there not back y under I'm just wondering we meet that Adam that was back under under if he's still not going to have one you'll be known as you are right just something think about but that one's got one Adam Roberts by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities that's why he puts it in the sea of God's forgetfulness we've got to believe that that's where it goes that God did make a place that he can't remember everybody says God knows everything no he doesn't he decided that he didn't you know why he decided that he didn't because it couldn't be a righteous judge cuz all the people that are going to be judged it's why on judgment he didn't bear their iniquity they kept it don't keep your sin give it to God and you'll never have to worry about that again now later on you will but that one is gone my sin is gone it's in the sea of God's forgetfulness with a no fishing sign over there for he shall bear your iniquity and if he Bears my iniquity then I'm a sinless one oh come on somebody he's going to make us without spot or wrinkle is he well what's the spot iniquity watch's wrinkle an in iniquity he's going to take that away he's going to eradicate your past if you'll let him you got to let him though let go and let God do the work quit trying to figure this thing out for yourself right be still and know that I am God then God comes on it right down John 17 now this is this is my Lord's Prayer to me we know what the Lord's Prayer is but this is The Lord's Prayer to me cuz he say sanctify them I'm one of them I'm one of them I'm one of them sanctify them through thy truth so how are you going to be Sanctified now we're going to get to it in just a few minutes where John the Baptist looks at him and he says look I'm going to baptize you with water but there's somebody coming that's not only going to baptize you with with water he not going to do that he's going to baptize you with Holy Ghost and Fire cuz listen the it's got to take the fire of God to burn the old nature of you out right cuz he won't dwell in an unclean vessel even in sanctification what drives that unclean Spirit out the word of God the heat that's put on right this is a hot seat talk about Israel being a hot seat now this is a hot seat right here this is life eternal or life damnation they fight all they want to over there this is the greatest battle ever fought right here but God is praying he said protect them through thy truth Thy word is truth clean them up Lord and keep them clean don't just clean them up keep them clean as thou has sent me into the world even so I have also sent them into the world now why here's the father he IMM morphes into the son we don't believe a trinity here there's there there the watch the first commandment behold oh Israel the Lord thy God is three that's how simple one God is behold oh Israel your God is one now he has many manifestations he has many am morphes he moves his form he moves over into the sun he moves he's into the Holy Ghost now just like me I'm a human being but I'm a father I'm a son hello I'm a human I work for the post office I have all many titles but I have one name that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ not in titles of father son Holy Ghost I am a father but that's not my name I don't sign my check father amen I signed my check wait there because that what does that do that identifies me with the family that I'm in well praise God that's why Peter got up on the day of Pentecost and said repent every one of you and be baptized in the family name cuz you're in a another family until you get into this family and it's not a family of father son Holy Ghost it's a family of the Lord Jesus Christ as thou has sent me into the world even so have I sent you them into the world and for their sake the only reason Jesus didn't have a wife which you could have brother Brown said he could have and kids is because he said his itself aside for me and you because he became the Sanctified one we got to have a Justified one and if we're going to be Sanctified we got to have something Sanctified or the sanctifier to clean out and I like that sanctifier to clean us out for their sake I sanctify myself that they also might I can't do it no you can't but God can amen amen he come back on the day of Pentecost in the Holy form of the Holy Ghost to do exactly what he said he was going to do justify him he justified Peter for cussing come on somebody look at that he justified Peter from cutting off that guy's ear he Sanctified him and he breathed on him right here he breathed on him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now remember they didn't receive it right there they received a promise cuz remember the Holy Ghost was standing there I'm standing here today I'm a father son and a spirit I can't imorph my spirit out of my body but praise God he can praise God he did and he divided himself 120 times 3,000 times and probably now 30 or 40 million times and he got no less weak he's just actually more strong he breathed on him and said receive ye the Holy Ghost whosoever sins you remit they are remitted whosoever sins you retain they are retained that's why we need to watch what we say by your words you'll be justified and by your words you'll be condemned now that word breathe on he breathed on them and it's a Hebrew it's an expression by the symbolic Act of breathing upon the apostles the communication of the power of the Holy Spirit to them this is the this is from the Greek lexican all right this word used only once by the translators in Genesis 2:7 so in Genesis 2:7 as the commentator says just as the original creation now remember Adam was an original creation Adam Eve wasn't a creation she'd come out of Adam cuz she was Adam everybody with me she was Adam that's hard to believe but me and but me and Jesus are not two different people if you look at it that way we are if I come out and I'm over here but Adam and Eve had the same DNA same Source amen but as he breathed on Adam and breathed into his nostrils the Breath of Life guess what he did then he breathed eternal life into them then he come over here on the day of Pentecost and what did he before the day of Pentecost he breathed on them those two words are the only two words used those two phrases say breathed on them breathe on him breathe on them that means that just as the original creation was completed by an act of God the new creation was completed by an act from the head of the new creation born by the Breath of God they literally had the Breath of God breathed on them and listen you say oh that was back then and that was for them when you received the baptism of the Holy Ghost you had the Breath of God breathed on you inside of you you were clean you were ready he was ready and he stood there and said I am pleased to dwell in that vessel right there and we scratch our head why me Lord well guess what maybe you hadn't found your full potential yet but you will if you're a son and daughter of God you're never a failure never will be a failure never have been a failure God has never unloved you he can't do that cuz he can't change his mind he can't change his mind if he loved you from the beginning he loved that Genesis 1: 126 creation that he had because it was him he loved it and canine love it we just got attach oursel to that say God that's me you know why cuz he saw you down here say God that's me I'm going to accept that I want that inside of me to have dominion over the fish of the Sea and the foul of the air and all the different things dear brother Bram what's the difference when Jesus breathed onto the disciples said receive ye the Holy Ghost when they had to go to the upper room to Terry it was a promise he give them breathed upon them his promise and said receive ye the Holy Ghost it was a promise they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled listen it's a promise when you start this Christian walk it's a promise that if you'll go through justification sanctification repent and be baptized amen am I reading Bible this is a prescription repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ this is Peter right and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise isn't to you and your children them to far off my children going to get the Holy Ghost it's a promise amen that's right but you have to wait till sometimes years to fulfill that promise amen don't give up on your kids God didn't give up on you did he he r you down and Found You amen so I pray he runs mine down and finds them sir they got to find their yourself they went to the upper room to wait for the promise to be fulfilled the same thing as when we lay hands upon to be healed then we go on about our business waiting for the promise to be fulfilled what promise that you'll receive your healing listen there's a miracle then there's Divine Healing Divine Healing may take a period of time we've seen Miracles where something happens right right then right something be taken away right there cancer come right off of a person right that was dying only had 3 months to live I've seen it with my own eyes cancer didn't fall off it just went out of his body right and you know what that was a demon if we'd been able to see in another dimension we'd have seen a demon take off listen brother Brown tells us many many times he said all sickness is of the devil there's a demon attached to every sickness that you got right that's why we send the Holy Spirit to attack that thing I don't send mine yours or nobody else's I send the holy spirit because he's holy he's right he's never wrong and you know what he'll do what his word says praise God what a mighty God we serve so in the upper room Matthew 3:1 so here's here's John the Baptist he's telling them he said I indeed baptize you with water into repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I now remember what was John John was the third coming of Elijah first Was Elijah second was Elisha third was John the Baptist fourth we believe was a prophet in the end time William brandham and the fifth one is going to the Jews one of the two witnesses that's why they're look listen folks the Jews are looking for Elijah to come back cuz he said he'll go he told him in Malachi he said I'll send him before I smite the Earth with a curse they just missed him oh they're going to see theirs but they missed this one I indeed baptize you with water into repentance but he that cometh after me is mightier than I whose shoes I am not worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire now that's a conjunction so that's two things that go on that's a conun and it's a conjunction sometimes we only dwell on the Holy Ghost you got to bring fire right listen to this the future home I love the future home man it tells you about everything tells you about your Redemption tells you about justification sanctification tells you what the Earth's going to do tell you what your body's going to do we're not getting a new body the Earth's not going to be blowned away in a new one created God's going to reform and reshape this one blow all the sin out of it just like one day did the same thing you I never shall forget the day the burdens of my what how did that happen am God did it you didn't that's right and I'll promise you thus sayith the lord the devil didn't bless his poor heart everything he touches and he tries to he tries to get think it today he tries to get an army together I was thinking about that boy that shot alling people he tries to get an army together and by the Free Will of that person sometimes they just take their life then another one steps up and he says well use this one and here they go and get shot or here they go and do this or commit suicide cuz remember you're a free moral agent you never forget that even with the Holy Ghost you're still a free moral agent that's right all right Satan can anoint you to do something but if you what is that scripture it's real complicated resist the devil and he'll flee from you that's right but see they don't resist him so they can't stand it why do you think people go crazy that's a demon that's you trying to I don't know where this is going this is you trying to be good you're a human you have an innate ability to be good amen cuz you were born in the image of God you just got messed up down through here somewhere but you have an innate ability to say no you can say no no but when you're but when he when he's trying to anoint you the devil's trying to anoint you and you don't want it it'll drive you crazy and then when he does get a hold of you it drives you worse crazy I tell you what I want the Holy Ghost to get a hold of all of us and make us all crazy where the world will look at us and say them some crazy people that's what they did on the day of Pentecost wasn't it them people's drunk they've been in the bar all night well praise God they got a spirit all right but it was a Holy One amen praise the Lord feeling good now watch brother R this is future home it isn't going to just going to have another Earth now what's he explaining this body is not going to be annihilated listen everybody's body is theirs right come on cuz if you don't get born again your body you're setting inight is going to the white Throne judgment amen you're not going you're going to go in the body you send in well what's the body you send in the one you sitting in amen but if we're born again where are we sitting now we're sitting in Heavenly places already judged don't have to go to we don't have to go to judgment we took his judge he took our judgment and we identified with him what a mighty God he you can only do that you and I can't do that that's why the devil just messes everything up I think he even hates himself sometime praise the Lord that's fine with me but now what brother Bown said look what he said he said I'm trying to get the Plan of Redemption to you now here he is talking about this place that we're going to live for an eternity the future home of the Heavenly bridegroom B bridegroom and Earthly bride so he's trying to explain to us how everything's going to come back down here and and you know we may be crazy sister but but I don't think we're going to go sit on sit on clouds and play Hearts I can't play spoons so I'd be in real trouble and I really don't want to sit on the cloud for an eternity John saw the city John saw the city coming down here's where Heaven's going to reside right here my home is on this Earth cuz I came out of this Earth God created this Earth to be inhabited he created it to be lived on but he didn't create it for all this garbage to be lived on he created it for his children to live on he's the only one that can do that he made this great big ball and we think we can we think we can trick him I'm trying to get the Plan of Redemption to you before if I don't get nothing else so he's he's he's he tried to tell him about a future home he tried to tell him that that home's coming down from heaven that it's made of pure gold that it's going to be sitting on the mountain that it's going to be right here on the Earth but he's trying to get the Plan of Redemption because remember the way he redeems the Earth is the same way he redeems you because remember he will not step his holy feet on this Earth until all that's done but now he's stepping it today in me and you amen cuz he said that he said he was going to come back and go in us right if he comes in us that's God what's the great mystery the great mystery of this world is Paul said was Christ in you the hope of glory us getting older more feeble can't see can't hear somebody sent me a text message the other day and I wrote I sent them back I said I can't hear what you're saying somebody get that in a minute the B if you don't get nothing else the baptism of fire now here we go with the Holy Ghost and Fire this is where uh this will bring the picture together cuz listen you can receive the Holy Ghost on your spirit realm right and be lost you can be an anointed one the anointing can come down on you you could prophesy do as balum do as Kus do as different ones that did and be lost amen so you got to have the Holy Ghost and Fire amen right what what was on top of them people in the upper room LS of fire listen that fire will burn you I got burnt today my two fingers are still stinging I got stick my finger where you ain't supposed to and you get burnt no it's on me but God will burn you with a fire that'll burn everything out and never leave a scar what a great physician we got what a God that will take all that sin out put it in the sea of forgetfulness whatever ugliness it is gone and he didn't even leave a scar the only scar you got is what you got in your brain the greatest battle ever fought right here cuz God don't have this totally God's got your heart God chose the heart Satan chose this that's right CU you know what God is simple believe me or don't believe me two things in the heart right not heart thumping heart but your your soul all right but in your but in your mind you have memory reason conscious effects and Imagination things you live with all right that's where Satan can play but if he he can't play in your soul if if if God's got it God won't dwell in an unclean vessel and you can't listen Satan hates the fire of God he can't stand it cuz that's why he leaves all that we have the fire god just a little bit more in this church that don't mean shouting speaking in tongues that just means having a fervor to do more for God amen instead of just come to church getting gold stars that you came two weeks in a row some of you can't but two weeks in a row the baptism of fire on it only is to cleanse it now watch and make it a fit place for his Meek to live in one more time the baptism of fire on it only is to cleanse it and make it fit a fit place for his meat to live in cuz you go back to the scripture where that this is going to be burned off yes now the many people think this is going to be annihilated it's not going to be annihilated God created it for us to live on he can't change his mind remember but he's going to clean it off so that his holy people can walk on it like he did us his creation to live in before he could come in it all right where is he he's not there he's not the two two two a a holy thing and a and unclean thing can't come out of the Same Soul either one or the other that's right amen so he comes in and burns that old nature out he doesn't kill you he kills the you that you don't need to be but you don't die and the and the you know the thing flat lines then all of a sudden you raise back up no he kills that nature that's attached to you righten that motivated you to do what you're doing or have done before he could come in it he had to give us the baptism of fire now watch then the Holy Ghost come in and live baptism of fire then when we get that baptism of fire then the Holy Ghost can come in what as it does it burns up everything contrary to the word out of you it won't believe nothing else but the word because it is the word now that's what we were talking about the other night the evidence of the Holy Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost is when you can receive the word now watch receive the word not some system but have a clear understanding I have a clear understanding why I'm in this message I hope you do I have a clear understanding why I can't go feed on that out there in the world I have a clear understanding why this is it and there's nothing else you know why because the one that wrote the bibles inside of us how do you know the word is clear understand it watch it vindicate itself well you say I see this do it and that oh yes weeds live the same way cuz remember he talking about you know some Min Minister told me one time said now all the seeds there ever was was in the earth I told him I said I agree cuz he's talking about the seed being here I said but the bad ones were there too right where'd all the bad seed come from I know we know it came from the fall but where'd it come from it was there we must be careful but it's got to be the entire word listen to to be the bride you have to be part of him he is the word what part of him is it the word that's promis for this day when he calls his bride not in Luther's day not in Wesley's day not in Pentecost that we've been talking about this day right here right listen this day this scripture is being fulfilled this day the Bible is being fulfilled this day prophecy is being fulfilled today don't look for another day today it's been fulfilled you walk in that door and receive the word of God and it becomes more Godlike you have received the promised word for your day you know why because you Vindicated I didn't say hate it I said you Vindicated amen and what is a part of him the word that's promised for this day when he calls his bride be a part of it Ministry of Christ 1953 you know what I done I built a little fire and set the old boy on it he moved then what we need today is not Church joining or arguing about baptism just the Holy Ghost in fire that'll make any church move get the Holy Spirit back in the church and the apostles and teachers and so forth I wish some people read that the apostles and teachers and so forth ENT their places and let the Holy Ghost go to reigning on a church like that and see what takes place signs and wonders and miracles mirales will follow sure it will questions and answers 1963 we'll get started here now brother B tells us that each AE had the dip of the Holy Ghost justification is a work sanctification is a work but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet talking about himself to come down no Messenger to the age all right there's no mess of the age of Pentecost cuz the gifts came to be what to be brought back to life in the day isusa Street Pentecost because the Holy Ghost came himself in the fullness of the baptism but at the end of the age in other words at the end of the Pentecostal age brother Ram steps on the scene 1947 all right now he preached a lot time before that because remember 33 down to River he was preaching all right but his commission came in 1947 all right actually the year that Israel was made a nation but at the end of the age as it always ends up in the other we find there then The Messengers sent so there was no messenger the Pentecost Pentecost went from 1906 to about 1915 it says in the records and then it kind of dwindled a little bit more to the 20s and 30s and then it just splintered into every denomination there was out of that one Pentecostal movement that's why brother Bram come to rebuke the Pentecostals did he not rebuke the Pentecostals he rebuked them every chance he could why because they had something God had moved from the lutherans to the Westland from the Westlands to Pentecost being a prophet he saw that the anointing was not on them anymore it was on the Pentecostal but remember the Holy Ghost is timid the Holy Ghost does not like I'll read it in a minute that's why the Holy Ghost left them because the Holy Ghost brother R said loves order when you get out of order the Holy Spirit leaves I'll read it to you right here cuz every prayer line you hear what do he telling to do be still quiet and down Welly that's different than what we get now when we go to special meeting quiet and down now don't move around you're all Spirits right and the holy spirit's very timid I'm going to read it to you the holy spirit's very timid you do one thing wrong and he'll leave the building brother R said one time he did and he left and he said I was left standing there wow so in 8030 the Holy Ghost fell on 120 mature word tutored bride people all right that's the apostles and all the different ones cuz they listen they had to get it right to start with God had to make sure his word was right with no denominational idea to begin with cuz he knew it was going to fall he knew the seed was going to go on the ground he knew that there'd be a pommer worm kangar worm caterpillar and Locust according to Joel that was going to eat his word down not kill it eat it down cuz I'm going to read you quote here in a few minutes the Holy Spirit can only work with what word you give him that's why Martin Luther could only work and the Holy Ghost could only work just shall live by faith all right but now remember Peter steps out and he preaches a sermon probably 30 minutes or more or less I know that's what y'all want now but but 3,000 babies you babies listen to One powerful sermon right and they received the Holy Ghost as babies they didn't know what was going on they said men and brother what we do we ain't been tutored then remember a little bit further down in the book of Acts they go and meet a group of people I think it was House of Cornelius he was preaching that Jesus was the Christ you think the it had to come life had to come through the body it had they Peter had to come one time Paul had to come one time Paul says if you receive the Holy Ghost since you believe so we don't know if there it be one they must have not been near them 120 or those 3,00 am cuz they didn't know what was going on but listen they felt the pull of the day they do you not feel the pull of the day I feel the pull of the day yes sir be convinced as brother R said and then be concerned about what's going on right but now when it come to isusa Street they had already went through that that dying off stage right pmer worm head e canker Locust caterpillar come up with Martin Luther two shoots John Wesley a stalk Pentecost was the Shu kind of looked like the seed but it wasn't a seed because God's looking for that Original Seed that went in the ground he's not looking for the plant he's looking for the seed cuz that's what you plant again oh praise the Lord I hope y'all get that convinced and concerned but that predestinated seed don't ask no questions it's thoroughly convinced that it's God moving according to his promise in the Bible listen a little further up the road really than isua Street we should be what's he doing now he's rebuking them you're still back there speaking in tongues and you're still what having a fit and the Holy Ghost don't like it right the church should be up here here it started with a weeping crying coming to God and it's fell way away wait a minute this is 1962 that's 62 years ago he said it's fell away right if my math is correct close enough anyway but yet and it's fell away way away and here's something up here that the church should be up to meet it now he's talking about his message brother Brandon preached sure he preached 47 through there but when he started his message that was to a mature group that wasn't even there right think about it right there was no message churches made from Brother Brown's preaching until way after he died everybody went scattering again went back to different places Shepherd had gone Shepherd had been smitten sheep scattered right but look here they should be up to meet it but yet they're not convinced yet that's the reason it's not concerned amen so Malachi 45 says behold I'll send you behold I'll send you you you you you you you Elijah the prophet he didn't send it to a group of people he sent it to one person me you deal with it yourself behold I will send you Elijah the prophet I'll quote it before the great and de day of the Lord he's going to send this Elijah to do two things so he's going to send the spirit of Elijah and John the Baptist to do what to take him from the Old Testament to the New Testament amen this new thing babies then it's going to mature it's going to mature go in the ground the bugs remember the four bugs come back atza street but it came back on untrained babies because they were still looking at the doctrines from Luther Columbus all the way back cuz they they they they brought false Doctrine with them let's just say it that way they brought false Doctrine with him and God can't move in false Doctrine that's right he'll move but he won't move free in false Doctrine God's will is going to be done I promise you that but it is hindered if the holy spirit's hindered because of a kid running through the church right are bringing a bad spirit in but the second part is for me and you he's going to turn the heart he's going to turn our soul come on brother Brown didn't come to bring you the new birth that's right Jesus Christ gives you the new birth there's no mortal man on the face of this Earth can give you the new birth except one man and that's the Lord Jesus Christ amen through the Holy Ghost and morph Fe into the Holy Ghost so he can go out into more people than just one to me that's simply why the Holy Ghost was given so he could move as a spirit among his people amen and not just be Jesus walking down the aisle because if Jesus is all everything which he is if he's here on the earth ain't none of us in we're not included in that listen when he was here on Earth who understood that man not one person am all his disciples left him Peter lied three times cussed at him wow he picked a real good group of people well bless God he picked a real good people here too from All Nations tongues backgrounds brought us right here so he's going to turn the heart of the children and how's he going to turn it by the word amen all right by the pure word of God coming back in the end time he's going to send us Elijah the prophet before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord or lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse so brother randam steps on the saying what are they they're Pentecostal babies he's trying to bring them to maturity all right he succeeds in a degree but remember he he didn't say Rapture and faith lies in the churches right right right he said rapturing faith lies in these books and tapes these 1100 sermons that we listen to and that we Revere and that we listen to the voice of God telling us a clear way to believe I just praise God that I was able to even hear a little bit of what he was saying so what did brother R he has a vision in 1956 now this is 1956 he has a vision the angel says you can't teach Pentecostal babies Supernatural things you'll cause carnal impersonations which it did oil in the hand they had blood running out it was just all uh musician tricks is all it was now that's true now 1964 let's jump up just a few years later he's talking about the same thing he promised about the pull of that line remember he was fishing got all tangled up he said you can't teach Pentecostal baby Supernatural things and when I made that third pull he said now don't tell nobody about this you've been trying to explain that other why was he trying to listen he explained it to us cuz we're the ones we're the ones to get it everybody with me he was trying to explain it to babies mature stuff am they couldn't take it that's why when they said brother brandham was on his discernment he was of God but when he preached he was of the devil now that's what they said right that's a baby that's almost Blasphemous when I made that third pull he said now don't tell nobody about this you've been trying to explain that other don't tell nobody about this this is the great and final pull if you'll look from 47 to 63 you can see brother random trying to pull them Pentecostals out amen rebuking them and trying to get them to come just step up a little high I just read you the quote step up a little higher come on up here where I'm at in other words all right come into the perfect word as the song says right but they didn't they stayed where they was at so what is this all for it's all for me and you right the third pull is what it was not it was in his it was in its partiality when brother Ram was here but not in his fullness until right now cuz what is the third pull is to the totally lost people right to the bride church and totally lost we will be preaching to the totally lost people amen they still going to think they getting saved still what they think they getting the Holy Ghost read it to you in just a minute now let's look at this real quick 1 Corinthians 12 we're talking about now what what was restored on the day of Pentecost 1906 just several years ago you know hund and something years ago right what was restored the gifts all right the Holy Ghost come bringing the gifts to the people now what did it start doing it started cleaning the church up now we know man got involved and turned it right about about the other way about face we always do man gets involved we go the other way 1 Corinthians 12 wherefore now this is Paul wherefore I give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of God and that's a capital S so we know that's the Holy Spirit everybody with me so by the speaking by the spirit of God calleth Jesus the cursed that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord but by the Holy Ghost that's why they I mean they take his name in vain now more than anything they don't call on Jesus Christ like we do they say his name in vain horrible thing now there are diversities of gifts now he's he's talking to the Corinthians all right now there are diversities of gifts but the Same Spirit now remember watch watch this just a minute though but look over at the Devil the devil is one Spirit but he has many demons working with him right anybody with me all right so there's diversities of gifts under God but one Spirit overall right and there are differences of administration Apostles prophets or deacons Elders you know there are differences of administrations but the same lord and there are diversities of operations right we're a diverse group but it is the same God which worketh all in all but the manifestation of the spirit is given to every man to profit all right now look the manifestation of the spirit of God the holy spirit is given to every man to profit with all now watch for to one is given now look I'm goingon to read a quote here in a few minutes brother M said he can use one man to get up speaking tongues one time and one woman to um interpret and never use them again that's called a gift all right but now the as brother Dale always told us you know the the five-fold ministry is a is a predestinated gift it's a gift of God he gives you brother R will tell us he said these prophets he said but some are born prophets all right I'll read it here in just a second for to one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom now we're looking at non spiritual gifts and we say well we don't have any gifts working in our church because nobody stands up and speaks in tongues and nobody prophesies well that's what we're going to get to it wait down the road there's seven other real good spirits before we get to the speaking in tongues all right part of one is given by the spirit the word of wisdom now here's the definition according to the Greek lexican skill in the management of Affairs skill and discretion in imparting Christian truth Supreme intelligence such as belongs to God Amen we have the wisdom of God amen skill in the management of Affairs skill and discretion and imparting Christian truth I believe we have a wonderful ministry here we had one in my dad that imparted the words of wisdom because what they do that he use skill skill in what management of Affairs or skill and discretion in imparting Christian truth what the word of God Amen to another the word of knowledge by The Same Spirit now watch he keeps telling them look there's not a different Spirit working here one Spirit working one Spirit working there's only one Spirit many gifts one Spirit to another word of knowledge by The Same Spirit knowledge signifies in general intelligence or understanding the general knowledge of Christian religion that's why listen folks we study you will not get knowledge right that's right like brother Ryan said without opening your Bible how you going to read it amen without listening to the tap now listen I'm telling you I don't listen to tapes I read books I can't listen to tape I fall asleep my mind wanders but when I read a book I'm focused on it amen but look I'm not looking for knowledge for me oh yeah sure I am but I'm imparting it to you guys same way with you when that was something happened other day and I'm not going to go into the details but I was going to do something and I told Brother Bob about it and he said I wouldn't do that gift of wisdom brother gift of wisdom yeah you don't even know amen and it absolutely turned out perfect that's God that's God using a gift that I the pastor is going to do this Bob said I wouldn't do that so I didn't and worked out fine prise the Lord that's what I'm telling you we we're we're a body here right I ain't got all the answ I'm like Paul I'm the chief of the siners I need help right okay we all do but God put me here to guide you what does he do he didn't bring me here to make you a sheep I hope you're already sheep Shepherd don't don't lead cows I didn't say that to make any light of anything but okay I'll continue on he sent a Shepherd to lead sheep to lead them amen right right in the pass of righteousness and all that we know that all right there's got to be somebody but remember as I told him at meeting the other day I said look I got to give an account for you you don't have to give an account for me right hello right you know what brother R said about the bride about your bride he said you won't have to give an account I mean you'll have to give an account for your wife but your wife won't have to give an account for you well you're the Bride of Jesus Christ aren't you right amen and I'm the spiritual husband at the moment at the time under Christ headship that's why brother Dell always said he said I'll have to give an account CU there's no gifts working he didn't say no gifts he he's talking about the the Lesser gifts all the other gifts are working cu the we was working the other day right but listen we got to be able to yield to it though and not get all puffed up and mad about it right am I could have but it absolutely worked out the way it was supposed to thank you brother Bob appreciate that I'm giving you a rose in front of everybody because you really probably didn't even know what you did you don't but I'll tell you later and you'll go okay but now watch the deeper and more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion such as belongs to the more advanced a mature especially of things lawful and unlawful for Christians we have to be kept in line cuz remember sheep will scatter moral wisdom such as is seen in right living to another Faith now this is the this is the gifts to another Faith by The Same Spirit conviction of the truth of anything you got to believe it to have faith in it right there's a conviction there that you got to say I believe that Mary said be it unto me according to Thy word there's nobody since a dawn a time had a baby without a man hello just be simple plain and she said I'll do it well it had to be something down inside to tell her I'll do it be it unto me according to Thy word had you right that ain't nothing but the truth she had Faith or conviction that brother Brown what he said was true amen all right to another so when I started looking at all this Susan I I started looking at this I got to feeling better because we do have gifts working in this church we have gifts working in this church all the time the gifts of healing by The Same Spirit now what does that mean make whole to cure or heal you can do it natural or spiritual amen right to another the working of Miracles now this word this this is what got me when you look that word up miracles in the Greek it's the same word as you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come dunamus that word Miracles means dunamus which is strength or power inherent power power residing In A Thing by what by virtue of its nature listen if you had had a nature change you still got the old nature amen so strength and power miracle listen sometimes folks sometimes that's a miracle you get to church you just may not know that that's right to another prophecy a discourse emanating from divine inspiration in other words a prophecy can go forth but remember I didn't write it in here but brother B says a prophecy has to be put up by for two or three people there are certain of these gifts that if you speak up and say thus sayth the Lord Brother John your car is going to tear up don't go that direction if you go the other way you'll get home it has to be judged whether that's right or not and if it's wrong brother B said it's an evil spirit and you got to get it out of the church that's how good God is though a discourse emanating from divine inspiration and declaring the purpose purpose of God whether by reproving and admonishing the wicked or comforting The Afflicted or revealing things hidden especially by foretelling future events we've had that brother R's part of it we've had it in his church too to another Discerning of Pi now what's Discerning now look that s is little everybody with me look that s is not big it's not capital S so that's Discerning of spirits or judging whether spirit's right or wrong to another divers means many are diverse that's where you get the word diverse from to another diverse kinds of tongues now this what in the Greek of that word right there the origin of the expression is apparently to be found in the fact that in Hebrew the tongue is spoken of as a leading instrument by which the Praises of God are proclaimed and that's true you can't without a tongue you can't sing hello without tongue you can't talk right but you got to remember James talked about that little thing in your mouth too be careful with it it's destroyed Nations right the tongue is spoken of as the leading instrument by which the Praises of God are proclaimed and that according to the more rigorous conception of inspiration in other words something behind it everybody with me nothing human in an inspired man was thought to be active except the tongue put in motion by the Holy Spirit right now to another the interpretation tongu somebody speaks in tongues with an unction something behind it speaks in tongues to another the interpretation of tongues somebody's got to be there to interpret to listen to it and then speak it to interpret are to translate what has been spoken or written in a foreign tongue into the vernacular which is your language your own language right you hear on the tape somebody get up and they'll prophesy or they'll speak in tongues you can't you won't understand a word they're saying then all of a sudden brother R waits for just a few minutes or a few seconds sometimes brother or sister will pop up tell you exactly in English what what they that person was saying right see that's the spirit of God you can't the only problem is it can fall on the just and the unjust that's right that's why the Bible says prophecy will cease tongues will cease but charity will never cease but all these worketh that one and the self-same big ass Spirit dividing to every man severly as he will all right God will for as the body is one and hath many members all right body is one many members and all the members of that one body being many are one body many they're still one body for by one Spirit are we all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we be Bond or free and have been all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many right he's talking about us there is one body of Christ he's one but he has a many membered body sitting here in front of me today today is the bride right now listen to this the prophet tells us I think it's 1964 54 now this is the truth of God that's the truth anything contrary to that is not true but that is to the Nations to the people The Plan of Salvation but to the individual now watch then sometimes after God sending his word this way and ministers to preach it he sent to the church Apostles prophets Gifts of tongues interpretation of tongues that's all for the edifying or keeping clean of the church bringing the church together in other words separating out the evil right I don't I believe that every I believe that every thing speaks with tongues hasn't got the Holy Ghost but yet I believe the Holy Ghost can speak with tongues see sure but then if there be someone speak with tongues like a gift of speaking in tongues would speak in tongues then there'd be one interpreted well then that one then one that interpret it would speak something to one of the congregation or tell them something that happened three or four judge it get before the church the church accepts it see brother R tried to set the thing up where they wouldn't just do it in the in the sanctuary what you're supposed to do is is take it into a into a room and sit and wait for the Holy Ghost to fall one prophesy one interpret and they write it down sister June you better not go down this road because they're going to be a tree fell across the road that's the way it's supposed to work but the Pentecostals they couldn't help it I didn't bring the quote but y'all know a the quote that remember that woman every every night brother BR said I know she's fixing to stand up she's getting her garer ready she's pulling her you know she's getting everything ready she's slicking her hair back and she said he she quenched the spirit of the prayer line for two nights in a row and that's when he told her to sit down and shut up you're out of line and boy they didn't like that now that gift of Prophecy or gift of interpretation of things ought to be in every local body every local church should have it' be on one tonight on one on another one night not just one person all the time all right on another the next night another one the next night another one this time another one that time it's in every local body he said that's what the little breakup comes with the Pentecostal people about the lat rain movement there's quite a difference now watch he's trying to explain something there's quite a difference between a gift of Prophecy and a prophet amen all right they couldn't divide it in the Pentecostal churches they put them all together right a gift of Prophecy is in the church we just read what it was but a prophet is born a prophet that's the difference this man might prophesy tonight he might never prophesy no more it might be that that woman over there the next night this man back here and that one over there but when the gift of Prophecy is operating it cannot be received unless two or three judge it now listen you don't judge a prophet he's a Divine revealer of the word you can't judge a prophet God judges a prophet that's why brother Brown said I made a horrible mistake the angel came in the room told me I was preaching this wrong and make it right they ain't no cheer there ain't no uh Church uh Minister from another church come up and knocked on brother Baron's door and said you ain't preaching that right no God did it himself amen but a prophet singular p r o p h e t is born a prophet comes up a prophet everything he says in the name of the Lord is absolutely truth if he's prophesying but now it doesn't come by laying on of hands if you lay on hands I know what you're thinking about he must have discerned somebody's thought about the preser in the Bible that's just some boy who raised up in a church then they know he's going to be a preacher they see the gift working in his life then they have ordination service just like we did not long ago now now gift has to First be recognized to be in the Bible all right right then if God confirms that gift then it's true then he ought to believe that the man is true but if God doesn't testify of that gift now if he doesn't watch well then if that gift is testified by God then God gives the man the gift if God says so you have no right to doubt it well now a gift of Prophecy gift of discernment gift of wisdom gift of knowledge and all these things are divine nine gifts that set in the church and oh God grant today that when we call all these together come together and see all these nine spiritual gifts moving through the church operating the whole church body then we'll have the Rapture what's holding up the Rapture the nine Divine gifts working in the church if we can't have faith for Divine Healing how are we going to have faith for rapturing Faith the church has got a ways to go but I believe God will do it so do I he's doing it now now listen to this this is a few quotes and then we'll stop three Witnesses 1951 well now sometimes if the people if there's noise or excitement or something the holy spirit's very timid very timid just the least little thing grieve it away that's why I'm sorry I deal in the least little things if you don't come to church on time you walk in here 2 minutes before the service starts you bringing every devil you ever had in church with you sorry well you can get quiet if you want to but I'm telling you what this ain't just what brother brandham said right everybody with me the holy spirit's timid but I want to ask you something 1954 you know I don't know you he's in a prayer line now we just got plenty of time that's why one this coming weekend y'all have a Revival no time constraint stop looking at the clock worship brother Bob preach brother but now watch now look look look right here though this is this is what struck me watch now we just got plenty of time don't be in any Rush see you get to rushing rushing not rushing rushing the holy spirit's very timid and I don't want you to rush I want you to be reverent like you have plenty of time amen 1962 testimony on the seat brother Brown said be alert the holy spirit is very timid how many knows that very timid it just won't tolerate nothing wrong amen that's why you better clean it up when you walk through that door I mean come on people I know people rush in here but you don't rush into a doctor's doctor visit you get ready the day before you miss that doctor's I'm going to start charging 50 bucks tell yall know what I'm talking about me you miss a doctor's appointment or you're late guess what happens you get a bill for 50 bucks you get a late fee right well if you going to take your devil that you got inside of you that's working in your body come on somebody God didn't God ain't in sickness and you walk into there and you say I got to get there I got to get there I got to get there listen bring that thing here bring it here and say I got to get it here but don't come rushing in five minutes before the service starts you are hindering the service period period that's right brother R said 20 minutes one time he said 30 minutes and you know why cuz he sees the Holy Spirit he saw people that were rushing in he saw people he could discern that it just won't tolerate nothing wrong now watch this identified Christ 1964 the holy spirit is timid now watch very very timid amen and where you have just one unbeliever or a skeptic sitting around the Holy Spirit just can't work hardly remember Jesus let a man Plum out of the city now listen this is the word himself this is God Almighty in human flesh he had to take somebody away away from an unbelieving house so he can heal him remember Jesus let a man Plum out of the city to heal him one time to get him away from unbelief he cannot do nothing against your belief you got to believe it 1959 quiny Sheba we'll be done just second he's talking about taking people this he was explaining really why they have prayer claws I mean uh prayer numbers prayer cards cuz you line them up you got a line you got what you don't have confusion right cuz even when remember that little woman that the her baby died the little Hispanic girl her baby died that morning he said it 12 ushers couldn't stop her they'd be trying to hold her and she'd run under the legs well she wanted a baby to well she got what she wanted right and they' break through the line and jump over one another run through the legs of the officers trying to get through why you you couldn't pray preach or pray for the sick like that there's too much confusion the holy spirit is timid everything must be decently and in order for the Holy Spirit that's why we don't have kids running that's why we don't talk unless we absolutely have to we don't talk while the service is going on or before the service there's a reason for that it's not just a law of the Ten Commandments written in something right yes sir I really wish well no I don't I was going to say I really wish one time God would open the portal and let us see into another dimension just for about 20 minutes before service starts there wouldn't be nobody here and scare you to death I've seen it get on people I've not seen dark stuff but I've seen it get on people and change their change their U facial expression amen we need something to work on before the Holy Ghost can ever go to work he's got to have something to work with I know y'all quiet but please do you know that's right oh this Pharisee age that we're living in I tell you I'll never let a 10 seventh grade dummy tell me now he was a seventh grade educator he was talking about I come from so and so I got a college education but you haven't gotten gumption enough to how to control it maybe that might mean a lot different brother I'll tell you Paul had one too but he said he forgot everything he ever knew in order to find Christ the trouble of it the church needs today we need to dump all out a whole lot of stuff so we can be filled up again here was 120 green bottles setting up there talking about the day of Pentecost all of a sudden there came new wine from heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind it filled those little old green bottles until they got growing pains praise the Lord and they just bounced all over the country saying this is that brother if this ain't that I'm going to keep this till that comes what it takes to overcome all unbelief persones Apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors these five god-given gifts in the church so each of you people who has a Godly Pastor has a gift from God in your church a Shepherd pastor means a Shepherd to watch over the flock teach them the word of God then these other nine different spiritual gifts should be operating in the church to keep the church clean like the Anan s of fire we talked about it Sunday it was a husband and wife team they conspired to lie amen and they both died for it they didn't lie to Peter Peter said you didn't lie to me you lied to the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost discerned it Peter probably didn't even know until they walked in and and God revealed it to him right remember brother Bown said what did I just say what the Holy Ghost took over and spoke through his through his vocal cords but ananas and Safar they held back a little bit of tithe maybe or maybe a little bit of something and but they both conspired to do it that's the whole deal and the Holy Ghost discerned it and they both lost their life and so forth the spirit of God rise up and call somebody out and tell them they're living wrong rebuke that sin openly boy we don't like that do we and that's what the holy spirit is in the church for to keep keep the church clean and ready for the coming of the Lord let's stand our feet God bless you come on musicians keeps the church perfect clean and ready for the coming of the Lord then you get down to where brother B said he said why don't you teach them these gifts brother B said I got to teach them their ABCs first before they don't have common decency enough to clean themselves up and act like Christians how you going to tell them spiritual things about Heavenly things that's right let the Pentecostal Church straighten itself up get right with God and I'll prove to you that the holy spirit will come right right in while this church will be so full of the power of the Holy Ghost there can't be one member do one sin then we read that last Sunday charity never fails all these other things I talking about fail but love agape love wins every time Paul said we know in part we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect is come that which is in part will be done away with in other words all the bottles will be taken up all the pacifiers that's right amen all the ground up food it'll be meat that's right praise God let's sing a song God bless you oh once was lost in sin but Jesus took me in and then life from Heaven F my soul he bath my heart in love and he wrote my name above and just a little talk with Jesus makes it right now let us have a little talk with Jesus tell them all about our trou here our faintest cry he'll answer by and by feel little prayer will turnning you no little fire is burning find a little talk with Jesus makes it right sometimes my past seems Dre without a rain cheer and then a cloud about me hi the line of day all we may have but just a little talk with Jesus clears away talk with Jesus clears away sing it to him now let us have a little talk with Jesus you ever talk to him talk to him like a friend like he standing right beside you I do all the time that's how I see God he'll listen if you'll talk to him is burning find a little talk with Jesus makes it right oh you may have doubts and fears your eyes be filled with tears but Jesus is a friend who watches day and night I go to him in prayer he knows my every care you know Prayer Changes Things you know oh let us have a little talk with Jesus tell them about our trouble hear our fous cry answer by and by feel a little prayer will turning you know little fire is burning find a little talk with Jesus makes it right don't wait till Sunday don't wait till Wednesday he's ever present help in time of trouble go to him all the time every time [Music] little burning no little fire is burning find a little talk with Jesus makes it right remember this weekend we'll be gone just pray for us for safe trip up up and back uh they've been before but I've not been so we should have a good time in the Lord we sure uh appreciate Brothers going with us and we appreciate brother Bob taking over for the service and like I said one service this weekend starts at 10:00 so brother R will come up here at 10:00 not 9:45 10:00 and then it'll be just regular whoever's doing Sunday school to do Sunday school sing a lot longer brother Bob don't need to get in the pull pit till maybe 12 1 two don't get scared he won't be very long he will be very long so you need to get him in the pull field about 1015 listen have freedom in the Lord that's why we want to try this like I said brother man said let's don't rush things you know how he used to stand he stand and talk to certain people longer than he would others right you know what he was doing remember he said he was contacting their Spirit Well some people's Spirit probably was so muddled up to he's trying to get through all the muddle to get to their Spirit but some people come up and he said oh I I see you're a Christian I I feel a a kindred spirit and he could just jump right in because they were believers they were they already had one part of it already done they were believing and he could just talk to them because the Holy Spirit was what was timid but it was right there but man let's don't grieve that thing and I didn't bring that quote I'll bring it next next time I preach where brother R said he said the Holy Spirit left the platform and I was just standing there listen he was a mortal man he had a gift but remember he was waiting on him to bring that gift of of of discernment he didn't have that gift all the time right he said I'm waiting on him well him was the Holy Ghost right in that form to come to talk to you amen all mind's clear pray for brother Bob come here and support him this weekend and we'll uh brother Aaron will be speaking Wednesday night and just remember the ministers meeting the next Saturday if you can help for a little while see sister June and we're just going to make sandwiches and put them together for the for the ministers and and uh hopefully we'll have a good time in the Lord Brother Bob's going to speak so that'll be a good thing to uh have him kick it off and and he might get kicked k out but he'll get he'll kick it off so just pray for him what did your brother random say he said I had more problems with what preachers than anything else right that's what he said but we going to have a good time in the Lord we had had one in a while and it's a good subject brother Bob's going to speak and I believe he'll do a wonderful job and then uh brother Jason Watkins so just keep him in prayer and keep us in prayer for traveling and we'll be back Sunday afternoon sometime so let's bow our heads Lord Jesus thank you for the evening you've give us thank you for a group of people Lord that's that's come under this roof father to hear from you Lord and had confidence that they'd hear something that would help them Lord and I pray that something has been said that'll help each and every one of us Lord that we'll leave this building better than we came in

he said lay all your cares on me for I care for you Lord sometimes we try to get involved oursel but Lord we just lay them at your feet father all the things Lord is that's um we're struggling with in life I know we all have different struggles in different places different ways Lord let us just lay it at your feet and watch you the Holy Spirit take over the perfect one the perfect one that can do
