Lord had a good time Bible Study last night really it's good that's a good question and some good answers so let's turn Revelation chapter six we're on the third seal it's sister Anna Connor okay right all right chapter six verse five and when he had opened the third seal I heard the third Beast say come and see and I'll be held in a little black horse and he that set on him had a pair of balances in his hands and I Heard a Voice in the midst of the four beef say a measure of wheat for a penny three matches of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine all right let's go over to Matthew before and read that part that Jesus was speaking to the disciples about the third seal which will be Saint Matthew chapter 24. verse seven because watch now remember we're looking at a progression of God but we're also looking at progression of the devil remember he goes from just being a saying to a deed to a Doctrine to a full-blown hope all right all right or someone that they can Crown look at the number verse 5. now watch this in the natural sense for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many verse 6. well that was the first seal verse 5 verse six is the second seal and you shall hear well it's not here of wars here of wars and rumors of wars see that there'll be not trouble for all these things must come to pass but the end is not going to come now look at verse 7 is the third seal for a nation shall rise against Nation they're going to battle it's not just rumor Wars it was happening it wasn't just a rumor it wasn't just a saying or a deed it became a Doctrine somebody said I'm declaring war on this person here we're going to battle all right right you see that you see the progression see look for a nation shall rise against Nation see out here in Kingdom Satan against Kingdom gods all right Kingdom of Satan is going to be fighting against the kingdom of God and that shall be famines now what does say not to do hurt not the oil in the wine all right and pestilence and earthquakes in diverse places all these things are the beginning of Sorrows see now look you go to the fourth seal which we're not doing now but look at verse 9. then shall deliver you up it's not Nations fighting against Nations watch it narrow down more and more now they're coming after you not just the United States fighting Russia or Satan's kingdom and God's kingdom it's come down to where Satan's kingdom is fighting you and they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and kill you it's not just Nations not just the same it's not just see that shall say I am Christ verse five say it mouth verse 6 here verse 7 is going to happen same way with justification justification you say you're a Christian you start trying to act right then you come up and you shall hear what what's the first thing you got to do in sanctification you got to hear the word of God because that's what sanctifies you right right you got to not just say I'm a Christian you got to start what you're in the word all right hearing the word all right in verse seven then you got a war remember Black Dog white dog there's no war before that you're just a devil now you got God come in and clean the shovel up but the devil's still playing with your body and your spirit so you got a war it's not a rumor anymore it's a battle because remember this third seal times what the baptism of the Holy Ghost we ain't got to do it yet but if what it does this this justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost third seal death with this old guy someone's got to die because you can't be newborn if you're the old person see he knew the natural part yeah but Jesus said you can't you can't understand that that's not natural happening that's a Heavenly happening right that's Supernatural not natural the natural happening he was looking at he could see Nicodemus in the product of the natural Act but he said Nicodemus in other words you got to be born again and that doesn't say b-r-n-e-d it says born again we get into that later he said you must be born again what Jesus said born from where above a new birth all right same thing well here's the nations are going to rise against Nation when did you start having all your real battles when you became a Christian that's right right that's right Nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom if you'll read through all these and we're going to go all the way down through it you'll see what we were talking about even in Abraham's life last Sunday with Abraham's Life coming down typing justification saying everything has to type those three there's no way you can get around there's no way you can get around foreign these times there's no way you've got to go through justification you've got to go through sanctification you've got to go through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to be born again not born from your mama but born again born from above all right a new birth all right so let's go never get away from that let's don't ever get away from the New Birth let's don't ever get away from being justified let's don't ever go get away from being Sanctified I want you to keep that in your mind because even when brother Brown gets to the uh future home he types this world going through the same thing and anytime then he tells you you're going to go through the same thing water and Noah's day blood when Jesus dripped on the Earth and the Earth remember goes after us we get our fiery baptism here for those of us that are born again we've had a fiery baptism already had that burnout but the natural world is going to get a fiery baptism the Holy Fire God is going to burn this thing up in the Battle of God in Magog when all the spirits are killed and we come back to rule the rain now the one the Millennium is not that's not the fire of God remember it's not the fire of God that's man's fire that's Atomic waste that's atomic explosion the man is going to destroy this world but after the Millennium God's going to come back and Satan's going to rise up and and God's going to kill him with not nuclear fire of nuclear fire you still have no it's going to be wiped off clean then he's going to come down with the city and guess who's going to be in the city you and I all right so everybody understand that's where we're up to as far as the third seal natural happenings spiritual happening all right pair of balances wheat and barley what did it say right here there shall be famines now you say well that's natural yes but that's also a spiritual family what did the Catholic church do they took all the wheat and barley away from the people and said we got it we'll give you what we want to give you same wave of famines and pestilence and earthquakes in in many places and all these at the beginning of Sorrows all right so now let's get our seal book out let's read what the problem said on page 234 if you have the regular book but it's paragraph 250 in the third seal paragraph 250. third seal all right everybody got it paragraph 250. third seal that's where we're going to start today we're going to properly explain try to get the basis of what we're looking at all right everybody got it huh this book right here paragraph 250 of the third seal don't go look at 250 in the first seal now the breach or the it says the third sale yeah if we wait on you baby all right you need a book yeah uh somebody got a bookmark okay okay all right everybody guys say Amen okay we're there I got a few 50. now if you get Spanish reading the scripture all right now a lamb has got the book in his hand breaking the seal he's broke the first one second one and now he breaks the third one and as he breaks it the lamb breaks it the third seal the third Beast now how many knows what the third Beast look like look like a man remember lion ox man and Eagle all right the first one looked like a lion the other one looked like a calf or an ox and the third one looked like a man as a man and he heard the living creature of the Beast living creature like a man say to John come see what it is this mystery that's been hit all down through the years of redemption since the foundation of the world has been hit under this seal what's going to happen now come look what it is so he opens it up a thunder blast and the lamb opens the seal see there so it's not that the Thunders are sounded on the first field the Thunder sounded every sealed you see you read that right there let's read it again so he opens it up a thunder blast and the lamb opens the Seals All right what did he see he seen a black horse paragraph 253. and his rider had a balance or scale in his hand now that's the first thing he saw when the lamb announced it broke the seal then the other BC then beasts are taking turns about announcing come see and John where he was standing may be like this he walks over here when the lamb opened and walked over usually the Thunder strikes as we've seen the first seal he watches to see what takes place and he sees a man coming first on a white horse he watches him ride down on down through John sees him Plumb to the end but you know Donnie and I were talking about yesterday that horse that horse didn't go away that horse is still riding that's why you can't talk to most people in the world they've got a white righteous attitude I got it and most people on the message the same way I got it you can't tell me nothing else all right once you get that you know what horse you're riding on all right and he sees a man coming first on a white horse who watches him ride down and on down through John sees him plunged to the end he sees him come down his White Horse got a bow in his hand the rider has has no Arrows with it the next thing he sees he gets the crown rides right on through and we find out the lamb Here Comes again he opens another one and look here comes the red horse this man has a sword in his hand he rides on down through the scripture see see he rides on down through the scripture this is a religious demon he's not riding through readers died yet Penthouse Magazine Cliff he's not running through that he's a religious devil he's riding through the scriptures because he's given his own interpretation of the scripture you see that actually I didn't have that underlined I just see that so I I just saw that okay so all right you gotta listen to what brother Brown says he he don't just fill up space with words all right he rides right on down through the scriptures see with this sword in his hand and was to kill and take peace from the earth now the lamb opens another seat another one of the living creatures like a man says come and see now he walks up he saw my John he walks up to see what it is when he does there comes a rider on a black horse now last night we found out that the same Rider that rode the White Horse with the same one on the red one and the boy said in the midst of the beast called out you see there come to see what it was he was in this living in this living creatures and he saw this Black Horse let's stop right here for a second I want everybody to understand one thing those four creatures lionox man and Eagle do you know what that is bottom line that's the Holy Ghost right that's the Holy Ghost bottom line you can call it whatever you want to call it as far as intelligence and sacrificial locks and and Eagle be able to but it's the Holy Ghost bottom line those four living creatures because when we get to the fifth seal brother Brown says the raster takes place on the force seal and he types it and shows he said see those creatures are not on the earth anymore so what happened now the four seal didn't say a thing about the Rapture taking place but in between the lines we read the love letter that brother Brown was telling us that Jesus wrote to us that hey once those creatures are have disappeared the bride has to disappear because that line oxman and Eagle was given to the bride to protect us go over into Ezekiel they stand faced all four corners whatever you need that's what they're there for to do they're they're symbols to of the Holy Ghost in The Believer combating that living creature is not just not doing anything he's moving read Ezekiel he's moving all the time moving forward and it's like I think Ryan had a question about that one time remember a couple years ago or something you wondered how the there was four creatures but they all were walking forward well you have to just look at it more like a like a movie scene you know lionox man and Eagle it's kind of like a hologram you know what a hologram is hologram is you see something here but you can move over a little bit and there's something hid behind that a different image if you need the line if you need the oxman and Eagle they're always going forward but you may not need them all at one time and we're not Catholics to call on the line call them no we've talked to the Holy Spirit but in our brains we're supposed to realize in our in our intelligence that God give us not intelligence about the intelligence God give us we're supposed to see that that line is bold we're supposed to be a bold Christian but sometimes we have to be sacrificial in the work that we do we have to be intelligent as man is intelligent you've got to hear the word first all right and you got to be in Talent the intelligence of God always defeats Satan always and then the eagle is we can see further than anybody in any age but you don't go praying uh to a lion image or an ox or a man or an eagle get that that's Catholicism get that junk out of your head but we do realize that they're there for our protection the lion oxman and Eagle just like the just like in the uh when the when they camp it's with the ark line ox man and Eagle each one of those had like the line of the tribal Judah Judah was right here with his Bantam with his other two you had there's 12 12 tribes right three six nine twelve twelve trials and that's the same thing in Ezekiel Ezekiel said there was man lion ox man and eagle and each one of these banners tribe of Judah so he had Judah over here he was kind of the head but he had two others that was with him on this side the Ops was Reuben or somebody I think it was on this side didn't the man and then the eagle but what was it protecting what is this right here this was the holy of holy which is what type of what the Holy Ghost the New Birth the believer there's no way if an enemy come from this way they didn't just have to fight Judah but they kept enough people around here in case in case the devil made a put a back door slip on you you get my you get my drift you understand what I'm saying in life there's something there to protect your backside there's something here to protect here if they attack from this way this way this way or this way now these didn't you know in a natural battle you would who in the world would take all if it attacks from here who in the world would take all these and run them all over here well if I was a good enemy that's the first thing I'd do I'd make a sneak attack around on the backside I'm just saying natural but that's what God's doing for us protecting the holy of holy brother Brown said Matthew Mark Luke and John protected the what book of Acts which is the actual the Holy Ghost and the believer so he got the book of Acts you got Matthew Mark Luke and John which was the Lamb's protection right here was the most important thing to Israel nobody got into that all right until they sinned in the natural type they had the sin to give us a chance all right but they backslid and let them take the holy of holies and tear it apart and do all that stuff you know in a spiritual that can't ever happen once you get the Holy Ghost what the Holy Ghost is in that holy of holies in in the in the inside Satan can't come in there and get it that's right but he sure can find a battle all four ways so the lion oxman and Eagle was given now when brother Brown saw them gone in the fifth seal he goes back and the Holy Spirit says they're gone brother Brown probably asked a question they're gone where are they he said they went up with the bride so the bride takes a Rapture after the four seal which is justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost and the word made flesh that's your four remember it was Palm warm canker worm caterpillar Locus four ate it down four has to bring it back all right there's only three just in case they came back in the Holy Ghost but you got to have that word incarnate This Is Us in the end time line ox man and what eagle see further see higher man intelligence that's good but that eagle can see a lot further the word incarnate is what we're looking for in the end time everybody understand that I'm kind of stuck on that but let's stay stuck on it for just a minute make sure that we know that this we're not just talking about a symbol of a line symbol of an oxman no that's the Holy Ghost in your life teaching you and training you like I said before get all the images out of your mind that you got well unless I'm going to be gold bold I got to pray to the line no that's Catholicism it's the Holy Ghost it's the characteristics of the Holy Ghost one day I'm going to preach on the characteristics of the Holy Ghost and it'll be real good because I've already got some thoughts on it actually this morning I got a few thoughts on it but the Holy Ghost has a characteristic because it's a person Holy Ghost is not just a spirit right it's a person brother Graham said the person of Jesus Christ come to you to baptismal Holy Ghost who is that that's the Holy Ghost it's a person it's not just a spirit that moves somewhere it's God you can fly right into the sun right sure and I'm telling you it's it's just a you know and I made a statement last Sunday I think and and out in Kansas and I wasn't doing it to be boastful but but the lion couldn't take us another word Luther's message it was bold Oh my he protested that Catholic Church he was bold he spoke bold that first three ages spoke Bowl ox Luther and Wesley they have they were just they they just got enough to get in the body and and become a Christian but there's more requirements As you move higher right right more requirements line ox man Eagle you're going high you're you're stack the stature even of the animals are higher but the line you won't miss you don't want to mess with a line he might be just this tall all right you don't want to mess with him though he's bold but he can't see very far right he has to get up on the hill to see down in the grass the auction's a little bit higher he can see the line coming the man's got the intelligence to be able to see and understand everything that goes on around him but you know what if there's a mountain right over there I can't see past the mountain I can see further but I can't see past the mountain but the eagle he gets up so high until he just every time he flies he just keeps seeing more sky more of the curvature of the earth more than he doesn't there's there's as long as he keeps flying even over the Rocky Mountain doesn't matter if he's in the Alps he flies right over the top of that and that's what we're in the end time that's what we are not making us anything but God made us his way God made us to what we could see where Luther couldn't preach this message Luther couldn't teach the seals Luther couldn't teach the sanctification like we know sanctification Wesley could teach sanctification but not like sanctification we did because see he went lean more to the Natural part where T didn't have any uh natural ingredients in it that would help you so quit drinking it you know quit this and quit that but see in your journey you got to do that you got to start quit doing this and quit doing that in sanctification all right so here we are in the stage of the of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we see a pair of balances we see wheat and barley we see oil and wine which is which is what the Holy Ghost and stimulation of Revelation all right which is the Holy Ghost but it's also a black horse which is the worst death you can have is being denominationally dead the Bible says the woman is dead while she lives with one's top of the what church so she's dead while she's alive she goes to a dead church but they're the most alive people like I said last Sunday they're all worshiping there it's just everything's worshiped now let's just worship worship and wear our plants and cut her hair and you know believe in Eternal health and you know but you can't do that and be a real True Believer all right so let's read let's keep reading just for a second everybody okay with that I mean you see you see what we're talking about as far as the Holy Ghost it's the lineup it's all those characteristics of the Holy Ghost that's what the Linus man and Eagle is go to Ezekiel and read Ezekiel and you'll see how they fly they're always moving they're not stopped they're moving if you need help this is what comes to help you and this is what comes to help you it's not some saints see that's where the Roman Catholic Church gets all that they don't just pull things out of the sky because what did I tell you that Rider rides through the scripture so those Roman Catholics took the Ezekiel and said hey there's a symbol of a line symbol of an ox symbol of a Man symbol of an eagle and they Twisted Satan twisted around said okay let's pray to our store let's pray to Zeus let's pray too and then they have that all mythology that they brought in and then what Satan do he put it right in Scripture he put it right in the word because see he was there when the word was being written remember Satan was there watching it so he's he's a better reader than we are he just can't get the revelation of it he's what a copycat so these are copies what red black and pale are all a copy of the lion oxman and Eagle this is the opposition that horse is in opposition you read brother Brown many times in the seal but he says in opposition so that's what he does he opposes right the Bible says he opposes and exaltes himself above God all right you said Satan put it in the word that sound might sound funny to somebody well Satan took it out of the word and misplaced it sorry thank you misrepresented he never put anything in the word because you can't add two but what he'd done was he added his interpretation okay thank you that's my sweetheart thank you I don't mind that listen I I'm going my mind's going 90 miles an hour so actually we weren't going this way this morning but we're heading this way now we weren't going toward the lion oxman in Eagle because I wanted to get to this listen uh 258 and the boy said in the midst of the beast called out you see there come to see what it was he was in this living creature he saw a black horse let's read the scripture and when the voice in the midst of the four beats called out a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny but see thou not hurt the oil and wine see this Rider let's discuss him if you'll notice the first Rider who he was and we found out last night script Charlie that the second writer was exactly the same man only was on another horse what happened he changed his ministry see the Holy Ghost don't change his ministry he just goes in the symbol of a lion oxman and Eagle but he don't change anything God's unchangeable that's Satan's problem he has to change he adapts because remember he goes after if you're the original you never have to change it's people that takes a copy off of you they have to change certain things or they'd be the original that's right all right same way in anything if you close and and all these things you know you there's some little something off or or City's brand name things they just want some little something off why because it's a copy of if it was not a copy of it'd be the original so he's a copy of all right there's some little something wrong what he misplaces the word and the writer less disgusting if you'll notice the first seal who he was found out last night script believe that the second rider was exactly the same man only it was on another horse what happened he changed his ministry see right we found out he was an antichrist and he had changed his position we find out that when he first just was a white horse he became a Doctrine now we've taken every one of these right down to the scripture see now watch here we're at tonight the other churches now see we're coming down to the third churches now just exactly on the third Church stages exactly like the third horse now the first church age what was it Nicholas in the doctrine this this kind of paraphrase I need let's get over here because he's running out of town let's go to paragraph you see what he's doing he's counting it down Through the Ages 263. which is on page 236 all right and just as that church is that kind Antichrist Church progresses so has the Bride come along with different things now watch him he's placing justification sanctification and the baptism of Holy Ghost and moving right on it's not with the Holy Ghost and moving right on so so there's something beyond the Holy Ghost you say oh listen to what I'm saying give the Holy Ghost and really you just get started so there is a lot Beyond okay we don't go beyond the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost takes us beyond the baby birth of being born again takes us into these stages that's why there's another form of justification just like we preached before there's another form of sanctification it's not a different I didn't say a different when I said another form of it all right higher order each time and moving right on see just like that only they taking their Revival first and the church is taking it the last their first three years first three stages of them that went through the Dark Ages then the third three stages comes comes the church out from justification sanctification baptism holy ghost in incarnate God made manifest Among Us here he comes in as the Antichrist as a false prophet then the Beast then the dark agent then in the Dark Age I'm sorry and the church comes out of that Dark Age justification of sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word the way now see there that's four stages got it justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost Incarnate Word that's the fourth stage the word's got to be incarnate sure it was incarnate in those people but not but it was in a baby form it was in a partial form all right now he goes down uh-huh you see that he goes down the church goes up just as perfect as it can be oh it's beautiful I just love it this writer is the same one but another stage of his ministry the first stage the White Horse scene he was just a teacher just an antichrist teacher he was against the word of God and how now how can you be an antichrist anybody that denies that every word of this isn't true and to be taught just the same as an antichrist because they deny the the word and he is the word now let's skip over to 273 same Rider now everybody okay you got it same router now this first stage he was innocent second now if you went a little bit higher a little more than that the second stage the Bible said he was given a crown and they crowned a man a Superman so he crowned him and then the Bible didn't call him a pope the Bible called him a false prophet look at verse two look at 245. now the next thing we find out that the devil controls all politics that ever has been and the next thing we find out that the devil controls all politics that ever has been are ever will be ever has been or ever will be excluding none all right but he's trying to get to church so he goes down to deceive it and he gets his Superman Works him into an organization and crowns him Banker of Christ Christ acted instead of God see this guy is a biker instead of God just the same instead of God what he's supposed to be a biker under Christ all right now go to 280 one we're going to read this just for a second and then it will be done right here now as great power comes he was made biker of heaven and worshiped as God ruler of the Earth by uniting the church and state Together made him ruler on Earth gave him a crown over that he could pray this old out of purgatory he could also Enter he was just like God on Earth instead of God together he had great power to kill whomever did not agree with his command what was that that was the second seal he's really talking about a second seal if you look in paragraph 279 he's talking about the second seal but listen to this but he's going to say who is going to say anything to him now look that Spirit never died brother Brandon said he got into people the people died but the spirit moved on all right and today who is going to say anything to him the church can't say nothing he's head of it State can't say nothing he's head of it so they died by the millions all them little churches brother was busted up killed and murdered and fed the lines and everything else see the dragon Rome give him his seed and Authority the Bible said so see so he rode his tight red horse through human blood till it became a red horse now see that's number two now let's go one more let's go on over 294. you'll have to flip over a couple of pages 294. I'm just kind of trying to set a base here just for about a few minutes now here is the mystery of this and now it when it revealed to me earlier this morning next on my third seal for daylight then I went quickly the description began to look search it up there it was three of them so far has been absolutely supernaturally revealed yeah now here's the mystery of the black horse corn to what's been revealed to me he started writing in the time of the Dark Ages that's what the Dark Horse represent the dark ages for it was a time of midnight to the True Believer that was left all right now look going down to 298. now we're going to get back to this I'm gonna give you the symbols as he gave them his balance is already scaled in his hand everybody on 298 calling out measure of wheat for opinion three measures of barley for a penny see actually that is sweet and barley is natural staff of life that's what bread and stuff is made from but you see he was charging for this what it means that he was charging his subject for the kind of Hope of life that he was sending out to them by making he started in that very time of making them pay for prayers charging for prayers they still do it no Venus because what was he doing capturing the wealth of the world a scale weighing out measure of wheat for a penny three measures of barley for a penny now you see that's still going on today that's my point you see that so let's don't let's don't look at these seals and that was my point really to come to right there because we're going down if you'll read it to uh 305 now oil symbolizes the Holy Spirit and then he talks about uh the wine the stimulation of Revelation okay paragraph 308 really good when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with the oil they all get stimulated wine is a stimulation boring all right but watch that thing's not dead I want you to realize that that thing's not dead I don't want you to separate these seals that that wild horse rider we said well he wrote off into eternity and everybody just kind of forgets him no how are you gonna forget the justification you went through if you're not gonna forget that sanctification same thing you're not going to forget that okay so let's not forget that these spirits that are that we're working we say in the coming out of the of the fourth age into the fifth age Lutheran Wesley the tech thing's still working today that's what we have to come back and the only way we can combat it is with the Holy Ghost you can't combat it any other way because any other way you're going to be trapped into it without the Holy Ghost you're going to be trapped into this all right so without the Holy Ghost read what happened and you'll see that's what happened that's what's happening to the people what's happening now is there's nothing for us to fall back on there's not other another age to shovel this off to this is it so as we get closer to that four seal we're fixing to take a rapture you know we got five six and seven to go but we're going to take a raptor in it for sale and type so as I showed you how it moved up closer to a nation should Rise Against nation and then for sale they're going to come to kill you you're gonna come after us personally all right so keep that in your mind and in your heart that the devil's not stop when you see the wild horse rider going off and he starts over on the black court and now you keep it in your mind this right here Satan's always going to come around brother Brown said he's got one shot left at you right and it's at your weak point so you keep that point covered all right same way with here in battle you always cover your weak spots in anything Sports whatever you're Hunting Fishing whatever you cover your weak points why because you know that's where you can be attacked as quick as that all right all right let's go thank you
