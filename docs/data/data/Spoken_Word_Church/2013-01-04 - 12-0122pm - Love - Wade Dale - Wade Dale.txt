by grace is is god's grace is it's not what i deserved with amen he knows my name you know i can he knows everybody but you know when he has a monetary affair with you he knows who you are i think that's what was preached this morning and i believe that's what being ministered amen let's all stand we'll change the water service there's nothing we've forgotten that we we got a brother here that he gonna sing for some time my foreign you pour out your power and love if we sing holy pour out your power oh god bless you god bless you and you've just seen the lord thank you hallelujah bless you god bless you y'all can you trace are you gonna sing for us all right if you don't want to say you better not come back yeah a lot of things we might forget but we never get there we won't forget that that will not forget well good to be in the house of the lord man man we got a full house today right yeah praise the lord for that we uh still expecting another full house you um by way of announcements we need to if anybody has any more names to go on that list that we're doing uh for the uh people that are that are seeking the baptism of the holy ghost or seeking salvation um then you need to add it to that list get with brother joe don't just come up and tell me to put somebody on the list that's like telling that drum to play itself it ain't going to happen write it down that you don't have to aim man too loud brother you know uh the old saying is the the shortest pencil is greater than the longest memory so write it down and give it to me or write it down and give it to brother joe he's compiling them in the back now so uh just uh lord bless each and every one of you we love all of our families and we want them to see this wonderful gospel but you know there was one time we didn't see this wonderful gospel it was one time we were out in sin we thought we had it all made we we thought we were the ones that were in control but uh sometimes god has a way of getting your attention and like brotherdale was preaching this morning he is out to seek each and every one of us he's out to seek seek the lost and that should be our goal brother brown said when you lose that zeal for lost souls he said i doubt your experience all right so if you have your bibles let's turn to the first corinthians chapter 13 we had a wonderful time over in alabama i had a good trip and i want to appreciate all that pray for us and all that that we're concerned about what we were doing and having fun and like dad said we were i thank them for letting me preach this afternoon other than he just told me this a day and a half ago out in the woods so the only time i had to prepare was this morning but uh we had a good time but i said well thank you because i get to stand up because we've been sitting down a lot for a week so so we uh but we had a good time now by way of announcement taxes are announced february the 18th is going to be the um sweethearts banquet that's correct and then i had asked i know some of you wondered why i won't ask to speak because the lord's been putting something on my heart and i've been working on it i say we me and the lord's only two that's been in that deer in that deer in that box for four days so well i know the devil was there too but uh we were not going to try to let them have precedence over what we were talking about so but uh it's been laid on my heart several things about the family we've got new families we've got older families we've got families that we want to come in we've got families that are not you know that are broken and separated and all those things and and we're just going to take that day and well tonight today we're going to start on try to get your mind a little bit on the word love and that's where we're going to start first corinthians 13 chapter 13 and see what paul said about charity but after that we speak on the uh banquet there then i asked that if i could have maybe several sundays so i'm going to take several sundays on family matters and it'll be pretty straightforward uh you're not going to like some of the quotes it's not mine it's your profits we're going to find out if you really believe brother brown to be a prophet or not we're going to really when you start seeing some of the things that goes on you know we just live in one big family this is a family you know you my my life's an open book to you guys and and a lot of you tell us a lot of things that you do and all that so we're just kind of all family but there are some things that if we're going to that i feel if we're going to move on with god the same burden that i had for all the people that are not here when i look around see some of your children are not here and i look around and see my children right here and things like that that puts a burden but that burden goes higher for even the ones that are already in here is that we can't stay this is not just the hour that we stay just as believers right we got to go on to perfection what brother dale's been preaching on he's trying to get us in a mindset that no we're never going to be perfect richard marlow's always going to have gray hair told the change i told you i'll get you back until the change i'm not looking for his hair to change back you understand what i'm telling you i'm not looking for i'm not looking for us to go backwards we need to go forward in god you know what it starts with marriage life family life right down where we live and i've asked brother down he's given us grace to that i can take a few sundays and maybe um get on a series about family matters so you can read up if you want to on what the bible says about it and then we're going to read what the prophet says about it and then you know i've become uh jen and i mad 32 years and coming up and we are grandparents and we're parents so maybe i've come to the place now where i can speak on it a little bit because you know what if you're not a grandfather you can't speak on that right if you're not a husband you can't speak on you know your wives i mean you know being married if you don't have a wife and it's just not you know it's maturity has come we've come to a place we all should be mature glory we all should be mature even in the gospel but we should be matured our homes first toward our family and then let's move that into the spiritual aspect just like what we're going to talk about today we're going to talk about love all right if we're in first corinthians 13 all right remember to next sunday i'll be at brother dutch scots he's inviting me to come preach for him so we're going to be there for the weekend next sunday so please keep us in your prayers brother um bob black's going to be doing the sun school class and he did a wonderful job this morning i mean a wonderful day he did really good and then remember that the dave ramsey preview is going to be february the 23rd that we're going to be teaching at the uh keller williams and and we've had a lot of people that have said they were going to come and we thank you for that so first corinthians 13 verse 1 let's say a prayer before we get started heavenly father we come today lord is it's just human vessel but father you have given us eternal life that's the baptism of the holy spirit that lord it it starts a fire in our soul and lord it works its way out and we should be able to show that lord and you sent your word lord down to us and give us the word and inside that word we need to glean out the things that you have for us for our day and our time lord and our season we've come lord where this is not a day to where luther's message or wesley's message or even pentecostal's message will help us it will give us a foundation but lord you sent us a prophet in the end time you sent us a man to lead as an example lord as close to the lord jesus as it could be lord for us to be able to to walk in what he said and father you sent your own son jesus christ yourself in human flesh lord the very epitome of love to come down here lord and to not just look over us lord but to be in us and let it be you working your way through us and today we pray lord that you would just be with us as we speak your word father not be a bystander but an active participant lord give us the eyes out of the holy spirit let our ears be open let us all be attentive to listen to you father what you have to say for us in this time bless us lord be with the ones that are sick the one names that we call this morning that are not among us for the how certain ones we ask you just bless them lord raise them up for your honor and glory lord because you get all the praise for it father thank you for keeping us all safe and bringing us here lord just be with us father as this week starts and sunday lord it's resurrection lord may we have a resurrection of you in our life and may it lord be not something that goes away lord but it'll be getting greater and greater as they go gone give us grace lord bless us keep us we praise your great name the name of the lord jesus christ amen first corinthians 13 verse one i think they have it up here i told them they're gonna they're gonna work again today those are some good guys back there in the back they said they were all gonna come up here and sing and i said who's gonna run the thing back there tonight it runs itself i said then who why do we need y'all that's not true we do need them though i speak with a tongue of many names i want you to fool it now this is paul a man with the holy ghost amen all right this is paul though i speak with the tongues of men and angels and have not charity i am become as a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol and though i have the gift of prophecy and to understand all mysteries that says all mysteries right and all knowledge and though i have all faith so that i could remove mountains now how many of us have done that and have not charity i am nothing and don't i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing charity suffereth long and it's kind charity envy if not charity vaulteth not itself is not puffed up right does not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not easily provoked thinketh no evil amen rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoices in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hope is all things endureth all things right this charity is pretty tough isn't it amen look at first corinthians 13 8 13 8 seem familiar near yeah hebrews 13 8 revelations 13 8 the names written in the book of life before the foundation the world hebrews 13 8 jesus christ same yesterday and ever now listen this first corinthians 13 8 charity never faileth but whether there be prophecies they'll fail whether there be tongues they shall cease whether there'll be knowledge it shall banish away for we know in part and we prophesy in part but when that which is perfect has come then that which is in part shall be done away when i was a child i spake of the child i understood as a child i thought as a child but when i became a man let me put it in my words we ought to quit acting like children when we become a man i put away childish things for now we see through a glass darkly right but then face to face now i know in part but then shall i know even as also i am known and now abideth faith hope charity these three but the greatest of these is charity amen he be seated the greatest of all that dissertation by paul he covered everything amen and he said the greatest there is is charity which is love unfained love and we'll get into something here in just a minute because it's hot up here because love is something that has been so misunderstood right you say oh i love this and i love that you know i love the deer hunt really that word love is so deluded until that's really not the love that we should be talking about all right you know you i like to go do those things but the love of god is the very you can't even really describe it brother brown when he went across the curtain of time what did he say this was perfect love right he said you can't even describe it he said the sisters would hug you and and and the brothers would hug you and and said it was just so much more than than you can ever imagine glory even paul when he went to the third heaven he the things that he couldn't even say why because we as human beings and that's what we're going to talk about today we as human beings do not live in the love or the charity that paul's talking about which is agape love right now you can say agape whatever we're going to worry about just a few things today and we're going to see how that brother branham which is brother branham brought us the absolute he was not the absolute but he brought us the amsterdam all right the absolute was jesus christ and we know that for for certainty but we'll get into that in just a second but now let's look at the first quote guys let's go ahead and pull them up brothers in bangerman brother brown preaching on life now there's life there's one kind of eternal life and that's god's life and when you receive that you have eternal life but life has many interpretations as it comes down there's love agape love filial love well there's love agape love that's number that's the top right love filio love lust see you just keep dropping down dropping down into the lowest of lows but all of that had a beginning so it'll have an end but those things which have no beginning will have no end so god had no beginning and his life had no beginning and it'll have no end and if you've got eternal life then you have no then then you have no end to eternal life it's forever and your character your character right it's proven by the life that's in you all right you say all my characters pre i proved my character by my my lineage and my uh that's what brother bob just really threw my soul this morning talking about lineages and he was talking about how you know you bring rehab in and you bring this one in and you bring folks ruth was a mobile right the out scour of the earth she was lower than a prostitute they would allow prostitutes into that city because they were prostitutes there but they would not allow morbidities to come into the comments of the temple and here she comes in and marries boaz but that's not the strange part who is boaz father yeah obed all right whose son was that rahab the harlot right so let's just forget all these lineages how we have this great lineage come down from adam and this great lineage from this one and greg forget all that because it's just you and i we were lost we come under a a a covenant that started with it if you do this don't do this god had to make an unconditional covenant that way we're all covered everybody's covered we're all covered let's read let's do number two here before we keep going on here you have south bend in indiana 1958. brother sister no poet they went insane trying to find the word to express the love of god there's never been a poet one of them said if all the ocean was ink and it would stalk on earth to quilt and all the skies the parchment made to write the love of god above would drain the ocean dry or could the scroll contain a hole those stretched from sky to sky love not love for one another not love for the world but the love of god amen the love of your wife is filial love the love for god is agape love million miles higher right every love not agape love see it says every love not a god we love it's perverted love which has an end right every love besides that love agape love has an end right because when we get over there there's not going to be a filial love it's all going to be agape all right that's why the sisters can hug the brothers over there because there's no jealousy there's no it doesn't see from from from god giving us the god beloved even in the holy ghost we still live and feel your love right we still live in eros or or love hate you say well that's bad this church would be empty without it that's right so i mean we just got but what matt what what satan done he just took the perfect and perverted it right right he took agape love and he said hey i can dilute that a little bit and get eve to love the beast as a relation and ain't going down to the lust part he just kept going further and you know what eve just kept going with him if she would have stayed behind the veil of her husband adam that wouldn't happen all right we're gonna when we get into this family thing we're gonna get into some real real teaching that i think we've kind of lost through the years and time everything had a beginning has an end and human love had a beginning and it has an end all the blessed eternal god love of god had no beginning and it will never have an end when the oceans have whipped himself into the deserts and the world has got so full of sin till the heavens has turned its back on it and it staggers out through space like a drunk man coming home the love of god shall still endure saints and angel song glory hey man if you'll pull up that now we'll i want you to look at that just look at these different forms i got this out of wikipedia and it's pretty neat but see where it says agape love is charitable selfless whatever that word is and unconditional in the parable i've seen as creating goodness in the world it is the way god is seen to love humanity and it's a scene the kind of love that christians aspire to have for each other right see that's why we don't hug sisters in this realm body right because of all these other ones coming on down further yeah right feel your love also used in the new testament you know in the old testament agape love is not converted in the old testament it's another word and we'll get to that in a second only when you pick up matthew 5 where dad's been preaching 5 43 when it says love your neighbor that don't mean you go up and say hey buddy i love you that's agape love right right brother brother nick studied this he knows that he's when he got me kind of thinking on those on these four things of love and then then talking about with uh with valentine's day coming up also using the new testament philia is human response to something that is found to be delightful also known as brotherly love which we feel you'll love you say well that's the love for your wife but also like i said it's a love for hunting it's a love for doing this that's a love for that it's just kind of and then watch how satan he brings that down to sexual love which is eros is never used in the new testament but it's more prominent in the old testament why because jesus brought agape love with him on the earth on in the new testament because agape love is what am what adam had right adam was christ he had if he had not had agape love how many of you let me just ask this question how many of you would take your wife back if you found out that she hadn't had a relationship with an animal right right with an animal that had to be agape love because that was unconditional you see we're going to get into some things here i'm sorry we have to say some of these words but we're we're living in human we still got this thing to worry about all right now number four is storage which is the neediest child parent because see and you look it's been perverted in our day all these others have been perverted but this is my kids can't love me with feel your love as that says as a husband and wife or that relationship but i love my children in a storage or needy children to child to parent love only appears in the compound word which is there in romans 12. so there's your four different kinds of love agape love failure love that's why you have the philadelphian age was the age of what they brotherly loved all right brother brown told us that and then eros is the is the sensual or sexual lust that we have for our supposed to be for our spouse only but what did satan do he perverted all that but what satan did he pulled that agape love and he started putting so much water to it till he diluted it down and now everybody in the earth thinks all those four are one oh yeah and it's the third one yeah because look at this age right and i got a quote which i don't have guys you don't just leave that up there for a second i pulled this one up because brother claw and i were talking about this the other day and i had not heard brother brown say this but in god's power to transform 1965 and now in the last church age we find here that they're naked again and don't know it but it's not the holy spirit veil it's the veil that satan slipped over eve back there a veil of lust the less veil and they're so filthy until they don't know it and that's what happened adam remember now let's start looking at family because adam was eve's protection right adam was he's protection fathers until your daughters or sons get out on their own and do their own thing and have their you know have their family you're their holy ghost brother mark you're mars holy ghost until he gets the holy ghost exactly adam adam and eve were a little different situation than us they came from the same exactly the same body yeah june and i didn't come from the same body physically but adam and eve did come physically from the same body but you got to remember it wasn't adam and eve to begin with right it was adam and woman yeah it actually was just adam right when god looked at adam and eve he didn't see two people right he saw one person right and to keep that holy ghost veil if she would have stayed with her help me right right she wouldn't have got away from that and got over the into the lush valley right but now that we're under the lust well what's happened we're under the lust veil which jesus christ had to come to get us back to the holy ghost baby right because that's where in that that if people don't understand the old testament couldn't have had the baptism of the holy ghost right like the believers do in the new testament they couldn't have the soul of god in their soul or they wouldn't do some of the things you look in the old testament it's kind of hard to believe some of the things that they did that were supposedly that god ordained god told the prophet one time to go marry a prostitute right jacob did what he did all these other people did what they did look what lot did with his daughters that was why that was satan perverting the true love that came from the garden right and then man has been trying to get back to that true love in the garden you and i we shouldn't throw away the the love that we have for our wife god forbid but we should be looking that if brother brown said our love for god is millions times higher now everybody in this room knows i love my wife but can you take that times millions right million times higher and that's the love that we're supposed to have for god exactly but it's not a sloppy love it's not some love that that we take for granted no it's a love that he had to only bring himself there's no other human could bring that love because we fell right we fell from this all the way down and there's no way we can get back to that agape look that way all right so now i thought we wouldn't be very long but look under the holy oats veil we were supposed to multiply and replenish the earth you're right right genesis 1 26 and 27 had nothing that was the love of god that was agape love that's what jesus brought with him when he came to this earth glory he brought that agape love right he brought the love of almighty god he didn't bring it he was it all right he was the love of almighty almighty god so we're supposed to multiply and replenish the earth we're supposed to love our brother we're supposed to love our wife as christ loves us amen that's where we're going to empty the church on but in matthew 5 43 you see all these all these things that happened in the in the new testament i mean the old testament go and pull up quote number three brother joseph can or brother richard whoever back there but in the old testament they had they lived under the lust bale because there was no holy ghost fell there they procreated as man should should not have but they procreated by this lust battle but to get us back to the holy ghost veil god had to come himself jesus christ because in the new testament the first thing he comes up and in the old testament if you'll look up the old testament the word love is used about 125 times and it's ahaba there's a word for it and it's human love or sexual love but in the new testament from the new testament anything that talks about love the first time it's used in matthew 5 43 for brother dale's been preaching on it means that strong's number 25 which is the gospel agape love so jesus had when he started preaching the kingdom that was the agape love coming back to the might to man right he was bringing it back to you and i it was not something that that we didn't forget how to love our wives we're not supposed to forget how we left how to love our wives we're not supposed to forget how we love our children right because we still live in this yeah but that agape love is supposed to somewhere take over in here all right folks let me tell you something let me say that one more time that holy ghost that that that holy ghost veil is in there but it's covered by this lush veil that we have right right there's nothing wrong with having love for your family there's nothing wrong with having love for your wife or one another but god didn't say in matthew 5 43 he told you to love your neighbor love your brother that's not filial though look up that strong's 25 that's agape love amen so he's not telling you to love your brother just say well you know your neighbor just saying well i love this guy because he's really nice that's not a goth to love right you're supposed to love him with unconditional love look right here now there's only one thing the church has to do if you want somebody to come to christ you'll be salty salt makes a thirst you be salty and the world will get thirsty for in a man he is in one sense a miniature creator if he's a child of god because the spirit of god is in him who controls him who operates him and i'd like to let you in just a few minutes that i know to be the truth if i had just a little more voice i'd like to preach on that tonight but i'd like to let you in on some things as this what divine what divine love now listen paul said where there's tones they shall cease prophecies they shall fail where there's all these signs the antichrist can produce any sign that's in the bible but he cannot love he could not love eve like adam loved beef so but eve leaning toward him because of the lust desire the antichrist proved that he couldn't love he perverts love there's nothing about him to love oh you can have some kind of a false love there's two kinds of love there's a love which is called human love or in the greek word it's called filial and the divine love which is the gospel of god for love is divine love when divine love is in your heart there's a difference in your life and everybody knows it how many people know that their neighbor knows they're christian yeah that's right you live like a christian act like a christian walk like a christian and your whole system your whole system is timed to god's bible how many of us can say amen to that amen but now listen john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that who should ever believe in him whosoever believed in him should what not perish but have everlasting life that's unconditional covenant you said oh no he come to get his own he loved the whole world remember there's no sinners are saying so he loves the world unconditionally but we've got to accept that love to get back into this holy ghost veil and that's what it is folks that brother brother dale's going to tell you how to get there but it's the love of god that you don't have when you're born it's a love of god you don't have that you maybe think you have because if you really got it there's certain things you wouldn't do right exactly there's certain things we wouldn't we wouldn't be even contemplating doing if we had that holy ghost veil again which is the new birth amen and who come to bring it jesus which was what a paradox here stands the very love of god on the earth and he's having to deal with filial love he ross and stores he's having to deal with all of them and he's walking through life so you and i walk through life the first part of our life and it wasn't the very first one we put up there i promise you that right we really didn't know much about filial love exactly right remember i've told you many times how we married we'll get into that you really don't know your partner you learn to love them the first one is number three a little bit of e-roll a little bit of a little bit of uh human lust sorry that's plain but that's the way it is because you do not you cannot humanly love something that you don't know anything about humanly you can't do it right even with agape love why do you think god had this all wrote down in a book for us oh yeah because we couldn't understand it without somebody teaching it to us paul would not could not teach it he could not give that whole dissertation in corinthians about charity if he didn't have it exactly paul peter peter could not have told us about these virtues how in the world could he had told us how to get these things if you didn't have them exactly right i've never been to new york city how can i tell you how to get there oh i can show you the internet pictures and i show you this and show you that but i've never been there but if i've been there i can tell you all about it same way with jesus jesus had to come to live among us live in that love not partake of it right but he was absolutely affected by it amen he was affected by it he was tempted by women right here's a good one pull up number pull up number four i think he's number four yeah number four everybody thinks and some of you in here are more compassionate than i am and that's okay but let me show you about this like i was preaching the other night on love there's two different kinds of love agape and feeling them and got beloved is above the levels of the earth and they're contrary one to the other so is compassion remember i told you one time if you ever ask god for anything and he says no that's the best yes you'll ever get in your life amen that'll make the eyes cross but remember he knows if he tells you yes what you'll do so if he tells you no then you know one thing's for sure he knows you're going to mess up if he says yes so if he says no you say thank god i would have done something wrong with that so it's compassion we'll take it up a little later in the week these things what it is but human compassion and compassion of god is so contrary we feel we feel so horribly bad for different people who are afflicted who are sick who are having trouble and sometimes we don't understand what they're feeling bad about notice him coming by this pool could you imagine your savior walking by this pool but there's got to be an answer right the answer for it was he did only what the father showed me to do hundreds of people hundreds of people that were sick and afflicted god told him to go to one man and heal that man you think oh the love of god would have just healed them all god's nose remember are the best yeses you ever get god telling those people no it was the best yes they ever got but human compassion sometimes we mix human compassion and god's compassion and and right here brother brown tells us they're contrary contrary one to the other just like when we get into the uh get into the study about harmony at home everything has to have a principle but it all must start with the biblical principle right biblical principles first not what your mama taught you not what your daddy taught you and even brother branham you know he told that sister he said now you do everything your husband tells you to do but if he ever does any tells you to do something contrary to the word of god he said you don't have to do that exactly all right then christ just takes over as your head but see if you're that's why it says don't let believers and unbelievers marry this all ties back together to people you want to make your life better live by the bible you want to make your life easier live by the scripture that will make your life so much yeah better but look you leave and look and you see how jesus walked through life that's why he couldn't call his uh couldn't call mary his mother because there was no love between the the mother and child relationship because he was agape love he wasn't lesser form of love he couldn't be because he has to be the example for us to get back to you see what i'm saying same way with the compassion the pastor may do some things and you think my heavens why did he do that well you know what there's a lot of other things involved with that that he's had to go through that we must understand that the compassion is the godly compassion because with human compassion we're all a bunch of dodeo granddaddies is that right isn't that right baby isn't that right i love you she can't do anything wrong see you there see that's why dog's not a granddaddy though right that's not you can't get agape love and a grandpa together you just think there's no work you know you just it's just too much we have too much human compassion but remember the compassion that god has for us is that as they all would be saved the compassion that god has was i'm going to come down and die for you so that you all can be safe everybody right all right but he knew only a certain people would and he knew that he had to get us back under that holy ghost bale to even be able to communicate with him to even be able to understand this all these emotions and all this seemingly love that we have for our brothers and love because look you take that and and many times we see that brother brown says money women in popularity are the three things that are downfall of a preacher money women in popularity why because it lets you get into all these different emotions and as a preacher aaron knows it and daddy knows it and anybody that's even ever ministered knows that we can get in the channel and get you to do anything yeah anything yeah that's why you have to be careful with money women in popularity you see too many people start leaning over to this one side and the popularity side i got some quotes on that but we're not going to talk about that today and then on the woman's side the women's side because women are compassionate and and that compassionate spirit comes out and then it draws two together and then you see all this mix-up like we've had even in the message of the hour much less all that other junk that goes on out in the world with all these preachers living with kids and all that junk like that well see what does that do that bro it's brought under satan said hey i'm gonna take the greatest love that ever was and i'm going to pervert it i'm going to make them think that they just love each other oh yeah but i'm going to put them in the biggest trap of their entire life because i'm going to make them think that this love is this life that's why brother brown had to come and he had to tell us that hey basically when you do come down to it there's only two brother that really there's only two and that's agape loving human and filial love now you mix those others in there with it but it's the love of god and it's a love we have for everything else right whether it be what brother brown said love of god love of man lust you go you keep going down further and further all right but god did give us a longing to get back to him not of all these other loves glory not of lust not of not of the just the failure love no he wants us back to the agape love glory because that's the only way you can communicate with god listen i'm going to tell you something that's the only way you can really communicate with your husband and wife that's right brother brown's brother brown said this three you always say three is a crowd well then this three is not a crowd it's you your spouse and god he said when you're missing one he said you can't get these two together i'll bring all those quotes i got them coming up in the in the little part that we're going to do that's why we should not we should not marry unbelievers but i know you know it happens sometimes it happens for a purpose yeah a lot of you uh i married an unbeliever but you know what i wasn't a believer either so it was just two unbelievers man on each other so but i knew right from right well now wait a minute i didn't know right from wrong i thought i knew right from wrong and i had been taught right but i took the wrong yeah legal yes yes legally i knew what was going on right i could tell you about serpent seed come on i see all you people that kind of grew up robbie shake your head we all did the same thing we thought we were okay and then we got under them other veils but thank god he's brought us all back glory because that's the if you don't get anything else get this the epitome of love is what god has written in this bible for us glory there's no other love you can understand there's no other uh kids that are growing up some of you there are young kids that's not married that are growing up there's no greater love than you'd have for god now if you have love for god first all these other loves will come into being and they'll all mix really well together and you'll have a real good human life because you do have a human life right we're still human right i'm not gonna pick on you today we're all still human but we all still must get back under that holy ghost veil amen because once under that holy ghost spell then god can deal with us listen god can deal with us the way he dealt with adam amen right now he can deal with us just like and adam was the ruler of this earth there's no way we can rule and reign without this without this holy ghost veil without getting us back under the veil that god give us but we still have to live under this lush veil that he's given us because we have to procreate now this way so husband and wife must come together but see under the love that god has he's allowed he's a lot good again well he's back in the back pray for him he's having a tough time early gary acting pray for him he's having a tough time but you know the bible says the bed is undefiled so what goes on there is okay with god but that wasn't the way he wanted it to start with right but he allowed that to happen to get us here because once eve did what she did there was no way that she could get back under that veil exactly so in not getting her back under that veil he couldn't get you back right because she surely couldn't get you back under that mail that's why he said i'll put enmity between you in other words i'll come i'll come through the way that was that was wrong the way he didn't come wrong he come the way that was wrong all right through the wound all right to clean that part to show us that hey even though we do come understand we are born like brother bob and that really just blessed my heart because you know in the old testament if june and i had a child and and that child was illegitimate there was no way that god had on the earth listen to my words that god had on the earth to cleanse that sin sure he could cover it and not kill the person right but it took 400 years exactly if june and i had a child which would be josh and he was born a bastard child right or out of wedlock from josh to 400 years could not come back into a church right pretty strong huh but brother brown doesn't stop there he goes on to say but under the blood of jesus christ it cleans you immediately and you're welcome in the church look how much stronger glory pull up number five well you know or which one of you whichever one of you back there door to the heart shout into tennessee how many really loves the lord just really love them i don't care what church that isn't that wonderful at least 95 maybe better 100 i trust that we love him what is god god is love he that loveth is of god now that isn't what we call free love that's agape love right there's two different kinds of love one of them greek word one of them is the greek word filio filio means friendship the kind you have for your wife love that kind of love that kind of love is not a true love oh i know you little teenagers want to believe that but it's wrong that kind of love will make you jealous of your wife you'll take a pistol and blow a man's brains out because of her that ain't real love that's feel your love but agape love will make you get down and pray for that man's lost soul that's agape love that's the kind of love the church needs what we all need is that kind of love now let's read this let's finish god give me that love i'd rather have that experience of love than have all listen to this man he's a prophet he's lived in realms that we've never lived in spiritual realms that we've never lived in i'd rather have that experience of love then have all the gifts that god's got in his heaven for you can have every gift god's got and still be lost amen how many knows that that's exactly right it's love the love of god where there's tongues they shall cease whereas prophecy it is failed where there's knowledge it'll vanish but when that which is perfect shall come it endures forever love love one another that's a great saying amen amen i'm look i've got to have that experience than to have all of the gifts that god's got in heaven amen because if you got that love if you've got that love it brings all those other loves under subjection to that love all right the problem is is when we get when we're not born again see that takes away the first love agape love and then you live under all those other three yeah that's what the problem is but when you bring a godly love in and you put it in a home and you pray over your children there's no reason that god won't move except for the sin that you have yeah you know if you cut your hair we're going to get in all this you cut your hair sisters do you know god will not hear your prayer for nothing right nothing except your repentance then once you do that then you can pray for your family husbands same thing we'll get into all that but there was no true love on this earth until jesus came but really that's not the way he wanted it exactly right so that wasn't the true love he wanted he was the true love he wanted that love to be put into the people amen so on the day of pentecost that's when the agape love the love of god came into those people so much until they were so mad and so mean before like peter and all those it just changed their whole countenance they were just like drunk people they went out into the streets if anybody said something to them then so what big deal same way with you and i we get somebody thump us on the head or or bump us going down the hallway or or do something to us and boy the first thing we want to do is store our dupes up what's our problem we didn't let the love of god take over right right i mean if you physically want to hurt somebody where's the love of god in that i don't care who you are right amen what did he just say he said the love of god the one right here this one i'll take a pistol and blow a man's brains out is filial love that's the love you have for your wife well now what how many of us truly can say that if we saw somebody molesting our wife is the first thing we do is get down on our knees and pray for him after i shot him i'd probably pray just to be real honest with you but now look that don't mean that's just like brother dale said that don't mean the bible says turn the other cheek that doesn't mean the guy keeps hitting you in the cheek 14 or 15 times you get away from it right okay if he slaps you in the jaw turn it up don't just say hey here's another one go ahead have at it don't let's don't be stupid like paul said god forbid if you think that's what i'm talking about that i would stand to let my wife be molested in front of me and me not physically try to do something about it but i would not have malice in my heart toward that man when i got him away from her exactly how many of us can do that we still got we still got to deal with road let somebody's playing with their wife amen amen that's right praise the lord somebody somebody is honest i'm telling you folks i've told you this before when you look around go and pull up colossians when you look around the message of the hour i know we're all going to find faults we're all going to be sticky we're all going to be failures and the human things that we do but now like brother dale said the other day which i i love the way he put it but we should be moving so close to god that some of these little things should be just shedding off what did brother brown say when he saw that vision of the man pouring the water into this right remember that remember sister shepard's dream a man was pouring water in here and he said trash was coming out right trash can i say it one more time trash was coming out of a christian because that's supposed to be a christian right christian pouring it in trash was coming out so being born again by the incorruptible word of god that's the only way we can be truly a child of god is to first be born again then let his love take over how many of us honestly how many of us could open the door in our houses today and let jesus christ walk in and not be ashamed and not be trying to hide something or kick something under the hit something under the under the bed or you know what every time you walk through that door right he's walking through that door right you're not bringing him with you you're not waiting on him to show up when you show up he shows up right because i thought he's supposed to be with you even right thank you pull up the colossians let's just read a few scriptures here and then we'll quit i want i just kind of want to set a basis of what we're going to be doing we're going to be talking about love relationship marriage the love you have between husband and wife the love you should have for your fellow man the love you should have for your children the love you should have for your church members and this is what paul said look colossians 3 13 for forbearing one another and forgiving one another being a man have a quarrel against any even as christ forgave you so also do you and above all these things put on charity which is the bond of perfectness what brother dale been preaching though it's the bond that holds the perfectness together it's the glue all right it's the glue that holds all that together first timothy 1 verse 5. now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart now look let's not change scripture but let's turn that thing let's read it backwards because what he's telling us now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart now if you have faith unfaint if you have a good conscience and if you have a pure heart that's the end of charity that's where charity ends and you say end like no no it doesn't end like this in other words you've produced it right remember seven seals the end of all things brother dale's preachers many times the end is not the end like you're stepping off of a cliff it's not the end it means that it's been it's been fulfilled right right it's been fulfilled it's been done now the end of the commandment is charity out of a pure heart and of good conscience and of faith in other words faith unwavered notwithstanding she shall be saved in childbearing this is one that i read this one the other day and somebody asked brother branham a question but look at this what is charity charity is agape love which is the holy ghost right so a woman's not just saved because she has a baby right notwithstanding she shall be saved and childbearing if but tracy that word if is a big old word it's huge because that if it's a choice if the spirit of him that raise up jesus from the dead be in you if if they continue in faith and charity and holiness with sobriety so a woman's not gonna be saved just in childbearing but if she's born again she's definitely gonna be saved right all right because it's charity right all right here we go second timothy 2 22 flee off also youthful lust that's where we're getting into the bottom part of the of the love part because a lot of us young people i said a lot of us young people confused that attraction to being just good old-fashioned love but it was just good old-fashioned lust but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart look at verse first peter four and eight and above all things have fervent that means fiery got it have fervent charity among yourselves for charity shall cover the multitude right of sin amen charity shall cover the multitude of sin so now we understand we've got agape love we've we've got and we've got the other one and we're going to deal with those four in the coming months after we in february all of you that come to the banquet we're not going to be over 20 minutes so we're not going to be under 20 minutes either like a guy one time tonight told he told that police officer he said officer said i don't drink no more so don't drink no less either yeah so we're not going to preach no longer but we ain't going to freak no way but after we get started with that i kind of want us to all and you know this church is a good is a good loving church it really is i mean but we still all have our problems right man we should treat our wives like we want christ to treat us so if you treat your wife you know what i believe we're going to get in the scripture and we're going to dig into it real deep to where you treat your wife a certain way then christ can treat you the same way exactly pretty tough huh because the bible says as you love your wife christ i also love you amen pretty tough huh but that goes for everything we're going to cover those things but love charity coverth the multitude of sins why is that let's start we'll end with this thought right here why does charity cover a multitude of sin because charity is agape love you know how to handle that sin right it didn't say it's going to cover it you can keep doing it and it'll come no what it says is that we can live with each other because we sin every day but we can live with each other in our sins and trespasses things that we do wrong anything's not a god of sin right right but charity shall cover the multitude so he's talking to christians and the multitude of sins that we have if we'll take it to god with an unfeed heart read all the scriptures read all that you take it to god with an unfitting heart and you know what happens a lot of times and i want everybody to shake their head yes i'll go ahead and say yes go and say yes before i even say it yes a lot of things we do we have an ulterior motive you're going to say yes because i know you do we have a motive god if you'll do this i'll do this and don't say you that don't happen but when in maturity you shouldn't do that being a mature christian you shouldn't say god now if you'll save my kids i'll quit doing no no that's not the way to go about it god's not a he's not a traitor p-r-a-d-e-r traitor he don't trade things he said if you love me you'll keep my commandments all right period that's right if you love me you'll keep my commandments and the commandments the ten commandments to me covers this whole bible and a christian with agape love is the only person that can take all ten commandments and say god right i can do that right glory because paul says i do all things through what christ which strengthens me all right but now remember what happened to the rich young ruler the rich young ruler he did all ten commandments he said he told jesus he said i've been doing that since i was again just like what did you talk about this morning i've been going to church i read i'm in the message i do this i do this i don't do this i don't don't cut my hair i wear my paint i don't wear pants so uh man we cut our hair and we do things and and man we're just good stuff but jesus said can you do one more thing sell all you have and follow me can you sell all your love can you get rid of all that love and follow me right and you know what he couldn't do but see he he wasn't he wasn't let that boy let me let me just put it this way if that boy would have been would have been led by the holy ghost he'd have been a real good church member after the day of pentecost because he'd been filled with the holy ghost and he would have done all that he would have got rid of all the things that he had you don't have to give all your riches away and be a pulper that's not what he's talking about he said you've got to be able to follow me in charity in a gothic love and all these other loves will fall in line to that i want you to think about that when we close you stand a body change yeah go ahead and have things in our life right that are not biblical principles we're not going to have these principles wrong and take his body change right the perfection brother dale's been talking about is from within but that from within has got to work its way out there's no way that we can that we can leave this world without having the love of god it passes all understanding right the love of god that you can love the man that hates you jesus said what would he say about the greatest commandment was you love your neighbor he didn't stop there he said as you love yourself right as you love yourself hey listen i got two gay guys in his neighbor that's hard but i don't i look gin i don't i mean we don't we try not to to do anything to harm them i mean they humanly we make mistakes and our dog eats their cat or something but but and then they showed what they were now by coming and screaming in my face and pulling the guns out and all that stuff but i just said hey guys we'll take care of them we'll take care of let's get rid of the dog we'll take care of it i had no animosity toward those people i had no there was no i'll get them back oh boy in my mind i thought buddy i can walk down into that field richard and i get in them royal pines are then junipers and i can shoot them through the window now that's what went through my mind yeah but you know what showing the appearance of evil right and just love those two guys and you know what mike said one time he said you know he said a lot of people told me a lot of people have told me what y'all believe he said one day i want you to sit down on the porch and tell me what y'all believe he said because i've heard it from everybody else what y'all believe but i want to hear you tell me what you believe right yeah so you know well you know and they see it they don't see us they don't see us you know it's sunday night we take our our trash out and and you hear the beer cans you know and we do it in the dark you know i know we don't do that but i'm just making a point you know we don't as soon as they walk in you know they come in the doors then they come in the door we start hiding things no don't do that right might be a lot of dirty clothes laying around the house but but not things that somebody shouldn't see yeah i mean if we have to do that where are we at right this whole series that i want that i want to get on is is let's get back you know paul says let's go on leave the principles right you got to start the principal somewhere to leave them you got to have them to leave them right you got to have this as leaving the principle there had to be a foundation for this building to be built on right but one time you had to leave the foundation but you can't make the foundation any less important because if you drag the foundation out from under this house you take the foundation out front of this church where is it it collapses right so there's nothing that were it wasn't built on good sand it wasn't built on on the rock that's the same way with you and i let's get down to looking at each other husbands you're supposed to be the rule in your house wives you're supposed to be subject to your husband how many others can chew that we're gonna find out maybe in a few weeks what the prophet had to say about it not trying to use our own ideas because you know what brother dale doesn't do it and i don't do it either i don't tell you how to run your family god's given us enough through the prophet he's given us enough through the bible and he just give us something to just give you a little direction right on how to use it because we we'll have some new thing it's been family since the beginning of time glory right moses had lord what moses had to deal with people like that i mean mine so we it's easy for us to deal with we look like what moses and people like that had to deal with but but still i think to live a better christian life let's just get back down to the basin right let's just get down to the basics and learn how to treat each other learn how the prophet told us you know who would have guessed that a prophet would uh go into a situation one day and his wife is you know she's got her hair out he said her hair was all messed up and one uh joseph was screaming and two girls were throwing stuff and this was all over here and this was all over there you know he didn't go in and he didn't go in and go good evening friends he didn't go in and go you going over there he what he's saying what'd he do he walked in put on an apron let me give you a little hint for your wives or your husband if you want to get anywhere with your wife put on an apron yeah get you a towel out and get them up start mopping start cleaning i promise you one thing what brother brown said he done though it changed the whole atmosphere he said all of a sudden the kids started calming down well you get a spirit an atmosphere we're gods we're creators we can create an atmosphere and that's what we're going to try to do is try to create an atmosphere that god can come and there not be any holes or any bars or anything that we have to go i need to hide this or i need to do no we need to walk right on up with god be a christian glory don't be just a christian when somebody's looking at you be a christian even when somebody's not looking at you let's buy all of this the heavenly father we pray lord that what we've said today would would be satisfactory to you lord we're just humans trying to live here on the earth lord until you take us out in the chain but father we're not supposed to live here and just be living per se day to day with no direction and nothing to do and and nothing to accomplish father you put us on the earth and give us the holy ghost to get us back under that holy ghost veil and get us out of this not just lush for for the opposite sex but lust for other things like lust for cars and money and all the things popularity the things of the world lord may our desire our desire and our joy be that agape love lord that passes all understanding a love that that we truly don't understand without you coming and giving your life to bring that back to the individual we would have never understood it but now lord through your scripture and through your prophet to come in the end time and lord through the fivefold ministry we're able now to understand truly the love of god that's sent abroad among all the people and all the earth but lord we've accepted it we pray lord the ones that have not accepted that love that you would fill them with the holy ghost now lord that you would make that list that we have downstairs lord may it shrink may we be able to take names off lord may people be be lord brought into the family of god not into a church family or a natural family but lord into a spiritual family a family that where there's harmony and peace a family where there's communion lord and it's communion with you father we pray lord that you would just abide with us lord give us lord grace and be patient with us lord as we struggle to do the right things here on the earth father we ask you lord to forgive us of our many sins and our mistakes and failures the wrong ideas that we have toward any person or anything lord that you would just circumcise our heart father that you would bless us lord with your holy spirit lord that love that oh lord we love our wife and we love our family but lord that love is one million times more lord just let us all feel that let's let us all become a part of that lord because we are the light of the world now you've left and you said the world will see you no more but that we would see you yes and the world would see you through us the lord as john 3 16 says for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever shall believe in him should never perish but have everlasting life lord i pray that if one person here this morning that does not this afternoon that does not have that lord in their heart to realize that you love this world so much that you died for it and you sit back your life with the holy ghost into the group of people and lord now we've come to the end of time where the we're now truly going back this is the last group that heading back to the garden of eden father and all the other ages and all the other sages are waiting on us lord all the prophets everybody's waiting on us to come to a place lord and if we can't live just a good christian life lord with all without all the mysteries lord you said even there's we read in corinthians if we should know of could know all mysteries but not have charity it profit us nothing lord we want it to profit something we want this word lord you said it wouldn't return board but it would accomplish that which has been sent out to do lord you said it we believe it and lord now we ask it to be made manifest in all of our hearts and lives in jesus name amen let's sing a song about eight seven eight seven in the red book blessing the word i know is is everyday will be we ought to be asking god hey fill me with love and not just love for like we were talking about but no we want the epitome of love but god be loved we want the love of god and the only way you can get it is listening reading your bible and praying that's what we didn't get ken you can't buy it doctor's not going to pour it out on you wish you did but there's certain things that we do that we commit ourselves just like we commit ourselves to a relationship with our with our spouse and just like we commit ourselves to our spouse we have to commit ourselves with a relationship with god right we have to commit ourselves hey i'm not playing with nobody else i'm not fooling around with anything else i'm not fooling around with the devil i'm not fooling around with the things of the world you know you take that vow i was thinking about it the other day you know we say it's till death do us part in our natural vow what about spiritual about right now that's right still death to us and i ain't talking about physical death brother dale said about this remember remember the only person that you can't that you can't um commute sin to or impute sin too it's a dead person right a dead man you can't get my grandpa which was been dead for 60 70 years he can't rob a bank tomorrow he didn't rob a bank 20 years ago what so if you accused him of that what he's justified because he never did it in the first place if somebody accused him and that's what satan that's what we got to realize satan has accused us of doing something that we say hey man we're dead we're dead we didn't do that we're dead but we just can't say that we got to be dead in christ and be a new creature our new creation i like that word creation right because we're a part of a new creation a new race that has never been on this earth before do you realize that glory there's never been a race of people on the earth like right now because you and i are staring a body change in the face and somebody is going to do it no other aids how great it was they can't handle it they can't handle it this is the only people that can handle it aaron you you know there's never been a day like this thing before start it off you know what brother nick go ahead there's never been a day is like this the ability to see it matters to me is there's a part of your life that shines how god could take this day and put you in it it's a hard day they didn't have to deal with devils like we had to deal with but he knew that he wasn't he he's not in a crisis session at the end time right no he's sitting back going i got the players exactly where i want them i got everybody right where i need them to be everything is on the stage at the right time this is the people i want right here there's never been a day like this day to me never been a day i think one more time we'll go home there's 97 o'clock to me is oh me me
