ask you if you'd like to donate some to it you can do that the Lord will in next Sunday this coming up Sunday uh because you know that'll help him and all right so remember that okay let's go into Revelations 1 and we'll begin with verse 10 I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet saying I am Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see us write in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus and unto samna and to pergamus and unto Tiara and unto Sardis and Philadelphia and unto lady OA that's the age we're living in lady OA that's down to us all right so this message is to be each to each age and I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one L unto the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about to PS with a golden girdle all right now let's go to John and we'll read the first 18 verses because I believe it pertains to to what we're trying to say anyway all right John 1 1 in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God now that sounds like there's a whole lot of people involved so that's what we're trying to get to is understanding the reading of the scripture is perfect it just needs to be interpreted right and that takes the holy spirit all right verse three all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not now it gets to John because he introduced him right there was a man sent from God whose name was John the same came for a witness to Bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe he was not that light but was sent to be witness of that light that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world he was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not now remember that the word the world was made by him all right and the world knew him not he came un his own and his own received him not but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of God he gave them Authority gave him the right by his death burial resurrection and delivering all right which was born not of blood neither the will of Flesh nor the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John bear witness of him and cried saying this is this was he of whom I spake he that cometh after me is preferred before me for he was before me and his fullness have all we received and Grace for grace for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ all right no man has seen God at any time the only begotten son which is in the bosom of the father he hath declared him you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we have been trying to express some things and uh you know to open up our understanding and maybe this morning we might just preach just a little bit and you know quote some things but uh I want you to think about the scriptures and what it's saying and that way then we can you know go into a better understanding and like I said we read there in John 1 and it says in the beginning was the word all right and the Word was with God and the Word was God right all right now where can you get three out of that you know what I mean where can you get three out of plain reading in the beginning was the word and the Word was with god well that's two you know God and His word with him and but then it says and the Word was God all right so you're not looking at what we call the Trinity because it's not in the Bible anywhere show me the word Trinity at all it's not there that was developed by the Catholic church and somewhere in the 325 when they had the first Nan counsel that was the argument whether Jesus was God or a like substance and they determined there and the first one really made the statement that he was the substance but then as they begin to deteriorate later on to 606 by then they had come out of it that he was a like substance now if you make him a like substance you meaning something different you know all right so then you think about what mankind has done with the word of God they have perverted it to the point that you know now not the letter of it it says the same thing that it was saying when this was brought into translation from the the uh the Greeks and whatever it was run the Hebrews and things the word is the same the letter of the word has not been changed now there's many new versions you know many new Bibles that have come off and and a lot of that changes the meaning of what the word was but we believe in the King James version not that it was the version that James and John and them read it just means King James because it was at the time of the King James when he had it translated and brought down to mankind so they could read it uh they didn't have uh John 3:16 you know we're a little older than that we're a little smarter than that they didn't have these things this only come into being a couple hundred years ago when they begin to bring it down from the the Latin vgate and bringing it on down to where that we would get what we call now the King James version I've heard people say that they' say you know way on back in our time when our our denominational periods they'd say that you know that this Bible here was good enough for Peter and Paul and it's good enough for me well the the revelation of the word was but not the letters they were quoting from because they were brought into being a long time after then all right but see instead of staying then with the scripture and believing it as it is said we take in our mind and try to conceive you know figure out that's the uh problem with humanity is we try to figure out what's going on but it's like I've said now and I won't spend no time on it but you know uh you take and read the Bible in Genesis and you know when this fall came and oh they ate an apple well now you know there's nothing in there that says that all right they ate the forbidden fruit that's right so he said well okay it's a pomegranate it's a peach it's a this no no you go into that and you try to figure out what it's talking about and but yet if I took a newspaper and I brought it to you and I said would you read this out of the newspaper and you would read that there was a man and a woman you know and then there was a an animal there which the Bible says this serpent was most sub of all Beast so he a serpent is a snake he was made a a snake later in the fact of being cursed he was a beast all right and you put a man and a woman and a beast and you read it out of a newspaper we know what happened right right we oh we've got a little sense we know what happened there but reading it out of the Bible you think you've got to make it something to interpret some way and when you do your concept comes out of it being contrary to the word all right you say yeah but brother Dale there got to be three Gods because here on the River Jordan was a a voice from up in heaven and a dove coming down and Jesus standing on the earth so there's got to be three of them you know well then some agree that there's uh two and some went into the four square movements of the Pentecost tool you got all kind of ideas trying to figure out what it said but why not read what it says right it just says the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove all right something was happening that we need to understanding so is it with the understanding here we read in the beginning was the word all right and the Word was with God and the Word was God well that's simple language you read that out of a newspaper in the morning you understand my point of illustration about the garden and reading it you go read out of the paper in the morning you're not mly confused about wordings even though I get confused because of the wordings they use sometimes today is is beyond my day of you know A and B and C uh they got these big old words that I have to get to dictionary and look them up all right but still follow the point that this one that you're talking about it says verse two the same was in the beginning with god well with God means with it means you know that oh two of them now uh brother Lise just returned from Nicaragua and I enjoyed his uh things that he covered there Wednesday night I really appreciate it but you know what he made a statement out of it he said uh some of your help went to go over there you know to do things well you know what he was with him right if you get gave him $1 and he took it over there and spent it over there for something related then you was with him right no no no I wasn't with him brother Dale I was over here you're you're not thinking right the word with doesn't signify that there got to be two people to be you know uh brother htis used to have a way of saying and he said the only time I know I'm carrying on a sensal conversation is when I'm speaking by to my own self you know well that's with you know it doesn't mean that there's got to be two people all right let's pull it back up and let's go on down a little bit in this and we'll we'll just preach a little bit from this point and try to help but pull back up John 1 and where we can read it and look what it's saying in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him without was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men all right now all things were created by this person you see I don't believe in three gods that would you can't find that in the Bible you find it in your interpretations the first what is it first second or one in other Commandments that the Lord thy God is one amen well now Israel didn't have no Trinity they didn't have no problems that's right and that was why they killed Jesus because they could see that he was referring to the fact that he was the Messiah right right and they didn't believe he was was that Messiah right because they believe that Messiah will be God in flesh right that's their belief all right so then in believing it that way when Jesus began to talk about the things they said you're a man making yourself God but their own Bible said that he was born Emmanuel which is what God With Us us but see we want to put our own thoughts and ideas and and you know it's kind of odd now that you're getting these things after 2,000 years of doing or I don't know how long it's been since they' started using the Christmas tree that ain't none of my business cuz I don't care you say well it was Old Saint Nick you know I don't know I just know one thing now you buy a Manger that you used to buy and now there's a little addition to that right and you got a manger scene and it'll have a gloryia there right see then you buy a upper room experience instead of just seeing the 12 they 13 because they got a glory there you know they've got to get this femin part into it all right because that's their point and see a picture we say is better than a thousand words you know why because words disappear from your mind unless you have a good memory but pictures are embedded into the seeing are embedded every other word into your seeing and that picture stays with you that's the way you remember that's the way you're driving down the highway and you go somewhere one time you don't have to look at the mouth the second time right why because of the memory of the vision or whatever this is there that's there this is there if you'll notice the way I describe it I'll tell you the roads that goes there and then I'll tell you you go down here and this road it turns to the right there be a McDonald's on the right hand side what am I doing I'm setting your mind to where when you're traveling even though you may forget the number of the road but in your mind you are looking for the McDonald's right and that's what is done through wording in things talking see brother brandham said it like this he said all a preacher does is breaks a spell over the people's mind that God can speak to them now that's good thinking you know you said well brother D what are you trying to do all I'm trying to do is to speak enough word to you that you then God can come back in the middle of the night or somewhere and bring that back to your remembrance you say well hey that's right see I'm trying to make that well then you take a picture and actually using this uh screen and the reading of the scriptures I I used to be against that because it does have a tendency to do away with you uh using your Bible right all right but I realized that hey those letters are being embedded into your mind more than it is for you to look down right that's why we give illustrations and we draw out things and to get you to continue your thought and remember it later all right and see in doing that then we can look at at something and it comes into our being part of us until we we we we come forth with an image or a picture in mind of what is being portrayed all right but see if we take the picture wrongly we say with God you know well that's two people right but you see I have many manifestations about me a father son I'm a human being I'm a granddaddy I'm a great granddaddy I'm pastor of a church I was an employee at General Motors I've got many many titles or forms that you can look at but I'm only one person well that's the Simplicity of looking at God that way now I I say this for your benefit but not for me to question if there is a God God now that's for you to think if there is a God you mean he can't keep his word straight they's got to judge you by something according to the scripture he said no the the father there's no judgment there are the judgments in the hands of the son but if we can see that that son and father is the selfs same person just say I'm a son I'm a father I have many manifestations but I'm just one person if we can see that about God then we'll go into correct understanding but now I also charge you or or have been recently about it because I went back and listened to the the services see you you don't want to go into the to the Trinity God in three persons Blessed Trinity show me any scripture for that God in three persons if there's a person there's a personality the personality is an individual individual is a person you got three literal Gods not even thinking it there are people that believe that there's three literal Gods all right the deception is when the Catholic Church brought it about they didn't bring it about as to be three literal Gods necessarily setting oh now daddy you set over there son you sat here Holy Ghost you set here now don't y'all cross each other's seats you got your seats you always stay there you know well see they knew that couldn't go over so they brought it into the form and says well it's God in another um person called a son well right now do you believe in Eternal sunship now that's the question I've asked and the prophets ask you what do you believe how can a son be Eternal because the word son signifies somewhere it had a beginning amen right right that's right you said well now wait a minute you're flipping I'm flipping because I got to flip okay bear with me but listen in all of the scriptures we find out that there's only one person with many manifestations amen all right then that's not God in three person's Blessed Trinity right right that's getting to the truth but you got to watch it because I was talking with somebody just the other day about it and I I mean it and strongly mean it that the biggest portion of the people that I hear preach now I said I hear over the times I've listened most of the Ministers of this message are really Oneness they fought the trinitarian concept so much until they've moved away from it and they go into a Oneness concept all right there's a Doctrine out there called Oneness and the Oneness is we say it's like your finger because that's a way of expressing it that the Old Testament was God you know the father Jehovah and then Jesus came and there's no father he's out of the way Jesus is all of it because in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily see they can quote scriptures to you all right but then coming in the last days as or coming in the as the Holy Spirit but yet they don't believe and the best way of saying it is they don't believe that there is an another form of God after Jesus Christ right all right now I differ there totally because I believe the Born Again experience makes you right in your new birth a child of God you agree and if you're a child of God you're God in another form is that simple because the form means that you just change from one form to the other but it's the same God all right that's why Jesus would say before Abraham was I am right right and he would say Phillip if you seen me you seen the father he never spoke of another God somewhere else the Bible says there's God's many right I mean the Bible says that there's God's many but Paul will tell you I believe it's right in one but any house where it says God's many he's plainly stating that none of them is worth anything because there's got to be one God all right and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ all right now what's the name of the father what do you mean brother Dale what's the name of the Father the name of the father's father well I'll write you a check you want a check for a million dollars I'll be glad to write you one decide father right would you take it to the bank well I'll help you out I'll F father son Holy Ghost I'll put human I'll put pastor I'll put any anything you want me to title it right these kids are smart enough to know they ain't going to the bank with it but if I signed a check Samuel you got a reason for taking it because you got a name connected to it all right see that's why we baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because the Bible says in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost father is not a name son's not a name Holy Ghost is not a name but it's Lord Jesus Christ right that's why in Acts it said to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ all right now watch that in a minute when we get to that Christ but what I'm trying to get us to look at is not the Oneness thought and get lost in it until we become a Oneness and don't know it and uh you know a lot of people they'll take the quote from the prophet and there's plenty of them and I believe he meant what he said and said what he meant he said all God was he poured into Christ all Christ poured into the church you know and take her back to the Garden of Eden but now interpret that by your own natural concept all God was you just done away with something right you got an empty space right I don't care about your beautiful drawings that shows this light going over you left an empty space I don't care about all of your mentalities of all meaning all you know and see you're going into the Oneness Doctrine right cuz all God was he poured into Christ well then there's no more God that's all Christ right then you say all Christ report into the church then there no more Christ it's the church you don't you don't get what I mean by that I know you don't cuz if you got it you jump up and shout hallelujah hallelujah right at least sit down and say it but listen see we can be so confused until we don't know we we're confused I don't ask for a raise of hand but how many of you used to believe in the Trinity you used to believe in a lie but you swore by it you swore that's what the Bible said there's been Wars probably fought over whether or not that it was one God or two or three right but see then when the Oneness came out they came out with the points of bringing it you go to a real Oneness and you talk to a Oneness about what you believe brother dick finds you one he likes to do that he knows if I tell him something he can go out find him one go find your good Oneness and get him to explain it I told you about it when I was in Jamaica for three nights in a row I preached on one true and living God and those Oneness people shouted it was a Oneness convention and they shouted over it because see what I was saying was the exact scriptures they were saying but you see they won't go on they stay back in that one part see a Oneness then is what I do that like I'm picking myself up you know all God was poured into Jesus if you're Oneness you just moved over here and you don't need nothing over there right but see the true Oneness won't tear it on over to the church that's why they're Oneness they sto back there but I hope you've been listening or thinking about what I've been saying about that maybe You' never thought about the Oneness concept of what people does with it you hear the preachers of this message preach so beautiful a picture of one God but watch them they'll always end at a certain point well how can we end un understanding of God at any point I thought we believe the prophet said there would be a message of cheer after this world is over with it we be understanding I thought it was to be an eternal partaking of the revelation of God my concept of that is one thing we're just getting enough while we're here to be able to enjoy when we get over there right and you know what I still don't do away with a lot of things and get over there you know that he that to the bride is she's going he's going to be a special person to the bride you know the foolish virgins and things cuz they get eternal life won't have the understanding you have so they still going to going to be degrees so there's still going to be somebody we can talk to there's still going to be somebody we can sit down for a millennial Reign and talk to people about God your Prophet says they would be a gospel to the Heathen in the Millennium now you interpret what he's saying that's that's his words it's about 14 15 Church age book somewhere right in there but do you understand what I'm getting at I'm trying to get us to look at one true and living God and you see in my home especially when we're sitting around you know we get together we we're eating together or we we have our time together we have Thanksgiving we always get together uh Christmas we get together we get together as much as we can as a family well you know brother uh Quinn I believe it's right he said I'm pretty sure brother Quinn or brother prash one he said brother Dale said I sat there today and watched you said your whole family was around you and said you was sitting there enjoying it I said you're exactly right because I can think about my children as being part of me and think of even the offsprings you know or the things and the even the the ones that have married into the family and things that I can think about them and think about how they're have extended me out into another form you know there as we all sit around the table and eating we we started out with a little table and we've gotten out of where I think is let's see 1 2 3 4 5 we get about 10 or 12 around the table and then we have to put these other tables cuz the family keeps increasing and uh you know as that family increases you know it's me increasing right the DNA is there to prove exactly to the children the grandchildren the great grandchildren and I wish I could live to be 150 years old and see great great great great great great why because brother the brother caught what I was doing he said you were just sitting there grinning looking around I said yeah cuz I look at my family and I think that they're saved and serving the lord you know at least doing the best they can that they're you know they're in church and they're do it well you know what that's an extension of myself so right there in one little meeting I can be many many things but to my wife I'm a husband to my children I'm a father right to my grandchildren I'm a grandfather great grand I'm a great great grandfather and you know what I can talk to all of them but they know who I'm talking about right they know by the words I'm using that who I'm talking about is my you know many forms that are sitting there and see then we try to limit God to the bases that we want to make him to where well now brother Dale there was Jesus standing down here and praying to the father that's exactly right long as you keep that in your Doctrine you won't go to a Oneness you want proof of it what did the prophet say one day people were talking to him evidently about something and and they were trying to convince him of a trinity problem and he said you believe you're born again again don't you I'm paraphrasing it so pretty close he said you believe you're born again said now who do you pray to who do you pray to Jesus had no problem saying Our Father which are in heaven which was a prior to be for us more than for him right but still he had no problems with doing that right what's the problem with one form communicating with the other form who do you pray to if you got the Holy Ghost in you then according to what we believe you have Father Son and Holy Ghost in you as a new birth right cuz we're not Oneness or Trinity that would tell you now be careful you remember them good old Baptist you know that trinitarian be careful now we got to give the father and the son the Holy Ghost all equal parts of our Salvation cuz we don't want to leave one of them out of it your mind don't click back sometimes to when you were sitting there listening how they were trying to explain all these beautiful things and it sounded so great to you but now you look at it and you say man how confused we were you you get what I'm saying see you got to keep that communication gap between Father and Son there's got to be a communication gap to where they can communicate now if that's not right I want you to explain where it says let us if there ain't no communication in your understanding of Doctrine or ideas you better disc considerer the Bible does say let us make man in our own image and our own likeness right now who's the US oh well it's got to be two father and son is not to if you understand it correctly that's right if you understand it it's not true cuz you ain't listening to what I said I can sit there at the table and be father son grandfather great-grandfather husband and just sit there and enjoy it see the Bible says that through the things that we see that the even the Eternal godhead of my quoting the scripture can be understood by the things that we see I'm a father I'm a son I'm a human it doesn't make three out of it yeah but we don't want to leave nobody out the if you got the right understanding you're not leaving anybody out right see you're coming forth with the right understanding to where that you can get the concept of what it's talking about all right so go ahead now and pull back up what we're doing and pull it down to verse um 14 brother C very familiar with each one of us but what is it in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him not them all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made now that's simple enough to understand the one truth but go on over to verse 14 because surely we know who this is in verse 14 it says and the word 13 says which was born not not of blood because it wasn't the blood of man that brought forth a body Eve never produced an egg for the Holy Ghost to Quicken it that make sinful mankind having to do with the body and that's incorrect that could not have been Hebrews 105 which says a body thou Hast prepared me right so watch which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man but of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us who was that who was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now the great Jehovah God through the Old Testament the best you can get closest you can get to him was when he appeared to mzc as MDC to Abraham all right but remember that was a spoken into existence and out of existence that would be no kin folks and you remember the Book of Ruth in the Book of Ruth there had to be a kinsman redeemer the kinsman redeemer had to be kin folks right right so he had to be kin folk so what'd he do he had to become flesh who had to become flesh oh he sent his son we'll get to that in a minute you mean you'd send your son to die come on no God came himself right come on get it in the right order see the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you know he was the only begotten yeah but now I've been begotten you had to be begotten through Jesus Christ coming and giving his life he's the only begotten right Adam came into existence right he was created right but he wasn't begotten the word begotten means that you come in which we're going to get in a couple of scriptures reason I said would cover this the word begotten comes to the point of not a separate creation but the same person in another form form where we get a little further let's keep on going going over now to verse 18 where we was at all right and it says no man has seen God at any time well that's exactly right the only begotten son there's that begotten verse 14 that was begotten all right which is in the bosom of the father he has declared him look at your original translation in the middle it means he brought him out in the open right he made him known you ever thought about bum I guess that's why I was sitting there doing that yesterday and I I thought well I need to cover bum and I got to running a lot of things and looking up a lot of things about it and looking up definitions of the word bum I didn't know I was going to use it today but in me from what I was looking there the word bosom signifies the chest part of an individual right and the Bible talks about being the bosom of Abraham we know that that's not being in literally the bosom of Abraham there was no way for the people to get there it was the faith of Abraham so now you're dealing with something other than abom like we do you remember uh Eli El Shad there in the scripture to Abraham was come and breasted one receive your strength all right mother takes a baby and pulls it into her bosom and you know that little fell he's heard that heartbeat all the time in the body and you know you can't fool him you may be able to work with him a little bit but you can't fool him cuz you take immediately when that baby's born take it and put it to a bosom of a woman that's not the real mother that gave birth he'll scream and cry you may oh yeah he'll get hungry enough after a while he'll eat anything right but he he he Rebels why because he's been in that person that's right right and he knows that heartbeat and that speaking and like I say about most of the babies here they know my voice before they get here because they're sitting there and the mama listening right and be careful what you're taking those little babies around even in your bosom like that you know today that's what gets me as people to smoking drinking and stuff like that and doping and that poor little kid comes in a world a dope head that tears me up that this makes me you know but have you ever thought about what bosom really means the Bible uses it in a lot of ways and phrases of bism but it literally means the front part inwardly not just sticking out as a breast to do it it means the the part of you uh may I get to it later in understanding it means your nature and your ways and a lot of that but it it has one meaning that was very deep to me and made it me think about it what is the center part of your inward being it's your heart your heart now the heart of mankind is a little thumping GE ready to go b b Bo well now that can't describe exactly what you want to about it that's why the Bible will speak of heart and soul because it's bringing it to the being of what you are look up bosom and you'll find that it will tell you that is the very heart of something that heart right in the center is the bosom I love the things the prophet would say that Jesus was the very heart and soul amen of God he said you know why because he was God all right we'll get to it this afternoon a little bit about his nature and his ways or condescending or whatever but I'm just wanting you to think the bosom of ab bosom of the father the very heart of almighty God was displayed on Earth amen all right now the body was a creation right a 16 element creation he could have given you a blood transfusion because it was a 16 element form but the spirit and soul that was inside of there was almighty God Amen or else you're back to your Trinity or Oneness or somewhere again well I just don't I don't know about God having a soul will go ahead I've tried for almost 50 years to explain that that's not joking got tapes to prove it most of you have been around here long enough you've heard me preach on one God enough to know that of what I believe brother randam said in spirit he was God I'll give you these but said in flesh he was a man that's true right that's exactly true he said in Soul he was God Amen but said in body he was a man that's exactly right right you are a body Body Spirit and the Soul right now he created us no matter where you want to think about your doings or whatever you want to go and the great message people of how they try to push you here and make you back dire still remember one thing God created us right right now but he was never created you remember that that was the last kind of where we were getting to where the Prophet said that that God's first creation was God himself now how can you explain that amen it's got to be explaining one God or you got a transan concept or some kind of thought it's messed up all right but if that man standing on the River Jordan wasn't already God before that anointing came on him that everybody in the message wants to make some kind of a that he wouldn't God until then the Bible said he was born God your Prophet said what about your Jehovah god with no teeth you heard them amen he said you're Jehovah God playing as a little boy that's right but see this great Revelation oh but but all that's all that's not true CU he just finally become god well what was he before he become God and where did he go after God left him as they want to say that's what I was telling them last night in the in the fell in the Bible study you know there used to be a Doctrine among the people of the message I guess it still goes we just don't hear about it some of your older ones will remember some of the doctrin that went along they had one called spiritual husband and that doctorine a lot of you come along later didn't hear it but some of you was old was back there and with his kids and you heard it and that Doctrine was that you couldn't go to no other Church except your pastor cuz he was your husband and they called it spiritual husband right brother Ray a lot of it went around we heard didn't we okay he said okay see he was back there with a lot of that I was back there with a lot of that we heard a lot of that well they had one that's called spiritual husband I said and they in other words you as a congregation are my wife I am your husband in the Lord now well I know I'm sarcastic and I'm a dirty old dude I'm sorry but you know what I asked the preachers I said okay we're a congregation we're your wife you're saying we don't go you know out and listen to nobody else cuz that'd be adultery I said how come you preachers are going preach in these other churches you're committing adultery against me cuz I'm your wife well they didn't like that I'll clap on that in myself they didn't like that because it exposed them for what they were doing it was okay for them to go preach but it was wrong for you to go listen to anybody else okay bring it on down today they don't want the internet system to be floating too much come on some of these know what I'm talking about we had meetings here about the internet the couple are grinning that was here because they didn't want you to go on internet with your message brother dick people be listening right they was against the internet they're still against the internet so we'll narrow it on down into one thing and we'll say that a lot of the Pastors in this message you can't get their tapes unless you sign in you just signed your name Miss MIRS so and so when you sign in to listen to them you sign your name MIRS every who you listening to I know I'm dirty but is that true amen that's why I tell you listen to who you want to but just remember one thing if I don't agree with it I will tell you from the pull pit I don't agree with it right not because I'm a spiritual husband but because my daddy don't agree with it right right if my daddy don't agree with it I'm going to tell you I don't agree with it because he's my daddy you know the daddy I'm talking about the word if it don't match up in this word then I'm going to let you know in a hurry I don't agree with it cuz that's my daddy and I'm very jealous about my daddy because of what they do with his word and I don't mind telling you that you said but you said this about so and so but you don't know what they believe I go about what I know as much as I can know if you spend as much time defending the truth as you do defending lies we ain't got no problem sorry that's right that's exactly the way I stand see because to me this one that was as we read in verse 18 that this one that was in the bosom brings out the father right he don't bring out himself right oh man how many years have I been on it everybody says adoption we was back in the 60s and oh they was really going with adoption adoptions and boy one of these days we'll speak that word and it'll just create itself well I believe that I believe that I've seen it happen so I don't have to worry about it all right but see we want to make it something that way that we come into the view look what I done I was the one that said that you ever watch that you know like a lot of people my my my my me me me me my my my right we'll get in my car and we'll go down to my house and we'll go in my living room and we'll sit down on my couch and them M get you could set a whole lot more in between there without the m I'm not throwing off on anybody because I realize what Natures are you know what those Natures are is people that didn't have anything when they were young little and everything becomes mine I'm not against that not talking about anything I'm just talking about one thing if we put anything above this word something went wrong and then why is Lula spoken of as a word word word word word word people well what's the matter you don't want to word well you know I just don't agree with you like I said last a couple weeks ago if I tell you you're wrong I'm going to show you why that I'm saying that I'm not just going to say you're wrong and walk off but see you present something I don't agree with that brother Dale I think you're wrong well show me where I'm wrong cuz I want to be right right well you won't listen to me you ever tried it I don't agree with you well you know what if you don't agree with me you're supposed to come to me you're not supposed to explain to everybody else why you differ with me you're supposed to come to me and we can sit down and talk about it all right but look that only begotten all right now I can quote the prophet if you want it he said there was never another son begotten like that son all right are you with me right when it says the only begotten you got it twice there in what we've read about 14 and 18 the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now that's got to be one true and living God or we've messed up somewhere in our Concepts our thoughts that's what listen I know and realize one thing for certain I know the human mind because I have one and I know that what you've been taught is still embedded in you and no matter what you do may I quote the Catholic Church they say give me a child right till it's what five 6 years old said you can have it the rest of your life now I differ with the new birth you know I I I differ with them that the New Birth can change things but I agree with them in the natural they may leave the Catholic church but they just go join a Baptist they go join another one they'll go join this or that because that's embedded into you this is your right hand you know say to people raise your right hand what you raise your right hand well if we're on the opposite side of the earth which hand you going to raise look at in the mirror raise your right hand turn around backwards and get you another mirror and look in the mirror which one going up oh you're silly that's what I'm talking about it's silly it's silly the way we think CU we don't take the Bible that's what it says right we don't take the prophet's message as to what it says we've got it already figured out and I Know It And I've been dealing with it for 50 years preaching that I cannot change none of your thoughts they will not change because of a weight of matter I I give 40 quotes for that that weighty of matter won't change you right it takes the Holy Spirit to reveal it is that the prophet page 45 Christ mystery God reveal is that right or in future home one somewhere right in there it takes a Holy Holy Spirit the only revealer of the word the father right but said you don't believe in Father Son and Holy Ghost I Believe In Father Son and Holy Ghost that's what I'm trying to explain I believe it so much until when you say oh God was he poured into Christ I don't whack them out of space over here and leave it empty right I still got something when I get there I can talk to him about he can explain it to me right that's the way I see the father now you show me where father son Holy Ghost has ever done away with right did your memory click you see that's why I like to preach did your memory click that there'll be a time that his son will become subject does that subject to you mean the son's done away with that's the Bible that the son himself shall become subject that God may be all in all is that doing away with the son no it means his time our existence is finished not done away finished cuz he's no longer from the bosom trying to explain the Father the father himself has already come into being right that's right it does what me do away with am on that's why I like to preach see I like to get it when I know that your mind is rolling and you come up when I look at your eyes eyes in your eyes he don't know that and I say uh oh I do know that I just got through explaining that cuz you explain it some other way and you're going to have him contrary to what is it uh Malachi 3 and 6 is that the one where he said I'm God and I change not are you going to be with Hebrews 13:8 same yesterday today and forever so whatever he is what was our life's messages I'll get a second on it what was it all the at attributes we showed you the video come come and put that up Brothers you know of what we've been doing that all the attributes God had him before he ever come into this world as a creation or Creator and the prophet would use that statement which is you know mindboggling to the human mind he said in the beginning but before the Eternal you can't even think that way that ain't all of the quotes that's just open enough p pull up the little drawing brother that we made all the attributes that God ever will have was in him before the world or else he changed somewhere right he didn't gain attributes over on this side he displayed attributes well that's what I can't understand well then you need to pray because I wasn't the one if you want the quotes we'll go pick up this afternoon on this point right here the attributes is Father Son and Holy Ghost there's only three attributes of God okay now all of these attributes here has to deal with Father Son and Holy Ghost okay no problem right because there's only three attributes Father Son and Holy Ghost I didn't bring that because that's sensible you ought to know but what about before the world in his mind and his thinking and his attribute which is part of him he was already a father no no no no there was nothing back there see that's where you're tying it up let me let me read what WR you see you are thinking that he has the ability to become something that's what you're thinking you're thinking he's back here with the ability to become something I differ with you 100% right cuz the prophet said he had all these attributes in him right but I just don't understand that I can't figure that out brother d i i kind of comprehend father and I kind of get along with these and these and these and the it's hard to do with the Christ but sure it's hard to do with the son cuz that look like Eternal sunship no it's not if you understand the word there's no such thing as Eternal sunship but there's an eternal God did Jesus have eternal life I thought we read in John where it says and the life was in him what are you thinking see you are thinking that he has the ability to become these attributes you're not thinking the way I am that these attributes was already in him I thought we believe that every Apple that would ever be on a tree was in the seed when it went in the ground right that's right if not where'd it come from right I thought that all three of my children was in me in a seed germ form and the DNA would prove that that they were there when I was born that's right no no now you finally become see that's that's what I mean you're thinking that he has the ability to be able to be these things the prophet is explaining that he had these things within him right but they were not displayed that's right but they were in him or else he changed somewhere now you see the seriousness where you're at but I don't understand that son well you need to understand where it over there you remember when he looked down into the furnace and he said we throw three in there but said the one that I see down there is like the Son of God you know that King didn't have no problem saying that right well see we think of son as beginning all right let me get just a second all of his attributes when they come over on the other side they can be expressed now because there was no ability back here to be expressed so now he has the ability when you become on over into the creation etc etc he has the ability to start displaying his attributes but you can't display more over there than you do over here or more over here than you do over there right that's why when I sum these up see all of this summing up means speech or word all of these comes down to be word where he said let thy be right any problems within the scriptures that all things were created by Him who the word right let me get these real fast let's read the Bible and see about this Creator we'll get to it this afternoon more we'll go to I've got them in order for them to bring them but we'll run it up run it up to uh Ephesians 3 and9 but go ahead and bring up to the the scriptures Brother Anderson you know that I gave to you all right but Ephesians 3:9 says and to all to make all men see what is the glory I mean what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God which created All Things by Jesus Christ right now we know Jesus the flesh was not back there that's sensible right right right but you know that's where your mind hangs anytime you say Jesus you say flesh I thought Jesus was the only name God ever had right am I right is that the way your Prophet explains it that Jesus is the only name God ever had all right see then he's not saying that all things were created by Jesus Christ the flesh man standing back there who was back there the Christ and who was that Christ the name Jesus had not come into being at that time but did he not have no name you had a no name God until you got over to where the scripture said and you'll call his name Jesus now come on you're getting all messed up but see if all things were created by Jesus Christ then you're right when Peter when Jes Jesus asked Peter he said who the man say I the son of man am Matthew what it 16:13 now he asked him who was the son of man Peter didn't understand him because that was a mystery but he did understand one thing because watch what he said Thou Art the Christ the son of the Living God right amen that's right right you are the Creator right cuz who else done the Crea oh the father did we'll get to it this evening where brother R says the father didn't do it the son created you going to say well the father had it in his mind let's read where the Prophet said the son had in his mind what to do you see I love it I love it you may not like it at all but I do I love the word of God go back now let's go to we done been with John and what did we get in John we got in John 1:3 so jump back up to there and we'll start reading then we'll quit all right John 1:3 or 1:1 and all things were made now this beginning this word this person and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made so then half dozen creators got one put this an end look at First Corinthians look at the next one 1 Corinthians 8 and6 that's what I said a lot of scriptures we just don't use all of them but to us there is but one God the father of whom are all things and we in him and one Lord Jesus Christ oh there's two by whom all things are all things and we by him so remember we'll get to it eventually he created us that's right we doesn't create him all right look at Colossians we've used Ephesians look at Colossians Colossians 1:16 who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created what first born of every creature the only begotten right that we still with the scripture that are for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers so the devil had to have a beginning didn't he all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist right look at the next one Hebrews one God who at Su times and in diverse manner spake in times pist unto the fathers by the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son the original says in his son whom he hath appointed air of all things but whom also he made the worlds all right look at the next one Revelations 4:10 the 4 and20 Elders fall down and who is this one the kinsman redeemer the 4 and20 Elders who Jesus Christ right around the throne what he's sitting on the throne Jesus Christ before him that sat on the throne and worship him that liveth forever and ever and cast their crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and honor and power for thou Hast created all things and for thy pleasure they are and were created look at the next one Psalms 33 and 6 by the word of the Lord speech Lord God speech word in the beginning was the word word with God and the Word was God all right by the word of the Lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth that's good right think about it there can't be but one Creator there can't be but one God amen amen they can't be but one savior they can't be but one Healer can't be we're quick to let him be healer we're quick to let him be savior but we don't want let him be God well that's contrary to the Bible come on musicians think about it what do you think about one God well there you know got to well what do you think about it the great Creator became my savior as we s and all God's fullness dwell in him out of the bosom of the Father the heart the very being of God come into being right and he created all things now we're going to get to it so before you get to it this evening let me uh click this because I like to do this I know I'm dirty but I like to do it when we get into talking about the coming into existence of the sun you're going to automatically say 2,000 years ago when your Prophet is automatically talking about before the world so before you get started I warn you don't let your little computer go but he just don't understand cuz that was after whatever he is now he has always been and will forever be that he said I'm God and I change not right so if you don't change why do we want to change you say yeah but brother Dale we think we we've been taught the TR that the son created yeah but the father created him well then if he created him he can't be Eternal come on the way we use the word create cannot be Eternal so then you got your scriptures messed up let's Stand Together think on these things what is your thoughts of one God well brother de I have to admit I never thought about what you said well then maybe you want to sit down and think about it I mean that's really the reason I said it a trinitarian don't have a bit of trouble with a father over here and a son over here and a church over here and and just all kind of manifestations that have a bit trouble with that right is that true that's true the oness their problem is that they can only go so far see they just pick up everything move it over to here and they'll say Jesus was almighty god well that's true but then when you say let us they don't like that but when you say there's one sitting on the throne they like that that's their Doctrine but do you have trouble with that you have trouble with it saying let us make man do you know that I can show you where brother Bram said that he was even just talking to the animals if you remember that the animals are created for we were he's talking to animals how he's going to create us but yeah we got to get it all we had a message go ahead brother 188 spiral book 188 one true and living God from his glory ever living you have a need the altar is open my God and and Jesus was his name morning M Str why do we have to make the Bible say what we wanted to say why can't we say what it says for my bre My All In All the great became my and oh God what about it you have a need he's still the Healer if he ever healed anybody he's still a Healer ever saved anybody he's still a savior he ever was the word he still is the word and the word come to the prophet is that Bible God gracious tender he didn't become God when he got on this side he said but God is an to worship he already had that within him he displayed it he said let us make man in her own image then whatever image now listen this is where you're missing it my whatever image the man is is the same image of God is or you missed your language so if we find out what he was that's what he still is if we find out what he is that's what he was but you see we think well we understand it because God is an object of worship and created angels amen that's true why can't you use the word God the Bible use the word God glor he said God is the spirit he said there in Hebrews that we just read it said God in time and divers man I know th word The Great I Am I wish I had a voice enough to sing I wish I could sing that's one thing shake hands with one another as you leaving just singing that song to each other cuz that's what we believe in right all in all the creat
