what we need to speak about because that we can take a topic when you take a thought but yet within that it's what we need to have and we pray you would help us to understand forgive our sins and lead us by thy grace in Jesus name Matthew 24 will begin verse 15 we therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing in the Holy Place whoso readeth let him understand that not them which are in Judea flee let them which are be in Judea flee into the mountains let him which be on the housetop not come down to take anything out of this house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes you remember how we were bringing out verse 15 brings out the mosque of Omar then you get up to the sixteen and I like that you started talking about when Titus come into Jerusalem in AD 70 and those that were caught inside the city see they were told to leave this is telling them to get out and they said there was no record of any true Christian left in and that's brother Evans wording left in Jerusalem because they all fled you know for safety okay need to let him which be in the field return back to take his clothes well and woe unto them that are with child and to them that give suck in those days he'd be hard travelling hard moving in in all the doings all right we pray that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day because the Judean heals I think would be covered over at that time so pray that that wouldn't happen well then shall the Great Tribulation such as was not since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there should no flesh be saved but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you lo here is Christ coming alway down out of where we're at all right there believe it not for there shall arise false Christ's and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect and brother Brennan said now he would get it so tight up until he cut to work short all right now remember what I'm saying about the words short it looks like saying it that way that he was intended for it to lives 40 more years when he's going to stop it that's not the point you remember years ago when we started doing it where the Bible speaks of he'd do a short work you murder scripture said he'd do a short work cut it short and righteousness that word work is word look it up Andy Dixon looking up near in quarters it means word he's not going to cut shorts on he's going to pour the word in you understand he's going to pour the word in and make it work um in real feist in the last days called it's a short word that he's going to do not a short work in cutting days off the the great eternal God wouldn't be doing that away you know it's not but that you know I think about that that he does it we'll do a short word all right behold I have told you before we're if we're for if that you don't say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth he is in the secret chambers believe it not where is the Lightning cometh out of the east and Shina 'the even unto the West so shall also the coming of the Son of man be for so ever the carcass is there will evils be gathered together you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word many of you probably remembers a man one time they used to you know but around confirms there's about forty something different kind of Eagles they are such thing is vulture Eagles all right and you know Brett around them confirms that and this Pentecostal preacher was making fun of me there at work about it and see they call me uh the head eagle you know and because of this trying to gather a group to that you know in the fight but I told him I said now you can make four hundred me I talked to him personally quite there's a Pentecostal preacher of it I said you can make fun of me all you want to and I said I know about the forty something different kind of Eagles I said there were it's vulture Eagles I admit that but that also means they're true legals alright and I said now you're a preacher and I knew it said I said I know your church teaching on that Scripture I said your turret your church teaching is that's the coming of the Lord and he just backed off and he said I'll never say another word about you okay thank you don't you see that's what that's talking about this is talking about the coming of the Lord where the carcass is the Eagles would be gathered where the Word of God is your children will gather to that word all right now watch it when we get over to where we're going to in stop to not in the message at a little point of brother branham selling us that with this part we're talking about the anointing we can find out whether we are seed or weeds all right then we'll get to that if we can get get to the point but I want you to think on on those things all right now so that would be false christs in the last days all right read that over and over and over about it because even just reading at one time you you don't get what you need keep reading it until you in you know until you see what all of it's talking about all right and then it's the fulfillment of the Scriptures yeah we know that where the carcass is equal to be getting on all that's the fulfillment of the scriptures and all that what we were we're just reading the parts of it too you know where it talks about the Christ don't go after it in other words don't go after all of these false doctrines all right you remember how that we brought out Deuteronomy the other day in the life services all right they didn't Deuteronomy it talks about how that he would bring among the people allow these things to happen that false prophets would come and said if they preached to you in other words and said it comes to pies but said if they lead you to another God don't believe them another message another thought not another God another thought another doctrine another idea like the people of this message see that they'll take brother brems message and twist it and make another doctrine another idea but remember what is it Galatians 1:8 that there can't be but one gospel there's not but one truth all right so then we should settle into that point of following the truth the message of the hour and not getting tied up in all of this other because that is part of what God is allowed he would allow it says there in Deuteronomy he would bring these among us to trash brother Brent said he would do it to find out if whether we'd stay with the truth or not you mean God will allow these things to happen to his children yes to see whether or not we're his children see whether or not we'll stay with what he's saying or take some thoughts of our own Rydia the room and you see today in the mass destruction across the land with the people we're doing it when the Bible says that they must needs be heresies among you that they that are approved may be made manifest manifested to make known these things of coming in the last days to try me and you to see where they will stay with the truth or not all right and see that's going to be given it's give us all these years to try and see you it's got to be because the scripture speaks of how you you've got to be somewhere before you could fall away well that's where the people of the message fifty years of studying the message or something and then fall away see that scripture we shouldn't be downhearted about the hour that we're in if we see what's going on we should be rejoicing because some work is going to have to come to pass that all of this will be consummated or ever how you say it and it'll be it'll come back to the point that something's going to happen and praise God whatever you're looking for to happen whatever I'm looking for it to happen thank God bring it on let's see what it'll bring because it's going to take these things to praying that whatever you think it is it's gonna take the point of where that Satan is loosed to try the people and what about now if the Bible speaks over there because it's always been amazing to me when brother Brown spoke with those back there you know about so many hundred thousand everything he said it's meant to be loosed on the bride he said it was loosed on Israel to drive her to the homeland said it'll be loosed on the bride to drive her work to the message of the hour demons what about all the demons it was already dire and then what a two hundred thousand thousands there how many millions that would be you know is loosed on the bride to drive her to the homeland well I'll tell you one way you talk about God I don't like him too well well he's wanting to be a daddy he's wanting to be a father he's wanting to display himself and to show us how much he loves us and sometimes he has to spank us sometimes he has to whip us to get us to do I was thinking today about it now and think about all of us how much sickness is among us but you know what they ain't one now bad colds are I wish we could get in our mind the right way of looking at to me a bad cold or a sniffle or something like that I don't count that as the devil life to me boy I tell you what I blowed my nose twice yesterday devil must be after me uh that's that's getting a little too narrow I think but you know what they can't be one thing come on you if God don't permit it is that right I don't sound good does it hey brother I'm sick well the devils after us all right let's see if we don't realize it that way then we'll try to everything else okay all right just trying to get a little point now to us tonight in a thought that I have a really brother I'll take was striking on something and it just rolled over into work that I was speaking and I said oh okay that's good you know and so we'll just continue the thought all right now what about these that are false christs cuz that's what it's called them and Matthew 24 false christs all right now not meaning where the way we make it of false christs the as to the point of making it that the individual person can be wrong but the Christ is right we said we'll look at Balaam and how he was yes but look at him I looked at up finally the other day to work do it I wrote today I'm some so to me yeah baylin's prophecy you'll find it in in numbers 24 one through five always said Balaam prophesied it's not necessarily prophesying of the coming of the Lord into that realm but it's close to it because that's what the Scriptures see Balaam prophesied it was even written in the Bible typhus prophesied I said it was necessary that one died for the sins of the people being High Priest brother Branham said the anointing came on him to testify that so then we're not looking at false Christ as to try to find some kind of hwangbang guy out here that claims you've got all this and all the others and and all kind of things happening but those things are happening and you know what there's gifts following those things now where's the gift comes from when I talk about bad gifts we're talking about real good gifts see we're going to get in to that point a little more when we finish that we'll get into the next message and that's why I won't kind of put it in a couple of message together though of how that we know what the prophet has told us that what the anointing is upon your spirit all right it's upon your spirit the anointing is upon your spirit it's not in your soul it's not on those bases and it works back out through that spiritual part out into the flesh so that's not the point but the anointing is on the spirit alright now remember what we read knew that that Christ would be so deceiving until it would almost deceive the elect now that's pretty strong that ain't no Baptist got here hollered we believe in three guards and you get up to heaven you ain't going to heaven and find this one sitting there that's gonna be three or four and all over the plug you need something like that here you got to get closer right see then that Christ see we always took anything that would be in any way relation to God would be good we could never consider even though the Bible would call it that I'm talking about we as people we would never consider that to be what the Prophet came out to teach it as being then it would turn out to be the genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit on your spirit and you still be lost no we always thought anybody shouted spoken tongues oh they've got a lot of problems or something anybody that claim to be a Christian come to our door shook hands with the preacher whatever you know we always come with him so Christians just got problems but just remember now the things that we talked about and knew don't never place the wrong thing upon God is doing and in heaven help you to try to figure out some way that God is doing these things to the line of it and it not line up with the word let him line it up let him say it let him say this is my army that I sent among you right see did he send the devil no he permitted the devil now you got it right you're not putting it in the wrong place you getting it in the right order so that's what we're we're supposed to be looking at but let's go to the scripture now and just see on this of the earth this day in coming forth from the Old Testament of the types and shadows then we can come to the New Testament code if you can't follow the anointing throughout the Old Testament so you'd never be able to understand how Moses could tell God a better way of doing something right you can't figure out those things back there that was in the Old Testament yeah unless you understand anointed ones and we're over here on this side with the Holy Ghost to not just be an anointing but to be a new birth but not to just be anointed with the Holy Spirit but to actually have the very life of Christ living within us but to understand what took place to bring it down so we come through the Old Testament down into the hour they were living so go ahead brothers and pull up number two on you your things are cuz I told them they didn't have no number one because these notes I've had them for about three weeks I guess and I still got a lot of a lot of you've got them if you held on but look what it says in in acts two they were all amazed now you know what happened here this is the coming of the Holy Ghost right when it fell under their Pentecost okay and they were all amazed and weird out we're in doubt send one to the other what meaneth this in other words what's what's taking place these things that are happening others Malkin said these men are full of new wine but Peter standing up with the eleven lifted up his voice and said unto them you men and brethren and all ye that dwell at Jerusalem be this known unto you and hearken to my words where these are not drunken as you suppose seeing these about the third hour of the day but this is that which was spoken of the Prophet Joel now the baptism of the holy ghost coming was spoken of by the Prophet Joel and it shall come to pass in the last days say if God I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh alright your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my spirit and they shall prophesy and I'll show great wonders in heaven and all like that now watch keep in mind what it's saying our Porco we're going back to jaw pick that up but look it's poor from all flesh now that doesn't mean everybody's got the Holy Ghost or it's living in them right has nothing to do with that relationship it's pouring it out upon all flesh now look what it's saying I'll pour my spirit upon all flesh and your sons whatsit and your daughter's shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and your old men shall dream dreams and on my servants here's your's and here's mine showing that's what I'm talking about showing that it'll be on all flesh it'll be poured out and all flesh shall be put to the basis that they can receive it it doesn't mean now I'm honest - try to say now - correct the scripture but I don't see everybody in the world getting anointing because you don't want to know what Judas and I mean all these over the owners and Buddhists and Hindus and Muslims and the things like that so you don't get all of that and you pull he's gonna pour it out on Oh flesh I remember one brother preaching here one time he he had that - going so much that he had the cabbage having the Holy Ghost I said now that's a little bit too far I don't think the cabbage is got it this you know but that's aura but look what it says see I pour it my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy and your young men shall see visions and old men shall dream dreams and on my servants and on my handmaids I will pour out in those days of my spirit and your prophesy okay what are you putting out on the hall now the Bible says that rain falls on the just and the unjust right now that's what it's talking about it's falling on we'll read that in a minute it's falling on all flesh not on everything that's doing the rain don't fall out there are those places in the world that hadn't had any rain in five hundred years probably so that's not you saying this come fall everywhere like falling everywhere get the right understanding of what we're talking about he's gonna pour it out on those that would receive it right all right now while we're at that point let's drop back there and just read it so we won't have the you know let's go back to to jaw and read that so that we won't won't mess up on that have you got it I know I didn't give it to you on these notes but I've got it in in the others but you know I was just gonna show you but this you got you got time to go back and read it yourself okay now listen pour out his spirit on all flesh meaning that it will be Jew and Gentile that's what it's meaning to pour it out on all flesh right so we're in a Gentile dispensation a Gentile dispensation means nations that can come in and receive all right the spirit can be poured out and it was poured out on the day of Pentecost and it was just a select group that was there to receive it all right showing that that was not the total fulfillment of joy that it would be poured on all flesh but it would come to the life that because there you only have true genuine seed in the Upper Room right a hundred and twenty crew genuine seed all right now exclude Judas and send him out of it before it's over with that he was dire you know all right but then see in the last days he would pour it out on the other time pour out upon all things now forgive me to try to be so carnal but I pick up wrong thoughts maybe they're mine but like I said on the zoo the street it wasn't poured out on everybody in the world it wasn't poured out on the day of Pentecost on everybody in the world so saddle the point in your mind what it's saying he poured out on all flesh if poured out to her that any point Jew Gentile Samaritan water that was not so an original on the dead pinnacle on the day of Pentecost that was only the Jews right and even your first church age was basically all Jews just a few Gentiles sprinkled in here and yonder the Prophet said all right let's see then in this - spliced days on the zoo the street of 1906 the Holy Ghost fell and it would it fell then to where that it would go on to any nation or any part but it's not going to fall on something that's not religious we'll get to that as we go along your anointing that one anoint your spirit will make you religious not but I hope I get to the end of the message where I wrote the notes like this there's a vast difference between Christianity and religion but then religion can be anointed right okay come on now let's get the point in this let's go down all right reason I want you to read the Norn he wants the endtime because I like the way he explains it okay so let's go ahead with number three paragraph 25 okay let's see now watch what he's getting at there shall arise false prophets anointed ones with a message the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed and that would be a prophet anointed there shall rise false anointed teachers now watch him if you take literally word for word what he's saying if it only be poured out on the Prophet so don't get hooked in on that you say brother Dale you just make things so dry and carnal do we get dead listening to you well there's one thing about it you don't have to have no misunderstanding this ain't dealing with just one prophet right come on because there's plenty of false prophets huh now watch and the only way the message could be brought out is by one that's anointed and that would be a prophet and on it there's arrives false anointed teachers a prophet teaches what his message is anointed teachers but anointed people with false teaching anointed people with false teaching Nordic ones Christ plural prophets plural if there's such a thing as a Christ thing later then there would have to be a anointed ones that their prophecy or what they were teaching would be different be the difference because there are no indeed ones all right then he said this is a Sunday School lesson so let's get down he said in the scriptures not by what someone else have said about it but just reading the scripture you say how can this be how can it be that there can be false christs that can have the actual genuine Holy Spirit anointing their spirit and teaching false doctrine come on one of these days we're going to find out why the Prophet had to come bring us the word now he didn't come to bring us the anointing he didn't come to bring us those thing he come to bring us the word God will anoint the word because I like we said one time he said you don't have to pray for God to northwards that hid words already anointed all right so I like that okay now listen you say how can this be would the anointing want what were they Christ CHR is TS anointed Christ's and false prophets anointed ones but false prophets Jesus said that the rain falls on the just and the unjust okay nice putting it in the scripture now someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon a person and yet they're false what's he meaning they're false they're not born again is that simple terminology they're not born again all right so no matter what the anointing is that's why I've always tried to do a fan I set up in the other day I found out that they're teaching now that the twelve had the Holy Ghost before Pentecost but they had it back before Jesus was crucified I said my lord people we we understood the bat in the Baptist Church we taught that you couldn't get born again until after the Holy Ghost fell cuz the Bible said it but see that's how far people can go off and claim this mass limit with their own concept or thought see of the anointing they're false they're not falsely anointed the yesterday or a time being falsely anointed would be something with half now the anointing is genuine but their teaching is what's false all right well how much closer does it get with Balaam that his teaching was not false of what he said about Jesus Christ what about Caiphas that his teaching was not false when he prophesied that one must die for the sins of the people yet it was an anointed one they were nothing wrong with the anointing brother Branham said Balaam could not say you remember he told him he told by that he said I'll go away he said but I can't say nothing only what that angel or what God tells me and he regard listen what he was offering he said I'll give you so much in the king he said you can give me the whole thing he said I can't say nothing that God don't tell me and he didn't but he tricked the people into going wrong after the Murat by women and the things that was in the land but as far as his message that he brought he was lined up good but did anyone after the wrong time money is sometimes right listen and listen close and see what it's in and they shall show signs and wonders and so much that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible and they are anointed with a genuine holy spirit I know this sounds very foolish but we're going to take time and examine it by the word that that's absolutely thus saith the Lord the truth what about it the anointing is not false it's the anointing it's the Holy Spirit and it's on the people my fault it's not thoughts anointed ones its anointed ones that they themselves are false because of their teaching had Balaam stayed with God he stayed there was that's what's always caught me I like things something bangs you read Ron said one day he said to be a prophet in Israel meant something Wow Balaam is a false prophet but it meant something you know what everybody running to him wanting him to what would happen if brother Branham would went after the wrong time you know the gift would have still been working her you remember how that they tried to get him to find out all well and he knew exactly where it was at but he knew they was going to use the money wrong and they had done told him they would put the money in the work of God he would have been a multi-billionaire and he turned every bit of a dime that gift and that prophet would work that's why it was being so dangerous you think it couldn't the bra what if brother branham would went to Israel he said God told him said don't go I said to you NIC with the a Manoj does not fool yet so don't go he said I said I do believe that I'll have something to do remember with Israel getting the message and I believe it too they're gonna get this message they're going to get it through to prophets but it'll be thus saith the Lord right straight through from this message to show them the truth of it all I believe that but what if he the wind what if he that got up and said if I'm right let God come and vindicate it you say what have God done it yes he killed 40-something children because the Prophet said first brother run said now that was not God he knew how to handle it but he said it was the power of the Prophet the one of these days I'll preach on what anointing really is because brother branham tells us anointing is not speaking in tongues shout and crying this and then give signs of one but the Prophet said anointing was supreme power in control now that's the anointing supreme power in control see that's why if you know the truth and you got it right you ain't afraid of nothing you think I'm afraid to go on the internet around the world preach what I preach the way that I preached home Cosi I've always got one time if you correct what I preach I can gain from that but if it turns out it don't maybe you get corrected so okay I don't work but listen now all right now you said you mean to tell me that that is the genuine Holy Spirit see we've talked and basically most of people the message still teach it that way that if you was in any way connected with God you got eternal life you're okay and if you got gifts working in UI you really okay and it's not much different than what I remember brother mo telling about that guy that had run off with a piano player and this lady called him up and were talking to him on the phone and and she come back and told him said he still had the Holy Ghost said cuz he was speaking in tongues right while he was talking to me that's something they didn't matter if he'd run off with a piano player she thought he was still right but you see Church why it would be so close it would deceive the very elect if it was possible all right well frankly the Prophet said he'd get them tied up then he'd have to cut the work short like I said I hope I won't repeat it again because that one is hard to follow come on listen to what I'm saying about it that anointing is so wonderful you realize that this the Prophet said the same Holy Ghost that was on Moses was on Balaam the same Holy Ghost that was on Caiaphas is the one that was on the Lord Jesus Christ but you know what I love about it the same Holy Ghost that was dwelling inside of the Lord Jesus Christ by your new birth that Holy Spirit is dwelling in you not as an anointing remember I've made this statement Ubar well that you write it down anointed ones are not sealed in because it's in your spirit and you're not sealed in your spirit you're sealed in your soul so anointed ones you see real quick I'll just ask you the question because this is what is with me what's the difference in a person who really genuinely has a brother branham okay what's the difference in brother Branham now take sot him being a prophet and etc but i'm using that as an illustration what's the difference in answering someone believer that you could think of they're both anointed but you realize that old Joe Blow or of who you'd call the other one Samuel Dale or anything you want to do it you know that anointing if I'm I don't matter of fact inside of me as false as can be this spirit with inside of me can be anointed by the Holy Spirit and do great signs and wonders and me be lost and die and go to hell just get your morning is the ride of what you're doing and when you're reading the book you'll see what he's talking about or listen to this day there's no difference in that anointing it doesn't matter whether you're a Christian or not the anointing is where you're anointed you're not sealed in that anointing you're sealed by the baptism of the Holy Spirit in your soul that displays back out through your spirit and into your body what about it do we realize that but you realize that's - like he's saying you mean to tell me that you believe that is a genuine anointing come on you say how can this be would you know at once what were they Christ chri ASDs anointed christ and false prophets anointed once with false prophets jesus said that the rain would fall on the just and the unjust someone might say to me do you mean do you believe that that anointing on those people means that it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine Holy Spirit of God upon a person but yet they are false he said what he's saying we've got one another one in here we gots a whole lot more robe right where he says they're lost yes but you can't tell me brother Dale I'm lost I better have anointed I feel it that's why brother Brown said you can't tell that woman was cutting grass I heard with her short song it was wrong for her to do it I know that not I'll get to that one he said you can't tell her that why because she's anointed being anointed with the Spirit of God doesn't mean you're saved I'm trying to get that to all of us well you're taking away everything now if I'm taking away anything it's not genuine false word can't even take away truth right don't worry about it uh-huh go ahead to number five let's read number four word let's get to Helen let's get Deuteronomy they had the other day okay all right now rise willing you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and give it the assignor a wonder and the sign or the wonder come to pice or for he spake unto thee saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve them thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams for the Lord your God prove with you to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul my brother Dale how can we know how can we know whether we're right or not what's the evidence of the holy ghost it's where the spirit and you agrees with the word or not now remember that's not talking about anointing though come on it's whether or not that that's living within you as the Jesus Christ in your soul sealed in by the by the anointing of the Holy Ghost and made alive the word that's within there and you turned around and you won't be deceived do you understand what I'm trying to say I said this 40 years ago I said one day and I was using this verse scripture I said what would happen if you rolled three caskets in here and a guy get up there and say you know that everybody don't believe in my doctor and or two souls to Lourdes and whatever this or that or the other kind of messages but said God's gonna raise these from the dead said you come down and raise them and what if they're raised from the dead God says he's doing it to try it come on what I mean if you're gonna do anything in this message why not get down the end of the message that's what gets me if you're they come up with some idea because of something day that's under something this side of that they don't get into the meat of the message because we're not to sold doctrine came out years ago you know what it sent me on the study of the soul the to sold doctrine set me anchored into one thing to learn what the Prophet said about the soul what the Bible said about it because it was very very deceiving but not enough to deceive anybody hardly but yet it did where are you at that's not hearken under the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams let's see wedges before we get to where's another one I want one hold on a minute yeah if you'll drop back to number three when brother branham is on the anointed ones in town easy listen close and see what he said and they shall show signs and wonders and so much that it would deceive the very elect if it were possible and they are anointed with the genuine holy spirit I know that sounds very foolish but we're going to take time and explain it by the word that's that's absolutely thus saith the Lord yeah that should be enough for any of us but listen going back over to number five let's become that we was in number four these are all from anointed once the end time today on the message the same Holy Spirit does annoyance the church that gives them a desire to save souls that gives them power to perform miracles it falls on the unjust the same as the just and the very same spirit now you can't make it another way and understand Matthew 24:24 he said there shall arise false Christ's false anointed ones anointed with the genuine thing but be false prophets of it false teachers of it see false teachers anointed anointed christ but false teachers is selling the way you can see it hmm let's get number six and then we'll see because this would be where we'll get to and stop now teaching of Balaam not the prophecy of Balaam that's it that was all right the what the prophecy of Balaam not the teaching of Balaam wooden rod is true prophecy of Balaam because that was what God said that was all right that was God having to believe that congregation says amen the prophecy of Balaam was exactly right because he couldn't speak nothing else the anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing else I don't understand when people say God told me God can't told you and me anything that ain't in his word that might not be good language but it's plain since he can't teach you something that's not in his word so I'm gonna stay with a word I'll do the best I can see Balaam was exactly right because you couldn't speak nothing else the anointing of God wouldn't speak nothing else and God vindicated by proving it was the truth but it was the teaching of Balaam now compare that with Mathew 24:24 anointed ones their teaching is false the Trinities and all these things like that wrong now I'm saying they should have put wrong and in space Antichrist cuz that's what it is wrong not wrong at across wrong it was the Antichrist it's the end of Christ now that's taking the people away from the real truth what else is doing it then cinnamoned the Trinity's in thing say the things that they're doing today well brother Branham doctor and Colorado and and he being brother ought to talk about this Sunday this was a was in the seventies we had ministers means on in seventies about 71 somewhere right in there about that cloud out there in Colorado I mean Arizona and I told them then I said what if you gonna find that one these day they change the dates on the hunting rights and and allowed in the hut that week all it is is a discrepancy between what's in the magazine lie and brother branham and his statements and then something spoke to me the other day time waiting on it to see I believe it did said they're dealing with the wrong date now we'll see one of these days whether that'll come out right or not but that was the statement that was made said they're dealing with the wrong day what do I care that's what I told brother oil tick what I told you over and over and over I don't care what they prove I don't care what they say about brother Brennan and the message and the things like here he led me to the Lord Jesus Christ and that's where I'll stay I don't care what you say he'd done or didn't do or did do over there whatever you're just trying to find some little something no a prophet stands before no man what if brother Branham gave the wrong dates out there as a human being to where it would be confusing to you and me I said if a human being he couldn't lie about it but he could make a statement of the wrong date on the human beings I remember from his beginning up till ninth inning in really 64 coming into the seals heard of random talk the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost the seals had to break to show him the truth of that now what are you gonna do you know what he would do go back and listen he would teach that to white horse rights even in your church age bukas he would stand up there and say if I've told you the truth let God come and vindicate it and God raised the dead and healed the sick and done all kind of miracles and wonders let me state it at what people are saying about with false word it wasn't false word that had never shined on that I don't care of course Larkin talked before brother Branham ever come that the white horse rider was a the Antichrist that don't make no difference he was not the messenger he said you say what I say he said because I will be responsible and up until 64 right in there he was teaching that but light remember whipped off the top he said light never shined down in here there was nobody could correct him do you understand what he said when he made the statement he said no prophet a man don't stand between God and a prophet there's no way for a human mortal to correct a prophet of God come on it ain't even sensible because even Balaam couldn't tell it wrong you say yeah but brother Branham was wrong all them years oh let's take some more from fifties up to 63 64 he told body so spirit as the three rims right but then when the seals broke he taught body spirit soul excuse me are going to inward body outside spirit second trim shoulders the sinner you realize until he taught that you can teach false doctrine with him if all I had was from 62 back I could read you that brother Branham said this you say yeah but wait a minute yeah if he said something else like I'd take that now it was there's that thing he sent it to tries to tries to see what we do what are we going to do with it all right let me read this because this is the point I won't compare that with Matthew 24 all right let's see raise it up let's get it right here I hope your feelings don't get hurt now I hope I would love to be able to preach I've told you this over and over how many wants to answer that part of them fixing the Sun I've told you I wish I could preach that everybody in this building would find out whether they're born again or not cuz if you're not born again you can do something about it if you are born again you're gonna shout glory hallelujah about the truth let's see we don't want to quote brother Branham we want our own little idea of something but look what he says I hope your feelings don't get hurt and don't turn that them phones off and don't get up and go out you're set still and let's see if the Holy Spirit won't reveal it to it and prove to us you say but that just whatever you believe just sit still and listen it ain't just whatever you believe and ask God to open your heart then you'll find out whether you're a briar or a thistle or whatever your were ever your standing pray for him to open your heart yes but I take doubt that he saved me I'm not asking you to doubt he saved you I'm asking you for one time in your life to have concern about your own soul not watch somebody else teaching but whether or not you're born again in that soul because remember anointing one's caitli sealed in they're actually filled out by the same anointing that you're sealed in sealed them out we could find out whether or not we're Christians or not if we understand what brethren is teaching on anointed ones now here's the thought that came to me there's a vast difference you remember how he was bringing out Balaam had so many followers this had so many followers and that has so many followers there's a vast difference between a Christian and a religious person a religious person can be anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit on their spirit and still be lost but a real true Christian he has the anointing on his Spirit also we'll get to that that's the that's the joy of it a true born-again Christian has the anointing upon your spirit but he quickens the word is in your soul the anointing ones don't have the word within them that's why they're false they can't have it within them they turn it down with true genuine that has the word within them those disciples had that word in them waiting and the Holy Ghost fell and quickened the word that they had heard darzee new birth is the word not an anointing not how much you shouted or cried or spoke in tongues what I've told in my life and most preachers could tell it they would try to get the biggest following I've seen God when I was 11 years old I've seen an angel three times in my home I have no problem with anybody but none of that is the new birth yeah but you saw God know it's whether or not God can come in you and that was my trouble back there I'd go out you've heard me tell it you're at least listen to what I say and said I'm not lying cause we're not trying to make nothing that go out and seeing the sins of the world come home and feel sorry and just set them so why did I do that you know just what I do I just felt condemned I never counted none of those things as the new birth I never came into this message glory hallelujah look what I saw before I heard the prophet but you see God is real that's what he wanted me to know he's real you heard me tell her than three times especially the first time when I grabbed my pistol and took off Astrid that's how real I'm not no fly-by-night and crazy nut I don't think so but when I looked up and saw something standing in the bedroom door looking at me the first thing I went for was a 357 hanging on my poster bed I went after it Peggy went off the bed on the other side and the boys were straight across she said what do you do it I said get in that room with them why I said there's somebody in this house you get in there with them I searched that house over I couldn't find nobody next time it was a little different a little more relaxed the third time when I turned over look I said well you're still dying what you see I'm not trying to teach you you got to have this that or the other to be a Christian you don't have to see angels you don't have to do those things it's kind of like the scripture says but the old men are dream dream of young men will see visions well it's the old men dream dreams brother right how old are you you dream a lot see old men dream dreams and that's not throwing Scripture that's just showing you how crazy where all our inner thoughts young me in a dream dream some of these young boys have dreams sometimes so good you see church there's a vast difference between a religious person a religious person can be anointed with the Holy Spirit cast out devils pray for the sick do all kind of things and yet turned down the word and prove that you're lost there's where the proof comes with us turning down the word what about it cause a religious person is like a church formed like brother old he was talking about you had Buddha and him coming up now let me ask you a question seriously everybody just just listen to me seriously for a second what's the difference between Buddha and the doctrine and Christianity remember what the man said to brother branham Buddha told us about a place to go Buddha told us we had this waiting on us when we died right Buddha the the Quran and the things if you read the Quran what little bit I read of it talked sister barber about it and so brother all in India oh brother Prakash if you took the Quran and live box you'd live a good life you got to fast so many days you got to do this you got to do that if you took the Buddha doctrine and live bite you'd live a good life oh you're crazy I never heard nobody talk like it what what is it you're promised a no lending was promised a happy hunting ground but see there was a lot of difference because they saved you run them oh that Geronimo talk to a supernatural part and that's the reason they could never catch him he told him one day he said Geronimo made their statement that whatever that was told him says they can never shoot you and said I will guide your arrows one day the Sun was rising and they were being cut off the military and Geronimo said that every what it was told him said it'll go and it just went dark cloudy and they all wrote off and they never caught a one those people had a connection with the supernatural yet we think about it see you know what would be you answer to most people my Jesus lives that's like they told us I cared what was it in the 60s when they were saying God was dead All Hallows read what his name would what was that guy's name said that God was dead and everybody run after and oh they went on I know my God Leo's could I talked to him this morning butit eight times on what do you put your religion on Buddha would live would put living a good life what do we put go down to some of these lodges and get your star case lecture and look at the Statue of a perfect man draw it out on the floor in a lodge you see what I'm talking about what's the difference between a Christian and a religious person a religious person goes to church pays ties leaves God leaves godly you know and does good what do you do you go to church you pay you tidy little Colleen and brother down I'm anointed I've seen visions out that dreamed I've done I put myself right in the middle of that when I just said it I've seen angels that's not that's no proof that you're born again no proof whatsoever you say but what's the proof that I'm a Christian that's whether or not that one that's within you agrees which agrees is a pearl oral statement which means it will it will continue because if it ever stops it's not in the continuing I told the Baptist that because the Bible said he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved I said how come it says believe it when you told us we've got everything when we believed that's when I was walking out the door the Baptist Church and that brother he said I know you're right said that's what we talked I said what you gonna do about it nothing you see Church one of these days you'll find out that what do you walk away from the place that others went to that was dead ain't talking about buildings and Lula and this one and that one I'm talking about the Word of God but look at him today how much they're splitting all across the land I don't blame them I don't blame people for leaving if my soul is involved in what I believe I love my family when Terrance was talking about it today ain't it odd that you you have you look at okay the family at Lula is based around and highs around in dealing with the Dale family because it's everybody's into jobs well not all of these other people why can't they get their people kids to come to church well why is yours here because I claimed him believed it come and I've tried my best to offer him a salvation that is simple enough to be able to understand of salvation to be able to believe that if that new birth comes into you heart that new birth that came on the day of Pentecost didn't just stop in the spirit of those people to 120 to start with and in the three thousand later it didn't stop in their spirit that spirit that I'll get to it later when we're talking about the the spirit realm it came down through their spirit yes but it quickened what was in their soul which was the word they had heard the Bible said they took the word and held it and the Holy Ghost fell on that word and made that word alive what's the difference in a Christian and a religious person a religious person can be highly anointed but they can't have the word alive they will turn it down somewhere but brother Dale if I got the anointing in my spirit it teach me I thought that the teacher that's within us is not a spirit realm like that of dis teaching us this editor I thought it was an inside teacher that was in the soul si we're gonna find out one of these days why brother Dale fifty years has been hollering about a soul trying my best to get to Lulu church on the one thing that soul is the real you I don't care where you're anointed at and what you've done in what you've seen maybe that's why God allowed me to come through where I'm at if I'm lost thank God I'll still preach it right up to the day I die this message is the truth then I don't care what you say brother branham done just give it a little time it'll all be put together but until that time comes I'm going to stay with what I believe about it that this word is the alive word see the anointing to a born-again Christian doesn't stop in your spirit it goes and it quickens that word that's within your soul the being if you are and it made that 120 little Jesus's 3000 heard one message and got the same Holy Ghost that the others God but not just an anointing in the way you know the reason I love it because see all of them always would say this is that come on music Peter rose up and said this is that this is what all the Old Testament had to say about it listen to what the prophets said on the message God provided way of healing now they don't have this one sort of there's a vast difference in looking at God's Word and receiving God's Word I'm reading what he says there's a vast difference in looking at God's Word and receiving God's Word when you then that received the word that was not them that examined it but them that received it then that received were not then to the examiner but them that received it god added to the church such as be saved three thousand souls receive the word you can hear the word preached you can look at it and admit that it's right Cain did all the others did but just where the word fell brought forth then that received it gladly was baptized see receiving the word what is it what is your new birth I shouted I cried I've spoken done welcome brother Dale now I've above that now I used to believe that but now I don't believe that now well I believe this because I've done this or I've done that I'm saved well you just move it one thing to another right you just move it from one place to another yeah if that word is not made alive now listen and we'll get back to this if it drops into your spirit and stops it will not be alive in your soul if it comes into that spirit and dwells on long enough to quicken that that's in your soul then you're a child of God is that it that's simple enough not if it stops on your spirit don't make you a Christian cause it stops on your spirit mm-hmm makes you a Christian when the same word that remember what brother altered was talking about the same children the same children you know God has children sons and daughters that will stand on the word and believe it you can't turn them from it Mustang think on these things what about it what is your life dependence upon because you're anointed because I feel it yeah a lot of you've heard my testimony I don't I love to tell it but see it's not telling it to get any glory out of its to telling show what God can do he can change us make us his children yeah but if I'm predestinated I'll make it now you're making it district won't that he done something a lot about predestination well we got brother 251 all in hymns just remember and I'm the baby there evidently they haven't received any notice Martini's guy here yet she's so let's just pray that they'll take him whatever has to be done there [Music] [Applause]

you want to hear fountain you were to go to Jamaica and listen to the one that's singing that song it's all in him they'll raise the roof off a house I thought the building's gonna fall into just you know they love to think about him because they're the original coming down from Seymour ever each one Daddy grace or something back there coming down from Azusa Street they believe even in the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for water baptism they're not that one that's sold out you got to be one one one one one I'll talk to you i sat down all day long and talked to the head of the he had a title on his name that long he was head of everything and he was the head Bishop of the island of Jamaica I talked with him all day they come to time that night to preach me of you've heard miss David gave an altar call preached as much as I could because my voice was gone and gave an altar call his son came he didn't come drag him out he come up there and prayed with us and you know what I told him I told him I said your mama and daddy's gonna believe what they want to believe but let's just make it serious y'all talk about speaking in tongues and your evidences as I I said let's just be Christians about it let's just let Christ come into these little children and to save their souls you know what there was many of them that did I believe it the coast I tried to do the best I could as sincere as I could about Jesus Christ that's my brother branham said what he said we're not getting them to Jesus he said I'm concerned about that they were not getting them to Jesus what the real Jesus of the word the real Lord Jesus not the Christ that we claim to be but you study that anointed one just read through the book and go back through it look what your prophet taught on anointed ones we would not be able to understand where we're at if it wasn't for that message that he brought think on these things father we thank you we ask you to just go with us now as we go home and Lord just go with our with us we'll go by the hospital see how the baby's doing and how Anna's doing we pray for the time we'd get that all as well we believe you and we thank you we just ask you to have
