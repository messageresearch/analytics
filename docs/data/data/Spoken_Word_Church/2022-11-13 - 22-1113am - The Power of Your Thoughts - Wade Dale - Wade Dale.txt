um um Timbo asked me said did you see any deer I said well if it's 80 degrees and your body is 99 covered in hair would you move no you'd find a nice cool place and you'd stay there until dark well that's kind of what happened last last week June did get to see a nice Illinois Buck we couldn't get him to stop though so we had him pretty close but I'll be heading back again Lord willing on Tuesday but we're having one service today we're going to eat after that service and then the family the Dale family has another one to go to at one o'clock in Gillsville dad's next brother to him is 85 years old today so the a lot of the family hadn't got together in a while so they're getting a lot of them together so we're going to be going there and uh being with them uh brother Aaron will be preaching for us Wednesday night I will be in Illinois so just keep us in prayer brother Aaron Aaron Brother Andrew Glover will be preaching for us next Sunday all right brother Andrew not Aaron I wrote Aaron down because I've been thinking about Aaron Brother Andrew Glover will be here next Sunday normal Services next Sunday all right two Services we'll have all the Sunday school and then I'll charge some of y'all to take care of him we already got him a motel room he is bringing his wife and his brand new baby boy so you'll get to see little um Malachi so I don't know why a Malachi Ezekiel Isaiah I don't know why we have to name these names then but next Sunday will be the be that way and I'll be in um I'll be in Illinois or up there Kentucky also remember the 22nd which is next Tuesday we will have service that night at seven o'clock that will be our normal Wednesday night service but it will be on Tuesday the 22nd then we will have um uh regular Services the next Sunday and of course Happy Thanksgiving to everybody if we don't see you before then and we probably will see you Tuesday night so December the 4th is our church standard one service here and then we will go to the Hidden Acres like we always do to have our uh Christmas dinner and it will be catered so you won't have to fix anything all right Dr brother Michael T Friday he said to tell you thanks for prayers but I'm telling you folks he's just down I've never seen Michael down but he's he's he needs prayer uh you can pray for his body all you want to but I've been praying for his self his his psyche his it's just kind of all tore apart it's you know we always even as Christian folks we we still we sometimes we think God why did that happen because we can't see the future we can't see what's going on we don't know we say what Lord why why'd that happen and and he's got a very small church and I told him we would be sending some of our folks down there uh to help him out and they will you know we'll we'll take care of all the finances because he's a very very small Church of 12 15 20 people but just pray for him he just sounded really weak and really down but now as far as health-wise he's he's coming up they're they're actually looking next Tuesday Monday or Tuesday he's going back to the doctor and and they're thinking that that thing May heal up by itself and they won't have to do the surgery so praise God for that but he's still got the puncture lung and it's healing up and broke bones and everything that's got to heal and he will be out of commission for a while so we just want to keep him in prayer I'm going to try to slip off maybe one day and go see him I don't know when but he he needs it he needs some mental he needs somebody to hug him so let's hug him with our prayers if you don't if you're not there don't worry about it just hug him with your prayers but we love brother Mike and he's always been just a uh somebody that we can depend on Amen and we know what the devil did he's trying to get rid of all those people amen but he's not no we win we win Sorry Devil let's picture you want to paint we win we always will win so I think that's all the announcements um remember we won't have Bible study the first Saturday in December and we'll have a prayer service if your brother Joe's putting them up on the screen now if you get here early enough to see them we will be having a prayer meeting on December the 10th like we do before special services but I thought we'd go and do that with the holidays coming up and then we've got brother Wayne Lawson coming in he's going to be with us Friday and Saturday night of New Year's so we're gonna have a Friday night service and a Saturday night service just keep those things in your prayers let's bow our heads thank you Lord for the things you give us thank you for the prayers of the Saints Lord thank you for the opportunity that we have to bow our heads Lord and to thank you for all the things that you've given us Lord thank you for this word that you give us Lord that you've illuminated it Lord so much that we we know the very mind of Christ and that's not something out of the Bible That's What Paul told us to do that we need to have the mind of Christ a lot of times Satan gets in and he throws a fog or throws a black shadow or throws a sheet over it but Lord Jesus greater is he that's in us than he that's in this world father I pray today that you would break back the scales off of all of our eyes that we may hear from you father and Lord your name will be magnified today thank you for all the things you give us the people that are here father the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us the ones that are traveling different ones people uh brother Zach and sister Lily Lord as they're starting a new life together I pray that you'd bind them closer together protect them in their little vacation Lord and bring them back home safe father we thank you for all things ask us in Jesus name be brother Aaron Wednesday night Lord amen all right I told you we were going to kind of cut through and that's big enough for y'all to see can you see that okay thank you the power of your thought all right we're going to take this back to where brother Louise was um reading in the uh in Philippians and you want to turn there we go to Philippians 4 but I got it on the screen but I want to weave this into the statue of perfect man because I've told you many many times before being the Lord Jesus in human flesh is not normal in here right oh come on somebody that's not normal that's why they hated Jesus so much he wasn't normal so if you're normal that's why we are separated from the world we don't think like the world we don't act like the world we don't dress like the world why Jesus told us to separate from that thing amen he even said forsake father mother sister brother hey go bury I got to go back let the Dead bear the dead come follow me boy everybody thinks Jesus was some nice guy he wasn't very nice when he come to the word of God and we're going to see today that when it's truth told to you it can be told anyway but if it's truth you got to take it if it's truth and remember Jesus is what the way the truth and the life everything he spoke he spoke the truth you Generation of Vipers oh we hate it when preachers call us names right Jesus didn't have a problem calling snake snake and was looking at him when he said it he wasn't doing it over in the corner or on his Facebook pulpit hello somebody they wasn't on their Facebook Pulpit no he looked at him and he said your daddy's not the same as my daddy you act like your daddy I ain't like mine and they killed him for that and that's what we're heading to in the Statue of perfect man but all these virtues are abnormal to the world Godly virtues now regular virtues yeah the world has a lot of them but I want to talk now and mold it together and show that the power of your thoughts the power of what you think because listen God stood one day and his thought became expressed Let There Be he had to think of it first and then he spoke it right a word is a thought expressed we'll get to that later on in the service so let's go to Philippians 4 verse 4 says rejoice in the lord always that doesn't say always in all way every way rejoice in the Lord some of y'all have already fell off right there that's right you haven't rejoiced a day in your life if you have you need to let your face show it like brother Dale always says and listen if you didn't hear him the first time he's going to tell you again and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand boy that was two thousand years ago how much more now be careful for nothing but in everything in prayer and supplication with what Thanksgiving let your request be made unto God and the peace of God which path this all understanding shall keep your hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus finally Brethren finally here's Paul Paul is summing everything up I like Paul Paul says sums it all up he'll give you a whole chapter or something right at the very end but Michael he'll say this is what I'm talking about he says finally Brethren whatsoever things are true we're going to break all this down a little bit later on whatever things are true whatever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure watch wherever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things you baby seated and the Lord has blessing the power of a thought you know there's two forces working today and we can't we can't help it there's two forces in this building today there's two forces in your psyche today doesn't matter if you're born again in your soul Satan still has a spot that he can aggravate you in your spare realm your memory reason conscious affection imagination that's what we've been talking about so this kind of ought to blend in look your soul may be sealed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost sealed until the day of your Redemption but your mind is not your mind is not sealed your mind is what we have to overcome right if you're born again today your soul is already sitting in Heavenly places your soul is already Eternal thank God for a prophet that that Lord will let him go across the curtain of time and see the people that had died we thought they're dead no that's more alive over there than we are here amen you know what I'm saying they didn't want to come he didn't want to come back here he wanted to stay there right so that part inside he used the same thing absolutely well we don't like it when we're separated we don't like it when somebody passes away from this Dimension but the Bible tells us to Rejoice at the death of a saint and cry at the birth of a child we got it totally opposite you know why because that's what we've been taught that's our thoughts I wouldn't bring any of the brothers and sisters that passed away in this building for the past 30 40 years I'd never bring them back for one thing in the world I want them to come back when the resurrection happens amen and I hope we're a part of that right but we've got to get ours I've always said our thinking thinking out of the way we got to quit thinking listen we got to start thinking Heavenly thoughts we listen if we are the Bride of Jesus Christ we gotta start thinking like a bride if we are the Bride of Jesus Christ that has a commission to come to a body change or come to a bringing the dead Saints out of the ground we gotta start thinking that way right so listen Satan and God is in control of our mind all the time there's not one second all of your nerves and all of your all of your body functions your heart your brain all that works and you don't have to think about it right but you do have thoughts that are running in your mind all the time you're not having to think art brain work all right some of you may need to all right Brian drop it sometime may hurt some of us but you don't have to say heartbeat no that's what it's an automatic process but you do have to think you do have to think you do have to make decision you do have to what process that thing in your brain but you don't think with your mind your brain is nothing more than a than a super computer everybody with me because the Bible says you think with your heart out of the heart precedes all things the man thinketh in his heart so is he not as he think it is mine listen it felt if that was true as a man thinketh in his mind so is he we'd all be in trouble I'd be dead brother they'll be dead all the ministers will be dead already well the minister said amen the rest of you didn't well what did that what Daddy tell you he was riding with brother mode all that time going down to to General Motors and he the devil would get in his mind and say make that man drive over there and kill him right that wasn't God that was the devil but he was in his psyche telling him I hate that guy right I hate that guy get rid of it well let's turn the table I hate that devil I hate that guy let's get rid of him because it's the power of your thoughts listen if that same God that's inside of you is the same God that said let there be then that same thought process has got to come to me and you that's right I can't and listen you say well I can't do that there you've already stopped it your massive computer has what your hard drive has just been everything's been stopped all right we're having trouble with the internet still today are we still brother Louise back up something back and forth so blue devil he don't want anybody to hear this what I got to say so let's just preach anyway and then we'll let them work on it back there all right look now what happens in our mind with those two forces do you know think about this I want you to think now think common think outside this room everybody with me all right most of you are anyway so watch that brother Louise is spoke about it some but we don't condone watching certain kind of movies but you watch these movies though they're preparing your mind right for something to come it's Satan Prince why brother Brown said Hollywood was of the devil why because it's preparing same way with politics same way with all the great leaders of the world they're preparing what our mind even the Christian's mind they're programming it what movies about superhumans well it's Satan going to be the world Superman he's going to be able to levitate and maybe move this thing and move it right he'll be Satan Superman he'll be the pope that'll be able to do whatever he wants to do when we're gone out of here but praise God we got a God that's greater than that to send me and you that we're going to do great exploits if we'll get our stinking thinking out of the way think his thoughts not our thoughts because look what happens right here but look as the movies are preparing the people for the future even as we see even the Christian movies a lot of times and and I don't want to be critical but we as a as a bride know that there's no one going to be saved after the Rapture takes place that is not in the Bible can't be in the Bible because the bride is going to leave the earth and the Holy Ghost is leaving with her amen there will be no left behind sorry Kirk Cameron's a good guy and all that was a good movie it was okay but it was false from the beginning you can't get saved after the Rapture takes place the Bible does not support that amen we know that see we know that but what about the world the world watches that movie said well if I don't make it this time I'll just live any way I want to now and then I'll get real serious once I see planes falling out of the sky with no people in them I don't know many born-again Pilots so the prayings are going to still be flying if there is don't be flying on the day of the rapture but there's a lot of things going to happen but the but the world is getting you used to that they're getting you used to going through a tribulation going through a a Mad Max or going through a after apocalypse think about it look at all these that's what they're forming you to continue on as you are and everything's fine and we'll be all right even if you miss it the first time you'll get it the second time no you will not he who's filthy let him be filthy still he who is righteous let him be righteous still that's not to watch on judgment that's at the end time when the bride leaves the Earth am I with me right but now look as the world is tuning us to that or not so much us but the world to that thought can't the word of God do the same thing get the word of God what transform us how many times have I read that by the renewing of our mind getting out of that thinking of the world the stinking thinking and all those things because remember the new birth is the Supernatural part of God in your soul that's Eternal cannot be changed will not be changed not going to be anything um that that and what the great mystery is is you can get the new birth and you still look the same you do now we know that we will change as sisters and brothers we won't do the things we did before but it doesn't take you and morph you into a you all gonna look like Jesus no thank goodness we're not going to do that we're individuals but the new birth changes us supernaturally in our soul but then he it has to work as the statue of perfect man it has to work outward now listen if you've got the devil inside of you which today let me remind you one thing you either got the devil working in your soul today or you have God working in your soul there is no in between you might be in a journey you might have the unclean Spirit drawn out driven out of you but until you're still by the Holy Ghost you're not born again and so that devil will start working his way outward into your five senses remember reasons conscious face and Imagination let's don't worry about don't worry about see taste feel smelling here that's just give to you in the human body for us to what process the world that we live in but listen you can every one of those you can fool we make soap there at the at the honey store and we may hunt or so and that soap smells just like dirt but it comes from a bottle of liquid right right so it will fool you into believing that there's dirt in that in that soap it smells just like dirt but it is not dirt so that can all be your your sensory your your your sea taste feel smelling here that is giving you the contact the world but I would never depend on any of that all right it's kind of highly likely that our memory reason conscious affection imagination doesn't need to always be something we lean towards but it's in that soul let's look right here remember the carnal mind is enmity to God the carnal mind because remember even what got Adam in trouble is he come to a place to where he let his mind come on somebody Adam's Soul did not do what he did that's right in his Spirit realm but see his soul loved Eve they were sold to Soul he loved Eve amen she was a part of him actually that soul that was in her was in him at one time amen when Jesus was on the cross wasn't the soul you have in your come on people think with me that same soul that was in Jesus that covers in you today yeah you're part of part of new things wrong we still have a carnal mind we still live in there junk everybody with me so now remember as we talk about this you think with your brain no you think with your heart but that thought that process has to come from here into here out to here everybody with me brother Brown said what a thought a word is a thought expressed think it then you say it all right so now look watch how Jesus in Matthew 24 44 says therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not you think not the son of man cometh everybody's looking like I said before all denominational world they're looking for Jesus to split the skies and come down through the Eastern sky and split the clouds and walk down and just take over listen that's what they expected 2000 years ago and he came so humble and so lonely as a baby they thought he was a devil he didn't want any of that stuff that they want him he was different but in the hour you think not that son of man is going to appear yeah that's why they're looking for him why not see him now uncle is coming it's coming now when you see him come from the clouds of Glory he's got what he's got a white wig on and that's judgment he's coming as a judge he's not coming as your king he's coming as your judge hey man we're in the palace with the King because we're the Bride of Jesus Christ so he's telling us to love her and such I know that you think not let's start a man will come listen this in John 5 verse 38. 39. and you have not his word abiding in you now he's talking to the Pharisees listen he's talking to the religious world okay talking to the religious World think about that think on these things and you have not his word abiding in you but but but but man we've got Moses he's our Prophet we read him every day we go to the synagogue we wash our pots you know what they said we be Moses as disciples we be Abraham's children Jesus said if you knew them you know me and you have not his word abiding in you for whom he has sent him you believe not he sent the word of God in the end time through a prophet and people turned it down he's not they're not turning William Branham down they're not turning you down they're turning Jesus Christ now amen look it says look search the scripture not in a quote search the scriptures for in them you think you think you have eternal life look at that word that word think means same suppose seems good be of an opinion there's always two opinions at least to be of an opinion to think or to suppose I think judge doesn't question what were they doing they were judging in their brain in their human brain without the Holy Ghost without God leading them they were what being led by their father the devil the religious people the religious peoples what killed Jesus folks not the people in the streets same as it today John 16 verse 1. these things have I spoken unto you that you should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues praise God please put me out of the world don't include me with this world yeah we got problems and issues but as we go up this statue of perfect man we ought to be shedding some of that stuff we ought to be what let that mind which is in Christ being you well who wrote the Bible man no Christ wrote the Bible the Holy Ghost Drew man wrote the Bible so whatever the Holy Ghost was in the Bible that wrote it is in you today if you're born again if you're not if you're just thinking that you are come on somebody you're still of your father the devil sorry about that these things have I spoken unto you that you should not be offended they shall put you out of the synagogues yea the time cometh that whosoever killeth you will think that he doeth God's service whoever killeth you think about that 68 million people 68 million Believers let me put it that way not just rank centers Believers 68 million were killed by who Catholic Church on their books not hot they don't hide it at all the Crusades was not for Christ it was to conquer Nation right and to get property then remember that mother has got daughters and those daughters are doing the same thing the mother's doing I'm just telling you what the Bible says you will think on the father or me oh it was wonderful to the world Constantine comes and says hey let's take church and state put them together thank you let's go on this Crusade and if you don't do what I say come on if you don't do if you don't believe the way I believe we're going to kill you amen 68 million were killed because of that and they were Christians they were persecuted by Christians so-called and then the Bible tell us to Joy and that persecution that's right in other words take joy that somebody is offended by you amen praise God Jesus said he offended people all the time but remember like I said what I said before remember he was telling them the truth you Generation of Vipers it's like oh he's cutting them down no he's telling them the truth you got to look back to the truth as Paul said his brother Dale always said have I what have I hurt your feelings because I told you the truth well you could have said it a different way Jesus didn't he said you're of your daddy I'm my daddy that's right yeah you're gonna act like him and I'm Gonna Act Like Mine so now Romans 12 verse 1 says I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God this is one we've been reading that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world Cosmos world order we have to live in this world we have to why we have to be human beings we have to work we have to be we're married we have children we have problems we have issues am I talking to the right people but God is walking in your flesh and your soul trying to get us what to renew our mind to get out of the fog that Adam put us in come on somebody Adam put us in this fog he didn't Adam did right people the message hate that they hate Eve no you better not hate Eve because you're evil if you hate Eve then you're dead as much as she's dead you better believe that the second Adam is restoring us back the first Adam killed us the second Adam is what's restoring us back amen that you present your body as a Living Sacrifice so it has something to do it does have something to do with your body you need to dress do right holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed what by the renewing of your mind your thought your thought process that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say through the grace press it through the grace given to me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think a lot of preachers in this message need to read that a few more times they think they're so much higher than everybody else they can't be touched they can't be everybody's shaking their head because you've seen them we're servants we're servants that's why I've told you you can spend you can spend a million dollars on brother Dale and if you don't live what he preached it ain't worth a dime but if he can see the fruits of what he's preached over all those years come to fruition and people come up that statue of perfect man and come to the body chains and come to a place to where you do live a Christian life not just some halfway something out in the world but live it right greatest gift you'll ever get so don't think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God hath dealt to every man The Measure of Faith all right look First Corinthians 4 verse 6. and these things brother and I have in a figure transferred to myself into Apollos for your sake that you might learn in us not to think of men above that which is written that no one of you be puffed up for one against another that's why we have to be careful when we talk about the prophet and the end time he was not God he was born in sand shaping and iniquity he needed salvation but he had a gift he had a gift of God that was unique that was given to us in Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 Revelation 10 7. we can identify him in the Bible these people that hold him above God or hold him as God they're wrong absolutely I give him honor no doubt but he showed me Jesus Christ he didn't show me him he showed me who the Lord was he showed me the Bible more than any other person could show you the Bible but remember whatever you think about him you can cut it off look watch this for if a man think himself to be something when he is nothing he doesn't deceive the people he's deceiving himself for if a man think himself to be something when he's nothing he deceiveth himself wow the power of your thoughts the power of what you think every day like I said before right now today since I've been into pulpit you have thought thousands of thoughts among all of you some of you are buying groceries some of you are figuring out what you're going to do tomorrow some of you are wanting to eat that good food it's down below my feet and your feet some of you are wishing that we get this thing over with that we can go do something else and some of you are thinking about the Lord Proverbs 23 7 says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he look eat drink and eat and drink saith he to thee but his heart is not with thee those disciples well Pharisees and the ones that the the the Sadducees to All Around Jesus they they wanted oh they loved him to a point but when he started saying I my father won you're of the devil and I'm of God when he started separating by the word not by his thoughts but by the word when he starts separate they hated him because remember their heart was not with him that's right their heart thinking in their heart listen confessing them they wanted him dead for a long time read the Bible you keep reading back and listen they even when Lazarus did not people the religious world if we presented 20 people then raised from the dead by us praying for the sick as the Bible tells us to do deaths raise you present them to the denominational world and they're like what who are you because their heart's not with us their heart their thinking well you didn't do that they weren't really dead he uh you know brother Brown was wrong here you're wrong and you've said this wrong you said that wrong as a man thinketh in his heart so is he so let's break this down just a little bit if that's all right but now look even Galatians back where we were reading here I was thinking about uh yesterday if a man thinks himself to be something when he's nothing he deceives himself think of all the people Adolf Hitler Stalin amen Satan himself he thought he could get a better Kingdom that's why he had to separate from God was because of his thoughts listen Satan is not going to ever curse Satan don't say curse words Satan don't stay out of church Satan's not this he's slick he's sitting right beside you and he's given you religious thoughts contrary to the word of God that's where he wins he don't win by making you curse like I said before hey the the the largest and the greatest drug dealers in this world why is that showing on yours not showing on mine the Lord the greatest drug dealers on the face of this Earth never takes drugs never they want to be focused they want to be sharp they know that their mind will get all muddled up when you see that they're not the Kingpin the Kingpin is the Untouchable guy the guy that they can't get That's what Satan is he's letting his little minions do his job and he's sitting up here going I'm going to be like God and God don't curse her I'm not going to curse have I thought about that before yes if he wants to be like God he says I'm not going to curse because God don't curse I'm not going to stay out of church because Jesus don't stay out of church we think of this and the devil's been way out trying to somewhere and he's some nasty something looks like you know he's got guts and blood and all that stuff all over him and he's some kind of uh two-horned demon he was beautiful God made him beautiful he knows how to worship he knows how to get a presence he knows how to get an audience he's slick so Adolf Hitler you think of all those people that always thought they were some great something they came to what look at their horrible end that they came to all those people they they thought that they were the what Hitler thought he was God he was going to just take over you know don't you can't touch me well he figured out one thing's for sure he either got touched or he touched himself because he ain't with us no more he fell very hard now look I want you to think about this we're going to go through these words let's go back to Philippians 4. let's look for a second right here Philippians 4 verse 4. watch this rejoice in the Lord all way in other words every way not just always every way and I say again Rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your request be made known unto God in other words change your thinking all right finally Brethren whatsoever things are true or if things are honest just pure lovely good report is there any negative to that virtue there be any praise think on these things what does that first word which is true the word true means what true obviously truly loving the truth speaking the truth truthful Everything Jesus said was the truth amen and they hated him we don't even like you to be in our church praise God that's what that man said one time he said throw me out I've been throwed out a better the next one is honest honest grave sober August presence of God honorable of persons and of Deeds whatever things be honest whatever things be just righteous right look it in a wide sense upright righteous virtuous keeping the Commandments of God Paul is not just throwing words out here he's telling us how to live by these virtues he's just not calling him virtue knowledge Temperance faces Godless brother kindness but he is putting it right here in this scripture he's telling us every one of those virtues all right I want you to look at this right here now we're talking back just right who puts the most guilt on you take your finger if I take your finger don't you point up here at me don't blame me for this take that finger and go I want everybody to see it on camera [Music] I'll help you hear me look used of him whose way of thinking feeling and acting is what wholly conform to the will of God not your will and who therefore needs no rectification in the heart or life in other words God is God yes a Christian is a Christian and these virtues will validate or Rectify all your wrongs when I say all I don't mean all you're not going to have where you you don't Arthur's still going to live with you Arthur's going to sleep with you and those of you that don't have Arthur yet you will get him I'm talking about arthritis thank God there'll be no arthritis in heaven approved of or acceptable of God whoever it's pure just watch this pure watch this whichever things are pure chaste clear clear look exciting reverence I wish somebody would amen somebody do that this is not exciting reverence unless you're praying but you can't Pray when you're going look exciting reverence venerable Secret do you come to church and think these things look pure from carnality chaste modest look Immaculate if you want the definition of Immaculate go to my mama's house yeah right and the ones that's been there says thank you so there is a definition of these words that we can compare to now the next one says clean now you can go to most everybody else's house is clean but immaculate's a little bit different to clean all right so Paul said look whatever so everything's are lovely acceptable pleasing is there any negative to this I'm reading you no nothing good report some of us cannot do that I'm gonna read you something in a few minutes science tells you that your brain cannot interpret negative impulses it does not know what to do with it you're the one that formulates that in yourself your brain is not capable to have negative thoughts because we were made in the image of God Adam that Adam before the fall clear minded move tree we don't need that over here that mountain would look real good over there and you see him [Music] good report sounding well watch a good report uttering words of good omen speaking auspiciously or speaking positively and knocks a lot of us out right there virtue is praise a virtuous course of thought feeling in action moral goodness if I put anything in here that's wrong negative any particular moral Excellence as modesty impurity and then Paul tells us if there be any praise what approval conduct condemnation commendation we get that mixed up just like I just did there you go the word think this word think where it says think on these things comes from the alert word can you say that look anyway that's where the word logic comes from okay everybody with me it's a Greek word and she's she's Greek background's Greek or her family's Greek and background it is who she is but that comes from the word logic so think be logical look to take into account to make an account of metaphorically to pass to one's account our problem is here we are as human beings and remember brother round talks about being putting things in Jesus when when you get born again he puts an account in your in your bank he put some stuff in it all right he says all right checks for it right what our problem is is we have so much negative in our bank there's nothing positive can come out of it I'm talking about all of us a thing is reckoned as or to be something as in or as availing for or equivalent to something as having the light force and weight to reckon inward think inward as a man thinketh in his heart so is he count up or weigh the reasons to deliberate that's our problem I like what brother Ernie always said he said sometimes our mouth gets in gear before our brain does afraid of me it's like a four inch pipe you know the the four inch PVC pipe it's from your brain to your mouth and there's nothing there to Hold It Back free flow thank you we as of us didn't know that um we're the ones saying it but stop and think before you speak I've got to learn to do that we've all got to learn to do that but some of us more than others don't lay hands on men suddenly so don't think suddenly but look by Reckoning up it's just pure lovely good report virtue praise store those up in your bank then when you need them you can pull it out and you can give it to somebody same way with virtue what our problem is is we Bank up negative so what's going to come out negative to determine to purpose to decide I like that one says to judge when you think you judge think on these things you're judging whether you want to think that or not think that and listen this world is not a world that you can depend on everything oh yeah we well you know the doctor says yeah you know you go to you go to an herbalist and they say all right you need to take these herbs right okay then then you you all of a sudden you get a little sitting you go to the regular MD that is big Pharma is behind him come on somebody big Pharmacy is behind him that they're they're they're saying hey you need to give this to your people with blood pressure well he you know what he's going to say about them midnight they're crazy these over here going well now they're going to say we're crazy but see so you gotta judge which one's right and wrong same way today you've got a judge and filter out things in the world things in the Bible because there's things in the Bible that talks about the devil and stuff you got to discern that out that talks about the mother that talks about the sorry the daughters that's why we had to have a prophet so we can discern those things it wasn't that he just discerns the thoughts and intents of people's heart he gave you the opportunity to discern the Bible yes right listen what brother Brown says 1962 sir we will see Jesus now what is a word a word is a thought expressed you got to think it before you say it you have to think it before you say it and in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and if the word ever was God it's still God see it and the Word was made flesh and walked among us we've been reading that over and over for 60 something times the word was made flesh and dropped Among Us the word of God was made flesh Among Us in Christ Jesus you believe that now he was the word made flesh so we know that a word is a thought first and then what it becomes what thought an expression so there's a lot of things in our brain in our brain that we think of we should never express everybody with me say Amen okay why but you know what we need we need these things because you remember look at Peter Peter was the same way I am he had a six inch pipe from his brain to his mouth hey man he was always shooting off the mouth they said he had a foot shaped mouth because he kept his chewing it all the time but after he got born again come on somebody he changed he changed so much to God had him write this in II Peter to tell you you can do it Peter went from cutting people's ears off yeah he wanted to fight all the time hey he was a sailor he probably used some sailor languages before God took hold of him and Jesus called him you know what Jesus didn't call him when he was in church he called him out of a boat said come follow me I know you're doing those things shut up Peter I'm with you I'm praying for you remember he said Satan I know it's going to sift you like Sam but I prayed for you Peter thank God God prayed for us in John 17 he prayed for us that we make it and we're going to make it Proverbs Proverbs 12 verse 18 says there is that speaketh like the piercing of a sword but the tongue of the wise uh the tongue of the wise we always talk down on the tongue well it ain't always bad the tongue of the wise is health the lip of Truth shall be established forever but a lying tongue is but for a moment deceit is in the heart not the brain the heart of them that imagine evil but to the counselors of peace is joy we need to look at that word Joy a little bit more we need to have more joy than we do like us for us it's a drudgery for you to be a Christian you're not one I said a drudgery if you have to make yourself do something you're just making yourself do something but it's got to be a desire like I said like the Bible says it's got to be something full of joy full of joy even though listen even though we make mistakes find the joy in it negative people can't do that they can't find a joy nothing Proverbs 15 verse 2 the tongue of the wise here we go again the tongue of the wise uses knowledge all right but the mouth of fools poureth out foolishness as a man thinketh in his heart so is he that portal that you got right in front of your face down below your nose the eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the good and the evil are evil and good a wholesome tongue all that come man that's the tongue is a bad thing he's not saying it right here a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but perverseness therein is a breach in the spirit Proverbs 18 21 death and life are in the power of the tongue and they that love it either way shall eat the fruit thereof listen to this this is Jesus talking again Matthew 12. either make the tree good and it's fruit good or else make the tree corrupt and it's fruit corrupt for the tree is known by its fruit oh Generation of Vipers how can you being evil speak good things listen folks they spoke good things in that Tabernacle everybody with me in their daily Journey they had to do the right thing you know do the incense they had to put the right sacrifice they had to do but all they were doing was it was a ritual and if you live this message as a rituals you got the same generation of operas it's a life it's not a lifestyle right it's a life oh Generation of Vipers how can you be evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart yes the mouth speaketh a good man out of the good Treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things but I say unto you that Every Idle Word now stop there just a minute how many of you I'm not going to let you see the definition of that because it's not going to be what you think okay it's not that we joke and cut up which we we can but not you know in good taste it's not that oh you just you just all the time you're joking that ain't what that means that's not what that means Every Idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment all right let's see what that word idle means slow barren in other words lies free from labor at leisure lazy shunning the labor which went ought to perform in other words if your words don't become fruitful they're Idle Words I'm talking about in this Pulpit I'm talking about oh yeah there's somewhere I'm talking about out in your job I'm talking about you at Walmart with a girl how many of you let me ask you a question don't raise your hand please I don't want anybody to get embarrassed how many of you when somebody opens the door for you say God bless you when somebody does something for you even at Walmart I don't care if they got tattoos and and earrings and and you know dress up to their belly button I say God bless you thank you you have a good day now I'm gonna get real this is gonna be bad but I'm gonna do it anyway when you go to a restaurant how many of you tip there's a lot of message Believers sit somewhere in the like the 1100 sermons brother Brown so you don't have to tip nobody June how many times have we been out to eat with people not here in this church well maybe some uh you can figure out who that is that just gets up from the table and walks off and we that Mom we have to scrounge around I'm a Preach Today We have to scrounge around and get an extra 10 or a 20 to make that tip you say why why what about all them just people out there that they're humans just like you are let me read that Bible where it said you thank yourself more than you're somebody else then what you're wrong you never know what them people are going through you never know what they look they may be crying but she's bringing your food she may have a baby this sick she might have a mother that died she might have she may have don't have anything June and I we tip 20 percent pretty much 99.9 percent of the time because you know what that's their wages that's their life they have picked they have picked that profession and you know what you're sorry Heinen wouldn't get served if it wasn't for them people so think of them as human beings well they're not bright I can tell that well you might not be either with that attitude but look I'm the worst lazy shining the labor which ought to be we are the labor as Christians every day man absolutely to make this world better how many times have I told you you know that I go down through Walmart and if there's a toy laying on the floor that some kid of y'alls yeah yeah has went like this our pitch the hissy fit mama always said Pizza hissy fit and start throwing the toys what I do I pick them up and put them back on the Shelf life lesson for you

great grandkids so anyway so now you know what you're getting for Christmas so I put it back up and somebody had put a somebody had put like peanut butter or something not what peanut butter it was something that was cold like cheese or something they just set it up on the thing and walked off well guess what I did I took the thing and walked back over and put it up but listen but you know what that's what we're supposed to be Look what Jesus did he hung around sinners prostitutes didn't wash his hands when he eat praise the Lord I'm just telling you what the Bible says you know who was that though that was the religious people of the world well you're he thinks he's God he don't wash his hands before he eats Jesus in other words Jesus kind of just looked up at him and went right on he never said another word but when he got to a place where he could he let him have it yeah lazy shiny less word Idol so Every Idle Word that men shall speak they shall give an account thereof in the day of judgment not that you're funny not that you do have a sense of humor that ain't got nothing to do with that Idol Idol is words you speak that has no value no value at all lazy shunning the labor which one ought to perform we ought to be Christians 99.99999 of the time so let me read you this real quick and we'll close it's 11 14. I said we'll be doing 11 15. I want us to realize one thing Satan has put up scarecrows all through your life but listen let me let you in a little secret we're not crows we're Eagles there's never been a scare Eagle they're scarecrows what to get what to scare the crows if you're an eagle fly right over that thing don't worry about that stuff brother Adam said right here but I'm gonna read you what science says look real quick the brain cannot interpret negative impulses it was not made to be negative negative impedes impulses positive impulses but so now we have to be reprogrammed be changed we have to be reprogrammed by the word of God by the renewing of your mind listen to my brother Ryan said we'll close right here musicians come on but you're you're to be negative you have to overcome your own self to be negative and negative has proven to cause you to be sick blood pressure diabetes I was reading just a few minutes ago a positive attitude cures 50 50. percent of your ailments 50. how many do you like to get rid of half of what you ailments you got well let's just start being positive then let's just start being positive listen to what your Prophet said look left your testimony this is 1955. let your testimony always in your thoughts everything never permit a negative thought to come in your mind if you can help it so he knew you were a human being when it starts back don't entertain it you know what you do if I asked brother Joe and sister Rachel to come to my house and they entertain a lot of us so we go what do we do entertain Hey Brother come on in and say have a safe sound right here let me get you some good coffee let me get you a piece of pie something like that Rachel's got some good coffee she never got any pie but she got some good coffee but what are you doing you're entertaining your gift that's what we do with the Devil we when we entertain a thought we said hi devil come on in I gotta see it right here called Misery I gotta see it right here called negativism Beauty just enjoy yourself in my house no this one brother around says he's luck I can't help the thoughts from coming well that's like the farmer that said he couldn't stop the birds from flying over his place but he could sure stop him from roosting now let me read you one listen to this 1955 blind barter mess brother around said don't think sitting there in a wheelchair and he's talking about people in a wheelchair don't think you in a wheelchair that you're hopeless that you're helpless you're not don't let that negative thought ever pass through the anchor you can't help it from going through your mind but don't let it stop like the old farmer said I can't keep the birds from flying over my place but he had a double barrel shotgun praise God I said I can sure keep him from roosting so you do the same thing now here's the shotgun the New and Old Testament there's your dad with Buckshot that'll blow the devil away if your lady must stand to our feet so don't let those negative thoughts don't let those negative thoughts be entertained they're going to come just don't entertain them don't entertain them don't be don't be captivated that's what this world wants that's why you know this world we spend more money now on entertainment than anybody in the world the United States of America spends more money on entertainment than anybody in the world does we want to be entertained we want somebody to entertain us we don't want a preacher to stand and talk to us we want him to jump up and down and shout and well then I wasn't going to everybody at least I did that's because what that's what we feel that's what makes you feel good they weren't many people felt good when Jesus got up and started preaching yeah yeah because he told them the truth amen amen he told him the truth that's why I said truth is here right all right now ever how you process it like brother Brown said those two women walked outside right he said oh he called me a buzzard that other girl looked at him listened to the same sermon said well he called me an eagle it's just the way you look at it right but he's got to stay with truth though don't think that we get in that we you know we've got all these rules that you got to follow no it's a life paraded life that's what God wanted he wanted them to separate himself from the world separate themselves from Evil separate themselves from non-truths that's what he was trying to get when he said you Generation of Vipers you know what he was saying you people have other people looking up to you and you're acting this way right amen remember what he said he said by your traditions you've made the word of God of no effect to the people because they were looking at their traditions as long as I don't look at that as long as I look at that woman I'm lust after but as long as I don't touch her I'm fine Jesus discerned that thought in what in their heart he saw that thought and they're coming from their heart that they wanted to do it but they didn't want nobody to see it Jesus said buddy you've already committed adultery with her in your heart and you'll give an account of today a judgment amen God bless you let's sing a song real quick and then we'll go eat yes [Music] [Applause] [Music] I will bless his name again is here in this and closely hear him born [Applause] [Music] he is here you can touch him you will never Jesus we ask you in Jesus name don't touch our party too Lord just keep her strong and healthy in Jesus name we praise amen amen [Music] his name again he is he [Music] is your name he is [Music] never be the same if you ever get touched by God one time you'll never be the same it'll make you act different [Music] you know what we act like what's inside of us if you act like the world look like the world and the love of God's Not in you that's what the Bible says I'm not trying to quote you something from somebody else that's what the Bible says the tree brings forth whatever fruit comes from what the light that's inside the tree and that's why with this statue of perfect man we've got to change our our thinking our mindset everything's got to be changed because we're going to get out of here and it takes that statue of perfect man it takes mature Christians to walk in this world listen don't walk blindly and around around in the world my word you've got a joy you've got a peace and you've got a purpose amen didn't brother around say God had a plan what a plan he formulated in his what mind his heart he wanted a world he wanted a people to live on earth he wanted animals but remember being connected to be God he had to also be a Healer thank you to be complete he had to be a savior so he had to let us fall he didn't make us fall he let us fall knowing that he would bring all them right back to himself praise God what a Plan of Redemption it's perfect you love the Lord let's go down and eat a meal let's have brother Dale pray over the food
