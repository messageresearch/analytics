just coming into his presence is a blessing I know we take it for granted many many times but it's certainly a wonderful blessing amen I'm gonna have Mom come up and testify she wanted to give a testimony I forgot to tell the brothers earlier and I thank God for my mom you know it's um she testified to us all the while while we were young coming up you know and um certainly a mom's prayer you know transformed and has transformed our lives so I want to give her this opportunity thank the Lord thank the Lord for be here today and I tell you I feel like if I shut up in my bones sometimes I just have to give my testimony a few of them sometimes just relief that God has been good and I've been like I said I'm a witness of his resurrected power you know the Lord visited me many times and like John said from the little kids coming up I always sharing testimony with them oh the Lord visit me or what he showed me are what he tells me you know so I remember my friend Mary she was my best friend to me and I always give her my testimony them and one day she had she come to me and said she had three dreams and it bothering her and she said could I intercede and final from the Lord what did his dream mean and I said okay I will so I went down the closet at night and I was praying and waiting on the Lord to come waiting for his present you know because he always visit me to have the experience of knowing how to get out of the way so he can come in and I'm about your footstep was coming in the closet while I was waiting and all of a sudden I Heard a Voice spoke to me and said get up and turn on your right side so I turn I get up I'm gonna turn to my right side there goes my friend in a vision laying on our left side so we were back to back and anyway she told me dream bother her so I began to dream the dream that she had it was happening to me and I was scared because I was interested I was trying to get the interpretation of those dreams but she when she told me a dream about the dark shirt and the Bush was coming at her she began to have nightmare and she was screaming for God but yet I'm in the closet I'm going through all that my and everything was happening to me what she told me and I was screaming out and I was scared and then all of a sudden I Heard a Voice spoke to me and said this is the interpretation of the dream and at that time I couldn't wait to get out the dream so I can go and tell her what it meant and in the dream it was I heard the voice said um the shot that was coming out from the Bush was our death she you know if she didn't give our heart to God she was gonna die so you have to give our heart to the Lord but I couldn't wait to get all that dreams to go to her and call her and tell her what the dream mean so I call her ER after I got out the dream but she didn't tell me a certain part of the dream there was a little girl in there about five years old she didn't tell me a little girl or her sister but yet I seen all that so I asked her who was the daughter the little girl she said that was her niece and actually I was the other girl that I saw a lady she said that was her sister and I told her everything so she had to give her all to God and she would die and that was that on that so and there's another time okay tell one more I was laying down into in my room and our divorce said get up and run through the run through it all so I I don't like Darkness so I was kind of scared but I got up on running down the hall and then I was shaking me like I'm scared of dark and then I said when I get back to where I was I heard I said to myself if God told me to run I can't run so scared let me give him a good run and I run I run again and I was still kind of scared but that was more braver and I said I'm gonna do a better one and I did the third time and I went and lay in my bed and then we're looking up to the ceiling and I saw that same light that was our brother Brandon it was in the ceiling like so it began to move towards the wall so I'm falling in my eyesight and there was no more wall then I heard like Bush was burning and I didn't know where where it was but I looked to see what was going on and I got I heard a great explosion and when I turned to look for the explosions all I could see was the closing up of the explosion and I came to out of that vision so um I saw a brother bring him a testify and talk about a vision like that and you have the picture in the same picture I see of the explosion and I said wow oh God let me see that for some reason like I said I've got many more testimony and I just can't wait I couldn't wait to give some relief some from my for me you know supporting the Lord for the experience that he gave me he spoke to me many many times and tell me things um just gonna say one more this is very short though one morning one morning I was laying down and I Heard a Voice Orlando and I said Lord what what about Alanda who's Orlando and I heard the voices brought back to me and say he's a dangerous person but I woke up no and I went I was going to work so I started walking around the back road and I saw a guy up on the hill he was yelling at me yelling at me and said can you walk with me and said no and he jumped down and come downstairs trying to walk and he started telling me some things he would walk with me I said no and he's beginning to tell me something I asked him what his name he said his name was Orlando and and then I remember what the Lord told me and he began to tell me that he was going to die he have some people going to kill him and all kind of thing you just want to walk with me put his arms around me I said no I can't do that but the Lord told me he was a dangerous person but I remember right away no way and that was oh God good morning amen praise the Lord Jesus amen I think thank the Lord amen so yeah we oh you know coming up we would hear the testimonies of the Lord and you know of course as a as a teenager we try to get away from from all of it you know I met my uh sister Alicia I was a teenager I was 16 when I met her and I'm hearing all the testimonies and hearing this word and she was from the world that in fact I saw the young couple here this morning and it just reminded me of sister and Alicia and I of course I was raising the message but I remember bringing her to the church the first time and she had all her hair cut off and we came we were sitting right in the front ourselves God was moving and um you know just as a young person coming up and hearing all and I didn't understand it and she would ask me well

them strength Supernatural strength because they're going to be tired in their human body but give them Supernatural strength to do what they're supposed to do so just remember them also remember what I announced this morning about the media room let's don't be in there unless you're a part of that group if you need to talk about something you need to go outside or go downstairs or slip around into Rachel's sister Rachel Sunday school class uh not when she's there I have to announce these things and you never know just remember the wedding will be on the 24th of March we know uh Esther she's not feeling good today so let's pray for her too and brother Micah that he'll get a revelation and um thank you all for going to the nursing home um brother Aaron will be speaking Wednesday night uh pray for me I'll be leaving here in just a little bit going to Ohio for a couple of days getting ready for a wedding in the next month and and few other things we need to we need to talk about so we appreciate the group up there they're really faithful they're really they love the word of God and um and they're just precious people we love them and we'll we'll be with them there for a couple of days also remember brother Daryl Ward will be here on the 28th and 29th and also remember that next Saturday at seven o'clock we'll have Bible study Bible study we'll have a prayer meeting oh not

you know getting on all of us and we want to uh we want to be healthy y'all like to be sick no I don't either I'm going to answer it for you I don't like feeling bad I don't like feeling I don't like feeling like I need to go back to bed and and you know uh weight of the world's on your head and everything else so we we just thank God that we have a A Healer that God can do that and he wants to more than we want him to do it right so let's call on him use him he's not going to get tired there's one thing for sure you draw virtue out of him now you'll never make him tired now he was tired when he was in human flesh but when he got out of human flesh or glorified body human flesh he's not tired never will be tired anymore it doesn't matter how many times you ask him excuse me picked up a feather feather so let's go to this this would be part 81 and we're going to try to get into knowledge um and remember as we speak on knowledge remember there's two forms of knowledge there's a knowledge that the world has there's a knowledge that God has all right so we've got to decipher which one if you if you use the knowledge of God you will never fail you use the knowledge of man uh you might make it in life and you don't be you know make some good money because you know about the first one thing in another or or your Life's a little bit better but I have never I've known a few millionaires a couple of them and they're not happy either they're not happy either they got just many problems you do they just don't have Bill problem you know they just but they have other problems you know why because remember the Rich Young Ruler what did he do he went and built him some more barns and you know what God did he just took his life he took his life he said no you know no no you you're done all right she turned God down and we know where he was at when Lazarus and he and Lazarus met didn't meet but they talked to each other in that other dimension so let's remember all these things in prayer um that we'll come back Wednesday night and brother Aaron will be speaking for us so let's let's bow our heads Lord Jesus thank you so much that we can come one more time lord and we can speak about you father now I pray Lord that you would be with each one Lord and the sound of my voice that you would bless them Father and keep the soul coveted and flus we know there's different strains and different uh names that man has put on it but it's just the devil and he's trying to strike young people and older people too father we pray that you'd just push that away from us Lord that we'll all have a good time on you father you'll bless us now in the furthermen of this service be with the ones that are sick Lord that are not with us today we pray that you'd be with them be the ones that are online watching in Lord just take care of them Lord give them Supernatural Revelation father and give us sitting here in the building Lord Supernatural Revelation without it we can't survive brother Brown said the bride loves Revelation the father I pray that you do that today reveal yourself to us Lord through your word Lord just forgive us of our sins and many mistakes Lord in Jesus name we pray amen in the beginning was the word where it was with God and the Word was God we're going to kind of kick it up another gear today because we've got we don't have any visitors with us so we can kick it up just a little bit today I love visitors I mean that that helped me this morning just as much to just kind of back up and um and speak for a minute on on a couple of items that was generic enough to where they could understand what I was talking about so I pray that they'll come back amen listen if you don't want people saved you need to get saved yourself hey man me and no more no I don't want no no I want everybody safe everybody you say the devil yeah I'd love to have the devil say that way he wouldn't bother me as much he wouldn't bother me anymore but he's our adversary and he can't get saved and we we um we know that um that he's if Jesus is the ever present help in time of trouble we know who's our trouble the devil's our trouble so in the beginning with the word where was with God and the Word was God and that word was transformed to flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory the only begotten and the father full of grace and truth one morning you'll be seated Genesis 2 9. right from the get-go God's going to split this thing up he's going to split it up into two trees and out of the ground made the Lord to grow every tree that's Pleasant to the site good for food Tree of Life in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil you can go and be seated in the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word Isaiah 28 9 says Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine you know we we as we were talking this morning about the little child we all every one of us started out first grade kindergarten first grade one plus one's two hey man we didn't get the a plus b equals c for a while we didn't get the trigonometry we didn't get to the Pythagorean theorem I don't know some of y'all don't even know what that is I know Aaron does and no air knows everything and that well the other day I said something about something he said I don't know what that is we studied it but you know what wouldn't have known that if it hadn't been for somebody to teach me amen if somebody hadn't teased me I wouldn't it's just not gonna pop up in your head and that's the same way with with being in the message of the hour and that's the same way with being with the speaking of the word of God God's not going to make you read it he's not gonna make you steady you're going to want to and therefore he'll already have it there for you same way with the teacher if a teacher gets up and and the teacher that's teaching your class you walk in what would it be if you walk in the door and and well and say college my baseball coach taught uh calculus in college and and if I would have looked at at the coach and I and and he was only about seven years old when I walked in the door he's teaching the class and he's seven that would be strange wouldn't it but the coach had been a coach for a long time and he'd been a teacher for like 30 years because he retired the year I was that I was there in Piedmont and uh he'd been taught so I had confidence then what I had confidence he could teach me I had confidence he had heard enough of the word he had heard enough of the trigonometry calculus and all the different things that he knew what he was talking about it was just it would just take it and get this and you can giggle if you want to it took something Supernatural to get it to us everybody say Amen yeah so it's going to take something Supernatural to get the word of God to us we're Supernatural people we love Revelation brother Brown said we Thrive off a revelation all right so what we're why are we thriving off Revelation because we want to know more about God we want to know that he's hidden and revealed we know it's in Simplicity but look it's hidden and revealed in simplicity so it is hidden and it is revealed in Simplicity all right and truly I have some teachers we had one we were talking about the other day doc says and uh he was my math teacher and he made it he was so intelligent but he could he could get you to understand and to me that's a wonderful teacher that's not so far uphill like you that'd be like Einstein coming in here and trying to teach us the theory of relativity you'd be going I don't have Clay what's going on but somewhere down the line somebody learned that theory of relativity and they were able to break it down to a group of people or break it down to a college group of people and they learned about that same way with the Pythagorean theorem and all these other things you know he can say that but some of you don't know what it is why you haven't been in school not that I'm I'm not dishing anybody I'm just saying you have not learned that because you have not studied that we don't know about the word of God unless we study the word of God we don't know about what God's got for us until we get there's only one listen there's not any other curriculum come on right man we had listen when I was going to college they still Drew on blackboards and the kids are going what's a Blackboard man I used to be king of the Eraser um cleaner because that mean I could go outside and I'd be the teacher's pet you know and I could do what I wanted to but I do I don't know what that is no letting most of you going you mean it's not on a no but God give us one it took me six or eight or ten different books that I had to buy every year every quarter that I had that it was required that I have them to learn my study but God only gives us one it's not very large War and Peace is bigger than this is It's only got 66 chapters 66 books sorry 66 books so that's what we got and then the world then is what uh is is if you don't have the Holy Ghost it's a mysterious book Let's just put it that way it's a mysterious book to 99 of the people in this world because about 80 percent don't even think it's real and even like um Jim's um Dad's girlfriend she says well I don't think it's just the absolute it's just something people you know she would be to me it would be like this she wrote this and then somebody else wrote this and somebody else wrote this and we just kind of put them all together and mix it up in a bowl and whatever pops out that's what it is they God don't work way his way like that God says you're going to listen to this this is how you're going to get it you're going to get it through the foolishness of preaching and you're going to have to have knowledge and somebody's got to teach you Whom Shall he teach knowledge you were not born with knowledge your brain is wired yes to a certain way and there are others there are some that are smarter than others but I believe everybody starts on the same basis it's just what you want to do with it and that's what you want to do is what you want to understand same thing with the word of God you can sit here and listen to brother Dale for 50 years and not and be in first grade I don't see how but you can't do that and like I said before then we didn't come to church and listen to a seventh grade teacher please listen please don't go to sleep I've only been here five minutes but we didn't expect brother Dale to be seven years old and not know anything and be a novice no he knew what he was talking about and then we evolved or revolved from that and we did drink milk milk's good milk's okay but milk's not everything but he says who what who shall make to understand Doctrine every church has to have a Doctrine every Church brother Brian set a church without a doctrines not a church so we have a Doctrine what is it all the truth amen we believe in serpent seed we believe in predestination the right way we believe in Daniel 7 who eats the right way we believe in the opening of the seals the right way so I believe we're in the right Institution that's probably not a good word to use there are institutions for people like me but I think we have a real good understanding of Doctrine so what I'm saying is so what so we should be weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast in other words we should be what they call it they call it weaning them off where you have a little bit you know you have a little bit of milk a little bit of milk but what do you do you feed them other things and that's what's been going on I believe for the last 50 something years we've been fed other things than just milk we have been fed Doctrine we've been fed the meat of the Bible we've not had any scarecrows popped up I like what a minister said the other day he said scarecrows scare crows yeah it don't scare Eagles I've never heard of a scary eagle there's scarecrows to scare the crows well we're not crows we're Eagles amen Isaiah 53 says look he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many so Jesus Christ look he was the master scholar that Jesus Christ was the master scholar amen it only took him three and a half years to teach this Doctrine that's totally worldwide three and a half years ago that's all he had he didn't speak anymore he didn't speak any before he didn't speak any after but by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many for he shall bear their iniquities in other words he's going to Bear let me put it this way he's going to Bear my stupidity his knowledge is not listened God's knowledge is not good I think what Satan thinks he says if I can get enough people to agree that there's not a god there won't be one he's crazy he's crazy because that man that created him is never going to go out of existence and that's the God I serve that's the husband I have that's the Savior that I have that Satan could have had in the beginning but he couldn't because what iniquity was found in him and you know what he sended it away so God can't cover his iniquity because you can send away your day of Grace and God's iniquity there's no I mean your iniquity will override God all the time from here till the day of judgment all right so now we talked about this morning real quick sanctification clean and set aside for service the unclean Spirit goes out we were talking about only chart if you pull that chart up just for a second I want everybody to understand when we start talking about now the unclean spirits going out of a man it's not in your soul if you're born again in your soul you have zero unclean spirits in your soul zero God and the devil can't be in there at the same time that's why you were born in sin shaping and iniquity in your soul because that soul is the real you that's the real person that's why I believe you're talking about the little baby going to have all babies go to heaven well what is their memory they have no memory of anything bad they don't have to reason they'll start having a conscience and when they start having a conscience that's when the age of accountability where they're going to have to know right from wrong and they're gonna have to make a what a decision they'll make a decision one way or the other and so have you we've made a decision one way or the other so the soul is where Faith or doubt not faith and doubt so we got to see that the holy of holies it's closed if you're born again and now we're talking about the spirit realm the memory reason conscious affection imagination that's where we're talking about the unclean spirits are able to work in mine in your life that's our problem s not in your soul if you're born again if you're truly born again please don't try to go backwards don't try to go back and clean the soul up that God's already cleaned up now if it's not yes you better get it cleaned up because listen that's what's going to stand in judgment and God's going to judge your soul he's not going to judge yours flesh right right so that sinneth it shall surely die the soul not the body the soul that sent it that's where you send from you send from your soul you do not Sin from your flesh now when you get to that next realm now when brother Brown talks about a Christian sins every day well now when a Christian sins every day it's not from here right right obviously if you're a Christian is faith where are you sending from you're letting your affection take over humanly you let your human reasoning take over you're letting your human memory your human conscious your human imagination you're letting them into that inner court and you're letting them take over this guy everybody with me on that the spirit man and and we live in that Spirit now you know brother Brown says the soul is the nature of the spirit absolutely absolutely whatever's in your soul your spirit is going to react to what's in your soul because I didn't it didn't bother me like I said before it didn't bother me to it didn't bother me to lust when I didn't have anything in there but now it bothers you when you start talking about stuff like that no I was a human being foreign I reasoned against the word of God I said I'm not going to church until mama calls and then I reasoned that I better come on but I didn't want to be here because I sat there and in my conscience I was thinking about everything else she took me out of the ball game I was gonna watch oh y'all didn't do that okay I I'm preaching the Saints today Saints and Hanks and my imagination oh my could you look at when you were when you were not born again the imagination you had in your what you had in your head everybody shake your head yeah that imagination that you know what never would come to pass but it occupied your time I'm gonna win that Lottery if I go just one more ticket that is your imagination taking over and then your reasoning is well if I don't play I'll never win yeah right so the devil just keeps throwing it so anyway it tickles me then guys that were at uh at the city they want to they don't want nothing to do with gambling they don't want nothing to do with a you know that was a uh the other day or no about two years ago they said it was going to be a casino built down at the craving pop property that big white fence in front of my house oh they were so up in arms and of course I went to Mayor at the time but the mayor I asked him I said what do you do out there in front of the convenience store what's on front of your truck he's waiting somebody I said you out there scratching the paint off your truck he said no I said what are you doing I said oh you're scratching lottery tickets you're gambling why worry about a gambling house you just made your own so where are we talking about now we have moved into that Spirit realm and we've had for a while but right here when we were down here at faith we were talking about what faith or doubt the soul of man okay so we went through justification sanctification which took the unclean Spirit out of here and put God's spirit in here close this off because once you're born again it's closed off the womb has been sealed it can nothing else can go in nothing else can come out all right so look right here now this is going to be where the sanctification starts are the real now down here we say well that's sanctification that's clean and set aside for service all right and then the Holy Ghost puts you in service now what does it put you in service for is in your soul is all these other things your imagination is now done away with in God's word's been transforming you you're conscious you're not sitting here thinking about how to fix the tractor and how much what's the score of the ball game is and and your memory is what you're thinking about that was great sermon that brother Wayne preached and I thought about this and I got this apart from that that's your memory part that your reasoning is what the Bible says come let us reason together in other words if there's a false Doctrine comes among you you're going to have to reason it out okay you got to reason that thing out you know you can't just say well I accept this because that's what brother Dale said now that don't do you no good I'm not going to get revelation solely on what brother Dale said slowly on what brother Bob said I said solely you understand not by one person I've got to reason it out what I gotta run it through my filter that's why we as a church we run things I was talking to brother Tim cross the other day and he's coming to preach for us in February when I go to Ohio and do that wedding and he was talking about something I said oh don't worry I said If You Preach something wrong I said my sisters will jump on you so don't worry about that sometimes preachers don't like that either a woman reasoning with him but infection now what did the Bible says it's gonna our affection is turned to what things on high our affection is not down here I love is a horrible phrase that we use all the time I love to hunt I love to drink I love the smoke I love the I love to no it ain't love ain't got nothing to do with it that's an affection that comes from that Spirit realm of man right everybody all right we're there but look it says right here it says to obey leave that up to obey what God Said do now where is the throne room the throne room is in that middle part right there that's what I talk about your spiritual Rudder because that Rudder it doesn't matter the rudder don't have to be about this big but it can move a ship that'll hold 2 000 people if that little rotor turns this away guess what that ship's gonna turn to the left every time you take that great big old boat Brother Gary used to have and no Carolina Skiff and you turn that thing like this you know what it's probably just a little flap about that big behind his Motors or his Motors were turning turned that whole boat the motor wasn't turning the boat folks the captain wasn't turning the boat it was the action of the captain that was turning the boat and that little flap or turned the motors to turn that whole boat in the right direction so that's what you and I we went through life and we had no Rudder in our boat we just storm over here blew over here we just blew over this way we blew over this way huh but it was obeying what God Said do is what brought the power I want us to understand this this statue of perfect man brings power not just to an individual I know it's building individuals but it's bringing power to a church to a bride it's bringing her to maturity to where God's not going to have to tell you every time how to dress every time hot wanna come to church every time while this is right while this is wrong it's going to be something inside of you that throne room is full of Truth yeah it is truth so like I said before let it out let that thing seep out from that entered part of you center part of you into the spirit realm and quit denying the word of God you see I don't deny the word of God by the way well no if you don't do what the word says you're denying the word right okay what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God let's let's get through real quick now I've read this this morning Christ never sent me to build an organization so this is not an organization we're building because you know what that's not an organization that is a person you that is not a person you and your wife that's not a person of you and your kids that's you that's your person that's what you've got to deal with is you so Christ sent me to build individuals to the statue of Jesus Christ that they might be the PowerHouse and Dwelling Place of the Spirit by his word listen God sets the day of Pentecost has ruled the soul of man that takes him and his word because the bride in their soul is God it's not just part of God it is God all right so why have we still got people dying why we still got people that have false Doctrine why we still got well we still have them now but you got the lutherans you got the Westlands they came from Luther and Wesley and they're highly denominated now why they took the part of Luther had that was wrong the part of Wesley that was wrong and they made a Doctrine foreign and it's false but if they would have started and tried to build individuals trying to build individuals because a denomination is a group I don't want us to be denominational message believers I wants to be individual message Believers the Bible tells us in the book of Ephesus that the Ephesian Church there was 12 people right they couldn't even pay a preacher he'd have to work but brother Brown said they were the most powerful Church of the day because they all 12 had the Holy Ghost now all 12 were mature because Paul had come they had come under Paul's Tudor tutoring and teaching and they had what they were they were not questioning everything Paul said they were not questioning everything God said they did exactly they had that little nod from God they went they went out and I believe that from that church in Ephesus there were more churches built there was more things done there was more gospel going out into the world and it was the truth it wasn't part truth it wasn't Corinthians going out there saying well this might be right and this might be wrong no irenius wouldn't even stay in the same building with the guy right remember we all read it Bob brought it we all read it he said I don't even want to be in a bath house with Corinthians he said I'm afraid God will collapse the building while I'm in there that's how wrong but look that's how wrong one Doctrine was that's how the first church hated that one Doctrine that Jesus was a light substance of God which started and went to 300 A.D and they said no he is a like substance of God that's what we believe so if he's a light substance then there's got to be a father there's got to be a son and it got to be a holy ghost so now therefore there's a trinity try try Unity try Trinity three of them and guess what brother Brown said that Doctrine came from the pits of hell even though they went to nicaea they got together they brought the religious people of the world brother Ryan said prophets came and couldn't do any good because they were overwhelmed by the power of the devil and he said that Doctrine came from the pits of hell it did not come from God yet the whole world at this moment unless you're a Believer are part of a Oneness movement so I guess you got a Doctrine to come from the pits of hell that's my brother I'm hated denominations why am I against organized religion now brother Brian didn't hate the people but he hated them Doctrine but now remember if you take on that Doctrine and don't get out of it virtue anyone knows the word virtue means see it must we must have it because virtue is strength or power then we talked about the three pulls this morning I tried to say enough to where you see because you we talk about things like third pull Seven Seals people are like why in the world are you talking about if they're not part of the Bride you know we're not part of a good Teaching Ministry then there's a lot of things that are absolutely it to them it's weird what do you mean we gotta be on third pool that's why you have to take that and break it down to justification Saints case at least they can read that part in the Bible you can't read about a third Paul in the Bible you can read about it but you can't see where it says here's the first pull here's the second pull here's the third pull it took a profit to bring that all right and thank God he came to me I don't know if he came to you but thank God he came to me so the three points was what the outer Court in the flesh because look the the second poem was sanctification and that's what we're under now in this part not in the inside we're already outside we are we're at that second realm and going up the statue of perfect man our affection memory reason conscious and imagination has got to be changed our souls not our souls already changed we're already sitting in Heavenly places we're already raptured we're already in another dimension in your soul if you're born again God came into this Dimension to get you all right so sanctification is what we're talking about from now on we're talking about sanctification of all of virtue knowledge tempers patients all the way up to statute of perfect man it's where God is cleaning us up to put us in service you say well wait well I got the Holy Ghost I've got power to brother Brown said you've got power to create a world and go live on it he said but it's held by bar what is that bar it bars us that bars my stinking thinking because when people when you say that when a preacher says that to you that you can create a world listen you can create a world just like God did travel to it like a thought and go live on it now how many of you are going I believe that 100 percent don't raise your hand I'll call you something else because in your mind and in your Humanity you're like no way but it's there so who's stopping it who's the bar we to the bar and it starts right there in our realm of him I can't imagine that would happen right that's what we say I can't imagine that's going to happen my conscience tells me foreign and and I don't know if I want to love to do that or not but my memory tells me I can't do it because I'm still stuck in this world and see then you start well now the Bible says he's coming back here to get me well when I need to go see what I mean why do I need to go build you know create a world and go live on it when God's here see that's the reasoning that we why can't we just believe it for what he said Bible says if you could what believe in your heart you can move a mountain what's the difference what's the difference in moving a mountain and making one same thing all right so what is it then the bar is us it's our thinking it's that second realm of our being all right so the opening of the word is that seventh seal that's the son of man that's going to what that's going to change your human body it's going to bring your memory reason conscious affection imagination under so much of the power of God never before even Jesus he had to yield to that and die he yielded to that and died because what because of me and you not for himself he didn't die for himself he died for us I hope don't want to surprise you there he died for us he did that for us didn't have to do it but he yielded himself to death died brother Brown said played the part of death because you know what when we passed away we're just playing a part of death Don't Tell Me Brother Richard Marlon and brother Ray and and different ones just passed on don't tell me they're dead they're alive way more alive than we are and they're probably one of that group of people that says he missed the field goal we'll have to deal with that when we get up get up north I'm sure I'll get all kind of repercussions of that but that's okay I don't care but you see what our but see what our thinking is though we are programmed to die we are programmed by Humanity to die you need life insurance why do I need life insurance because you're gonna die why do I need to keep going to the doctor and now I'm not saying anything we go for you need to go for a checkup even if you'd feel good you need to go for a checkup okay but we go we're not going to worry about that we feel good you know I'm going to trust the Lord and that's okay trust the Lord if you want to but he did give us doctors he did give us nurses he did give us medication to take and we thank God for that all right but we don't lean to that understanding remember brother Brian preached the sermon leaned not into your own understanding all right which is in the Bible we'll get to that because understanding is part of knowledge there are several words I was going to read them and I'll read them now wise unwise no knowledge wisdom Spirit of wisdom we're going to try to get to that today because there's a spirit comes among the Bride of spirit of wisdom right to know what's right or wrong to get to take the balance watching brother George Smith somebody told me the other day everywhere brother George Goes and preaches I can't remember where he was at he's got a little um in his coat he keeps a a balance a level and he takes the level out and he sets it right here and he said we've got to be level one of them brothers I was talking to the other day I don't know who it was but I'm not saying I think I know who it was now he said I want to pick that thing up and throw that thing out the window every time I mean it don't matter what he was preaching on he takes that level out and he lays it right here he said we gotta have a balance which is right it's got to be a balance we do listen to tapes we do listen to The Prophet we haven't quit listening to Prophet because we got to fight for Ministry but we're not over here to this side he said that's all we're going to listen to and something that you know that we've got one man to follow and now I think we got two brother brandeman Jr right tell me where that's in the Bible not in the Bible you should have enough wisdom to know that a five-fold Ministry has got to be five folds to get you out of here there's got to be five different men how many times have you you shouldn't listened to me and you said you've listened brother Dale you've listened to us and listened to us and listen to us it's a refreshing to listen to somebody else don't say that too quick but it is it's refreshing to bring one in because it's part of a five-fold Ministry all right can't just have one it's not just one all the time you gotta have a five-fold Ministry and it's not just one man fulfilling fivefold now that's a little bit different um to me it would be it would be um just complementary to the word of God let me just put it that way for God to just say you can't listen but just one person and that's it got a variety brother Wayne will bring something that I've been preaching and he'll bring it a different way and you'll be going I never heard that before and I preached 15 sermons on it you know why you hadn't heard it the way I said it you heard it the way he said it or Bob gets up and he starts preaching and he preaches my sermon over and over again and over again glad you're going to Nicaragua maybe I'll get some no but see that's the way but now no way the word bringing out a way many times brother down you know people tell Brothers I never heard you say that well I pull you 20 sermons where he said it but it's just it's part of a five-fold Ministry so what am I saying that's in that realm right here I'm talking about boring again people are going to ask questions Born Again people are not gonna get it just from one person right but to perfect us we've got to have this do not worry about this right carnal man living room outer Court don't worry about that guy we worry about him too much right here's a man we need to worry about if you're born again folks to me this is to me this is God in his fullness everybody with me but when we came down and we come through the womb of a woman like we weren't supposed to when we come through the womb of a woman we received a contrary spirit you with me a contrary Spirit which is an adamic nature that's attached to that inside part of you and you what will happen is it'll take over and you'll become a sinner at the age of accountability but what happens at the new birth he burns that nature out he doesn't burn you out he doesn't annihilate your soul he can't acknowledge your soul and give you a new one that's a Doctrine that was real prevalent in the message that he'll take one soul out and put another one in well brother Brown said clearly that you there's no transmigration of souls listen when you're born you have your soul it stays in you until you die or until you take a body change it is you because it's the real you who's God going to judge if he puts another one in there no he's going to judge that one person that soul that you were born with that's one if we deal with that though and we've been dealing with it for probably 50 sermons on you must be born again and how to be born again and all that well now we're working in a little higher order we're in the spirit realm the second pull which would be turning the hearts of the children to the fathers that would be the revelation of the Son of God or this statue of a perfect man and then the third pull we haven't got to now listen I know for a fact I know for a fact that you're probably going to question what I'm saying and others are going to question but everybody says we're in a third pool Ministry be careful we got to get that statue perfect man down first we're not can't jump all the way up there to the top yes we are covered under the mystery of the son of man but if you don't understand what I'm talking about with the Son of God and have these virtues working in your life it's no use saying that you're this third pool person think about what you're saying we are third pool people we're we're it's in other words it's available for us to get right right but we've got to get the second pull on the second part of the ministry of God the Son of God which is these virtues working in our life just like Peter just like Paul just like James just like Mark Luke all the different ones right if we get that yes absolutely but God's not going to come down on a body that's not finished that's right amen right he's not and he's not going to come down on a body that's not the same as the head remember the vulcanization we were trying to tell y'all last last Wednesday night it's rubber to rubber is what vulcanizes rubber to rock doesn't vulcanize it don't stick but if we become him in our second realm and and you know if we we're going to still have problems but you know what's going to happen I believe that those problems are going to get less and less not less and less in intensity but less and less in bothering us right brother Bynum said one day death will crawl up your sleeve and you'll just wipe it right off now wow now take that for a quote everybody wants powerful quotes you think about what happened when he said that right he said one day death will come up your sleeve and you'll be able in other words to push it back and he didn't say be able to go call the preacher that caused the Deacon that caused the Elder he said you will be able to push it back you will be able to do the no devil not my time you believe that then we've got to get these second pull the spirit realm the the memory reason conscious infection imagination we've got to start taking that and letting that be the most important thing if you're born again in your soul listen it's just like a little piece of of atomic energy in your soul what you're doing is you're trying to crack the shell to get it out so you crack in the Shell to get it out to that second realm of memory reason conscious inspection imagination like I said before don't worry about your your flash listen I will promise you I'll be 63 in a few days Ryan if you hadn't done what you did Terrence had been finding somebody else to do that openness don't start off wrong now he said that if it was September so y'all just don't just don't bother me about that but I know I'm getting older I know it's harder to get out of a car to get out of the bed but that should never ever hinder your spirituality just cause I'm getting older I don't have to study anymore just cause that I'm getting any older I don't have to come to church now the Bible didn't say that right right I'll hurt your feelings your feelings ought to be hurt so we blame it on old ladies now you blame a lot of things on old age all right I can't stay up all night you know I can't do this I can't do that humanly but if if if Joshua and Caleb Caleb was 80 something years old he was 40 when he went in you know went into the Wilderness they were in there 40 years he was like 85 years old he said I he said my strength has not abated he said I'm just as strong now as I was then what was he testified he wanted that mountain he wanted that mountain that was his to get and he never said well I'm 85 I think I just want to I want to just go up about two feet I'll just no he said give me my mountain now where are we going to say give me my promises give me what I'm supposed to have at 85 years old and it was just a strong why he had a will he didn't have the Holy Ghost in his soul folks but he had a promise those people in the Old Testament died under a promise under a promise that Jesus Christ the Messiah was going to come and die come through a virgin die and take their sins away and they move mountains brother Bob's Fish and get into Hebrews 11 they did all those great things that whole chapter not one of them had the new birth it was just the will of them saying I believe that's what's going to happen I believe what this Prophet is telling me of course those prophets got killed by a lot of people too but they were listened to and they were so like Barack you know different ones but look at them they all started out with I can't do that I can't do that Gideon was hiding when God said you're a mighty man of Valor and he's going really he said isn't that your land aren't you aren't you tired of them people doing that to you pick up something and just start fighting you don't have to be trained in Jiu Jitsu and all that stuff pick up your sword the word of God in other words he had an ox goat he picked up what he could get and you know what he done he got what he wanted same way with Caleb Caleb didn't count how many because supposedly that was the son of anak was the ones that was on top of that mountain which was the Giants God always makes it a little bit harder well now let's not cross Jordan when it's only about this about this wide let's wait till the snow melts out of from Judea let's wait until it's about two miles wide right let's wait till flood season God said we're waiting till flood season I'm gonna send them across during the swelling of Jordan so in your worst trials guess what it's got to be a blessing if you're a Christian today it's got to be a blessing your trials will absolutely you know who it's for it's not for you it's to prove to the devil that you can do it in the worst of situations the most swelling of your life he said step in that water take the priest down there step in that water as soon as you step in that water I'm not going to just make it where you can walk across I'm gonna move it back and you'll have a two mile path you can walk right through Jordan and as brother Wayne was saying there is there is a two piles of stones one of them is in the Jordan and when it swells you can't see it but when it settles back down they go man they couldn't even see that when they crossed the first time but God had to open it up and they could put the stones in there and come back together what a mighty God we serve we're sister um Johnny when we need her she called the other day boys you talk about somebody talking fast if her team would have missed a field goal and and yeah anyway when sister Johnny calls she talks you listen and it's real good we miss her don't we [Applause] she's faithful she said I'm watching I'm saying second devil what a mighty God we serve but brother Brown said it'd be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of children to the Pentecostal fathers that's going to be when the seals open when he started in 63 he said my new ministry or the son of man now what is the son of man the son of man's not dealing with your soul right you quiet your soul by this time ought to already be redeemed because you'll never understand the son of man what the son of man is unless you got God that son of man in your soul so the third pull was what to a special group of people it's not for you on questions and answers it's gone from you it's not for you to get in other words you worry about cleaning this guy up right here 's what he's saying live a good Christian Life you know what he said live a good Christian Life do the best you can in other words though God's going to send a power in the church after these seals are open to show you that not only this guy can be redeemed but you know what this guy can be redeemed when we take a body change this guy is going to be changed and it will be fully redeemed everybody with me so that hasn't come yet that's the chief headstone we're under that Ministry but we got to get to some God Ministry down first before that's why I've tried to back up I was going to continue on too into the son of man but we've got to get the Son of God Ministry down first the memory reason conscious effects and Imagination working in virtue knowledge tempers places Godless and brotherly kindness remember facing on an ad if you're born again you get Faith anybody with me all right now look this is what brother Brown's explaining when we're talking about this message your Malachi 4 do two things bring back the church to the word now what is the messenger of Malachi 4 to do restore back the original Faith the resurrection Faith they've not had to have Resurrection Faith now listen you're resurrect is sitting in Heavenly places but that's where those two guys had the doctrine that Paul says the resurrection is already over Paul's talking about an out-resurrection we're in the Resurrection The Resurrection in your soul because listen at this very moment Paul's body oh I wasn't supposed to touch that sorry it's in the grave sorry Richard oh Lord but his body's in the grave it's probably now that's probably back to dust you probably can't even find it but that thing still lives and this thing right here he's still got it too because remember they can remember what went on when brother Brown went across the current time they remember they said you've got to go back you don't lose those things brother Brown said you got an eye he said God's got an eye but it's a greater eye but when you go across the curtain of time you got an eye but it's a greater eye amen because the limit what we're limited to this they're not limited when they go across that it doesn't matter they leave their body here they leave the limit here and when they break over in that other dimension man their senses are just exploded all right they were meant a few words they went forth and preached a word talk about preaching all night now what he'll take the message of Pentecost which was not Azusa Street see he couldn't depend on Azusa Street Pentecost because they were trinitarians the original Pentecost was not trinitarian the Pentecost of 1906 was a denomination the Pentecost of the first era or the first church age was not a denomination so brother Brown wasn't talking about because when he would I just it tickles me that he's sitting there preaching a bunch of Pentecostals and every time he talks about the message of Pentecost I bet they're like oh yeah and he says I'm not talking about y'all I'm talking about the original Pentecost that's why they hated him that's why the Pentecostals still hate him today you can say brother Brown's name in the Baptist Church and it's not going to hurt you do not go to a Pentecostal church and say the word William Brown or the name William Branham they do not like him because he preached so much against them because they were what he came out of they didn't come with him they stayed right here and he's telling them he said you're dead and it wasn't hearsay he was telling them sitting in their bench you're dead because he'll be rebuking them because they didn't keep this same faith that was back there at the beginning amen now I believe we pretty well realize it's going to be Elijah and we know that for sure and notice the first Elijah was come to turn the hearts of the children he flipped it around the hearts of the fathers to the children that would be John the Baptist Baptist see the old patriarch fathers the old Orthodox the legalist the law he turned it back to the faith of the fathers from the faith of the fathers to the children in other words the new message that Jesus was bringing what's the new message you must be born again not you must go to the temple you must be born again not depend on a lamb lamb lamb all right that's what he was teaching that's what he was telling him that's why John was turning him that's why John didn't really have a Doctrine to teach he said behold I'm introducing this one is going to teach you all right he said I can't even he said I wouldn't not even worthy for him to loose my shoes all right look so now the hearts of the children this new message that John was preaching of the coming Messiah at hand he turned the hearts to this but now watch the next time John appears we know that's he meant next time the spirit of Elijah and John all right brother Brown wasn't John all right but the spirit of Elijah and John the next time John appears he turns the hearts with his children back to the faith of the Pentecostal fathers that would not be 1906 that's way before that would be 80 30 33. so it'd be back to the original message and you'll know when it gets here now that's where brother Brown says they don't even believe in signs they don't believe in that back in his age they don't believe in wonders they don't believe in speaking in tongues they don't believe in this that the other he said that's why I go with you Pentecostal people because you're as close to the truth as they were back then he said as close he said they weren't the truth because they would what he said you cut your hair every year more he said I preach on it you cut it off every year I come he said you put on tighter clothes you do all these things in other words you don't listen to what I'm saying you'll know when it gets here it'll be a restoration to send that lukewarm loudacy in church back to that original Faith back Yonder yes sir and he will be anointed who this this Elijah that we're under when this Elijah comes he'll be a prophet he'll pull no punches he'll cut right and left and then we talk about restore Joel says I will restore the years that the locusts eat what did the locusts eat what the canker and palm War what they eat they eat the original face they eat the original tree that was back in what Pentecost 80 30 Pentecost 33 Pentecost it was eat down and what was it now listen God can only work in truth he can wake at ignorance but he can only work in truth that's why brother Brandon would say he'd say if I've told you the truth let God come and vindicate him now listen God's not obligated to vindicate anything but truth and for him coming on the scene and vindicating it it must have been the truth but you know what that's why they hated him too that's why they hated brother Brown they were saying he was false and he was false teaching but all when he got on the pulpit and he got the anointing it was good it was a true anointing I don't understand that so I will restore you can go ahead and pull the quotes back up I'm finished with that right now Proverbs 12 talking about a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband we talked about that we got to get to knowledge here just for a minute and then we'll then we'll close let's go to knowledge now we know what virtue is we know the virtue is strength that's something we have to have but you got to know what how to use that strength everybody with me I know it's hot in here I know y'all taking a night night nap I just hope my pilot tonight does not take a night night now even the co-pilot see I don't ask God when I get an airplane I don't ask him to be co-pilot I don't ask God to be a co-pilot in my car no I want him to run the thing I want him to drive the airplane I want him to drive my car it's like that old guy Workforce and what was his name t Rick what Rick I'll remember Rick anyway so he was he was a Christian man he was a nominal Christian guy and he goes around this curve with some chicken on it that we had that we were going to deliver somewhere and he hits this barn and the Barn's really close to the road he hits this barn and I mean it just drives two by fours right through the cab and right through into the into the uh back of the truck that I think it was his truck but anyway there was a guy standing there and Rick was just testifying said well if the Lord hadn't been with me I would have got killed and if the Lord hadn't been with me he said that old man looked at him and said buddy you keep driving like that and the Lord ain't gonna be with you that's why I want him to drive I don't want to be the co-pilot he'd got two before stuck through him knowledge what was his name Rick what wait why Rick why Slick Rick he was a good one yeah the old man said you keep driving like that but he said Lord ain't gonna be riding you much longer that's the same way with us that's why I want him to drive my vehicle I don't want him to be my co-pilot I want him to drive my vehicle second Peter 1 verse 5 we talk about knowledge so this is knowledge starts with four letters know so it's got to do something with knowing or no or know what's going on all right so knowledge second Peter 1 verse 5 said beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and to Virtue knowledge now look at this word knowledge into Greek it's called No Seas it's knowledge signifies in general intelligence we were just talking about that understanding the general knowledge of Christian religion the deeper more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion so it's not just grammar school knowledge everybody with me it's not just grammar school knowledge all right such as look the deeper and more perfect and enlarged knowledge of this religion such as belonging or belongs to the more advanced now that's what we're talking about you get a certain form listen when you get born again you get knowledge a part of knowledge telling you to do what the word of God said but then you've got to you've got to take that higher to where as you listen to the word of God you have to decipher what's good and what's bad you have to take that knowledge and apply it to you such as belongs to the more advanced especially of things lawful and unlawful for Christians because you remember look the knowledge when cyrenthius came in and he said I believe that's a light substance of God because that just can't be God he cried he hungered he and I'm sure he brought all kind of accusations or or evidences to to prop up what he had but remember it was false so whatever he used to prop up he used it wrong he didn't have the knowledge of God to tell him like Irene is that's why brother Branham picked irenius and didn't pick polycarp remember he said polycarp was a mighty man he was a wonderful guy but he leaned toward organized religion is that not what he said but he said irenia stood there and said no that's wrong polycarp get away from that and polycarp wouldn't get away from it but now I'm telling you polycarp is going to make it he was that far he was that close to being a church-aged messenger can we be that close to a body change oh when we bring it to now it wasn't bad say that about him but when we bring it home that we could be this much by leaning to organization or or doing what you want to do watch this moral wisdom that's another word I stopped at Spirit of wisdom the word understanding the word known the word says look we talk about the word new Adam knew his wife in other words he had knowledge of her everybody with me we'll talk about it a little bit later but we'll close right here in just a second moral wisdom such as saying in what right living hmm Genesis 2 9 now here we go we separate them the three of what the tree of in the garden and the tree of knowledge now look that is a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil that's not just evil there is some good like I said before to get out of all this a lot of people are not going to be able to chime in today or turn into the to the internet and watch Us online without somewhat knowledge off of that tree and knowledge of Good and Evil he's a master at that he lets the devil do things and he'll you listen the way to drive you to God is for the devil for him to turn the devil loose on you hello somebody we hate that we don't like it but that's exactly God's prescription if you get to wandering away from God he will send the devil on you to drive you back well I don't know if that happened maybe it's just me maybe it's me this whole thing hmm Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine then that are weaned from the milk drawn from the breast now the word knowledge out of the dictionary but I like this watch this the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity is this a strange Doctrine to you is this a strange message I know when you first get born again if our brother and sister comes and gets gets born again it's a little strange but now it's not strange you're strange you're thinking strange my thinking is strange it's not that the message is strange it's what look it's the fact of knowing something with familiarity gained through experience or Association birds of a feather acquaintance with our understanding of science art or a technique the fact of can or condition of being aware of something when you have knowledge of something what you're aware of it you're aware today whether I'm preaching you the truth or not if you're born again how many of you have been sitting in a in a sermon and a brother say something a little bit off or a little bit wrong what happens ding something goes off right here that's knowledge that's your Holy Ghost knowledge taking what taking your memory and bringing it down to say hey there's something wrong with that brother Ram talks one time he says it doesn't ring true remember we talked preached on an uncertain sound the range of one's information or understanding which is um example is answer to the best of my knowledge I watch this right here I like this one these circumstance or condition of apprehending Truth you got to go get it when you apprehend a suspect guess what you've done you've run down the road or you've drove down the road and you've apprehended that person in other words you have went in their direction and you have apprehended so what we're going to come into this direction to apprehend the word of God you got to know where the word of God's at the circumstance our condition of apprehending what truth or fact through reasoning you say the Bible says come let us reason together right and we'll read that a little bit later on when we get into reasoning we'll talk about that but brother Brown let's let's do this and then we'll uh we'll close right here and musicians get ready to come brother I'm saying the statue of perfect mass and then thirdly you add knowledge knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge judge what right from wrong how do you judge it then if you've got Christian knowledge with your virtue and faith you judge whether the word is right or wrong and if you can lay aside all your Creeds and all your unbelief everything that you claim you have done then you have knowledge to believe that God cannot lie let every man's word be alive but mine be true see now you're getting knowledge that Supreme knowledge you don't have to have four degrees in some college or something like that to have it because all these virtues are given to you by God not by school to place upon the foundation of your faith that you might come to the full stature of a real living man of God why do we why do we come to church I and I fail miserably I come here to get better surprise I come here to get better I don't come here to get worse I don't go to the to the doctor's office or I don't go to the hospital to get worse I take the prescription to get better I come here let's read this right here and then we'll close musicians come on is that your perfect man brother but I'm saying now when you get it like that then add that to your faith when you get true virtue add it to your faith when you can walk out here on the street live like a Christian act like a Christian be a Christian add that to your faith in other words strength when you have knowledge you say well I don't know whether this scripture is just right now here is Acts 2 38 I don't know how to go about it with acts 28 19. I don't all right you don't add nothing because you ain't got it yet see what are you going to do because you don't you haven't got knowledge enough to know of God yet that the Bible does not contradict itself see look leave it alone and I put that word but in big letters look but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory when you can see that the scriptures are not contradictory that you can say that and can see that by the revelation of God the whole word is wrote in Mysteries look and only the knowledge of God can reveal it Mass knowledge says can't happen man's knowledge that ain't gonna happen man's knowledge says I it doesn't matter how you go to church and wear whatever you want to you can do whatever you want to you can live like the world and still be a Christian now that's the overpowering um whatever you want to call it it's it's very prevalent in denominations because you can't tell them guys from the world we uh well never mind foreign shoulders with the world every once in a while ask him say hey man what that tattoo for why'd you get that piercing for wow I like him I enjoy it I wanted to do it now what do we do when somebody says hey you want to get a tattoo bird John no no cause I don't enjoy it don't like it don't want it don't think nothing of it now wait a minute that's too different but the prevailing world is that Mom saw it last night we was at that wedding she said I hate people got tattoos everywhere I started saying mom you probably there's some that you can't see that yeah anyway but that's that you know you can have that the preacher can get up and he can go outside and smoke a cigarette put some children back in his mouth and talk like a sailor but he's a preacher let's stand to our feet so but only the knowledge of God can reveal this then when you get inside punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your faith are we at that point let's say Lord Build Me Up O Lord into this let Christ be my head that works through me working through me on my Foundation my faith that's in him let virtue in all his temper is placing Godless brother kind of work in Me O Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die sink or drown denomination or no denomination friend or no friend how many of y'all can say that or did you get cut off somewhere in there somewhere I don't care Liberty sink or swim denomination no denomination friend or no friend let that work in me let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out that I might be able to teach those for God has said in the church Apostles prophets teachers pastors and evangelists all for the perfecting and bringing all these virtues into it for that Perfection of the coming of the Son of God each one of these stones are immaterial off of that one this is material of this he's talking about these virtues this is material of this each one of these virtues belonging to him and they're pouring out of him down through them down through them down through them that means us we'll talk about the spirit of wisdom when we get back because president look Spirit of wisdom comes into church to make known the church to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost so the spirit of wisdom got to come into the church it's not just something it's not just we've been message Believers for years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years and years we got to come to a knowledge that we're better than that right that we're here for another purpose we're not here for a purpose just to be in the message and to gather together and to bring our our uh you know bring our uh ideas no we come here to see what he's got for us to see what God's got for us to see what song he wants us to sing to see what praise he wants us to do to see what he wants to preach where you can many times brother Dale said many many times and and you can feel it that he'll try to get a sermon try to get a sermon and man it'd be like this right here Aaron amen amen be like this right here and then you come to church that morning and you got five visitors well that's why I gotten you those visitors were coming and he didn't want them to teach on the seal that day he wanted to get down a little bit lower so that so that they can understand that you don't leave people out and there's one thing for sure you don't sit there and Bash them the whole service either we've been to them Services before too hey ma'am yeah when you see a preacher that said I just had to hit that long that short-haired woman sitting in the front row well you know what she probably drove her away because that was her first service I mean come on people that's where you don't have the knowledge of God you don't have any wisdom when you do that let me tell you one thing for sure I'm glad you're not God and I'm glad I'm not God they wouldn't nobody make it if we were God how many of you came to church with a pair of pants on or short hair or whatever more you didn't get kicked out not in this church you didn't you didn't get preached on either there was a love and a reverence that we gave every human being has a soul and as Louise says There Were Ten Thousand worlds Every Soul not just oh bless God it's just a bride no every soul is worth ten thousand worlds Every Soul to God is important it's up to you to make it important well I well get born again that's what God wants he just wants us to get born again and start living this statue of perfect man that's what he wants he don't want nothing else okay he wants you to show the world though he wants you to let the world know I'm different I'm different because you know what Jesus Christ was different bro John they called Jesus everything but God they called him the devil you know why they did that because that devil inside of him hated him so much hated him so much so they called him Bells above the devil was calling Jesus build above well the devil inside of Caiaphas and all them other people did but when he met them real demons in gadara what's the first thing they said oh thou Son of God why you come here to judge me before my time they knew exactly who he was because they knew they could see in that realm in that Spirit realm they could see that that was God and they were the devil they had the devil in there or they were you know part of the devil so that's the way the world's got it all messed up when Jesus came here nobody liked him caused War everywhere but he's the Prince of Peace he opened up his mouth the Bible says but he caused a lot of fuss heading to the cross right sometimes we misunderstand This Man Called Jesus he is the Prince of Peace because that's what we're headed to there will be peace listen you won't know peace you don't know peace here you say well I'm having a little bit of Peace well that's a little bit right right bro John you got kids a little bit a little bit of peace but think about a Perpetual piece we can't fathom that brother Joe we can't do that we can't sit and go oh I can know that no you don't know that but you know what I'm dependent on God if I'll do what he says that he'll put that inside of me and what's inside of me will take me to peace it'll take me to the peace that passes all understanding wow let's sing a song God bless you cabinet [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] of the healing power Lord and I pray that wherever these go Lord that he'll touch the therapist Lord and and we are [Music] home so let us create [Applause] is Jesus [Music] for we are standing in his presence in it the mountain wasn't holy he said the mountain was Holy Ghost God was standing on him there's not a holy church there's not a holy building it's the holy people in the building that's me and you take that to the world that the world is dying they need God [Music] and I'll promise you today before this service started [Music] if we could see in another dimension the Angels marched in that door first and they're all along these walls because I promise you the devil will want to stop this from happening but what a protection that we have so I don't see it I don't feel it now God never told us any of that he said believe it and I believe that I believe that angels are if we can see them standing on holy grounds [Music] see there do you know I do they're ministering Spirits said to me and you [Music] your heavenly father Lord our brothers standing here today Lord with the needs [Music] foreign [Music] for we are standing in his presence on Holy Ground uh well one day you won't have to leave this we'll have to go home praise God there'll never be a Monday amen the little things that we take for granted that we're not going to have to worry about when we get over there bro Joe you're not gonna have to worry about losing your glasses and finding them you don't have to worry about your car keys losing them or finding them you're not going to worry about your hair losing it or finding it it'll be right there but what is one more thing before we go there this is a minute part of your life if you're a Christian I'm talking about just a blip on God's radar he's he's brought us down here to living human bodies to what to show him to the world and then we're going to an eternity that we can't even fathom because when I say a little blip that don't really mean a whole lot I mean bro John is really like that you know we're just down here for a moment what 70 80 years that we get to live here you know maybe a little bit longer so I'm a little bit shorter but get him in your soul get God in your soul if you get God in your soul you're just as Eternal as God is and then brother Byron could say the quote you never had a beginning and you never had an end what the real you the real you the one you that was supposed to be here had there not been a fall and that's your soul because your soul is changed back not exchanged but it's changed back to that young 18 year old well praise God all the things God got for us that we can't even see in the natural realm but if we'll just every once in a while just get in the spiritual realm just close your eyes or even open your eyes and say God show me just a little bit just a little bit more I want to know a little bit more give me some more knowledge have you ever just asked him for anything in the Statue of perfect man that's what we're talking about just ask him say God I'm missing it in virtue be honest with him I'm missing it in knowledge Lord I'm missing it in Temperance okay well that's your issue then then we're going to work our way through it this is not Alcoholics Anonymous this is not going to suppress your feelings suppress your feelings you're just going to explode one day and be the same person you were before before all this but if you'll give it to God and he'll eliminate it and there'll be no way it'll come back what a mighty God we serve hey man let's bow our heads we're going to get um get out of here real quick I'm gonna change clothes uh pray for sister Jim and we'll keep up with everything with the surgery and all on Wednesday but just pray for me that all the traffic's good from here to the airport and we get on the plane and get over there and have a good time with them we sure appreciate all of our streamers we appreciate the ones that come here and we appreciate all the ones that that archive our sermons because I believe that that I believe that we're doing something good I said we ain't talking about one we're all doing something good for the glory of God if I didn't believe it I wouldn't be here hey man you either all right so let's bow our heads Lord Jesus thank you Lord that you have encamped Angels around the Believers to hold back the power of the devil Lord I pray that that would continue in our daily Walk of Life Lord when we stand and we do something wrong and we hang our heads and we we say Lord father forgive me I didn't mean to do that I shouldn't have done that but Lord I ask you to forgive me and the Bible says you are just to forgive so I believe the word of God that today our sins can be forgiven and our daily walk can be more like you Lord be with us Lord on the highways the ones that are going home the ones that are sick touch a vehicle there Lord and I'm going to be driving there'll be no accidents there'll be no flat tires everything will be good I'll get there in plenty of time and the plane flight will be fine Lord and go meet with our brothers and sisters there in Ohio father just be with the group here brother Aaron speaking for us on Wednesday that will come together Lord in service for you be with our wife and touched her on Wednesday Lord touch the surgeons hands Lord and let them say that

year Lord that we can climb up this statue of perfect man somewhere that man cannot go without the new birth and I pray the Lord to just be with us now sanctify Us in Jesus name hey man you're dismissed God bless you his presence on Holy Grail always [Music] I know
