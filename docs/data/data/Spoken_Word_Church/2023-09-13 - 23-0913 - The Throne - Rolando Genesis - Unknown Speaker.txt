he just want to you know see more churches and fellowship with the brothers and sisters and um so uh as we remain standing uh let us open our Bible in the Book of Revelation chapter four leadership read the verses one and two I'm sorry I and then uh verse 5 it says after this I look and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show the things which must be Hereafter and immediately I was in the spirit and behold ashron was set in heaven and one sat on the throne Let's uh uh red verse 5 and out of the throne are proceeded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lumps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God let us bow our heads for a moment of Prayer father God once again we thank you Lord God for this another opportunity Lord Jesus that you have given to every one of us come together and fellowship together around your word of eternal life Lord God and Father God you know Lord God how needy we are Lord and uh father God as we talk about your word Lord we believe that your word is inspired every scripture is inspired by the Holy Spirit and it is impossible Lord God for us our human mind could comprehend Lord God these things Lord unless the holy spirit will give us the understanding Lord I pray that you will anoint your servant Lord anoint your word and anoint every ear this evening Lord God moving now means Lord meet every need Lord and I pray God hallelujah that you will bless every one of us Lord in Jesus Christ name we pray amen you may be seated in the presence of the Lord praise God hallelujah and uh this evening I would like to ah share with you with the topic of the throne amen hallelujah that's wrong or God's throne Hallelujah and uh when Brian he used this text when it says after this he said that after the seven Church ages and then John was summoned to come up hither and God showed him ah many things things that are that will ah happen Hallelujah in the future Allelujah and one thing that God had showed to John was and he says uh come up hither and I will show the things which must be hereafter and the first thing that John saw in heaven is as in Universal and immediately I was in the spirit and behold asron was set in heaven and one sat on the throne there is only one sitting on the throne so some people they teach that uh there are three Gods two Gods but the thing that John saw there was only one throne and there was only one sitting on the throne Hallelujah so and God said oh brother him said that when God God when he is enthroned he is then judged he is a judge once God sits on the throne Hallelujah and it is a fearful thing you know brothers and sisters it is a fearful thing to stand before God when he says in the throne because once he sit on the throne he is a judge Hallelujah and a lot of people ah they think that God they always think that God is love and sure he is a god of love Hallelujah and but the thing that uh didn't that they didn't know is that God is also a god of wrath amen Hallelujah once he sits in the throne he is no longer he is not uh like Abraham said that he is our uh what do you call that a grandpa you know Hallelujah but he is a righteous judge hallelujah what is wrong is wrong and what is right is right what is uh good is good and what is evil or Sin is Sin Hallelujah and it is a very fearful Thing Once Hallelujah you uh you stand when he sits in his throne Hallelujah you know a lot of people they are you know uh I wish I can I can go into the presence of God I wish I can stand before him but brothers and sisters one time Isaiah showed Isaiah a vision era Isaiah he he saw the Throne of God the temple of God and you know Isaiah he was the great prophet of God one of the of the Major Prophets earlier that God used to to write the Bible Hallelujah and he got ah I think if I'm not mistaken 66 books Hallelujah and God revealed to him a lot of things and maybe Isaiah you know in his days he was you know he was so confident you know maybe I am a holy man Hallelujah I am worthy because you know a lot of people among the people of Israel God is revealing to me Hallelujah and maybe the people who was admiring Isaiah oh Isaiah he's a good a great prophet of God you know he is a holy man but one day Hallelujah God showed him a vision and he saw the Throne of God Hallelujah and when he saw the Throne of God you know he realized he realized how unworthy he is that even he saw the seraphims and they have six wings and two Wings they used to cover their face Hallelujah ensures that even the seraphim that had no sin in them Hallelujah they are not worthy to look upon the throne of God Hallelujah they covered their faces and they have two wings and the two wings uh they covered their feet and barbraham said to shows reverence Hallelujah and then the two ways they use it to fly or for action Hallelujah and then when Isaiah saw these things he realized and he said Hallelujah imagine a prophet of God a holy man of God hallelujah when he saw how holy is God he said I am a man about unclean lips and I dwell in the midst of of a people about unclean lips and my eyes have seen the king the Lord of hosts that's how uh sacred that's how holy amen hallelujah that's how fearful Hallelujah when you stand before the presence of God and I believe brothers and sisters one day Hallelujah but I believe the bride will you know but the people one day everyone will stand before this Throne Hallelujah and everybody must prepare for that day hallelujah what judgment you will get Hallelujah we knew a prayer before his he's from you know one day when God God's Throne came down into Mount Sinai if you read The Exodus chapter 19 from 16 to 19 it says and it came to pass on the third day in the morning that there were Sanders and Lightnings and a thick Cloud upon the mount and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud so that all the people that was in the camp trembled and Moses brought forth the people out of the come to meet with God and they stood at the nether part of the mount and Mount sinai's Sinai was greatly on a smoke all together on a smoke because the Lord descended upon it in Fire and the smoke thereof ascended as the smoke of a furnace and the whole mount quick greatly Hallelujah imagine brothers and sisters that if you can imagine Mount Sinai it is a Rocky Mountain Allelujah and it says that even the mountain greatly yeah right even the mountain win win win God in his throne he touched that mountain Hallelujah even the mountain it showed Hallelujah and how much more we human beings and when the voice of the trumpet sounded long and works louder and louder Moses speak and God answered him by a voice and then now if we continue reading from this uh chapter chapter 19 and then from in in verse 20 from verse 1 up to 19 God he gave Hallelujah the Ten Commandments and then after giving the Ten Commandments after God speaking and writing Hallelujah those Ten Commandments Allelujah in verse 8 then it says and all the people saw the thunderings and the Lightnings and the noise of the trumpet and the mountains smoking and when the people saw it they removed and stood afaro amen and they said unto Moses speak thou with us and we will hear but let not God speak with us lest we die they were so scared be afraid Hallelujah they trembled hallelujah how fearful Hallelujah in their sight Hallelujah when they saw Hallelujah the presence of God when God hallelujah come down Allelujah us judge and then Paul's account in in the book of Hebrews chapter 12 from Verse 18 to 21 he says for year not come unto the mount that might be touched and that burned with fire nor unto Blackness and darkness and Tempest and the sound of a trumpet and a voice over words of Words which voice they had heard entreated that the world should not be spoken to them anymore Hallelujah when God speaks Hallelujah it was so fearful Lord Moses allelia speak to us and now we will now hear you Hallelujah maybe before you know they just ignore Moses voice and they became Rebels Hallelujah but when they heard that Moses Hallelujah we will now hear you just don't let God speak to us we will die Hallelujah which was the uh that heard in written that the word should not be spoken to uh to them anymore for they could not endure that which was commanded and if so much as a beast touched the mountain it shall be stoned or thrust uh through with a DOT and so terrible was the sight that Moses said exceedingly fear and quick Hallelujah even Moses halleluia Evan Moses he was exceedingly fair and quick and even Joshua Hallelujah the great warrior he was the one who used by God to to bring the children of Israel into their inheritance and divided the land Hallelujah to its uh tribes and he could not even go up into the mountain he was just able to go halfway Hallelujah he could not come near into the presence of God Hallelujah it's so fearful brothers and sisters that even Moses was commanded to take to take officials Hallelujah this is a Holy Holy Ground Hallelujah and a judgment said nothing could stand there but only the redeem one day nothing Hallelujah a good standard only those that are Redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ and sinner cannot approach Hallelujah that's judgment said Hallelujah and you know brothers and sisters one one ah the thing that we're rich out of the throne not only coming from a pharaoh but out of the throne from the throne Hallelujah proceeded Lightnings and thunderings and voices and in other scripture it says and sound of trumpets Hallelujah you know Brothers sometimes when we see this lightnings from a distance you know when we hear this uh great thundering sometimes we do like this we cannot endure Hallelujah we cannot bear Hallelujah the sound we cannot look on those Lightnings when even if it is a far off how much more brothers and sisters when you stand before the throne and the standings and Lightnings and voices are coming out Allelujah from that Throne if you can still stand Hallelujah a sinner could not stand hallelujah it's so fearful brothers and sisters to stand before God when he is when he sets us judge Hallelujah now it's but on the throne there is a way to approach Hallelujah and now Moses when he made the things in the Tabernacle ah here on Earth the things that he saw in heaven he patterned Hallelujah those things he patterned everything in that Tabernacle he patterned it to what he saw in heaven Hallelujah and in Hebrews chapter 8 verse 5 he says who served unto the example and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make that Tabernacle foresee saith he now that thou make all things according to the pattern showed today in the mount Hallelujah God showed to Moses what he is going to do Hallelujah and how to do and how to make and how to build and how to approach God Hallelujah in heaven and that's the thing how to approach Allelujah God when he sits in the holiest of holies so also Paul I believe when he wrote the book of Hebrews he said I know man I don't know if it is in the body or out of the body but he was you know he was talking to himself that he was caught up into the third heaven and I believe that God showed him what he saw in heaven is what Moses saw Hallelujah also in the vision and the same thing that God showed to John Hallelujah they saw the same things Moses Paul in in in in John in in the Book of Revelation now when Moses he he built that Tabernacle in the wilderness Allelujah and uh and how the people approach God Hallelujah when he was enthroned in the holiest of holies Hallelujah now they have uh there was uh there were three courts in it first is the outer Court and there the congregation they come under the blood Hallelujah because uh uh as Abraham said that God will not meet any worshiper except the blood Allelujah and then ah everybody was unclean Hallelujah but when a man is unclean unclean became unclean Hallelujah God had made a way for them to be clean Allelujah and no other than no other thing that could make them clean is through the waters of separation the Waters of Separation which is made out of a red Red River and they burned it and the ashes of it Allelujah is called the Waters of separation and when a man became unclean winner when a woman she delivered a child she became unclean and when a man touched a dead body she became unclean and could he could not enter into the congregation Hallelujah so there is a way of making him clean is by the sprinkling of the Waters of Separation then he can start Hallelujah to approach God halleluia in the outer court and no the red river which which was our sacrifice no other than the Lord Jesus Christ he was the word mid flesh and he was killed Hallelujah at Calvary he was the world Hallelujah and then in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 26 he says that that he might sanctify us see he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the world it is really the word that cleanses up cleanses us hallelujah and as we you know as I have said uh maybe if I have said it here that when we come to church it is not only to attend the service you know it is not only to fellowship with the brothers and sisters ah maybe the preacher is not a good preacher his English is you know you know but if it is the word of God Hallelujah when we are hearing the word we are God is really cleansing cleanses us Hallelujah it is a really cleanses at us hallelujah and in the outer God Hallelujah on the first court it is the place where the sinner comes and listen to the words to the word being preached Alleluia and that is the the first uh step to approach Hallelujah God and the first step is we have to come to God by faith and believing him and Faith cometh by hearing and hearing and hearing by the word of God hallelujah so in the outer Court there is the Brazil Altar and in there the sacrifices were offered Hallelujah and then from first uh chord and then the second is the holy place Hallelujah and in the Holy place not all the congregation become but only the priests Hallelujah and then on the third God is called the holiest of holies and in the holiest of holies there was the art of the Covenant and God dwells in there between the cherubim halleluia and God dwelt in that art of the kubinan or judgment said because when God is enthroned he is now judge mybraham said God when he is enthroned he is then a judge and because he is a judge when he is in drone there is no sinner could come in it is the art of the Covenant and it is the Judgment seat amen no sinner could come and stand before the Judgment seat of God but the problem brothers and sisters but the thing I mean is we are all sinners Hallelujah we are shaped in iniquity come to this world speaking lies and in sin did my mother conceive us by the sin of my mother and my father I am the product can you get a cleansing out of the unclean not one Hallelujah that's my brothers and sisters that even the high priest was a sinner Hallelujah if we read the Hebrews chapter 7 verse 27 when he go to offer Hallelujah before God to offer for the sin of the people first thing that he is go he that he does is Allelujah he says who need it not daily as those priests High priests to offer up sacrifices first for his own sins it means he himself is a sinner and then for the peoples Hallelujah for this did he uh he did once when he offered he of him of himself Hallelujah so even the high priest was a sinner Allelujah that's why brothers and sisters win when he entered Beyond behind the veil he is not even sure if he will die or will come up come back alive Hallelujah he is not sure no and if he will die God it means that God did not receive the offering of all the congregation of Israel he represents the people of Israel so because he is not sure that if he will if he will live or he will die then they put him up they tied him a rope on his leg so in case when he enter into the holiest of holies in case he dies then if the high priest died how much more the ordinary person amen that will get in to the holiest of holies to get the body and he will also die that's why they put a they tied a rope a rope in his leg and then we will just pull the Rope to get his body out of the holiest of holies Hallelujah but brothers and sisters thank be to God he had a remedy Hallelujah the Judgment said that nobody could stand if the high priest will just go there having blood having blood with him Hallelujah and then when he sprinkled that blood into the Judgment seat then it became a mercy seat amen Hallelujah you will find Mercy when you go there and you have you accepted you have the blood Hallelujah with you Hallelujah that judgment said will became will become a mercy seat for you that's why brothers and sisters the only thing that we can come before God is to accept the blood of Jesus Christ not only the blood of the animal but the blood of Jesus Christ we need to accept it Hallelujah we cannot stand without the blood of Jesus Christ and when God ah see the blood because God's uh law is the day you eat the day you die means the day you sin I will require the life amen and the Bible says that life is in the blood and when God when he see a blood it means there is a life that was being shed it means the penalty of death was had been paid amen amen hallelujah so once I in a year the high priest ah can go there once a year with blood Allelujah and he must have blood with him to sprinkle on the Judgment seat in order for it to be to become a mercy seat and not only blood but the high priest could not get in could not get into that place with his ordinary clothing Allelujah he needed to be dressed in a certain way a certain garment yeah that's right a garment that according to the design that God showed to them Hallelujah so brothers and sisters that's why maybe some of the newcomers you know the unbelievers are wondering why why these Believers are you know are are dressed like this Allelujah you know God he was the one God was the one who designed a dress for the believer Hallelujah you know brothers and sisters uh who are the who are the top fashion designer of the world most of them are perverted ones perverted people and where the anointing of these perverted people come amen Hallelujah and sometimes believers they get Envy to how that the world is dressed but thank be to God hallelujah we have a designer Hallelujah and without obeying the design of God for his people to be dressed you cannot come before his presence so the high priest in order for him to come in not only for him to have the blood but he needs us also to be dressed in a certain way Hallelujah to be dressed in a certain way and then in the hand of his dress Abyss garment their hungs a bell a pomegranate a bell a pomegranate Hallelujah and I believe that even if there are bells and pomegranate on the Hema business government if he will just walk an ordinary walk he's usually or walk it will not create a sound Hallelujah but when he maybe he his ordinary work his daily walk he is used to it but when he comes inside and stand Allelujah before the presence of God he must have to walk different a different work not this ah not uh not his ordinary work but a different book because the bells and pomegranate will will will create a sound it needs to Struck One each other and so that it will create a sound and will say and will cry holy holy holy unto the Lord Hallelujah it means brothers and sisters if you want to come before the presence of God and we believe brothers sisters that in the presence of God there is life Hallelujah outside the presence of God is death you remember brothers and sisters that was already dried a dried stick he had been maybe he had been using it for years and years and it's also already dried but when they put it in the presence of God in the ark of the kubernan it blossoms Hallelujah and even the the the Mana that will only last a day and if you will get Mana today you will pick those Mana today and then keep it until tomorrow one day Hallelujah there was an Israelite he kept from those Manas and when the look at it the next day it's already there were worms on it it will rock it will be spoiled Hallelujah but when they put this manner and they call it the hidden Manna when they put it inside in the presence of God in inside that box that ah Arc of the Covenant it was in the spoil for years and for years and four years why because in the presence of God there is life Hallelujah and brothers and sisters if you want Hallelujah do you have life Allelujah you need to come before his presence you need to come Hallelujah but you cannot come with your ordinary walk you cannot come with your you know with the with the dress we are dressing with the grace of the world Hallelujah you need to come according Hallelujah to his design Hallelujah and another thing brothers and sisters the high priest could not come unless he is Anointed with an anointing ointment or ointment I mean Hallelujah from The Rose of Sharon halleluia and who is the rose of Sharon no other than the Lord Jesus Christ he is the rose of Sharon in the Bible Hallelujah and in order for the rose of Sharon to be an anointing ointment to have the fragrance of it will the fragrance will be the fragrance of the high priest when he get in into the holiest of holies that Rose of Sharon must be crushed Hallelujah in order for the fragrance to come out and the fragrance Hallelujah will be the fragrance of the amen the high priest will smell Hallelujah Rose of Sharon because he will not he could not go inside and and he smelled you know like our human Hallelujah order Hallelujah and no other and Rose of Sharon is a beautiful flower halleluia he is it it was a beautiful flower it is a beautiful flower and there is no other Hallelujah the most beautiful life that was displayed here on Earth is the life of Jesus Christ and he was crossed at the cross of calvary and Barbara Braham said Hallelujah when they crossed Jesus Christ at Calvary they killed him they struck him on his side with that Roman spear and the blood came out and when the blood came out of him the life also came out with the blood Hallelujah and God set the body on the right hand of God but he sent Hallelujah that life into the 120 at the day on the day of Pentecost and Peter said Allelujah that this promise this is the promise Hallelujah this is what Joel had spoken this is what God had promised and This Promise is not only for us not only for you but to your children and your children Hallelujah as many as God will call Allelujah until this time that this fragrance that this kind of Life Alleluia is promised to them that believe if you only believe if you only receive Hallelujah that life Hallelujah and then you will be no longer the same Alleluia Paul said it is not me leave it Hallelujah I am crucified with Christ yet but I lived Hallelujah but it is no longer me that liveth but it is he who loved me and gave himself for me Hallelujah and the life which I'm not giving the flesh Live In the Flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who love me and give himself to me Hallelujah it means he is no longer he became the same if any man be in Christ he is a new creature all things are passed away and behold all things are become new why because it is now Christ in you the new person the new one and then if you have if your life is now smelling the Life of Christ then that's the only way that you can get in and stand before the presence of God and will not die Hallelujah so then from Dr dashikina Glory move into another Tabernacle which is which was the body of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so God who was sitting in his throne in that Tabernacle of Moses Hallelujah then he moved birbraham said he moved into another Tabernacle which was the body of Jesus Christ the Bible says in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 19 19 God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself Colossians 2 9 for all the fullness and the godhead bill is in him badly Hallelujah so done the seat of God Hallelujah is now in that body in that another Tabernacle but when Jesus died Hallelujah at the cross the temple the will of the temple was rent Hallelujah before it was only the high priest can get in but God he made a way Hallelujah it was the veil was rent not from the bottom to top but it was rent from top to bottom it means it was not the deed of a man it was God who did it Allelujah who made a way Hallelujah that it means not only the high priest now could come in but whosoever will Hallelujah and the priest he could only he was only the one who could have that anointing of the Shekinah Glory and walk a holy life she walked Hallelujah before the presence of God it Cries Holy Holy unto the Lord but this time when the veil was ran whosoever will could come in and walk a holy life and your life will cry out holy holy unto the Lord hallelujah now when Moses built that Tabernacle although inside there was a veil but it was built with the covering of an animal skin so imagine what maybe he was you know some people will have this question he he was he is God and why he did not belt with you know with the precious wood or pure gold but why did he animal skin because Paul said that everything in the Old Testament are shadows Hallelujah of the good things to come which was the Lord which is the Lord Jesus Christ it was it means the the Shekinah Glory covered with animal skin it only speaks that one day the Shekinah Glory of God will be covered with a human skin the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah Hebrews chapter 10 19-22 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus by a New and Living Way which he had consecrated for us through the veil that is to say his flesh Hallelujah and having an high priest over the house of God let us draw near with a True Heart in full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkled from an unable conscience and our bodies washed with pure water Hallelujah now that is to say his flesh it means literally the Valley of the temple was written and everybody can get in do whosoever will but what God is showing Hallelujah the real thing is the body of Jesus Christ was his place was the one was being rent Allelujah in order Hallelujah for the life for the throne that was in him Hallelujah so we can he says hallelujah let us come boldly boldness having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus Christ by renting the body of Jesus Christ and we have now the access to Fellowship Hallelujah into his presence amen hallelujah so in the oldest cement it was only the high priest couldn't tear into the holiest of holies Hallelujah but he must be you know he was the only one imagine brothers and sisters millions of them Israelites and only one who is maybe the world will say he was so lucky but we can say he was a blessed person because he he was the only one could come in and fellowship with the Shekinah Glory of God and even David one time I remembered he says he said one thing have I desire of the Lord that I seek after he was not a priest no he was not unhypressed that I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life Hallelujah to behold the beauty of the Lord that was his desire amen Imagine David he was you know longing he was Desiring to fellowship with that presence to behold the beauty of the Lord Hallelujah imagine brothers and sisters there was no electricity electricity there there was no ah lamb stand inside that and yet it was light there was light in it so what kind of light it was from the Shekinah the glory of the Lord and everybody was longing everybody was deciding Hallelujah to see but brothers and sisters God had made a wave for every one of us to come and to see that beauty that Shekinah Glory we were given the chance if you only Hallelujah one right to come before him and you know brothers and sisters the high priest he must be a special person but Jim brothers and sisters not every American was given a chance to be the president president of the United States right and maybe we are not longing for it because it is a position that you know for the world but the worldly people they are spending maybe millions in the Philippines spending billions of pesos in just in order you know for him to be just a mayor to be a mayor or to be a governor Hallelujah and now this is not only a president but to come before the presence of God he must be a special purple person that maybe all the people must invade oh how lucky he is how blessed he is my brothers and sisters I tell you this evening that how blessed we are that God made a way for every one of us to come before his presence the fellowship with the Shekinah Glory all right but sometimes the problem is instead of the worldly people the people of the world get Envy on us sometimes Christians especially young people they get Envy with the world how they walk how they do how they talk how you know how they dress no brothers and sisters We Are The Most Blessed people and should not invade with the world Amen they must be the one to invade Hallelujah on us Hallelujah in our behavior in our daily work Hallelujah will always cry unto the Lord holy holy holy and to the Lord Hallelujah and our Behavior will smell Hallelujah Jesus Christ will smell the odor must must be smelled Allelujah will you know I don't know how to say it they say I don't know what's the exact word Hallelujah now then the Shekinah Glory rest from that Mercy Seat versus it one day and settled into another Tabernacle which is the body of Jesus Christ and then that body of Jesus Christ Hallelujah were the Shekinah Glory of God settled it becomes supposedly it becomes the Judgment seat in his son Alleluia John Chapter 5 Verse 22 it says for The Father judges Newman but had committed all judgment unto the son so now it is not the father that will be do the judging but he committed all the Judgment all judgment into the son he became now the Judgment seat but the thing is the reason Jesus could not judge anyone Hallelujah at the time because the Judgment said the Throne of God was inside of him but the thing is the Judgment said was loved with the blood Hallelujah he was the blood of God created in the womb of Mary Hallelujah that's why the judgments it became amen amen hallelujah all the people did Evil things unto him persecuted him killed him but only saying that he that without his father forgive them for they know not what they do it became Mercy instead of judgment but God he speaks on another mercy seat or another judgment said another Tabernacle coming in Matthew chapter 12 verse 32 he says and whosoever is speaketh a word against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever whoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost it shall not be for before his word neither in the world to come what is the Holy Ghost Hallelujah it is not a different person Hallelujah because if the Holy Ghost is different from the father and the Bible said in Matthew chapter 1 verse 8 and that when the angel spoke to Joseph in a dream he says that she was found a child with the Holy Ghost it means the father of the child is the Holy Ghost amen and then Jesus said he got the father so if the father and the Holy Ghost are too different person then Jesus had two fathers and Barbarian said that then we have a an illegitimate savior but the Holy Ghost is God himself but what is the Holy Ghost yes it is the spirit of God in the Believers when the spirit of God come into the Believers it's called the Holy Ghost Hallelujah what is the Holy Ghost uh in the in the message what is the Holy Ghost who is Barbara and said who is that Spirit then what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ in your the comforter that's the Holy Spirit another quotation what is the Holy Ghost uh Mrs what is the Holy Ghost nah what was the Holy Ghost given for he says what is the Holy Ghost God in you amen God in you Hallelujah so from the Tabernacle in Moses he moved into one body and then from that one body he moved into many member body into the Believers and it is called the Holy Ghost Mary's belief he says but when he was but then he was is in one person Hallelujah all that God was battled up into one man Jesus Christ but in this time he's Across the Universe in his church doing more of it the same works so it was from Tabernacle he moved into another Tabernacle and then he moved into another Tabernacle and Paul said knowing at that year the temple of God and that the spirit of God dwelleth in you and then he says if then Paul said If any man destroyed that Temple he got to answer God that's why ah Jesus said whosoever is speaking award against the son of man it shall be forgiven him but whosoever speak it against the Holy Ghost where the Holy Ghost is in The Believer whosoever speaketh Hallelujah to the Believers it shall not be forgiven him neither in this world neither in the world to come that's oh Hallelujah and sometimes you know people it it is easy for them to say bad words against the Believers Hallelujah say evil Things No Evil things but they don't realize brother what they are doing maybe you cannot we cannot judge them now why because we have that same spirit Hallelujah that was in Christ so I one one time in Birmingham he said when when you open the the fifth seal and then the Bible says that this Souls under the altar and then said who are they Hallelujah he said that they are Jews because Lord how long will you avenge how long will you you know will you judge them everyone said they are not Christians no because if they were Christians they have the spirit of Christ and if we have the spirit of Christ what Christ did they will also know hallelujah what Christ did they said that he did not say against them he said father forgive them but brothers and sisters what they did to us God will never forget it what the people did to a believer who is the temple Allelujah God will not forget it you know one one time it says in the Bible that even if you will give a glass of water Hallelujah God will into a believer in the name Hallelujah of Jesus Christ it will not be for forgotten there is a reward Hallelujah but when you do something to believer maybe the believer will not you know judge you at this time but there is someone halleluia who will not forget it if you speak against the son of man it will be forgiven but when you speak against the Holy Ghost it will not be forgiven even this world or in the world to come that's why brothers and sisters we should know hallelujah how to treat each other even your Believers you know you should have respect each other especially to the Hallelujah especially to the to the ministers I'm not seeing this because I am a minister but you have to respect Hallelujah the Elders of this church of this church Hallelujah Barbara I'm sitting as we sin them now that was God's throne in heaven Moses spotted it on Earth was God strong because his judgment seat was present represented here on Earth in the holy of holy all Israel come to that one place to find Mercy because God only met under the shed blood now listen close then the Shekinah Glory raised from that Mercy Seat one day and it settled on another Tabernacle amen this one The Father judges new man but he's committed all judgment to the son God's judgment seat Hallelujah you speak against me it will be forgiven you speak another one another another one coming another Mercy Seat you speak against the son of man I will forgive you but someday the holy spirit will come to dwell in the hearts of the people one word against it will never be forgiven so as I have said what is the Holy Ghost it is the holy spirit that dwell that will come to dwell in the human heart Hallelujah of his people one word against it will never be forgiven Hallelujah now another quotation it keeps getting more severe and more severe all the time the judgment caused God's continually wearing his patients out trying to get Sinners to come to him to be reconciled first he was in the heavens above and shining in the stars the second he was on Earth shining through the Shekinah Glory next he come and was made flesh and dwelt Among Us still wearing his patience then he redeemed Man by his blood came into his church in the form of the Holy Ghost and speak against that it's a finished thing done now you can see where the shaking come we are at the time didn't realize people can't comprehend what it means and he says and when you walk through that when he goes into the heart and there's where his his throne does the Holy Spirit In You Jesus said it will be better if far better that a millstone was hung at your neck and you was drawn in the depths of the sea done to even offend one of these little ones that believe in me not do them any harm just even to bring offense to them oh brother sisters how how dangerous Hallelujah just to bring an offense to them just upset them about something and be better that you had your own self drawn or had never been born on the Earth than even to bring an offense to one did he mean it could he lie did Apostles say it no it was not the teaching of the apostle Hallelujah no Jesus said it Jesus himself said it Jesus said if you even bring an offense to one of them these little ones had that believe in me so Hallelujah and then I believe brothers and sisters that every one of us especially we the Believers the message believers Hallelujah and everybody says that uh we claim this that I am the dwelling place of God I am one of that Hallelujah Tabernacle I have the Holy Ghost but remember that wherever the Throne of God is it becomes a judgment seat either it was on in heaven it was in the Tabernacle it was in Jesus it was in the Believers but once God sits in that room he is judge last quotation that I'm going to read he says you say I can tell dirty jokes I don't it don't condemn me why the end got nothing it can condemn no one's there to take it out no no one's there to condemn you well I tell you the woman say I can have short hair it don't condemn me no wonder see oh I can worship I can do this the man said it don't hurt me to smoke cigars and it don't hurt me to play some cards and shoot some dice and whatever they do it don't hurt me and this still belong to the church see don't hurt me to do this why there's nothing there to judge you but when Christ comes in you've created an altar on your heart and your sins are taken daily the great Saint Paul he said I Die daily nevertheless I live but not me leave Christ live in me there's the inner will brothers and sisters because that's why John said Apostle John said that we in your heart condemns you it means there is something that judges you Hallelujah when Christ is really in your heart and he is sitting there as a judge every time you do this and it is not halleluia pleasing before God then God will judge you and then that's why oh Lord forgive me I Repent Lord because why because there is someone that judging you but you know if you only if there is something if there is nobody no one judging you when you are doing wrong it means there is no judge sitting in there but brothers and sisters all I can say is what I can say is God had already opened he rented the bill Hallelujah he already had rent The Bell the bill will have the desire to come in and fellowship with him whosoever will God will grant your desire if you're really sincere to invite Jesus Christ to come in Lord Hallelujah come into my heart you know because God he is a gentle God he will not interfere in one's life unless you permit him to come that's why he can do you know he can control everybody but the Bible says that that's why the Bible says he is knocking Hallelujah and if you will just open your heart and you are sincere Lord please come in and let my heart be yours from Hallelujah and he will come in Hallelujah so I believe I hope this this message this is just a short message and I hope this uh will be a blessing to everyone and uh as I have always say said that if I did say anything that is not what your Minister sir are saying then just forget it just get those things that uh become a blessing to you so please uh pray for us and by the way I maybe I forgot to say thank you very much for helping us this to purchase the ban at
