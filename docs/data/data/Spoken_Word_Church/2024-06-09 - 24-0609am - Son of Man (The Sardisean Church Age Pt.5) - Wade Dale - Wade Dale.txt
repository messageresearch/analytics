Donnie sister Susan just keep them in prayer and um had a special request this morning uh unspoken just remember a situation that's coming up with somebody else um we hadn't seen in a long time but uh thank you again for the last weekend that was wonderful like I said if you didn't wasn't here Wednesday night or didn't hear the service that's the kind of preaching I like that's the kind of preaching that that I grew up with I grew up with Brother Richard and brother Dale and brother Woodby and brother Mo the different ones preaching the meat of the message we need to know it because if it's on tape we're required to know it all right and um if you didn't understand it then just pray if you got the Holy Ghost heal bring it he said he bring it to your remembrance and tell you things to come so just remember that God's not going to leave you behind amen so let's bow our heads just for a moment dear heavenly father thank you for this day you give us thank you for the word we're about to read Lord and give us strength Lord give us as the prophet said give us Supernatural utterance that we can speak the word of God and get oursel out of out of the way Lord so that you can speak to the people father forgive us of our sins be with the ones that are sick the ones that will be on the highways coming back brother Louis and brother Bob Lord I pray that you'd bless them Father just bless each one Lord that's listening in watching in father I pray that you touch them Lord just be with us now in the further on this service in Jesus name amen now for those of you that haven't been here in a while or been here we're on a um series that called the son of man which has been about a year or so ago but we're in the sardian church age we're going to talk about that but we're going to back up just a little bit so let's read Revelations 1:10 can everybody see that okay I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice as of a trumpet now this is John now remember as we get through going through this I was thinking about this the other day John was required to write what he saw not give a revelation all right John wasn't preaching he was he was he said write these things that you see and send them to the churches all right but it took a prophet in the end time to get the Revelation that John didn't get and then bring it to us that's the Love Letter that's the in between saying I am Alpha and Omega because see the alpha he was in the alpha church but the Omega Church hadn't come yet that's us that's right all right I am the Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou seest write in the book send it to the seven churches which are in Asia Ephesus Smyrna pergamus thara Sardis Philadelphia and today and L out of and I turned to see The Voice he turned to see a voice that spake with him cuz he was familiar with that voice and when he turned he was a little bit surprised he saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one liken to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and G about the paps with a golden girdle you may be seated the Lord has his Blessing to the reading of the word now we get started in this church age but as we were talking as Brother Richard was was ministering last week you look and see that this messenger of Malachi 4 he was to bring some things that people not heard before things like Thunders things like the opening of the seals uh things like the cloud and things like the supernatural picture over his head there were some things that they had not had back in that in those ages now we see no see now though that back then Paul irenius and Martin different ones but we come up now to we what we call is almost the modern age is we come into Martin Luther where there's going to be printing presses there's going to be um there's going to be Transportation that's a a little bit faster than it had been before all right so listen as man developed God developed God develops first all right develops it to you now not God it's the expanding of God to us not to him he knows who he is he knows how he he knows he don't have a limit but we have a limit all right and we're limited by what by our brain human brain all right everybody with me so we're going to read now Revelations 3 this is a sardian church age this will be Church age number five and we're going to see some of the characteristics about this church age but we'll back up just a minute for the new ones that are here and unto the angel of the church in Sardis now there's an angel there's a messenger God's got him in his hand he says right here he says these things sayith he that hath the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars which is what the seven Church age Messengers I Know Thy works that thou has has a name that thou livest and are dead we'll get to that in just a minute you got a name you're living by it but you're dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God now this is God this is God telling John write this down and we're going to deliver it to this sardian church age okay remember therefore how thou Hast received and heard and hold fast and repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch I will come on thee as a thief and thou shalt not know what hour I will come upon thee it's getting that hour folks remember he's going to come as a thief in a night he's going to come and get his own and get us out of here and the world is not going to know it except all hell's going to break loose all right thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments there was all always a bride in every Church age and we're going to talk about this a little bit where that that you see that this was called an unfulfilled age when I don't just remember one thing it wasn't the Holy Ghost was UN unfulfilled the people were unfulfilled because you can only work the Holy Ghost can only work as you let him everybody with me that's where you can't understand you think God's all powerful God's all this God God is but thank God for a prophet that told us one day he said the Holy Ghost is very timid come on what it's a spirit and he's not going to force anything on you to give you your free will and then he will what he will work as you work all right is everybody with me thou Hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white now look they shall walk with me in white that means they got the Holy Ghost if you are if anything says in the Bible about white robes pure and white without spot or wrinkle you got the holy ghost in your soul there by with all right cuz you're as perfect as God is as Brother Richard said you have already your Soul's already crossed over that Chasm and you spiritually are in Eden sometimes we need to just let that thing out what we do is we bind it so much by our own ideas by our own thoughts I don't like this one I don't like that one this one didn't look at me this one didn't somebody cut me off on the highway have I hit anybody yet I hope nobody H you thou Hast a few names which have not defiled their garment thank God in this evil age this Dark Age he's got a same group of people yes sir that is taken on his name they are worthy and we're to finish this thing up he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white rment and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father before his angels he that hath a near let him hear what what the spirit said not what man said what the spirit said to the churches all right now the church age we're in now I tried to make that thing a little smaller but I didn't but anyway we're in that church age where it says Martin Luther the sardian church age lasted from 1520 to 1750 and we're coming into a time to where intelligence of man I read you Wednesday night the the many things that between Luther and Wesley's age the pocket watch was invented the water wheel the knitting machine microscope thermometer telescope submarine steam turbine adding machine pressure cooker piano steam engines lightning rods we know Ben Franklin did that for us dictionary steam ships bifocal glasses also Uncle Ben did the same thing for us he give us bifocal lenses Ben Benjamin Franklin parachute bicycle gas lights cotton genin small poox vaccine and even batteries number one was the pr and press the prin and press is what changed the world cuz you could put it in print and you could hand it out and then they can make copies and hand it out and you could read what somebody says instead of going well I think he really meant this over here and you made your own interpretation out of it but you could put it in print the Bible was put in print actually Martin Luther helped get it from Latin to German and compile the books together so everything in this church age is about intelligence yes all right we'll get to that later on not to not this morning but intelligence of man there is not a problem with the intelligence listen how'd y'all get here today just Diane you get your horse good okay your horse is good yall got it out there on the pastor eating you ready to go back it'll take you about two and a half months to get back to Tennessee where you live but you'll make it you'll be you'll be no she got in a car got down here about five or six hours that's how advanced but it started it had to start somewhere well let me tell you in the spiritual also God starts you really slow God starts you as a baby he gives you milk you take milk and then you go on to meet and then you go on to eat whatever you want to and maybe sometimes our problem but that's the fifth Church age and we know that it's the man anointing according to Ezekiel so the th Church Church age it was an ox age we already been now the first three Ages was the lion the second was the ox which is what works Ox take an ox outside he'll work himself to death all right so that's the same now listen you and I got to have that same those Spirits don't die I said the other day that the demon Spirits don't die they just migrate to another place guess what the Holy Ghost don't die either he takes and he goes from one place to another he goes from one Church age to the other and he works upon what God said because you're going to look at this you're going to see Martin Luther in a few minutes you're going to think how in the world is this guy Church a messenger he did a lot of junk but brother brandham said God was pleased with Martin Luther we look at it different Martin Luther did what God said maybe sometimes if we'll just do what God said come on and not what man said or what you thought you ought to do amen but we know every one of them every Church age had a dominating female involved in Ephesus it was Diana they worshiped Diana in thara they worship a prophetess who sat on a three-legged stool right father son Holy Ghost baptism in this church age her name was sael it was always a woman but this became a woman with a child and then as we read the other day then you see that the child goes away and now it's only Mary worship just like the mariology of in the Catholic church but in our age everything comes together and God calls it the great and her daughters yes all right plain but that's what God said I didn't have to interpret it it's in the Bible all right so Revelation 17:1 says There came one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vows now remember this is the seven vows so what's happened is we've already left the Earth the vows don't pour out till we're gone the vows is what judgement all right so we're gone and this is what this Angel is saying unto me John come hither I will show thee unto thee the Judgment of the great that sth upon many waters are many people we know that half this world is dominated by the Catholic Church which would be about 4 and a half billion people are Catholics wow with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication they took her Doctrine so he carried me away in the spirit to the Wilderness I saw a woman sitting on a Scarlet there a woman the church sitting on a Scarlet colored Beast what a power something to ride on full of names of blasphemy we know what those are having seven heads and 10 horns that's the kingdoms in the ages and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls having a golden cup in her hand what full of Abominations this is not the church the bride the bride's gone this is not even the foolish virgin they're not part of this right here now they may part of the system but they're not part of this right here because a golden cup in their hand full of Abominations and filthiness of her fornication and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of Harlot so she was a great and she had Harlot children and Abominations of the earth and I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the Saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus we just got through with the th tyan Church AE and when I saw her I wondered with great admiration in other words John admired this thing this thing she was so beautiful John gets caught up in it and the angel had to say hey John hold on buddy I'm going to show you why do you Marvel wherefore Dost thou Marvel I will tell thee The Mystery of the woman of the Beast that carrieth her which ha the seven heads and 10 horns the Beast thou sawest was and is not what one Pope dies one Pope comes back one Pope dies one Pope comes back everybody with me and shall Ascend out of the bottomless pit and go into predition and they that dwell on the Earth shall wonder whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world when they beheld the Beast that was and is not and yet is that's what we're coming to now the Bible says in Timothy but she that liveth in pleasure is dead amen dead while she liveth today if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in your soul soul today you are dead you are a walking dead person talk about Walking Dead on the movies out there that's what you are you're walking dead all right so let's get some life in us get the Holy Ghost get the get the new birth have some life is as brother um Ryan was saying let's get some passion listen we can get some passion about anything we're passionate people God made us this way amen come on God made us to love God made us to love him though and be passionate about his word and like brother Ryan said be passionate about the things that go with it like studying reading coming to church being a Christian amen be that straight stick in front of that crooked one but if you're not born again you're dead I don't care if you've had signs wonders it doesn't matter to God Satan can do all that but Satan can't get born again Satan cannot have come on somebody Satan can't have passion for the word of God he has a passion for perverting the word of God so anytime you see that perversion H it's the devil pretty plain but let's have a passion for God and if we keep oursel in the word of God then God will what fulfill that passion listen as this age we're fixing to talk about is an unfulfilled age let's make this age a very fulfilled age and it's up to me and you to do that have a passion of what you're doing read your Bible with passion come to church with passion try smiling sometime some of you crack your face and we pray for the sick so now let's look here real quick what happened in these Church ages is there was a Ministry Loos in every Church age because I read you everyone Ephesus smus pergamus he came to one man and one man brought a message all right is everybody with me one man Paul arenius Martin Columba Luther Wesley and brother brand everybody with me here all right a specific message for a specific time to a specific people cuz you can you're going to sit here today and you're going to look at your church age messenger that we looked at brother Brandon but you're going to look at Luther's Church age and you're going to say wow he was pretty he was pretty awful sometimes but God was pleased with that time don't you remember when you were a Christian we come up just like how God develops the church ages we come up the same way don't you remember when you first became a Christian that you made so many mistakes you stayed on your knees God forgive me for this forgive me for this for me cuz those old demons they don't leave they just still trying to pack yourself in but there's a seal praise God there's a seal that Satan can't get in and God can't get out but you and I have come to that but we do stumble we do make mistakes we take a baby we put her there put the baby up against the wall and the baby starts to walk when the baby falls you don't just start beating it do you well thank God God doesn't start beating us either but he does expect when we get about if we're 16 and 17 and we can can't can't walk am I getting to somebody God ought us whip us so the opening of the first two seals now what is a seal we're going to try to make this simple as we get into the layout of see in church age but remember a seal is seals something in or out but there's something written on this paper all right there's something written and it's important if I don't have these notes I'll stop but you see that what's on the outside Brother D you can't see see that can you can you see anything all that all you see is lines but something inside there is sealed up God sealed it up and Only God Can unseal it all right so we're going to see in Revelation 61 and I saw when the lamb as Brother Richard was talking about the lamb opens the seal Christ is the only one that can open it all right because he is the seal all right so when he opens it guess what boom now you can read what's on the inside of it so that's what God did he sealed it up because of Daniel 12 he said Daniel seal up these things until what the time of the end that's right so they were sealed up because God said to seal them up yes sir but there would come a prophet in the end time that could stand there and say here stands a lamb with a book and there goes a white horse rider he has come to a place to where God was using him so much swallow do you couldn't tell the difference but what did these do what did it do it loosed a Ministry at loose so that something can be said yes sir we've read the Bible for years and years and years and years and for those of us that were trinitarians we read it as a trinitarian Bible exactly but the seal wasn't really tore off of it we were just reading words on a on a page yes sir but these these animals these four beasts are the lion at first reading Ezekiel you see it's a face of a man face of an ox face of a lion face of an eagle everybody with me all right so we're in the Bible but it's come to the age where we can understand that all right so Revelation 6 verse one said when I saw and I saw now that's John when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast lion the lion said come and see and I Behold a white horse he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer now we know for a fact that who that was that was the Antichrist starting in the first church age under the opice of a white righteous Church seeming white there was a white righteous Church Paul irenius and Martin they they develop or brought that group together called The Bride but then Satan he gets on his horse or what gets on his power and he starts riding but remember at the first church age he doesn't have a lot of power because there's more power in the lion l in the lion which is bold that's Paul arenus Martin the different ones they didn't have to muddle through denominations they didn't have to they didn't have a big Catholic Church over their head it was coming yes it was coming in very in very small amounts but it had not come to his Apex or come to his head all right and he got on his horse and he had a bow oh it look like See's a bluff he looked like he was strong but he had nothing same way today and a crown was given he didn't even have a crown itself Crown who crowned him the people the people crowned him it's our situation God's give us we're going to Crown Him king of kings and Lord of lords is that not what the Bible says we're going to Crown Him amen and we're going to get crowned and he went forth conquering and to conquer so the first three AG Three Ages Satan bluffed his way into the true white righteous church and God allowed that to happen because we're going to read the scripture this afternoon where God promised that the corn of wheat had to go in the ground all right if this is not exciting y'all y'all need to wake up and um we'll find something else to do okay this is what we're doing Revelation 6 now verse three and when he had opened the second seal now what was the second beast it was an ox what we've been talking about in the Thon Church age or the work the work horse or the work Ox this was the ox age and John saw this beast and that Beast said hey come and see what's behind this seal all right and then went out another horse all right now look Satan got off of one and got on another one but that white that White Horse He said kept running running cuz that power of that white righteous church just kept going cuz remember it's going to it's going to uh culminate in the world Council of churches cuz it looks good it looks righteous looks looks can be deceiving somebody ought to somebody ought to make that a quote and they went on another horse that was red now he gets on another horse this horse is a different color cuz this horse has a different the the messenger setting on the horse which is Satan he has he's getting ready to loose another Ministry or one that's a little bit higher than the one he had because the one he had didn't have a lot of power he had a bow and no arrows that's right but now we come up to this church age now what what happened power was given unto him that set their own to take peace from the earth and they should kill one another and there was given to him a sword ah he's got a sword or a word that he can cut the people with absolutely I like the one that says sharp two-edged sword that cuts me but there was one that came in this church age which is the fourth Church age which is th tying Church age he was given a sword or a word so then we go to the nasan council we have all different councils and they all come together and they they they you know they come out with a trinitarian Doctrine they came out with a name that you called but you're they come out with all these different things all these different uh denominations are fixing the head up we'll read about that in a little while because remember everything has a beginning everything is a seed all right that seed has to grow the the denominational seed started growing in the first church age but it was so small nobody worried about it at the time everybody with me but now we come up to Columbus age and we come up to where that that that the Roman Catholic Church is fixing to start dominating they're fixing to put what they put church and state Church wasn't very it church was weak but when Constantine give him give them an army do you know the Vatican has their own Army and it's huge people just don't know about it and they're everywhere but Vatican has their own Army and their own protection of of the Vatican their own self but let's look here just a second there was given him a word a great sword and that was the red horse rider or the second horse and what went out to combat it an ox of work labor keep going God said keep going keep going now let's go to the second seal this brother R preached in 1963 when the slain risen lamb opened it and the second calf life like Beast said come and see what the seal mystery is now we get to it the lamb you remember has to open every seal so if you don't understand anything understand this Christ was there that week with brother brandham opening those seals sir all right he was the one brother brand got out of the way so much he said I've never worked in Realms like this before read the seal book he was just AED at the things that that he didn't see until Christ came on the scene and said hey this this this this and that's the Perfection of the word of God only Jesus Christ can keep it together that's why if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're not going to understand a word we're saying oh yeah maybe you know get saved and baptized and and the second beast if you notice in the routine of where we just went through the church ages the first was a lion as we said before the next was a was a calf or ox or something you see and this Beast said come and see now when the lamb opened the seal and then John went to see now remember John toed the bride I'm telling you today come and see if you're bride you will be able to see it you will hear the call listen folks that's the Thunder the Thunder is the voice of God when the seal breaks to you when you realize who you are what you're doing here why you're here what stage you're at where you need to be you're God L by then you're not demon POS look at where we're at folks if you'll just listen don't worry about seals and Thunders yeah you need to worry about but just it's simply brother Brown said it was a life lived is the greatest Thunder that's the devil the devil can't stand that so John tying the bride the the the ox said hey John come see I want you to see what's going on well that's God calling us hey hey hey I want you to see I want you to see this deceiver yes and what he's doing to the world and then I'm going to read in just a little while he turns around and says come out of that my people have you come out of it that's my question to all of us have we come out of this thing as Brother Richard said out of the true church they'll come a bride the two seeds in the framework of this church if that's deceiving you you're already deceived and you're done cuz when we get to that third poll and we talk about brother Brown had the three polls we're talking about the second poll now brother Richard said but the third poll is here speaking to people that are totally lost I hate that but that's what he said so when he walked in what happened let's let's see what he found come see there's a mystery sealed up here that's been here now for 2,000 years about now we see what it is now we find here that we saw a red horse go forward I continue reading now they should kill one another they should kill each other his bow had no arrows at first remember in the first three Church AG his bow had no arrows he was a bluff he bluffed his way through the whole thing but his sword did he done his killing later and changed from a white horse to a red horse the same exact Devil with his sword what Jesus say Jesus said they that take the sword will perish by it he said don't fight talking about Peter Jesus that night when Peter cut that guy's ear off he said Peter put your sword up we're not fighting with that kind of Sword no more but Peter on the day of Pentecost he stood up with the sword of God yes he had the Holy Ghost then he put that sword out and he said oh my you've killed Jesus Christ and they said men and Brethren what can we do and he said repent and be baptized what they were pricked that passion came out in their heart now remember he's got a sword he's going for a sword in his hand riding a red horse waiting through the blood of everybody that disagrees with him now do you understand it how many understand what that seal is now what is it it's that middle Church age it's that th tyan Church age that where they killed 68 million Christians put them in the ground and as Josh looked up for him one more time that was the whole state of California and Texas the two biggest states one of the two biggest states in the United States wiped every person out this those two states that's how much the Roman Catholic kill people 68 million people that would be all of California all of Texas do away with every person in it right now and that's how many they killed in 900 years and they were Christians all right this writer and all his kingdom subjects that are slain down Through the Ages that draw all this Blood of the martyrs of the Saints will be slain By The Sword of Jesus Christ when he comes that's where the bows are going to be poured out out they took the sword of dogma and Antichrist and cut down the real true worshippers all down Through the Ages by the millions and when Christ comes with a sword which is the word he will slay every enemy there is before him but now who is that and where is he Christ is here and this is the sword he's going to use why we looking for something else you think he's going to stand on the Mount of Olives with this great big sword and just go right on through no he's doing it now yes sir he's going to do it through two prophets he's going to do it through the word of God that's his sword he doesn't need a sword like this his sword is the word of God you might have killed 68 million of them down through these ages maybe more but Jesus said he that takes the sword will perish by it watch as the imposters against the word of God and because they didn't agree and this thing Satan placed United the political power which is Constantine iCal power which he held and the spiritual power which he held put them both together and made a church that sweeps into every nation he's put Millions times Millions after he jumped off his white horse on Red he took his sword and went forth but God said with the same thing that he perverted the false teaching that same word will rise in power I say it's rising now it's cutting it's pulling it's pushing we're going to get out of here but we're not going to get out of here with all this Dogma we're not get out here with all his baggage hanging on y'all get happy if you want to but I'll just get happy right here cuz I'm happy to be a part of it I'm happy to be able to see that Satan's got a store that Satan is out there he's out there I say he's out there he's right here cuz look coming from the lips of Jesus Christ and it shall slay him and everything before him amen there's your second seal now let's go to the third seal now what was he given them first he was given to B but he didn't have an arrow now he's got a mighty sword in his hand he can do something now he jumps off his White Horse white horse rides on remember the right White Horse keeps going that power keeps going on now straddles a what a red horse blood blood red horse he really rides that one oh sure CU remember that's the longest Church age 900 years he's given great power and a great sword to kill then he rides his blood red horse why listen I want ask you a question why' God allow this to happen you ever ask yourself a question God why we why you have you ever asked God why you got to go through what you're going through oh those of you that are all sainted and don't ever question God we we'll have second service for y'all to be in the altar before we take communion cuz you're lying well hello somebody listen we all got we all question we question things but once we get to the part where we we say but Lord as brother Lis was preaching but God but God steps on the scene I promise you if you're his child he'll tell you why you going through that he'll tell you why and he'll show you why it will Define you it will not destroy you if you're a real true Christian he takes peace from the earth and killed one another in his own modology of Roman Catholic said they put 68 million Protestants to death from the time of St atin of Hippo until 1580 68 million and it's recorded So I mean it's not hearsay now remember he gets his power because he becomes the viker of heaven and worshiped his God ruler of the Earth by uniting the church and state Together made him ruler on Earth give him a crown over that he could pray the souls out of purgatory he could also in other words intercede he was just like God on Earth instead of God you see how perverted that is because you know what you and I are the same thing but we are God we are representatives of God if you have the new birth listen the pope didn't have the new birth all right you've got the new birth you listen you and I today we have the power that Satan's looking for come on somebody we have the power that Satan's looking for he's want to do it with this do it with political he's trying to get so big he can whip God hello yes sir he's trying to get so big put I he's got the world he's got 99% of the people in the world but he's after us why because we won't take his garbage I hope you don't take his garbage the church can't say nothing he's head of IT State can't say nothing he's head of that so they died by the millions all the little churches brother was busted up killed murdered fed the Lions and everything else the dragon Rome gave him his seat and Authority the Bible said so so he rode his typed red horse through human blood till it became a red horse with blood Matthew 6 ver 23 but if thine eye be evil thy whole body shall be full of Darkness if therefore the light that is in thee be Darkness how great is that Darkness listen the Roman Catholic Church they thought they were it Satan's got them so so confused remember what God told us I I in Timothy or somewhere he says he says I'm going to let him believe this lie I'm going to let them believe it and be damned by it but they're going to think it's you you don't think the Catholic church is going to try to take over the world just so that they can all fall apart no they want all the gold they want your mind they want your kids they want your right right they want all that cuz they think what they have is light yeah yeah but Satan's got him so deceived I want to ask you a question are we so deceived that the thing we think is light is actually killing us if you don't get a true revelation of this message not this church not spoken word church this church The Message Church the Believers the bride amen if you don't get a true Revelation that you are in darkness come on what do you think about those people like Tim Humes I'll call his name because you see how much damage he's done he thought he had light now he says that that wasn't light that light is over here we should get away from the prophet light's over here denounced everything in the message well that light that he thinks he has is Darkness it's going to kill him physically and spiritually maybe but definitely spiritually so now it's getting a sardian church age just for a few minutes now look what God said he said I Know Thy Works thou has a name that thou livest and art dead remember the first three Church ages the baptism was name in the Lord Jesus Christ the correct name we were bride we knew who the Lord Jesus was he was one God he wasn't three he didn't have three personalities he didn't come different from God he was God all rightall but this group of people had a different idea they took the name out and put father son Holy Ghost they took the name out and put Pope in they took the name out and put Cardinals and Bishops and all that I Know Thy Works thou has a name thou livest and you're dead Be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy Works see he's fixing to rebuke the ones even that have light he said I have not found thy works perfect before God you have a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled their garments and they shall walk with me in white for they're worthy so the combat Beast as we were seeing before brother Brown told us now that there was a lion in the first three ages there was an ox in that middle age where it says Columba right there get up here a little bit higher we can see it right and then now we're into the third creature which is the man which is intelligence all right we'll read what brother R said about that maybe this afternoon the intelligence of man is always contrary to the intelligence of God that's right okay you see that word knowledge right there that word knowledge is God knowledge that's not knowledge that you can add and subtract and tell who so and so is no that's Holy Ghost knowledge brother R said to know what's right and wrong to know what to believe and not to believe all right cuz remember if you're not sealed you're going to be deceived you're going to be deceived if you're not sealed if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're already deceived but come out of her my people come out of that deception amen that's why brother R said the the the most important thing for us to do is get the new birth know we got the new birth not just a feeling not just an emotion that's Satan Satan can pass out well I spoke in tongu well so did Satan you remember the people says have I not healed the sick have I not raised the dead have I not preached your in your name and Jesus said what depart from me you never had a birth you never were part of my family you were part of a family but you were so deceived that light inside of you is Darkness if you don't see the True Light that's why it's important to see truth it's important to see truth and know that what the why are we bound why are we bound Jesus said said You shall know the truth and the truth shall set you free let's go back to the truth part amen what's your passion like brother Ryan said what you what you passionate about what does your conscience feed on what are you feeding on come on somebody get quiet now that's okay but this church age lasted from 1520 to 1750 and like I said before I read to you all the things that came uh the the nation of of America was was getting ready to be formed uh it had already been established so America uh 1776 is when we got our independence so it's coming into the age of Wesley but that all Luther and Wesley Luther was a German so it was over there remember brother R said it was there went across the over the canal to Wesley which was Englishman and then it comes over here remember Wesley actually came over here to Georgia actually so let's look at it real quick what we were talking about the other day about six weeks or so ago what does a messenger do when that messenger comes on the scene Luther come on the saying he condemned all that that was back this way that had turned away from God all right then what did he do he rebukes the previous age like I said and then he what he brings a message like I said there's something loosed in Luther's message there was a message that was loosed there had never been seen before now it had been seen back here but it had been so eroded it had been so much believe the Catholic Church believe in Works believe in penants yes but when he come out he he he looked at the Bible and he one the Bible wasn't written he just brought the manuscripts together and he looked he said the just shall live by faith what a message now remember that word Sardis means Escape ones the religion was the mother and son worship which is SA and de us at first but remember brother R said look all these characteristics he was up here and she was like right here but when we come to the End of the Age it shifts like I said about that book I was telling you to read about the 50 years in the Catholic Church they start out they put a kid they they have that's why they bring kids into monasteries of course they do some awful things to them you know that but they bring the kids in to teach them the Catholic way and then they he said they sat down with me I was 7 years old the guy that wrote this book he said the priest sat down with me and said who' youd rather talk to your mama or your daddy oh my mama cuz my daddy's me oh when you need something who do you go to I go to Mama Daddy's me uh who you need to talk about this now I go to Mama I go to Mama I go to Mama so then he starts saying well Mary Mary's the you need to pray to because Jesus is mean you see how that just develops so much just like us or what who are you more comfortable that's what who are you more comfortable with your mother or your father well I'm more comfortable with my mother cuz my dad he's mean sometimes you know or he whips me a little bit harder than Mama does and Mama when you get sick who do you go to you see how that is now listen that sounds pretty good but but if you're sick who do you oh mama just rocks me and cra me you know kid 7 years old but he's writing it now at 60 years old is how they did that in the Catholic church to get him to worship Mary and not Jesus CU Jesus is mean Mary's sweet so we're going to the mother of God we're going to worship her first CU Jesus is mean sounds good but it's the devil the mother has literally taken the place of the son endowed with the merits of God do you know round about this time that a gets up and he says I believe Mary was resurrected cuz we can't find her body and she ascended to heaven and she's up there now and that's who you pray to Mary no Mary had to go to Pentecost absolutely Mary had to get the new birth yes sir she birthed the word but she had to birth the word inside of her soul yes sir the mother has literally taken place of the son endowed with the Merit of godhead all one needs to do is go over her various titles and recall the lovely attributes according Mary by the Roman Church to understand where the religion of this age came from Wow Let's through now watch but what did Luther do Luther during that time he crystallized the doctrine of justification by faith that they held to Works penances prayers and other unscriptural means and as to Freed Christians glorify the son the Roman Catholics increased their increased their deification of Mary like I said before until the 20th century saw in opposition to most even high ranking Roman theologist that Pope P literally exalted Mary to glorification in a resurrected body now they believe that that's why you see the Blessed Virgin Mary you know he got this big heart you know and if he do if if she is holding the baby she's got a Halo just like he's got that Doctrine is absolutely the babylonius doctrine of the son carrying the mother bodily into heaven wow Martin Luther let's talk about him just for a second then we'll recap this this afternoon Martin Luther was born in 1483 died 1546 he was 62 years old when he passed but he was a German all right he was a priest Theologian author he wrote hymns he was a professor and an augustinian frier cuz remember Luther was in that system amen andbody with me Luther came in under the cath Catholic system yes he was actually like a um it was a Fri but but he couldn't marry cuz now at this time they said no priest can't marry he broke that up but he was the seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation you know why that's called Protestant right because they protested the Catholic Church all right Luther was the seminal figure of the Protestant re reformation and his theological belief form the basis of Lutheranism he is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in Western and Christian history brother R will agree with that he's one of the most important one because it was so marred it's just like you put something in a pit of tar and there's one finger sticking out and Luther reaches and gets that one finger and he pulls the church out of that just by one finger now listen they still Tire on it but at least he pulled them out all right Luther was ordained in the priesthood in 1507 he came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church you in particular he disputed the view of indulgences Luther attempted to resolve these differences amicably but first proposing an academic discussion well that got him in trouble he put those 95 Theses up and they everyone was against the Catholic Church Pope Leo demanded that Luther renounce all of his writings and when Luther refused he excommunicated him in January 1521 then they actually they sent people to kill him they sent people to kill Martin Luther and they couldn't get to him listen God's not going to if he's not finished with you you're not going to die all right Luther taught that salvation and consequently eternal life are not earned by Good Deeds rather they are received only as the free gift of God's grace through the believer's faith in Jesus Christ who is the sole Redeemer from sin see that put him in trouble right there because there's saying the pope is right but he had enough gra he had enough power about him he but listen he had enough intelligence too to do it the right way Luther's theology challenged the authority and Office of the Pope by teaching that the Bible is the only source of divinely revealed knowledge Luther's translation of the Bible into German from Latin made the Bible vastly more accessible to the Ley remember Catholic Church even today they do everything in Latin they you don't read the Bible you just depend on the pope which had tremendous impact on both the church in German culture it fostered the development of a standard version of the German language added several principles to the art of translation and influenced the writing of an English translation or the tendale Bible you know what happened to tendale right they hooked him behind a horse and they drug him till he K till they killed him just because he put a Bible together his hymns influenced the development of singing in the in the Protestant churches cuz remember that wasn't in the Catholic Church you see how much he's he's reformed or pulling the people out and getting them to where even our worship now cuz what happened to Wesley Wesley had a method of worship right that's why it's called Methodist there was a method but it started with Martin Luther singing songs and remember he gets married to this cathina Von Bora she was a nun well that just tore the Catholic Church up a priest mared a nun set a model for the practice of clerical M marriage allowing Protestant clergy to marry so you see how he's pulled that out but remember he's not going to pull it all the way out he's not going to pull it all the way out everybody with me some of you are some of you not in two later works Luther expressed anti-jewish Fusion now see he called for the Jews to be expelled or experss or done away burning of synagogues these works also targeted Roman Catholics anabaptists and non-trinitarian Christians based upon his teachings despite the fact that Luther did not Advocate the murdering of Jews some historians contend that his rhetoric contributed to the development see how Satan gets in yes Satan just died right in he said oh Luther I see a crack and he inserted himself right in there and started what happened was the Nazi party came from because he was a German Germans hated the Jews well that continued from Luther all the way to what did that demon do that demon went right into Adolf Hitler Luther dedic him dedicated himself to the augustinian order devoted himself to fasting long hours in prayer listen he wasn't a scoundrel he was a Godly Man pilgrimage and frequent confessions Luther described this period of his life as one of deep spiritual despair watch what he said I lost touch with Christ the Savior and com comforter and made of him the Jailer and hangman of my poor Saul this is his letter to the Pope I like this I want to read it again this is a direct letter he wrote this and sent it to Pope whatever Leo the 10th I believe it was the first and chief article is this Jesus Christ Our God and Lord died for our sins and was raised again for our justification Romans 3 he alone is the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world well that got him in trouble right there and God has laid on him the iniquity of us all all have sinned in our Justified freely without their own works and merits well that got away from the Catholic Church by his grace through the Redemption that is in Christ Jesus in his blood Romans 3 this is necessary to believe this cannot be otherwise acquired or grasped by any work law or Merit therefore it is clear and certain that this faith alone justifies us nothing of this article can be yielded or surrendered in other words I'm not changing it I'm writing it to the pope and if he kills me I he just kills me even though Heaven and Earth and everything else Falls now this is the letter he wrote to his followers in these sermons he hammered home the primary the pracy of core Christian values such as love patience charity freedom and reminded the citizens to trust God's word rather than violence to bring about necessary change do you know what the devil thinks when he sees men use violence to propagate the gospel he sits with folded arms arms behind the fire of hell and says with malignant look and frightful grin oh how wise these Mad Men are to play my game ain't that what we do oh how wise these Mad Men are to play my game let them go on I shall reap the benefits I Delight in it but when he sees the word running and contending alone on the battlefield then he shutters and shakes for fear real quick right here we got to look at this as the Reformation or the age of reforming this was not this listen just for a minute this began the age of restoration do you understand me that but it wasn't yet restored we'll read we'll talk about that this afternoon cuz Joel says I will restore this is not a restoring this is the Reformation he's restoring now Luther was a mighty preacher and teacher of the word word and insisted especially in his first years of public imminence that the word was the sole Criterion thus he was against works as the means of Salvation and baptism as a means of regeneration he talked of mediation of Christ apart from man as was the original and Pentecostal concept he was a man given to much prayer and had learned that more the work he did the more solely he sorely he was impressed for time more of his time he gave to God In Prayer in order to ensure satisfactory results he was passionate about what he was doing he knew what it was to battle with the devil and said that Satan one day visibly appeared to him and he flung an eat well at him bid him to go another time two Fanatics came to him to induce him to join with them in banishing all priests and bibles he discerned the spirit and sent them off he was a Prophet evangelist speaker in tongues interpreter and one person endowed with all nine gifts of the Spirit what stirred his heart by the Holy Ghost In which was the little green Shute and that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon he was the little green shoot that signified that truth was coming back it wasn't there you got a name that you're living that you're dead I'm not really happy with everything you're doing that's what he said your works are not perfect back to the church as it was known at Pentecost was the doctrine of justification salvation by grace do you know that you have based your new birth on that man's teaching come on you have based your new birth on being justified by faith and that God was just to forgive you yes but you can't stay there he stayed there cuz he had no more word that was his part that was what God expected him to do but you and I that's our first work everybody with me I recognize Dr Luther did not believe only and preach only justification but that was his major theme as in indeed it had to be for it was the basic doctrine of the truth of the word he will be forever known as the instrument in the hand of God who revived this truth he was the fifth messenger and his message was the just shall live by faith surely we admit he knew and did teach that we are to go from Faith to Faith His Marvelous understanding of sovereignty election predestination and other truth show him to be a great man in the word yet I say again as do historians God used him to bring to the people God's standard against works which is what you can't be saved by your works and that's what you and I base our Salvation on today that it's not works listen we do Works after yes we get born again now as I mentioned already this age has been called by the historians the period of reformation that is exactly right that is what it is it had to be that for Martin Luther was a reformer not a prophet that's why folks we needed a prophet in the end time to bring the word of God straight from the mind of God straight through his mouth straight to me and you now listen Luther did get a piece of that the just shall live by faith that was in the mind of God he was pleased when Martin Luther said the just shall live by faith but there's more yes that is what it was it had to be that for Martin Luther was a reformer not a prophet so he was not able to lead the church back to the whole truth as would a man like the Apostle Paul who was both Apostle and Prophet the word does not call it a restoration of musicians come on the word does not call it a restoration but certainly calls it a Reformation had it been a restoration that age would have been another Pentecostal age that's why we got to have over here praise God a Pentecostal age that we just came through and listen I'm talking about Pentecost by birth I ain't talking about Pentecost by what they had in 1906 Pentecost by birth Earth yes but it was not the best that could be said of it strengthened that which remains that is ready to die there was something missing yes sir there certainly was this age had justification but it had missed sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that is what God's original plan was that is what they had at Pentecost they were Justified they were Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost and that's Pentecost listen to me the reason for being justified and Sanctified is to the end that you might be baptized with the Holy Ghost that is the reason that there is a church it's the temple of God filled with God even the holy ghost that same spirit that was in Jesus while he was here on Earth causing him to do the mighty Works which he did came back on that church in Pentecost now it didn't come back on Luther it did in part we know in part we prophesy in part but that which is perfect is come that which is in part we don't do away with justification we move through it this age did not have those words oh they had the written word but not the revealed word that was the Reformation period but fear not little flock God said I will restore we'll talk about that this afternoon let's stand to our feet and this reform was going to be the start of it God listen God don't have to start anywhere but he has to start something in you somewhere yes sir right we didn't come here full grown we came here as babies he was going to according to his promise take the church back from the depth of Satan in the dark ages to the depths of God today we stand in the depths of God if you'll believe it if you don't think this is just a church to come to we're in the depths of God that they had at Pentecost in the first few years of the existence of the church now be careful and get this it says in this second verse it reads for I have not found thy works perfect before God do you know that the meaning of not perfect really is it is unfulfilled this age was an unfulfilled age it was just the start of getting back do you remember your start if you don't remember your start you don't have a you don't have a an ending you got a beginning you got to know where you came from that is why I said the Bible called it Reformation not restoration it had started out the doctrine of justification which meant salvation was all of God and how Luther preached the sovereignty of God in election he knew it was all of Grace he separated the church from rule by ecclesiastical hierarchy he tore down the idols cast out the confession Booth he denounced the pope it was wonderfully good as he started but God said 1500 years before Luther you are going to start something but your age will see it unfulfilled I leaving that to the later hallelujah our god reth he knows the end from the beginning yes Luther was his messenger it didn't look like it as We examined the flaws but there was a man called Jonah I say there was a Man Called Moses they had flaws he had flaws in his life too he was a prophet though you and I might not want to say it on the basis of how he acted now this was an unfulfilled age it was an age of ref information but that is how God wanted it listen if God's satisfied with that you better be satisfied with it because it's perfect if God's satisfied then I'm satisfied that Luther had to come and give us a message of justification and we stand like I said before we stand on that if you don't believe that God Justified you your sins are still hanging on you hello but then we got to believe and know that brother comes and he tells us from the mind of God he said that person inside of you never did it to begin with now that wasn't a revelation of Martin Luther Martin Luther said we're saved by right here grace through faith justification we can't do anything we know that but we know that we've come into that come to that justification in The Headstone where you realize you didn't do it
