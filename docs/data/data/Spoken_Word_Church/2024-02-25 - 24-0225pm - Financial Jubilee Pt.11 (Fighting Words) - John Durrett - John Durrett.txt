Christian that means I'm armed that's right I'm armed right my goodness Our God told us to put on that whole armor of God so I have to be armed I have a wife I have children I live in this world just like you I have to be armed every day every day and that is the serious part of our walk is that we have to be armed there is no other way my brothers and sisters but to take God at his word when he say put on that whole armor of God every piece of it amen so getting into Financial Jubilee you know um I I had my laptop and I left my power cord oh my goodness but our brother had another computer we got plenty of energy so we can take the whole afternoon amen thank you Lord Jesus so we're going to take off from where we left off amen Financial Jubilee 11 fighting words fighting words my my my I hope by the time we get through this you have that understanding of what fighting words mean you know when I was young and coming up we grew up what we call the hood it was the hood we a call it it was the hood believe me that's where we grew up and it was something about fighting words you know the one thing they had to say if they said something about your mother your mama that was fighting words period And I wasn't much of a fighter I got to be honest with you my brother he had all those types of jeans so I didn't have to worry too much because he was older and he always had my back but I remember once getting into a little scuffle with a guy and um you know he said something about my mama you know and the other kid would had to remind me you know he said something about your mama you need to act and I did act amen I think that was the last time you ever said anything about my mama that's right so that's what I want you to get when you hear fighting words something should trigger you and sometimes we do have to be reminded we got to be reminded oh we should be armed we're in a fight we're in a battle okay and what I'm hearing on the pulpit is fighting words to trigger something in me to fight we have to that's what this word is it's a what it's a sword he didn't give us a pillow he gave us a sword to fight with to fight for everything see I don't want the devil to have nothing that belongs to me not one penny why would I give him a penny I don't want him to have my penny I'll do something with that Penny but he's not going to have it I don't want him to have my kids I don't want to have my family I don't want to have anything that God wants me to have and I'm going to take this word this sword and I'm going to fight with it so when we look in the word we got to know what it's talking about is fighting words not sleeping words it's fighting words by the grace of God so as we get into this this is what I hope you hear fighting words amen and like I said the word is a sword and we have to hear we hear the word we hear the preaching not to go to sleep but to recognize and what else hear recognize and act act on the word of God so many of you you're going to hear today I hope you all hear what I'm saying okay it's a little bit more challenging to recognize right that's the next level to recognize recognize means it has a relations to you you're you're feeling it it's touching you I had to be reminded he said something about your mama recognize he's talking about you you have something to do okay and then you have to act so again many of you will hear some will recognize like this this is talking to me yes I I God I wish I would have done this I this and that you recognize and then those will take it further and act on it the only way any of this word works if you have faith to act on it am that's it amen praise the Lord Jesus so I hope you all hear I hope you all recognize and I certainly hope you all act on these fighting words I love the story brother Ram told you know of the the the elderly lady and um you know she was living in poverty you know she was dying she was starving to death that's what our Prophet said starving to death poverty stricken so someone turned her into the charity and they went in and they started talking to her and said hey don't you have any family she said yeah I do I have a hardworking son he's in India on business like wow that sounds promising well I mean does he know about your situation well I can't tell him about my situation my you know I don't want to wor he's such a good boy I don't want to bother him he said well you should tell him cuz you you about to die you need to do something she said well I just can't do it but I tell you what he is a good son he sends me the prettiest pictures she said really my said well something is wrong with this boy I mean my goodness he sent his mom pictures and she's starving let me see those pictures she went and got her Bible open up those pictures and what they were they were draft notes from the bank she was actually very very wealthy rich and didn't know it didn't know it my and our Prophet said you don't have to act like the world you don't have to go all bound up you're rich where do you find it at in the Bible you just looked it over and thought it was just a picture book or some other true story but it isn't it's God's word you are rich you are rich brothers and sisters that's to all of us each one we are rich but I can assure you it's going to take a moment for you to recognize that to really live into that to come into that presence where you can act into that there's a song that says our father is rich in houses and land he holds the wealth of the world in his hands of rubies and diamonds and silver and gold his coffers are full he has riches Untold I'm a child of the king I promise you if we could really see and recognize and act on that the way we should we could end this Jubilee right now and go home I can assure you because it's God's word this is our father this is our father but I know because I live through the same thing you do where it's a fight but if I can hear God's fighting words and get into that and be able to recognize and I will see so hear recognize and act on the word of God amen praise the Lord Jesus amen let's go ahead and stand we'll read the scripture in Nehemiah 4 14 it says and I looked and Rose up and said unto the Nobles and to the rulers and to the rest of the people be not not ye afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses amen you may be seated my my my what a powerful scripture we have looked and Rose up and said be not afraid of them remember the Lord which is great and terrible and fight for your brethren your sons and your daughters your wives and your houses amen so when you hear fighting words the first thing you could should think about is that there is an enemy there is an enemy and in Nehemiah if you go back and read some of that chapter you will find out what happened as we know he went there trying to build a wall and it had Jewish people raising up Judah who was there they said we don't have the strength it's too much rubbish it's too much adversaries said hey we going to go kill him that's right the Jews that were living close to the adversary said hey 10 times they came up and said the enemy is going to be upon you putting in that fear but here Nehemiah rose up looked at the whole thing and said hey don't be afraid remember the Lord amen and as we get into any of God's promises and are certainly around money remember the Lord that's why it said we're a child of the king we are we are that my brothers and sisters we are children of the king but you got all kind of things and you got an enemy that would want to keep that from us amen that's his job to keep these things from us to keep us from all of the things God has for us and so a army first in getting ready for battle first there's got to be a select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting so when you're dealing with anything with God we have to be trained we got to be trained yes we do and I thank God for this church because we know it's a teaching church but again remember what it's trying to teach you fighting words not sleeping words it's trying to teach you fighting words so we can recognize and we can act on it that's what it's trying to do and the same thing I'm doing this morning presenting this to you so you can fight so you can be trained in this area we got to get our muscles up that's the problem we don't have our muscles to the point that we can fight this is a real battle my brothers and sisters this is a real battle soldiers die bankrupt happens divorce happens not outside of this message in this message I'm talking about okay so it's that kind of battle it's a real battle amen as I said every day I'm fighting I'm fighting for my family I'm fighting for my kids I'm fighting my own enemy that's in this flesh I'm fighting every single day so we have to be trained see with the things of money I wish I could go right in and start showing you do this do that do this that's I'm sure that's what everybody wants what what what secret can I do what is the secret you have to be trained to handle that secret right see our father knows that okay if I had a billion dollars I have to be equipped to handle that level of responsibility I wouldn't want a billion dollars and be on my fifth marriage okay I don't know I don't want that but if God had that for me I want to be able to manage that with my wife and my children amen and my grandkids in the generations to come amen so that they see God like our Father Abraham am who is Rich and servants and all that but he knew that money couldn't answer all of life situations it was properly placed properly placed and that's what God wants us to be able to handle whatever he has for us but to have it properly placed but we got to be trained see money Dave Ramsey said look he said it's 80% behavior and I believe that it's 20% knowledge so I can start telling you do this do that and you'll be excited you'll be excited today you're here you here you may recognize a little bit then you'll get home and something else will happen be like well you know what yeah let's go out to eat I'm tired you know don't know what where you got the money don't know where it's coming from but hey look that that was good he said something you know he said something yeah you know what one day one day one day and generations are going past one day one day we had this same Bible that has all of these precious promises it's not a pretty picture book it's a ticket to a billion dollars right here right here this is word of God is every single thing you have need of on this journey my goodness if you are a young person and can see what I'm trying to tell you you want to be able to handle a billion dollars get in this word of God it's that it's your skills it's your job it's your career it's the door that God wants to open for you it's every Avenue everything amen yes we hear of the deep things but all of the small things are included in there if you got $100 you got $1 it's the same it's you've got a bill you got everything so every single thing is in this word of God but we have to be trained to handle all of this we can't handle all of these precious promises without being trained my I think of David and we know he went out and he killed that lion he killed that bear you know and and that was normal for David now you might have thought you know and I always thought about this that David now we know David was human it was a question as brother W was saying this morning he was a murder adultery M he was human so tell me what was going on as a teenager that he could walk out there and not be scared of Goliath either he was crazy right or something was wrong yeah right but I want to tell you that he had to be trained so I'm thinking Lord how would this young man do this this is not normal if he would commit adultery and David was obviously normal so what's going on that he would do that I said well you know he said he killed a bear yes he killed a lion but that ain't a little I said my goodness David must have been going through something in that desert area that made him say I can't go back home with this sheep missing no right Lord I've been putting a rock in a hard place man my brothers they going to go crazy D oh my Lord I'm either going to die or that lion is going down right God be with me I'm going to take you Lord at your word help me Lord I I don't I know what to do but I can't go back home had to be that much distress in his normal day-to-day life that he would say you know what I'm facing it and he went out there and did it and when he came back he was like Lord my God I killed a lion he must have walked back he could tell his brother they wouldn't have believed him he just walked around had it in himself like Lord that lion is gone Lord you are real my goodness and he Joy he started writing music he like Lord I'll take it all for myself Lord you've done this for me praise the Lord my so by the time the bear came along he's like Lord again another test another trial oh Lord God all right Lord you did it once Lord I'm going trust you I'm going to go out did it again my goodness he had lost his mind by that point he was like Lord father you answer my prayers I don't have anything to be scared of please if I killed a lion a bear come on come on please then Lord if I stand up for you if I act if I recognize and I act this little bit my muscles have gotten big enough Lord my so by the time he went out to Goliath he was probably living in that environment like Lord you are just everything I don't care if I live or die Lord you are every single thing so there's no way this uncircumcised Philistines is going to stand up here and say that I'm going to walk in it I'm going to act in this and when he did we know the result Goliath was history but he had to be trained he had to be trained and the same for us we have to be trained in these things and money is just a tool for you to practice practice handling these great things that God wants to give you to bless yourself your family his people but we got to be trained like I tell you you know this this um powerful verse quote I just I really love it said now the people today are expecting God to reach down and get them by the neck say yes that's right you bring me out clean me off heal me and I'll believe you God doesn't do his business that way he gives you the promise but you have got to fight for every inch of ground that you possess do you still believe the prophet brother that's what he's saying you got to fight God is going to give you the promise he's goingon to give you the tools whatever you need he's going to give it to you but you're GNA have to fight for it you're gonna have to fight for every scent of money that God wants you to have that he places it within your hands you're going to have to fight for it amen I love what God allowed me and my wife and family to go through when we ran out there like everybody else not knowing this wasn't just a picture book thinking it was just that thinking oh we were saved and thank God but Lord I guess everything else we got to just get the world's way yeah huh my my my so we ran out there grabbed our 40-year loan 40e loan to get the payment down and my I was like oh thank God I'm doing well look at this you know we were just pleased that they would give us that loan my we wanted a bathroom with two sinks in it I remember I was wanted that we went in that house and they were like no we don't want to do that but we were so happy to get that loan that it was like okay we don't want to ask too many questions we don't want to ask too many thank than you sir we are so grateful for this Lo loan that you're giving us that we oh that's why the Bible says what the borrow is servant to the lender we walked in there servants we didn't have any power but just to accept what they wanted to give us but after God started showing me in this word after we lost so much money I told a story in business and things like that I said Lord something's wrong I'm paying my tithes you know I I I I God I went to college I think I thought I knew about managing money but Lord something's off Lord help me show me Teach Me amen train me and he started training me am he started training me and I've been on that Journey ever since my brothers and sisters and I can tell you my life is transformed because of what God trained Me On by his grace 2007 we owed $32,000 on this house if we would have kept everything the way it was the paperwork that they gave us is telling us you going to give us $836,000 but I never looked at the paperwork I just signed it I was okay we can make the payment okay it doesn't seem like it matters cuz I get to have the house and we're so excited my goodness but we pulled oursel together after we start looking in this word like Lord this ain't a picture book father God you telling me if I obey God that I should be the head not the tail my you don't like your children borrowing things my my my and you bless us when we obey you and you got debt as a curse my goodness Lord you're saying that to your children Israel Lord I'm supposed to be the bride that's what I'm supposed to be Lord my my my Lord God you have all of these things in your word and we started little by little walking slowly slowly selling things that we didn't need you know paying off debt little by little by a little paid off a lot of that business debt and by that time I'm like Lord huh that business debt is gone I've never had that much money in my life just by itself so I'm like I could pay that debt off paid it off was around $245,000 I've never had that much cash saved ever period but when I saw that I was like man we haven't missed anything my family we felt closer together we felt more bonded more in love you know hey you could get $10 to go out to eat we were in love you get one cheeseburger I get one fry we divide it up and we enjoyed it you know what I mean but I tell you it tastes better it was so good because you like we were together we were unified man it was great so I'm like oh God this feels good Lord I'm GNA look at this house huh they want what let's keep going honey let's let's keep going and we kept going we kept hidden we kept hidden taking that word learning hitting hitting hitting hitting by the grace of the Lord that house was paid off 2017 paid it off done praise the Lord instead of 40 years 2047 it was gone my my my so I recognized something in that I said Lord God your word is true it is absolutely the truth Lord God and what I've been saying and seeing I'm said Lord Jesus if that's always been there if that's always been available to me but I just didn't know how to do it I didn't know how to apply it but Lord as you started training me on it I see it where it it's just like wow Lord God you mean I could go my whole life 2047 and never know these things be a born again Christian and never know these things then Lord there are more things there for me to learn hey we can handle money that a small thing now by the grace of the Lord but Lord you're telling me other things you're telling me this whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust wow there are precious promises money is just a tool a small thing but it can give you that muscle like Lord okay okay Lord I can learn to wait I can learn to do this Lord I can learn to trust you and see you in action and the Small Things my confidence grows my strength builds Lord then all of these other things must be the same way in your word father I believe that my got to take our time you know this it's like Lord I'm just I'm excited for the word I'm excited and I pray God will just speak to your hearts I believe it's nothing but the truth in this word of God our Prophet says this listen to this he says the power that's in you you could speak a world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are amen we need to start losing our minds because this is the truth our minds can't accept this I know it can't cuz you can't accept that you can have a billion dollars that seems no well see then well and then your mind start telling you all this stuff if you could create a world and live into it my God a billion is a small thing start realizing that it's a small thing amen that you could create a world there's gold streets there's gold buildings there's anything think about that now you think God is just we just making this up like we're just saying this no this is where God wants our mind to get away from where we're thinking is just a fairy tale no he's telling you you got that power that's what power is in the church now it's now but it's controlled by a law see now we start saying well see it's a law see that's why all things are possible to them that believe and if you can believe it whatever God will lead your soul to believe that is yours every place The Souls of your foot can set upon by faith God gives it to you amen it's yours you possess it if you can find the key to this law of faith that op it to you that's right if you are a son of God you are a daughter of God that never leaves you it's with you all the time but your faith gets away from it but it's still there right the billion dollars it's still there it's it's still there okay but our faith so this power it's still here but our faith we we can't we can't seem to grasp it we can't seem it gets away from us why because we're not practicing we're not training he told us we have to be trained he told us that already okay and you have to get your muscles up to handle these types of things so we have to be trained in that we have to fight for these precious promises believe by faith and see all faith has to do with that ability to obey God the ability to obey God that's what David had when he went out and saw Goliath he had the ability to obey God cuz he was trained he was equipped equpped okay and we're trained and equipped then we will be able to handle this power that God has promised us in this day and time believe that by the grace of the Lord amen now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows that how the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church and defile it making it lukewarm formal powerless it exposes Satan revealing his Works attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word he fights that say that word again he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army amen praise the Lord look at it real close look at it we talked about that power we talked about a lot of things so far but this is bringing out there's something the reason it's fighting words because there is an enemy there is an enemy he wants to discredit all of this he wants to disarm you in everything disarm you in your marriage disarm you in dealing with your kids disarm you in this life's journey and have you powerless a powerless born again Christian that's what he wants but God doesn't want that for us he want us to be powerful have the ability to create a world and have the character to say I'll wait yeah I can do it but I'll wait until God tells me to do it and if that's life or death I'll still wait right I don't have to show it I don't have to show it off I can hold it until God tells me move make that move character that's what he wants but you have to be trained into this I hope your mind is just going out and thinking about about your money and the little things that we can't even we can't break away from and this kind of power it's real my brothers and sisters Is that real but that's where we have to come to if we want to be that Invincible Army amen right but remember the devil is fighting that and he's a good adversary like the sister said he's a good adversary he's very good very good Invincible means too powerful to be defeated or overcome impossible to defeat or prevent from doing what is intended amen Invincible comes from the Latin word to conquer that's it Invincible that's what God wants us to be in all areas of our life Invincible with your children Invincible with your spouse invincible with your parents Invincible with any of the challenges that we face and knowing you have that kind of power that God wants you to have see we're intended in this day and time to conquer to overcome right you know I can't help but think about this word all the precious promises finances everything that this Bible laid out for all these generations and we're down to this time the prophet has come the prophet has gone you have seen your parents come up and go you've seen Believers we've seen all of this and we know all of these things because this word that's preached here we know it we cannot say we haven't heard it we have heard it I do believe we're challenged in recognizing it sometimes no doubt and certainly challenged in acting on it because it's not easy amen that's why it's fighting words it's to trigger you to start stepping out there to start fighting to start pressing to start moving so we can get to that point where you are invincible if you had a billion dollars I'm sure many of your financial problems that you have you would feel Invincible you really would be like hey that's that's no problem no big deal I feel good my investments are going to pay for I don't even have to work if I don't want to I'm pretty much Invincible I don't have to worry about the car breaking down I'll just buy another one it doesn't matter hey it's all good my what Smiles would you have on your faces you know what I mean my goodness Invincible yeah that's what I want to be I want to be Invincible in all areas of my life but I know I have to be trained I got to be trained to respond to my kids in the right way I got to be trained to respond to my wife in the right way I got to be trained to respond to my own brain right between these two ears in the right way trained in it so I can feel Invincible I can feel that my my my praise the Lord see we haven't even talked about financial Jubilee yet we're just not getting started praise the Lord Jesus but I had to set that stage because I want you to see that all of these things are ours my brothers and sisters all of these things and I do I want you to fight for everything that God has for you we must we must do that every single scent all these things praise the Lord Jesus it's not difficult things that we have to do it's all of these things small things that we have to just train and fight you know you have to train and fight you know don't sit there and let the devil just go Haywire on you in your life stand up so no stand up whatever that takes you know go pray do something don't just accept your mind don't accept what it tells you you know what I mean likey I'm done I'm I'm gonna do this I'm going to do that this feels good no so no no no I know I know better not to do this I know better right not to respond to my wife this way I know better it's not easy it's not easy but as we practice on all of these things and you just husband keep your mouth you know and go pray that thing off and then like oh what was I even upset about my she is a wonderful wife I just love her it's amazing I mean you go through things like that that actually happens you know but 2 minutes you're under so much pressure it's like you know our Prophet said said this he said he walked in the house I love the way he said it because I don't have to say it he said feel like your head is about to explode that's what he said that's his words look it up yeah he said I live through it that's what he said so if my head feels a little you know sometimes the Lord I can say hey the prophet felt that way too yes he did you know human human but we learn to fight we learn to get on our knees Lord help us get us through this Lord father give me wisdom give me Grace father give me your wisdom father that's what I need Lord to deal with this situation don't want to be too hard don't want to be too soft we got to fight to be in the middle of this road fight in the middle you see and that's what it is and when we come when we start talking about money it's it's we fight because like if I be rich uh but what are you doing with the money that you have that can tell you something you know I have people I don't want to be rich but you got all that credit debt you know what what what what do you what it doesn't make sense well God don't want us to be wait a second huh you really think so well my Bible is telling me some different things it's telling me that God has things for me and I want everything that God has for me that's it amen I don't care what anybody else says I want what everything that God has for me that's what I want period amen Financial Jubilee our Prophet comes along 1965 he says clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said get all things off your hands get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen 1965 how long y clean your lives up get ready amen get ready for all of the promises that we've been hearing about amen we don't have time to have all of these distractions in our life with such promises that's waiting for us we don't have the time for it period we have to learn to fight quickly how to fight how to get on our knees get these spirits and these things off of us and move on by the grace of the Lord see I practice all the time especially in this area of money okay and you guys see the the older vehicle I have you are probably the only people that see some of the old old vehicle I have because nobody at Works they sometimes see it they don't see it but sometimes I walk out and I know they oh he's I'm a manager at work you know and I can imagine people want to say I wonder what car he's in and sometime I feel that little Spirit coming around me a wait don't let them see I'm like what am I doing no it doesn't matter like these people don't know me I'm going in my car you know and I'm getting in you know why am I hesitating I mean this is this is normal but I'm practicing I'm like Lord yes because soon as I'm ready Lord and I feel like I'm ready then I will but I don't need to do it because I'm feeling this and I'm trying to impress somebody no they don't know me from Blue from left period amen and Lord I want to enjoy my b i I do if I can't clean this thing up the way I want then I don't need to get another vehicle I'm no I can't even keep this thing clean I'm just running around all the time I'm like no no slow down what am I in a rush for who am I trying to impress I go to church with Believers so I don't want to try to impress you but we got Spirits so we some sometimes want to impress each other you know no now I'm not saying anything wrong with that but let's make sure it's cleaning your lives up not complicating your lives not making your lives more complicated and now I'm going to do this and honey you do this and you squeeze from left you pull from right and we'll go pray for this trust that it come through can you coign for this can you I've done all of that I've done that honey they need your name on the paper you put your name when we were doing business oh my God and she had enough sense to be like John I don't know just sign your name I'm like just doesn't matter he just said the husband and the wife has to sign why are you worrying about it you know you know that's how you feel like why are you don't worry about it honey just it's go I have it all under control until it's not under control right but that's how you feel like it can't go wrong you know and we went in I remember signing the loan and we had a lawyer we we were doing hard money lending and what that means you don't necessarily have the credit long as you have some backup to it you got a house or something like that then they were loan you when we were doing business property and they said yeah but bring your wife in you know this I won't call him a slick lawyer but he was a lawyer you know and he come on in he had sushi like you can have some you know we ate sushi and it's like yeah sign in we need your wife to sign as well now he knew what he was doing but we were kids like yes how much we have access to a million oh that's so wonderful we could buy all kind of properties uhhuh until the stock market and the the real estate market started crashing and tell us about that huh and it's like Lord what is going on Lord God all kind of mess so I've done that but our Prophet is say clean your lives up it should be clean clean clean what does clean mean that means your husband your wife they can walk in it's clean they're not under all kind of stress and pressure and all kind of things that we've caused no we cause it and regardless of whether your spouse is different than you see I I'm trained in business and things like that that I promise you brothers and sisters God give you a spouse he knows what you need period my wife is all butterflies and love and all that I got none of it so we are a great couple you are by the grace of the Lord but she keeps me sof and I know that I know it I know I don't know what I would be probably I I don't know without her amen but she brings that side and I look back like man if I would have got her involved her own emotions would have kept me out of that trouble yes she was like uh and you're like well why logically explain it to me no she ain't never GNA logically explain it to you you g say I just don't like it I don't know what you're talking about logic but you know but that's how we feel that's the differences in relationships that we go through you know and it challenges you you know it challenges you sometimes we think and our always laugh with the brother sometimes like if my wife if she would listen to me any of you Brothers think that you're wrong if she would listen to me it would all be good that's how we feel no it would not you would have a nightmare on your hands if they only listen to you my goodness no we got to listen to God so your wife is there to drive you to prayer to say Lord God am I just overthinking I'm I missing this side Lord Jesus well you slow me down we don't need to be in a rush clean your lives up pay your debts come on man oh no man so why should we ever enter into this if we're out of it right and why are we not cleaning it up so we don't have it when he told us this in 1965 get all things right make ready get ready see fighting words as I said look at these words clean that's something you have to do clean see you're hearing it now but none of you are doing it cuz you're just hearing it this is the point that you're hearing the word you're hearing it but you got to recognize you got is this meaning something to me but then you got to go do this you got to go clean your lives up you got to go pay your debts you got to do that you got to go into action amen oh no man you got to oh no man get all things off your hands all of this stuff that's just complicating our lives because remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen remember that long time but we have to decide to do that we got to take these words and make that trigger something in you that you fight you do these things God's part and your part remember that that's what you hear when you hear the word of God it's easy for us to confuse and we hear God's part we like yeah huh God is always faithful with his part I can promise you that always the problem it's our part that's where the problem comes it's our part amen and we like to hear the pillow part we like to hear God's part that's pillow pillow talk to me yes it's like thank you Lord you got it all under control I don't have to worry I Lord I'm really not thinking about it Lord you're going to provide you yes he's going to do all that he has his part but you got yours amen believe that brother amen and I'd say come you got something to do too God just don't poke things down your neck you've got to believe it you've got to do some fighting amen that's our Prophet you've got to do some fighting someday I'm going to answer for every penny of money that's given to me that's what our Prophet said someday every penny that's been given to him he's going to have to answer for that think about it think about it we're in the same boat brother God's part okay just like Joshua now listen to this God's word and I don't want mean to say pillow talking that way but if we take it wrong it becomes pillow woke like we we we we tend to want to sit back and like yes God is saying this there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I will be with thee I will not fail thee nor forsake thee and then shall you have good success look at what God is saying look at his part it becomes easy to say well see and that's I I I believe that being around this message a long time you know it's so easy that we we go to that part cuz it's easy easy it's easier for us to just repeat what God Said and he his part while he's working okay he's working to fulfill his part amen okay he's offering grace mercy he's paying the price for us think about it he's doing that he's paid the price for us all of these things he did his part amen he's done it okay but he wants us to experience some of that glory amen he could end it right now amen but he wants us to understand that he is Victorious he is a mighty conqueror in him in us we are the same okay when we're at work and we're trying to set someone up for a promotion or something like that what we tend to do we see somebody they working hard we give them extra jobs and things like that so their talent can come out right okay we present okay work on this project y do this do that setting them up setting them up all of the tests and trials that's what God's trying to do just set us up up so we can be a participant in this great plan that he has God's part talked about that your part here's Joshua and now he comes and say God Joshua you got a part be strong and a good courage be strong and very courageous observe to do now I hope you're hearing these fighting words that he's telling Joshua he's like Joshua nope you're not going to be able to sit down buddy I'm sorry I know you want to and I got you that's how is I got you don't worry I got you but this is what I want you to do right see God is expecting us amen we're expecting God he expecting us he's like I got my part don't worry about my part yeah you worry about what I'm telling you to do and you will see be strong observe to do stay in the word meditate day and night observe to do be strong do not be afraid do not be a dismayed look at all of these things that he puts out there for us that we have to take as fighting words see there's no reason right now that you need to be courageous cuz you're sitting all in here we got the air conditioner on we you know hopefully you're fighting to stay awake you know there hope you're fighting that good fight but when you walk out this is where you now have to recognize and put into action what you're hearing observe these things stay in the word of God as you hear the word see it says faith come by hearing as you hear the word what is Faith see it said faith comes by hearing but what is Faith to me that's the ability again to obey God it's the ability to walk into it okay so you're hearing something but Joshua had to be strong he had to have courage he had to observe he had to choose to stay in the word he had to choose not to be afraid he had to choose not to be dismayed all sound very challenging and we're in the same boat but if we can see what God is to us and see that he is there to supply that power that you need then you know if you can have that confidence in God and act in it your muscles will grow praise the Lord Jesus all right I see we're getting time is is going praise the Lord everybody's still here by the grace of the Lord nobody has left amen so as we get more towards money again you know I have to be able to show you whether or not you need to recognize this I got to be able to show you like hey he talking about your mama yeah I know you're not a fighter but he talking about your mama so I'm talking to you I'm talking to every person here whether you're young whether you're old it doesn't matter I'm talking to you but you still might not be able to relate so we got to do something when you go to the doctor they do something to find out and tell you if you're sick or not so we like to call this life Financial bondage symptoms okay and I want to take a little time to go through this so you can see whether any any when you checking that button does any of this applies to you then you go to this room okay so if any of these Financial symptoms apply to you then you know it's talking to you all right number one are you always worried about money or you're not worrying about it at all either way either way see if you have money and marriage problems arguments frustration the month too much left the money is gone or you're on the other side where you think everything will work itself out I'm trusting God to provide and I say it in that tone because that's typically how it comes out that means I'm not doing anything he going to provide but I'll borrow from this I'll borrow from that I'll do this I have no limits but I'm just trusting God did you just take a vacation and now your bill is not due but you went to the church to borrow some I don't know it sounds like you trus in something different right see that's what we got to question these things okay I'm trusting God to provide again remember you are expecting God he's done his part he's faithful God Is providing but he is expecting you to do something remember that so again always worried about money or not worried about it at all number two bailout right this is the out this is just ignoring reality okay avoiding the pressure of dealing with the issues like I just just don't want to deal with it I just honey I don't want to talk about it just I don't want to talk about it you know it's gonna work out just I got it no and you don't okay God is waiting on you and your spouse to be United amen as he said he will answer your prayers okay when you honor that weaker vessel amen okay so we don't have it figured out right we can't ignore these things okay and it's the reality it's the truth we think we can ignore these things but I always tell my wife I like to remind her that I I am a human being don't ever think of me any higher than I am I mean I'm trying to do the best that I know how period so I have to think in terms of that I am not Superman God is Superman so I don't want to leave her if something were to happen God said hey it's time for you to go home I don't want if she don't have a clue she's in a mess that has happened my brothers and sisters period okay so we can't ignore it we got to deal with these challenges we can't ignore we can't look for the big bail out you know this is the big one this will fix all my problems I don't need to do anything you know 10 years been barring every left and right and every situation and you just hoping this will happen this deal will do it no it won't you know I when when when I was in business I I was thinking you know I said Lord he's going to bless me I'm a Christian this is how I'm going to buy that vehicle that's what I said he's going to bless the deal is going to work out like he this is how it's going to happen okay I hadn't learned any of this stuff it didn't happen that way it didn't happen it happened the opposite way and I learned that I had the tools to do it in a way that's going to build character and that's a much better way so don't ignore it don't don't avoid the pressure don't be looking for the big one the ba out don't jump at every investment opportunity to get rich quick and then I'll tell them I'll let them know then I love my wife when I'm bailed out now so number two number three cover up you know this is cover up you broke but you have to represent we know that's a big one in this day and time that means hey you you you looked apart you go to YouTube man you see those guys with those cars in the background I mean especially these young people it's so hard for them because they see all this stuff you can make 10,000 tomorrow all all you got to do is do drop shipment all you got to do is Amazon all you got to do is this and tomorrow you will have it you don't need to do this you don't need to do that you don't need to do that I got the secret sauce for you and I promise you you listen to that stuff you would tend to like yes this is it it got to be true no no no no God is God he provides for his children don't look for the easy way don't cover up amen I like say this is act your wage you know whatever wage that you have act that way okay don't look for credit just because you think it gets results okay you feel like oh well it gets results I can have that car I can have this I can have that no we wanted God's way remember what Satan tried to do right he tried to offer Jesus the whole Kingdom on credit it's like all he did said Jesus look I I'll give you what you worry about I got you this is easy all you you got to do Jesus is just sign right here all of the kingdom is yours why you want to go that hard way stress that was for the old folks that's how they used to do it you don't need to do that now this 2024 Jesus just accept the kingdom it's he's not telling you the price my goodness think about if our Lord wasn't a mighty fighter my goodness said now our Prophet said that Jesus said our prophet he said this and I loved it he said what's just a few more years he knew he was going to get air to and inherit it he said what's a few more years look what our Lord did for us so nope I'm not taking the easy way I'm going to show my children how things are done right he's our example praise the Lord greed hey if you feel like I deserve it it should be me more more you can't have enough you don't have that contentment you know you just H you see the next magazine you're like oh this is how it should look I'm going to change this you just can't keep that contentment this is getting outdated this is you know all this stuff just pulling on you now I'm not saying it's anything wrong with change and Improvement nothing wrong with that but you just don't want any of the devil's way you don't want any of his tactics you want that peace where it's love where you feel good just like a child you said you feel good with God giving you something you see that's what we want not a feeling well I I my husband don't he's not happy she's not happy you know all these kind of things no we just wait on the Lord wait for that right timing resentment okay you feeling resentment pointing fingers God not giving you all your wants you feel envious of others you know and all these things are going to be applied spiritually as well that's right you know like how did he do that or how did she do that or you know oh all these kind of things and we got to fight off these kind of kind of spirits next is Indulgence trying to create happy moments right you can't afford it so you buy more it's called a great escape take a vacation or buy and create your own happy experience to forget about your money problems that's the entitlement mentality reward yourself you only live once why are you waiting yeah why are you waiting for you only live once well I want to live according to God's plan that's what I want to do I don't want to create my own happy moments I want God to be with me I want God to anything I do I want to be a blessing and I Lord I want your hand in it because I don't want to be thrown off course in this most deceiving age that we live in and I certainly don't want to take your greatest thing that you've given me and I think it's just a picture book I don't want to take that I want to see your word for what it is and if that means just waiting a little bit longer Lord to start seeing your word for what it is then Lord that's what I want to see I want to see Lord you're able to provide for my needs in the greatest things I want to see that for my own self so that I have the muscles to handle Lord what you have for me no plan too busy and this is a very good one and this is a good one especially as we get closer to financial Jubilee and some of the homework and the things that I got to challenge you on okay not having a plan you don't know what's happening you're too busy or too slothful okay to have a plan you don't know where it's going like to say hey I'm not a numbers person you know you don't know what's going to happen when you're gone again you're not a numbers person but guess who is a numbers persons God he is a numbers person and you know the Devil he's a perverter so he's right and long being a numbers person he spends billions billions to learn you how to Market how to get out of your hands what God wants you to have billions studying marketing pushing planning this whole economy is based on that right okay so he's taking his time in a plan but we don't take our time we don't want a plan it feels just odd no God wants you to have a plan okay he wants you to have a plan he wants you to be diligent in everything that we do middleman this is living paycheck to paycheck that means everything that's coming in is going out sorry about that everything that's coming in is going out okay that's not where we want to be as well help wanted this is where you you just don't have it to help you wish you could be a help but you don't have it to help in my spot here okay I like to call this like the the broke Good Samaritan he just s couldn't would be the Good Samaritan if he was broke yeah but he wasn't broke he was using everything that God was giving him for God's honor and glory and we know the story today and then the last is the de trap thinking it's the only way we know debt you know God does not want his children in debt as our Prophet said clean your lives pay your debts now he does say he not talking about your normal bills and you got you know your gas and your electric bills and things like that that's not debt debt is when you borrow okay you borrow and now you have a additional charge that's interest that you're now paying this interest that's a cost of you borrowing okay that's what he does not like okay and I like to like what God doesn't like I doesn't I don't like what the Lord doesn't like and I like what he likes okay so he's given that in his Bible he's telling us that I don't like that now you decide how you going to deal with what God doesn't like okay quickly we're we're coming to a close I think I'm saying that just to kind of wake you up a little bit I've saw the brothers do that we're coming to a close I don't want eyes getting glazed over you know my kids they they they've been around me a long time was going through all of this and I've learned I start seeing their eyes like Dad yeah and they start talking about the birds and I'm like huh well it's time for me to put my passion down a little bit on these kids they'll learn I'm passionate about the things of the lord it's everything to me my brothers and sisters his word is every single thing and I want everyone to know that it's every single thing it is your money it's your health it's your strength it's your life it's this journey principles we're going to go through this might hit on a couple things and then we will wind this up for today God owns it all the 10% is his and the 90% you have to manage his resources diligently the Bible says the hand of the diligent shall bear rule it says that money can be your master you cannot serve God and Manon you have to be the master of money am get that plan put things in place number four patience wait on the Lord we know that avoid debt like the curse the Bible says the blessing of the Lord maketh rich and he adth no sorrow with it that's right principle number six save winter is coming save a little go to the ant any of us as we're getting older you know you're like different than when you were when you were 20 something years old you're 30 am my dad is the hard hardest working man I I knew in his lifetime you know and to see that he is now retired you know and not able to work he would have not stopped working and if if life you know but to see that it's like my go to the ant you know think about this journey that we're on save a little bit giving is the best investment the Bible says it's more blessed to give than to receive so you want to be in a position where you're truly giving not where you got MasterCard over here taken out this pocket and you giv I don't that's kind of that's something you got to pray through right you know but where you really have it is yours that you're giving see and principle number eight contentment godliness with contentment is great gain amen that's what we're after that great gain hit on this principle then we will wrap this up but listen to God's part okay God owns it all all of it the 10% the 90% it's all it's given to you to manage look what God says he owns it he says the Earth is the Lord's and the fullness thereof the world and they that dwell therein the silver is mine and the gold is mine sayith the Lord of hosts he's saying this he owns it all he controls it both riches and honor come of thee and thou reth over all and in thine hand is power and might and in thy hand it is to make great and to give strength unto all the Lord maketh poor and maketh Rich he bringeth low and he lifteth up amen he provides it but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus but Thou shalt remember the Lord thy God for it is he that giveth power to get wealth he owns it he controls it he provides it he says anything that you need anything you have need of in this earth Journey God Will Supply it if you have need of it he promises to supply your needs not your wants your needs and he's God and he can only get it to you as you would believe him amen that's a promise these are promises that we have from God he owns it he controls it like I said a billion dollars what's that to God what's that to God we should really really honestly have that that we know that's a small thing that's nothing to the Lord we want this power we want what God has for us so we can get all of the these precious promises that God has for us we want that freedom that God wants for us in our life so we can train our children so we can have that type of Faith muscles in all areas of our life right see Satan wants all these things to be stumbling block blocks and distractions to where we just don't necessarily have that freedom we don't have that that true Freedom okay and and our kids can tell our our grandkids they could they could tell you know they're looking you know they're looking at our home our marriages how we handle each other they're looking at all of those things to see if we really possess what we're saying we possess you see and we want to be in a position where we can possess that where we have that but we know we have to be trained in these areas and money again that's just a tool it's just a tool for you to use to practice to see God in all of the things all of the things from the big things to the little things you can see God God yes we're going to jump down I do want to read one thing we'll read this quote says if God gives us things to do and gives us money so you said who gives you the money that's what I'm telling you God gives you the money and he gives you things to do and he makes us the richest nation under the heavens then God's going to ask what did we do with it why did we spend our money for things that satisfies not not only to a nation but that'll be to individuals if God gives us these things God is giving us that money that's right he's the one that's doing that America is in a bad situation and they call it a debt pandemic like the national debt has never been the high as high as it's been and the Consumer Debt that's like personal debt your cars houses credit cards all that it's never been as high as it is is this month period they call it the debt pandemic you can Google it and look it up and see what's going on but it's it's a lot and there there it's we been know it's out of control you see and we know our Prophet said he said right there in the money that will get the ball rolling it'll get that ball rolling you see so we want to certainly be like Abraham we're over here on this side we're not caught up in all of these things and wrapped up caught up stressed out bound down you see if these things that God has promised us if they know they're coming as our Prophet said something is coming in the name of the Lord we heard him say that if he said that then it's just been Grace given to us that we're still here that we can listen to these things that we can come out fighting as Nehemiah said fighting for each other fighting for your brethren fighting for one another fighting for your wives your children and he said and your houses I love that he had your fight fight fight for these things if it's your car fight for it don't let it be at you know American Express's car or whoever the loan that's not your car yet if you got that debt on it get that thing paid off so it's yours amen if you got a house hey start working on it start fighting to get that thing paid off free ourselves clean it up yes it takes the key word sacrifice but that's where you start seeing God's grace that's where you start seeing his Mercy these these blessings that he give to you because you're on his path see there's nothing too hard for the Lord and I believe that Jubilee I believe that Jubilee is something if we can have that experience of that Jubilee I think it would really do something in our lives I love this and we'll we'll close the musicians they can come on up can't get my Masterwork here but let's go on I am going to have some sheets of paper in the back I I do want to go and pass this out because I do want it to be something tangible that you can start on I'm going to make it very simple actually brother Michael if you don't mind passing this out for me yeah that's right yep one for family and this is just the action word so what what this is that I'm I'm going to give each person I don't know why this thing is what I'm passing out is is what's called a spending plan okay and what it is once you get it you'll see that it has a lot of different categories on it and it has all pretty much all of the spending areas that you could spin things on so so I I really want you to start getting familiar with it that's that's the goal just to get familiar with it to start looking at it easy easy assignment to see if you do you see any other expenses that you have in your life that's not listed here so it's talking about mortgage you have second mortgage home insurance real estate taxes ground rent electricity water bill sanitation Bill telephone bill look at all these things that wants your money auto payments gas Insurance life insurance Dr dentist eating out lunch snacks movies babysitting subscriptions activities you name it it's all the categories that should cover pretty much all of your expenses all of the money that's going out so you can take a pencil and you can go back if you want to do more work just try to see if you could fill this out you don't have to do it but I want you get more familiar with the categories because as we continue with financial Jubilee we're going to go into some of this some of the spending and just looking at it because I want you to see a plan I want you to see your own household plan even if you've never done anything like this before in your life just to be able to see like wow okay okay and then husband and wife you can have something like this that you both can see your wife can know what's going on and if hey we can't have secrets we got pray God help us you know we we got to be able to to work together um through some of these things and all of these things is what God wants us to have you know to where we can kind of relate to each other we can make decisions together and things like that but I want you to take that take a pencil and see if you're able to fill out some of those things for your expenses that you spend on a month okay and and this will show you so and I know some people may have variable incomes that means their money fluctuates you don't have to worry about your income for now I'm worrying about what you spend out what you spend okay so your food your groceries start thinking about those things oh how much do we spend on groceries a month huh how much do we spend eating out a month huh okay uh how much is our electricity electricity bill gas start getting an idea of those things if you got receipts keep those receipts it'll help you you know and God wants us to be diligent in everything that we do and this becomes a framework for you to help you on this journey I want to conclude by just sharing you you know with our Prophet I want you to see something that just has been a blessing to me brother Brenham as we know he had that tax situation and he came home he said 'I looking forward this week to a Revival in my own soul I told my wife yesterday when I heard some good news and I rushed over and threw my arms around her and I screamed I'm free and went out into the room and started weeping and I said you know I want God to give me a Revival in myself I said for about five years I've been choked down under a great burden that's been released now the message itself should give you a clue return and Jubilee that was preached in 1962 November he said yesterday yesterday we know what happened after that we know what started happening in 63 but look what he's telling you something released that choked down feeling that he had in his life I believe paid away paved away for his spirit amen to be in an attitude a mindset to receive what we are living off of today amen that's what it did he got free by the grace of the Lord said Billy you're free a couple
