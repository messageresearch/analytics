have to cough that's right won't have to be sick won have to catch your breath wow wow clear set of loans my dear clear set of Lo clear set of loans remember today after this service obviously since we've got a crowd here today we're it's time to go eat some Christmas dinner and have some gifts given out and um honor the church by giving you a dinner down at Hidden Acres so when we get finished for this service which will be pretty short now and that's okay because I only got um one thing I'd like to to bring out to you and um if if if Bob will quit preaching my sermons we'll just uh we'll just that's the way the Lord works though cuz we don't call each other and and talk about it but uh I was thinking on this as he was showing the the history behind it but I was thinking more on the line of there was a guy stood up one day and he looked at the Lord Jesus and he said what is truth it was a question pilot was perplexed he said what is truth Jesus had already said many many months before I am the way the truth and the life but pilate didn't hear that pilot wasn't there but what is truth that's what we're going to talk about today um for just a moment remember brother Lis will be speaking for us Wednesday night get some of these announcements out of the way uh remember the prayer service will be this coming Saturday at 7:00 come and we're just going to pray we're not going like I said we're not going to have any Fellowship uh coffee no we're just going to come and pray we'll open the doors have soft music on and background music and then you just pray in your own way and everyone is welcome to come I believe that's why we're having good Services is because the Lord is pleased that we're taking out a moment of time to come and pray sure you can pray at home you can pray in your car you can pray anywhere else but you make an effort to come here I believe the Lord to give you a little extra something special all right that's just how I believe it and we'll be praying for the watch night meeting which will be the 30th and 31st we'll have a Friday night service at 7:00 brother Wayne Lawson will be here and a Saturday night at 8:00 it'll be our regular watch not service and we'll be letting you know a little bit more about what to bring as far as finger food and things that we'll have before and after the service so just keep that in your prayer also remember February the 11th keep that on your calendar that will be our annual um Valentine's banquet I can't remember how many years I'm sure brother Joe and some of them could could find that out how many years we've had this thing and and all of you remember last year we almost got snowed in U it was a 3 or 4 Ines of snow before we got ready to leave so uh but that's all right everybody made home and and stay but we'll be announcing that more but just put on your calendar February the 11th and we're going to do it a little bit different this year like I said before we're going to open it up where that if you are a couple then you can bring a couple with you they don't have to be believers they don't need to be drunk but I believe we ought to be as a church we ought to be an Outreach we ought to be able to bring the community or your we saw that in know how I know they're watching in now but it it softened up their in-laws that were really hard-hearted about the message because they saw love projected in you that went they had not seen it before they saw it in you that went all right so they didn't see it from somewhere else they saw it from you so we're going to project that a little bit further because all them are coming down from Ohio plus the um the in-laws on one side and we're trying to work on the other ones but we're want to open it up to where say June and I can bring a couple with us and they got to be a couple and they got to be married and uh and we'll have a um a good time in the Lord and and I'm still praying about it and I may have a a guest speaker just speak for maybe 20 or 30 minutes and then we will have some fun like we always do we'll always have our games and prizes and and Freda and Paul will be able to come my goodness C and and um Lily and Zach we got some extras coming who knows it's February you never know between now and then oh anyway so just keep that in prayer did you have your hand up J what you need sure come right home y'all have to excuse me I do not like speaking in public um but it was just on my heart last night and this morning to say thank you to God and to this church um when my dad died at the end of 2020 I had nothing I felt like I was empty like my emotions were completely gone like I was a desert inside so I had started coming to church every other weekend driving here from Tennessee and someone told me to step out cuz everybody kept asking me are you moving are you moving well I didn't know you know it was not something I've really thought about a lot and someone told me to step out so I did I just put my resume out there and I got a job here in Georgia in Gainesville great job moved down and this church became my second family every one of you some of you I didn't even know had never met Ever every single one of you as become extended family to me made me feel so welcome here so loved I do have biological family here which I love my brothers to death my my sister-in-laws are great my nieces and nephews are wonderful but especially Aaron and Sarah welcomed me into their home let me live with him until I can find a place that is mine not just some place that I can live but some place that is mine I hope God blesses them in the biggest way for that right my job I found out Friday that I am getting a promotion in a huge rate so I want to thank God for that amen I lived in Tennessee for a long time that place it became comfortable it became convenient it's where my mom and my sister is and some of other my family when I moved here I missed a lot about Lebanon a lot and every time it gets to the point where I start second guessing where I should that I should be here or not somebody in this pull pit always says put God first God has to be first every time and every time I hear that statement that goes away that feeling of second guessing whether I should be in Georgia or not goes away instantly because this is the church where I feel where I get fed amen I have been to other churches and I enjoy the services greatly every church I've ever visited but this is a church where I feel like I get fed by the word and where I get fed emotionally from you all am so I just want to thank you all every single one of you to for being such a huge huge wonderful church family and I also want to thank God for healing my mother yes amen than right there is one thing that God is still having has to show to the world I I know that they say there's something still wrong with her but I'm just waiting for it to manifest but God says everybody we're already healed so I'm just waiting for that one thing to be finally manifested from her and I want to thank God also for healing my brother-in-law he was his heart was very very bad very very bad and not only did he get to take his monitor off his heart they're no longer saying surgery he just has to they said purely by diet he can he'll be fine so I just wanted to thank God for that too and there's probably one other thing I meant to say but looking at all y'all staring at me I'm nervous how about your house looking oh yeah that I it's not mine yet but I found I looked at a little house yesterday that was so cute and it's perfect size perfect place to live I just I'm waiting for God to say yes that's yours or no that's not quite where I want you claim it so I'm hoping I'm praying that it's mine but I'm also saying it's God's will God's Will has to come first above my want that's right but I am saying God if this is your will I'm ready for it this is what I want amen but anyway I want to say thank you all I appreciate every one of you and I thank God greatly for putting me here where I'm supposed to be right amen amen amen you believe that amen I think we all have a testimony pretty much like that too so we pray for sister Janine and the family there and I know they missed their dad he was a wonderful guy but uh he's in a better place he's looking down on us today I believe and says hey that's my daughter so let's go to Lord in prayer we'll read this scripture and then we'll we'll speak just a few minutes so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this testimony that we've heard Lord thank you for the gifts that you've given us in this church Lord 365 days a year not just one day Lord I pray that you just be with each one that's not here be with the ones that are sick we have several that are out Lord that are setting at home we pray that you just touch their heart even as the word Goes Forth today Lord and they be healed touch their bodies Lord we pray that you'd be with un that are sick the ones that are sin sick Lord be with the ones Lord that are that are not with us for any such reason father we pray Lord that you just be with us in the further of this service just help us and lead us guide us into all truth in Jesus name we pray amen let's read this real quick and you be seated uh we're still on Hood a son of man but I kind of wanted to me and the Lord were chuckling yesterday and uh yeah I believe he has a sense of humor and yeah thank you brother I think he does too and I'm going to we're going to talk about truth today just interject a little bit about truth but this time of the year is the most lying time untrue time you'll ever see and we'll look at that in just a minute so in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld the glory the glory of his only begotten of the father look full of grace and what truth all right so let's read psalms 8510 the Bible says mercy and Truth are met together righteousness and peace have kissed each other truth shall spring out of the earth what Earth down here no earth right here all right everybody with me truth shall spring out of the earth and righteousness shall look down from heaven you may be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been talking about the Statue of a perfect man but I was thinking yesterday and talking to the Lord a little bit about truth cuz you you look and you see you know you have phrases like Moment of Truth and and it ain't nothing but the truth and and you hear all that and like I said before it was chuckling yesterday I mean this time of the year we've got a man that flies all over the world at the same time delivering present in a sleigh that flying reindeers drive and one of them's got a red nose we laugh but that's what you taught your kids right we try to keep them from lying but we tell them the biggest lie soon as we they're born and growing up uh we have deer that fly we have snowmen that come to life and talk and and frosty goes away and comes back next year have you ever thought about the silliness of that we're we're laughing today but 99% of us older ones have told our kids the same thing right we told them an untruth and this world is full of untruth but there is one truth and it shall spring out of the earth that's what I want to talk about just for a few minutes today because what brought me to that point is is someone called me the other day and we were talking about something and and what it was was a a doctrine that this Minister had just you know sold his soul on and and pre preached it for years and years and and and and how that you came here with eternal life that you came here with the seed inside of you and you were always Eternal and you never were lost and all that and then about two weeks ago he got a revelation he said well it could be the other way it could be the other way well now you You' built your foundation and everything that's what I said about when we when we go out into the world and we talk to people and we and we give them the gospel listen give them the gospel give them the truth of Jesus Christ first but there is a part of the message that sometimes they're asking well why you do this and why you that are you going to tell them a lie no you going to tell them the truth amen right and if it's contrary to their truth come on they get ill so do you if I preach a doctrine that you don't like you get ill you the person get ill yeah now if you got the Holy Ghost the the Holy Ghost doesn't get ill right but you get ill that's why we talking about the memories and conscious effects and Imagination you go back on your what on your past but I want to read you something and it came from a man named M Richard Oliver listen to this letting people be wrong about you are a situation false Doctrine while keeping your PE and focus is the most Mi misunderstood power move that you will ever make let me break that down one more time letting people be wrong about you like that brother with the false Doctrine he kicked people out of church he didn't want to fellowship with people and we've done the same thing in the past maybe but letting people be wrong about you or a situation while keeping your peace and focus yeah focus on the truth instead of trying to go back and in other words jump into his pit and try to straighten him out but Focus your peace and focus is the most misunderstood power move you'll ever make because what's happening is we've got a group of people that left the church we've got groups of people I don't know if some left here because of Doctrine I hope not cuz I think we preach pretty much the truth all the truth but we have some of you left other churches and come here because of of a Doctrine right but I hope we're to the point to where we know one thing for sure if it's truth it will always Prevail that's right if it's truth it will always Prevail it doesn't matter if you've got 75 listen Jesus was what the way the truth and the life amen he was hated that's right by the whole world Amen hated because he was the truth he didn't just tell the truth he was the truth and if you got him inside of you what does that make you truth shall spring out of the earth your Earth but when you come to truth and you stand there like this quote says you stand there and you focus and have peace in what you are amen you're standing in the truth guess what if there a child of God I say they with false Doctrine folk that are untrue guess what they'll come around amen cuz you cuz cuz cuz God's people's always got to come to truth amen if you're a child of God you will come to truth it doesn't matter what but but don't get so muddled up and say I'm the only one didn't Elijah do that one day Elijah said Lord my I'm the only one that hadn't bowed to bail lord said hang on a minute Elijah I got about 7,000 in some other cities that you don't know about they're children of mine too and I said that he said they just believe the same thing you believe they just weren't right there where Elijah could get on Facebook and contact them am or colum or whatever you want to say social media can't get away from social media everything's on social media now but and they use it for a pull pit which I hate but there's nothing you can do about but keep your peace and focus in that time that you think that you think that you have the whole world's against you listen the whole world's against this message didn't they tell Martin Luther said Martin Luther the whole world's against you he said tell the whole world I'm against them cuz if you're against the truth if you are the truth the way the truth and the life if this message and I'll read it to you in a little while if this message is the truth there's none other that's right there's none other that's right it's false that's right listen you and I were born on a lieen right every one of us were born on a lie right one lie told several thousand years ago to a woman in a garden that's right amen it was a lie yes there was some truth in it but it was a lie yes that's right that you're born by that's why you have to be born again and then what become truth that's right if Jesus says I am the way the truth and the life we've got to come to that yes listen to this I want to read in just a few minutes I'll read a u a um definition because the definition of Truth has a lot to do with faith yes cuz they go together amen faithfulness and truth faith and Truth they all go together all right cuz listen you got to have faith in what you believe that's right all right so listen to this so what happens is here in Jude we've been reading this before but it kind of struck me again that you should earnestly contend what for the truth am I changing the Bible no no earnestly contend for the truth which was once delivered unto the Saints the truth of the what of the first church age no false Doctrine but look what happens certain men come in what unawares telling untruth are telling lies Paul even call them fables men preaching fables Santa Claus Easter Bunny think about it ungodly me men but not ungodly men that's dragging you off to the Beer Joint right he's teaching an untruth in the Pulpit right because he turns look turning the grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ second Timothy 25 says study to show yourself approved unto God a Workman that needeth not to be ashamed what rightly dividing the word of Truth amen rightly div in today you're going to divide whether this is truth or not right amen now Jesus said my words there are what truth and life amen so if we preach the word to you today that's truth and it's life yes everybody with me on that but just to understand listen we live in a world of Lies we know that we were born a lie we tell our kids lie our kids tell us lie we lie to everybody everybody lies to us I know we don't as message Believers but 99% of everybody else are they going to lie yeah right oh don't get quiet on me yeah no they going to lie but why Jesus told him said you're of your father the devil and he said the truth is not in you amen the truth is not in you that's why you lie listen to this right here the word truth in Hebrew the Hebrew lexican when you see the word truth in the Bible this is what it means and the word truth is in the Bible 271 times times all right starting back in Genesis all the way to Jesus's time and on into Peter firmness faithfulness shess reliability stability continuance now you think back on on what today every one of you sitting here today has some basis of truth in your head right now I'm sorry your truth in your head right now may not be the truth but it will be maybe some symbol of Truth well I don't think this I don't think that well we're not talking about your thoughts we're talking about what something stable I remember you know I read the scripture to you several times in the last few weeks that a double-minded man is unstable right in what in his word are in truth he's unstable he don't know what to believe he believes this one day he believes this another day that's right we've got to come to one truth not two not three one truth am that's why if we get Jesus Christ in our heart that'll boy that'll help a lot to get you to the truth cuz he is the truth but look faithfulness and reliableness there's not many liars that I trust well that hurt everybody's feelings there no I don't trust a liar you can't cuz you don't know what he's telling you maybe a lie and you know what a lie is wrong but reliableness faithfulness you take a pastor like brother Dale stood here for 50 years amen we relied on him to teach us the truth yes amen we rely on the ministry to teach us truth we don't rely on the drunk to teach us truth we don't rely on The Neighbor Next Door if he's not born again to teach you the truth he can't because Jesus said the truth's not in you that's right amen let's go to Proverbs 16:6 just for a moment like I said we'll get done about 11:45 and we'll head on down to the Hidden Acres some of you are new that hadn't been was here last year um going to the Hidden Acres just follow somebody it's only about 8 Miles just follow somebody and they'll get you there cuz 99% of you has been there but we got a few new ones and we sure appreciate that we appreciate God sending us some some good young people and some and some good old people Amen brother brother klie walked in the door and Terence was going we'll wait on you brother klie told you not to be running in the hallway brother klie used to come out that step back under a little faster than he does now right but you know what the truth came through the door that was truth you saw truth walking in the door they've been faithful him and brother D's been faithful the rest of you may have been but I'm telling you brother klie and brother Dy has been just absolute pillars in this church amen come here sit brother dy's wife can't make it to church brother colie's wife passed away several years ago you know what that been a real good excuse not to come to church guess what they come to church amen and they're in their late 70s now and they just drive around on an hour and a half to church shame on you people that don't can't drive 15 minutes to get to church that's right I'll say Amen myself Proverbs 16 Verse 6 says look by Mercy and Truth watch iniquity is purged by Mercy and truth truth will drive out iniquity now what the Bible tell us about iniquity in this age in this last time iniquity shall what abound and the love of many shall wax cold why they don't no I and and forgive me but it's the only way I can preach yesterday we had a a little Christmas thing at Gillsville at the town and uh yeah we had Santa Claus but uh there was a there was a a pastor there from another from a Baptist Church and I was going to have him pray when he came in and well he comes in and he's got this big water a CH back in his mouth and I started not to but I had already asked the brother I said where's your pastor and he said he's right there I could tell he just look like somebody been working on a farm had a little backer in his mouth you know but you see that and then he stands in the pull pit and preaches the gospel now we all have faults and failures but that's a sure sign that if I look at it and you looked at it it'd be wrong there's something he needs to overcome he hasn't overcome the world yet right amen so that's that's what we but see we look at and maybe his truth come on somebody maybe his truth said it's okay right the people that run a restaurant they went to a baptism yesterday closed the restaurant they're Catholics they went to one of the little sprinkling things because listen in a Catholic Church where's Anna in a Catholic church if your baby's not baptized it goes to hell right right if that baby dies it goes to hell don't pass go no collect no $200 if you're not sprinkled that's why they get them as quick as they can they take them to the priest and have them sprinkled or whatever they do but you know what though they took that as truth the Nan Council took everything they had as truth and man has walked in that for years that's why we had to S have somebody to turn us back to the truth the truth of the Saints of the first church age and thank God you and I are recipients of that today the world is not recipients of this you and I are recipients of this by Mercy and Truth iniquity is Pur by the fear of the Lord men depart from Evil John 1:14 we read it just I'll read it all the time look the word was made flesh look full of grace and truth that should be me and you if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost full of grace and truth John 1 verse1 17 I'm going to read you a quote here in just a few minutes minutes but you take a minister of the Gospel like brother Dale different ones ministers here that are preaching the truth and and they have a responsibility Beyond any other Baptist Methodist Pentecostal whatever and most of people in the they have a they have a responsibility to teach you the truth right because what that truth is going to do is what what's the truth going to do when it comes to you I'm sitting back there with you now the truth's going to set you free it's not going to bind you that's why when people look at the messy hour they say oh you poor people you're bound you're bound to this man you got to wear your hair long and you got to wear your dresses long what do you mean you can't wear pants they wear pants and shorts to church now so I mean come on but we don't but they're saying you're not in the truth there's got to be a separation somewhere but there is like I said before we've got to establish Lish a truth and say this is that yeah that's right we got to establish a truth look for the law was given by Moses but Grace and Truth came by Jesus Christ you got to mix that Grace and Truth together everybody with me on that get here real quick John 4:23 said but the hour cometh and now is when the true look when the true worshippers all right so that excludes the nontruth worshippers I'm reading you the Bible I'm not discluding people the Bible remember what brother Brown said he said Jesus he said God is a segregationist amen amen God says get away from that thing it's the devil but the hour cometh now is when the true worshipper shall worship the father in spirit and in truth now this is Jesus talking for the father seeketh such to worship him he goes and looks for a good congregation that'll worship Him that'll sing a song like we just heard a few minutes ago and everybody said oh that's me that's my God he moves him unmovable amen glory god is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in what Spirit everything is connected to truth you can't say just worship Him in spirit cuz remember power without character there you go see this is fence right in with the Statue of perect man power without character satanic amen but when you take the spirit and you put it in truth it's got to be right that's right well I don't know if it's right or not you better get in the altar somewhere yeah amen cuz I'm going to read you a quote here in a few minutes and remember one more time truth always prevails amen I don't care who it's coming from truth will always Prevail over nontruth you just got to stand there and hold it you got to stand there with some patience and some knowledge and some Temperance to know that that brother's in error and you don't go out and lambast him you pray for it that's that's brotherly kindness you pray for the person and then guess what few months later God May soften his heart up and he'll come back and say cuz I'm going to tell you something folks there's one truth that we have in this church that a lot of people don't have and that's the truth of Daniel 70 weeks now some of you may not understand it but that's okay there is a there is a truth of Daniel 70 ws and and most people 99% of the people in this message do not have it right I hear ministers say Amen some of you may not know that but I'm just telling you if you've been to ministers meetings and you've been to brother col's been to them way back long y'all were talking about this 40 years ago amen and what did they do then they ostracize you they cut you off and say a you're foxs yeah amen oh that ain't true that ain't what he said you just hang on though yes just hang on brother Claude weinger when I started going out there a lot preaching brother Jess was still alive brother Jess said said brother way said said come out here and preach us uh um uh I think we had a Friday Saturday and Sunday he said now he's at the pastor come he didn't say Daniel 7 to week but he said come out here and preach us a Doctrine preach us something teach us for three days pick topic oh buddy I pick Daniel 7 week well see why y'all say oh my why' y'all do that for why' y'all stay on my CU it's a contention in the message about Daniel 70 WS brother no Johnson see says that's a shin kicker you understand what I mean you under the table kick somebody in the shin I ain't right so I went out there for three days and I poured my heart out I gave them the charts I read them the message I read them the Bible and and I got some feedback back no Rotten Tomatoes but I got some feedback brother Jeff said he really didn't understand it brother Claude said that ain't right and one of the deacons wrote me a long letter that ain't right I said okay prove it to me well brother Brown said I said hold on a minute one more time the Bible's right what is the truth the Bible's the truth you got to make that quote that seems wrong match the Bible am and the Bible says that there's after the Antichrist puts out a contract there's one week left and I even told him I said I really don't care what brother BR saying cuz you're making him say something false right that's not what he's talking about am you're not understanding that weak he's talking about cuz he can't change the Bible that's right but then I kept talking to brother Claud he kept calling me and I kept talking to him kept talking to that Deacon and we go you know I remember I was going out there about over two weeks when they were you know looking for me to be their Pastor or something oh a long time ago but um I go out there for two weeks boy that's the first thing I get off the airplane Claud would be going all right I've been studying this what does this mean right here well now let me just get skip to the end of the story the end of the story is he understands it just as clear as a bell I waited on him to come to the truth amen I let him ask the questions and the Deacon asked the questions and then once it all cleared up they said well they're like hay right well I ain't nothing but the truth amen see that's bringing that's letting truth have its work let truth have its day but it may not be the first day amen it was several maybe months before they come to the truth when I see Claud understands it the the Deacon understands it but now people can't understand when CL preaches it so listen you're not going to understand something if you don't want to right you just cut yourself off and you'll not understand it you know that's for the Jews it's not for us well it does have something to do with your Redemption amen amen and the truth of that Redemption so so what am I saying is you if somebody had something against you even like brother Dale 1974 he preaches the Daniel 70 weeks or 71 74 74 he preaches Daniel 70 weeks Prov that we could go past 1977 oh my word Antichrist you're going against brother randam I have a quote well are we still here are we still here huh are we still here are we still getting filled with the Holy Ghost are we still listening are we still what Christians we still believe the message of the hour then there must have been a truth hidden in there somewhere there must have been something that sorry give him give him credit he listened to God he didn't listen to man he listen to those people that said if 1977 doesn't we don't take a rap I'm turning my books in a lot of them did right P A lot of people turned their books back said I'm out of the message brother R was wrong he preached that for a purpose amen amen to get those naysayers out of the way come on Amen so that 1977 could be a year that we started our Jubilee that's right the whole word started opening not that God sent us a prophet but God sent us a prophet with a message and that message is what going to take us out of here but he had to stand on that where nobody else they laughed him to scorn he had a a dream about Anna I had a little seven or eighty old girl blackheaded you know he told a dream told dream is a dream I said all Brother D you going to miss you going to miss the Rapture so she's going to be she's going to be way older than that 1977 I mean way younger than that 1977 so you going to me that tells us you going to miss a Rapture and and you going to have a daughter in the tribulation period that's what they told him that wasn't the truth better listen to him they wouldn't had so much headache and heartache in 1977 plus amen that was the truth that's why Jesus said hey I'm the way the truth and the life any man that comes to the fathers got to come by me amen amen all right so we'll get off of that but I mean there's got to be a there's got to be a truth and you've got to realize it that it's not a man that's right yes it was a man yielding himself so that God could speak to us amen amen same way with brother brandham same way with brother Dale same way with brother Aaron same way with brother Bob brother Luis all the different ministers it's God it's you yielding yourself and letting God speak through you but you rightly divide that word of Truth by bringing in and talking about Daniel 70 weeks and the seals and the different things that we've talked about and you don't worry about somebody that can't understand it or say it calls you this or that or the other they don't bother me a bit amen like dad's always said if I can talk you out of your salvation you didn't get it to start with that's right like you always said we get them in with a hot dog get them out with a hamburger do you understand that that means we get them to come to church we give them a supper and feed them and get them to come to church but if the next Church down the road gets a steak and baked potatoes they going to go there the next time we're going to have turkey and dressing in a little while so I hope yall enjoy that John 8 verse 31 we'll be done in just a second I just want to make a few points about truth today like I said this is the time of year where it just lies it's just lies being told to your kids lies being told and I'm you know if you tell your kids that that's okay we all grew up in it so you can't s over there and go it don't bother me none yeah it does bother you somebody say amen amen thank you thank you sister John 8:31 says then Jesus then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him now look if you continue in my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth yeah and the truth shall bind you the truth will make you oh Lord help it'll make me want to come to church it'll make me want to not curse it'll make me not want to drink oh it'll make me not want to wear pants it'll make me not want to chew what ain't that what you want if you get to truth inside of you that's exactly what you'll get and look the Bible says and you'll know it well I don't know if this is right or not you know people in the message right on the borderline right well if one preacher preaches we'll step over here and he believes in return Ministry so we'll step over here yeah but now brother D brother way don't believe it so we going to step back over here double minded right you better get settled in what you believe cuz if you don't you're off the word that's right me or anybody that's and you shall know the truth and the truth shall what make you free amen amen John 8:43 why do you not understand my speech here's God Almighty saying why don't you understand what I'm saying because you can't hear my word well wait a minute they were hearing it yeah physically right just like you sit in a in a Minister's meeting you know they start talking about something and you you you get up and you give this whole uh even brother no Johnson the other day actually he looked at me and Dad and we were at a restaurant together and he said I have never heard it explained so simple and so to the point than what you and Dad you and your dad did at that ministers meeting several years ago but now he was one out of 40 the other 39 didn't believe that you are of your father the devil and the lust of your father you will do he was a murderer from the beginning and a b not in the truth amen because there was no truth in him that's right right when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own listen when you tell a lie it's yours right amen it's not of God so you cut it off right there but if you speak the truth come on somebody if you speak the truth is of god it come from God cuz he's the only one with the truth that's right amen now look because there's no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not listen that's why I made that big so we can see that and because I tell you the truth you believe me not amen John 14:6 Jesus said unto them him I am the way amen the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me John 14:16 say I will pray the father and he'll give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever what even the spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive this world hates truth that's why there's CNN Fox News yes oh don't get me started on that because it's their opinion right have an opinion over here and we have an opinion over here but where's the truth amen even the spirit of Truth the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him so if you know him you know the truth yes for he dwelleth with you and in you John 15:26 I'll hurry through these real quick because I want to read this quote to you but when the comforter is come whom I will send you unto you from the father even the spirit of Truth what which is the Holy Ghost which proceedeth from the father he shall testify of Me John 17:17 sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth as thou has sent me into the world even so I have sent them you into the world and for their sakes I sanctify myself that they also amen might be Sanctified through error oh what did it say truth is it through truth that's the only way listen to this I read you this not too long ago Galatians 4:16 am I therefore become your enemy because I tell you the truth that's what I mean you're born in sin sh you're born a lie right so you can't stand truth come on we try our best to tell the truth we do I'm not I'm talking about in the world but how many of y'all were Liars amen I'm right got my hand up I was a liar cuz the truth wasn't in me then when you tell tell a li I told my kids when you tell a lie you got to tell another one to cover that one come on then you got to what tell another one but if you ever tell the truth you tell it one time that's right and you can tell that same story all the time one time it doesn't deviate but when you lie that's why lawyers keep you keep getting keep asking you the same question get you to lie or get you to tell your lie so study to show yourself approved a Workman not needs not be ashamed look rightly dividing we already read that look watch this talk about Philipus and hus they listened to Paul's preaching they got a untruth from Paul but Paul was preaching the truth who concerning the truth have aired saying that the resurrection has passed and overthrow the faith are truth of some 1 Peter 1 says seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth yes you don't just believe it you got to obey it amen through the spirit unto unfeigned the love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently and in being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth in B forever ever third three 3rd John 1:3 look for I rejoiced greatly when the Brethren came and testified what of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth I have no Greater Joy than to hear that my children walk in truth you're not going how do I please God Walk In Truth amen now the word truth according to Webster's Dictionary is a body of real things real events yes and facts actually the state of being the case a fact talks about spiritual but look a judgment a proposition or idea idea that is true are look are accepted as truth see that's not of God if it's accepted as truth it's something else like the trinitarian doctrine it was accepted as Truth at n but it had no truth in it at all everybody with me on that that's what that means all right the body of true statements yes and propositions the property of being in accord with what fact or reality do you know if you tell a a lie it's not real think about that when you tell a lie that means you fabricated something that's not true in your mind right cuz if you tell the truth it's exactly what that is this is a black boot right not going to take it off this is a black boot that's a fact but now some of you that can't see it so well I think it's white well you fabricated a lie cuz that's black same way with the word of God you fabricated a truth it's got to be a lie and it can't be anything with substance that's why hell has no substance hell has no bottom to it cuz it's a lie we weren't supposed to none of us go to hell right hell wasn't created for us that's right right sincerity and action character and utterance Fidelity or constancy I want you to listen to this quote right here everybody with me we'll close right here we'll sing maybe one song watch this right here this is from the token 1964 I want you to listen to this listen do you believe that Jesus Christ lives and Reigns today congregation says all right do you believe that I've told you what I've told you is the truth amen amen it's the token the requirement I only can speak what is truth this is Brother BR if I believe it was a prophet right want to make sure we in the same congregation I only speak what I see what I hear and what's revealed to me listen to this and why I say this of the tens and tens thousands of times I looked up if you'll look up that word truth brother Brown says that probably 90% of the time he says it in prayer line do you believe I told you the truth you believe I told you the truth you believe if I've told you the truth God will do this you believe I told you the truth God would do this and they say yes you know what God manifest what he said by telling them they were from another country or they were riding a horse yesterday or driving a blue car or something and why I say this of tens and thousands of times not one time has ever failed to be what true why cuz it was a fact he saw it happen amen now that has to be God Amen that has to be God he says it twice well would God give a Ministry like that come on somebody would God give a Ministry like that to somebody that didn't know what they're talking about would he identify himself as that sear there and then turn around and give him a mixed up word the guy that denies that's the one that's mixed up and God ain't mixed up God is his own [Applause] interpreter people leave his message all they want to they're the ones that's mixed up that's right that's right if you don't believe that then you know there's a Moment of Truth yeah all of us are going to come to a moment of truth there's going to be a countdown brother around said there's going to be something that's going to come and we're going to come to a place and you going to have to make a decision one you are going to have to make a decision what is truth as pilus says what is truth I don't have enough information well you got enough information amen listen to this one more time this and then we'll close and then we'll just stand I tell you what we'll stand and then we'll pray and then we'll go eat all right cuz it's 11:48 now we need to be down there in about 20 minutes now they don't have this one I just pulled it off the computer Moses after he received his commission this is cadis bar 1956 went down to Egypt and delivered the children of Israel one great mistake we find and one great thing as it was in that day so it is today when we find out that Moses went down and got the children of Israel and brought them out the phenomenal had been done now here it is I don't want to hurt you I don't want to shake you a jerk to hide off of you for I wish to preach the truth there's one thing about it brother the truth will never make you popular popular right the truth will never make you popular amen but the truth will make you honest that's the one good thing and well had you rather be honest than to be popular listen this one read this I got to read this quote this a good one All Nations and kingdoms Must Fall 1957 brother Brown faith wants to deliver to the Saints every Mortal must give away the immortality don't disregard those words because it comes from an uneducated person talking about yourself don't regard it because that person the person that I am but regard it because that is the word of God everybody with me and that God himself it's what he's saying he's fixing to get a prayer line if I've told the truth will vindicate it to be the truth if I'm false then my preaching's false then my Doctrine is false then I'm false with it and if I preach perishable Doctrine and a perishable Christ I'll perish with it but if I preach the imperishable word of God and an imperishable God I'll live forever with him I've done my best I can't do no more except to God to shake your heart to believe amen once more I ask him in Christ's name to let this happen again tonight for the glory of God let's stand to our feet but God didn't do that through a prophet just for him to take it back with him in a grave that's right it's to give me and you confidence to do the same thing we must believe that we're being preached the gospel too the truth of the Gospel that's right and know that you know that you know that you may have to stand alone this church may have to stand where nobody else wants to fellowship with us I don't care I'd rather be right than be popular that's right amen there's a lot of popular preachers in this message that ain't telling the whole truth right okay but you got to decide that let's by our heads Lord today we come to you I know it's a hurried time of the year we laid a lot of things aside we've heard some beautiful singing some worship Lord and I pray that the word of God went forth as we were like I said yesterday we were kind of giggling about the world telling so many lies and Wan their k to tell the truth but I believe you said you were the way the truth and the life as brother Bob brought the truth of St Nick the truth of this part that Santa Claus we know that we know that father you were born in April you were not born in December but Lord maybe this will remind us that you had to be born and that you were born by the word of God amen amen you were the truth you you were the life maybe that'll remind us in this time of as your Prophet preached those many sermons why it had to be Shepherds God's wrapped gift your Prophet I believe like Christmas like I do because a lot of people are are more jovial and friendly and kind to each other Lord but let us realize you had to be born because when we come up in April and in Easter we're going to celebrate your death and Resurrection so Lord just for a moment you had to be born a baby and Lord we had to be born again as a baby but Lord you grew up and you grew in Grace and knowledge and you stood up one day and you said I am the way the truth and the life let us never forget that Lord You're the basis of everything we do every quote that brother brandham quoted was had a basis of you behind it and Lord I believe that and for those that are not believing Lord I pray that you'd help them that you'll touch their heart Lord Lord soften their heart Lord take that Stony heart out that that maybe they want to have something different or want to or want to not be a part of this bride of Jesus Christ Lord I pray that you'll touch their heart maybe this time of the year maybe you'll unwrap them as a gift Lord and give our wayward ones back to us Lord as we unwrap that present at home sitting around the fire or maybe sitting in our living room may we remember the ones Lord maybe that are sining Lord the ones that are out in the world the ones that are not with us right now Lord I pray that you just as we unrap natural gifts that Lord they'll come a knock on the door I'm back Daddy I'm back Mama amen wife I'm back than Lord I see you've stood for the truth you've not waved you've not been wavered you've stood for the truth and I want some of that truth why may we be that way and that be the greatest gift that was ever given is to have a soul that's back in the fold of God Lord grant it father be with us as we go eat a natural meal we'll have gifts down there Lord and we'll have prayer for the meal father I pray that as we Fellowship though that we continually remember that we are in the truth I believe that we just got to make sure that we follow the truth and follow it not as a wayward child but follow it as the followers of you father just be with us now and bless us in the further of this service as we go Lord if anybody's sick here Lord I pray that you'd heal them touch them now Lord many are weary many are sick Lord some are sick at home Lord I pray as they're sitting there on their couch or wherever they're at that they raise their hands and say bye your stripes I'm already healed and Lord we may may we hear results of that we ask you in the name of Jesus amen God bless you you're dismissed go down if you don't know where to go like I
