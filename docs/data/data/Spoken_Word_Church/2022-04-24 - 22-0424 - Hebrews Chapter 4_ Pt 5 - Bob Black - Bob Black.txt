ruth had mentioned here our brother-in-law be with him all be well all the other ones brother howell and sister freda and or many many other ones that we have mentioned here lord do you know the the needs and the situations lord come down and bless them today forgive us for all of our sins in jesus name we pray amen amen be seated god bless you saints it's good to be back in the house of the lord let's just pray before we begin to study lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather back around your word lord and we just pray lord your blessing upon this little study and bless brother wade as he studies there lord we just come an expectation this morning lord grant it lord and your blessing upon this word amen so we've been studying through hebrews chapter four and we we're we're about halfway through i think and we're been looking at rest and what that is and and um and we'll just we'll just start at verse seven here and where paul says again he limited limiteth a certain day saying in david today after so long a time as it is said today if you will hear his voice harden not your hearts for if jesus had given them rest and would he not after would have spoken of another day therefore remaineth therefore arrest to the people of god for he that has entered into his rest he also has ceased from his own works as god did from his and we we we've talked before about how there's a there's always a pattern you you start you start on your journey and you believe and then you labor and then you come to a place where you're resting and not not not in your own works or not in something that maybe you can see with your eyes like that but you're resting in the promises of god what he said let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief so you're resting and and what uh not things that you can see and we we put this example at this slide of a picture just to kind of maybe set in our minds what what rest is is is jesus there in that boat and he's you know he's resting in who the word says he is and who he knows he is and and and a revelation that he he's not going to die in that boat and he has power over the winds and the waves and so he's at peace and you know you think uh just listening to brother branham before he was before the service talking about jonah there in the boat jonah there in the whale uh saying all the everything that he could see is lying vanities all around them you know you're you're resting in the promise of god and of course now jonah and that whale is a type of of a type looking ahead to when you get the baptism the holy ghost it's a it's a different kind of rest than what he had he was resting looking to the temple over there if i i know that if i pray that that's where god is that's that's the representation of god and earth but now with the baptismal it goes christ is in you the hope of glory and that that gives you a personal revelation of who jesus christ is and begins to open up the word to reveal to you what your plan what god's plan and purpose is in your life and what you're doing here and the power that god has given into the church to live to live a holy christian life so that's why jesus said in matthew chapter 11 he said come unto me all you that labor and are heavy laden and i will give you rest all those that down through the ages had labored and tried to get come to a place uh a place that that was fulfilled on the day of pentecost the rest that comes by the baptism of the holy ghost where we're looking not to our own cells but to what christ did on the cross you think about hey everything that we do and everything that we believe just centers on what christ did at the cross where he died for our sins and if it wasn't if it wasn't for the fact that he died and then rose again then there would be that would be uh everything that we'd do here would be in in vain it would just be for a gathering but you know just gathering here today this morning proves uh with the life of christ manifested in our members that that he is risen that that he finished the work and so like charles spurgeon said if you rest on the finished work of jesus you have already the best evidence of your salvation in the world you have god's word for it what more is needed so we're resting in what he did and what he said we're resting in his word so brother brown and when he would when he would explain you know when he would when he would talk about what rest is he would go back to the old testament scripture of isaiah chapter in chapter 28 where isaiah said that he is speaking of that rest in verse 12 this is the rest where you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refreshing think about hundreds of years ago isaiah talking about the rest that will be that will come on the day of pentecost with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to this people and it took so many hundreds of years before that was finally fulfilled and think about what how do you get that rest whom shall he teach knowledge and whom shall he make to understand doctrine the rest that rest comes by the word because the word as as we studied out in the greatest battle ever fault the word makes a way for for the spirit to become active in your life when you believe god's word it's not just like believing reading the dictionary or reading some some some novel or some some self-help book that you can get at the bookstore but the word is is is a supernatural thing it's this is it's the life of god when you receive it it allow it opens up a channel between you and god for god to become active in your life like for example this morning maybe maybe if it was preached that that god cares about you and and preached in that line and you begin to open up your your mind begins to open up to believe that god cares about you whatever your predicament is this morning you begin to open up when the word is preached that god is god is a healer and he died on the cross to save you from your sins you begin to open up and begin to believe that god as god is able to save you from your sins and heal your body and that's the kind of rest that isaiah was talking about here to whom he said this is the rest where you may cause the weary to rest and this is the refresh get in it at a rest when you you come you come through all this labor and then god reveals to you he just drops down right in the moment right when you're sitting in church and reveals to you that he did it and and it's over the word of the lord was under them precept upon precept precept upon precept lying upon line here a little there look because it isn't that true how you know you i i i was telling my wife this morning last night i was reading the sermon and uh i was just meditating on it and and i began to think about how years ago i read that same sermon and i didn't understand it and and and that's how the word is precept upon precept like even these things that we're reading that paul said you know think about them sitting there listening to paul talk about these things that peter said were hard to be understood and it would seem like it would be really hard for your mind to grasp or to understand what he's talking about but precept upon precept hear a little there little and then one day some it just it just all comes into focus and the picture is made clear and you know what god is talking about right that's and then you have you have a rest you're resting on you're resting because you know it's not something that you just figured out or you were educated into but it's that god revealed it to you he dropped down in that moment and it came off life off of the page into life and is a manifested word in your life living living in your members a precept a precept and a precept is is is if you really examine what that is it's a it's it's in this case it's the word actually changing your thinking and changing your like we talked about earlier that to change your thinking from where you think that god hates you to where god loves you and he doesn't want to give you the holy ghost to where he does want to give you the holy ghost and where he doesn't care to know that he does care about you and where and you know all those things that's what the preaching of the gospel does as it as the word is going forth it's precepts to actually change your thinking to mold your mind to know to so that god can work in your life that's why romans chapter 12 says and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god and as you allow the word to become effective in your life your your mind and your thinking and your actions are being transformed by that word yes it isn't that something to think about that is it's as we're all sitting here it looks like maybe sometimes like nothing's happening but just like you look at brother and we'll use the example of you look at the ocean and you don't see the water evaporating and going up into clouds and then forming raindrops and but yet something's happening because because as you receive the word your mind is being transformed and you're being changed so brother randomly say now what's the sabbath he was quoting isaiah all tables are full of vomit no one clean who shall he teach knowledge not worldly knowledge not knowledge like where you get schooled into it or something like that but spiritual knowledge who shall he teach knowledge who should he make to understand doctrine oh bless god our organization don't believe this they wouldn't put up with that care what i don't care what your organization believes he's saying what does god's word say about it oh well our pastors you know are educated oh sure certainly got so much education they left god out of it truly for you can tell them the word and they'll walk around and say well i don't believe it just that way you see you see how edgy even these things that i'm reading here it could be like just just letters on the page and education to you but see when the when it's revealed to you that's what we're talking about not just because that you can read it off the page but when it's revealed to you that's why uh you know just kind of we use the example last time to compare education versus revelation because because uh cain was there was edgy he had a good education where he thought he understood how to offer the sacrifice but it was right by revelation that abel knew that it was blood and brother adam would say he said we can't figure these things out a god is past figuring out you've got to believe it see god is known not by knowledge not by education he is known by faith and faith only and faith is a revelation that's what you're resting in that's a rock that you can rest you can you can hang your hat and your soul and everything else on a revelation by revelation not by education but by revelation abel saw that it wasn't bananas or apples that eve eat and he offered blood and god accepted it it was revealed to him i've got down there at the bottom of that scripture in ii corinthians that we we read who hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life the spirit is what is taking the word that we read and revealing it to us you know think about how many how many people have probed at um at what the seven seals are and what the seven thunders and things and you can probe at it by education but when god comes down and reveals it to you then then you know it's true then you really know it it's not something that you can just debate over the kitchen table or debate when you go out to people at shawnee's or wherever you go out to eat with believers and things but it's it's re it's revealed and it's it's it's true then you can rest on it so brother adam said in christ the mystery god revealed remember the sabbath day keep it holy one day in the week now he magnified it the rest comes from keeping the spirit of god precept upon precept and lying upon line here a little and there little hold fast that's what that what's good for with stammering lips and other tongues will i speak to this people and that is the rest that's the refreshing from the presence of the lord amen and comparing with when ruth was uh the journey of ruth when ruth was resting it was a type of the church resting in the promises of god we have the earnest now of our salvation we're not worried whether we're going over there or not we're going that's right god said so god promised it yes and we've got the earnest done being received christ has accepted us no way to get away from it now we're there all we have to do is just wait he's down doing the kinsmen redeemer we have the earnest of it right now waiting for the time that when he comes back and he said again when that next thing ruth was ruth was rewarded and we talked about how you know that the church went through the lutheran went into the baptism of the holy ocean in the last days and and now resting with the earnest of our inheritance that we know that something happened in us we we've passed from death into life and waiting groaning with nature for that time when we will receive an immortal life and immortal fullness our bodies will be redeemed what are you resting in the resting in the promises of god so hebrews 4 11 says let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief and how do you labor you labor by being at your postal duty on church you labor by doing doing the things that maybe when you get up in the morning that you don't really want to sometimes you don't you don't feel like praying but you're laboring because there's something in you drawing and pulling sometimes maybe at the end of the day you feel like the the day's been used up and maybe there's not time enough to read your bible but you labor you open up that bible and you begin to search things out why because there's something drawn in you to understand what the word says because you need you need that rest there's something laboring now now let's let's before we go to the next slide let's think let's get in our we we quote hebrews 4 12 so many times but think the context of what paul is saying sometimes for us to really understand what scripture means it helps us to put the before and after together all this time we've been talking about entering paul's been talking about entering and rest and rest comes by a revelation of the word and and and and how god gives us his word to a precept upon precepts so that we can have something to rest in when god reveals it to us so hebrews 4 12 says for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and other joints and mirror and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart the word of god is what you need to enter into rest and now i got a picture of this the way that brother brahma described that sword when he was up on that on that mountain and he lifted his hands up and a sword dropped in the way that he described that sword is it looks like this a sword that you could do with that had a little something over the fingers to protect your fingers that you can you could hold that you hold that sword out and go to dueling with somebody go to uh you know when you when you're talking to a jehovah's witness or somebody that that believes in some of these strange doctrines you you got that sword because you you have an understanding that god has given to you and you can go to dueling with it and it and the sword will protect you you can block and defend and things and and look look what the word is the word the word is quick the word is alive it's actually a living word and it's powerful that's why you know the bible says that he give us power to become sons of god and his power is in his word that if you want to be the son of god this morning and you hear somebody preach that is attainable that god wants you to give the receive the holy ghost and then that is power to you that you can take that and you can go against the devil anything the devil comes and throws at you when the devil comes with you with some kind of strange things in your mind well i don't i don't believe that it's for you i don't believe that you can get you've been sick too long that you could take that word and battle the devil every time anywhere you can battle him just like when jesus battled the devil when he came to him them three times why don't you turn the stones into bread all those different things well how did he battle the devil with the word the word is quick and powerful and see what it does this morning as as we get prepared for the for the for the sermons today what's happening is the word is actually because it's alive is acting like a surgeon that when you come to the house of god sometimes you're sick you might be afflicted you might sick in your soul and what the word does is it goes in there and it starts performing surgery now the bible says that this is a different translation it's alive and active it's sharper than any double-edged sword it penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit joints and mirror it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart so you think about somebody maybe they come to church and they that where they realize they need something and they're wondering what they need and then the word goes forth and it begins because it's alive it begins to deal with that person and deal with that individual to bring them to a place of repentance or bring them to a place to realize that maybe they didn't know what they thought they knew and so the word is actually acting like it's like acting like a surgeon where it's you know a surgeon don't don't use a dull knife the surgeon uses a lot of times they'll use that um i'm i'm drawing a blanket the material yes a scaffold but they're made out of something that's extra extra sharp because it'll go in and you when you start cutting things out you don't want something just you got to saw with or or mess around with but you want something that's going to be just slice like butter and that's what the word does the word the word preached will bring you to a place of remembrance bring you to a place of knowledge that that you need something else you think about the first time maybe that you heard that it really opened up to you that you needed the virtues and you're sitting there thinking i i thought i thought that i was maybe finished with my journey but yet now the word is open it up and it's beginning to reveal to me that there's more to this thing and the word begins to surgically change your thinking and change things and begins to remove things that aren't supposed to be there that's the sometimes the word is cutting in it you you know you you you maybe you leave feeling like you got some things sliced off of you a little bit because it's a little bit rough because that's what the word is an alive thing it's alive when brother ram said in the patmos vision he said now paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word preached actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword it went to the consciousness of men that's what the word is doing it's going to your conscience to your thinking to the way that you think about things and like a surgeon's knife it cut out the diseases and set captives free you see how you this morning if you want to be delivered of something or something something in your life that ain't right if you just yield yourself to the word and the word is the thing that was performed spiritual supernatural surgery everywhere those early believers went they went preaching the gospel the word and god confirmed that word that word with signs following the sick were healed devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last stage it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday god will give you the kingdom now look at what it's doing the word is quick and powerful as a two-headed sword sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and mirror and what we've been talking about as we go up the statue of perfect man dealing with your soul and dealing with your spirit and dealing with your body your soul dividing us under soul and spirit and joints and mirror of the joints and mayor now without without this word that opened up in this last day how would we even know what the center realm was or that you had a spirit and how those things interact with one another and you see what the word is doing is the word is being preached it'll reveal it'll cut down and reveal to you whether or not you're even born again if your soul is at rest or not and you can by the preaching of the word it will open up to you where you are you can know where you are on the statue of a perfect man and you can know whether or not you're adopted or not and you can know by the preaching of the of the word whether or not the seals have become open open to you to reveal to you the redemption of your body by the preaching of the gospel see the word is what is dividing asunder is dealing with dealing with it supernatant in a supernatural way dividing asunder of soul and spirit and other joints and marrow and what the brotherhood said he said it cuts us under the carnal from the spiritual it cuts away all of your carnal ideas your carnal understanding and and and leaves a supernatural understanding that'll give you rest because what what what the word does it's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you know you ever you ever come to church and you and and and maybe you have a need you haven't you you want something to be answered and the preacher will just preach right on that particular spot and and and give you the answer because god knows what you have need of now maybe the preacher doesn't know but the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and that's why the bible says or paul would say that the the god's word is like a mirror that when you look into the mirror it reflects back so you can see where you are you see if you're bearing the image of christ you you can see you can see it actually as as we're as we're as as the word is going forth it will unfold to you what you have need of in that moment what does what does discern means deserve means to distinguish like it's it's this is true or this is false or this is right and this is wrong and and the word is discerning the word as you listen to it just actually discerns what's what's wrong in your life in psalm chapter see what what what is a discern a discerner is like a the word what what the word is doing is like it's like a flashlight where where it's a light on your life and when the light like turning a light on in your life it illuminates whether your life is just full of cockroaches and things that shouldn't be there or whether it's something real and pure psalm chapter 119 says through thy precepts i get understanding therefore i hate every false way thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path so you know when the words going forth now listen to what the rest of this verse says as we're closing on these last few thoughts the rest hebrews 4 12 a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart and hebrews verse 13 says neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do all things are open brother bob this is a really strange image that you got up here but listen to god and god can see everything and he can see he can he can see the nature of a little dove flying arrested on a branch and down in the bottom of the sea he can see in the darkest realm he can see these horrible creatures at the bottom that would scare you and i now see that's what the word is doing the word illuminates in your life if you've got the nature of a dove or if you've got the nature of something horrible something that you know if we're if we were really illuminated by our visible eye we would be maybe shocked at it there's nothing that is not manifest in his sight he knows everything and the word illuminates what's wrong in our life or what's right in their life you have you ever come to church and you and you maybe you feel things and the musicians can go on come come forward and and go ahead and change uh start changing the service you ever felt maybe in your christian journey where you maybe you were wondering is the preacher preaching on me or something that's that's maybe the word probing is something in your life that needs to be changed but then you come to a place where like brother branham in one place he said you can come to a place where you don't feel like you're being preached at any more and that's where the words open up and the pictures being formed and you're at rest because maybe the word is illuminating that there's that little dove nature in your life and we'll just stop there and we'll continue on we're getting close to hebrews chapter five so god bless you saints [Applause] i
