with them guys for years i mean i mean i was in my twenties i was young and i thought i wasn't gonna say i'm forgetting but sam he had really been a friend and then he's been a real pastor figure also he'd been a real father figure i told him i had two people i would have considered doing my dedication for if john key would have been living he was being considered to be one he'd been a father figure and for sale so but john went on the glory and that sam is here let me see jesus will never be [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] come here for a special dedication today looking forward to it i'm coming over and yeah we finally got around to getting it all together i didn't tell brother forney but i'm i retired from going out in the uh going out and preaching for other people i just preached to my church my brother called me want to become priest i said no i just quit preaching out i said i'm i'm just going to preach the church you know stay with them no problem just be with the church and everything you know but now when you're when your son calls you [Applause] all of you are family that's what we've gathered here for today and it'll be a little odd thing i guess because i'm just never done anything on the right schedule you know i i never had no certain way of doing anything uh if you try to tie me down they tied me down the other day at a wedding and and you know i kind of got through real fast because when they tied me down that's what i'd done if they'd elected and i'll send letters that was a short wedding but see they tied me down they told me what they wanted done brother fournier hadn't told what he was done so uh eight o'clock tonight we'll try to get around to the dedication all right all right all right amen but let's just go to the lord in prayer and then we'll read one little scripture and going to hebrews 10 5. father we thank you for your love and your grace and thank you for an opportunity to come here with our brothers and sisters in my precious faith and come to do what we've always thought about we'd love to do and that would be to just dedicate our brother a church somewhere that he'd be working on it because you know he he's done his part on the field and things and now maybe it's time to slow down a little bit and just stay at home and some go out some but just stay around his people and have a family together in your loving grace we love you and we thank you just bless each one bless the church at home there today and the brothers is our ministry and we ask you to just guide each one forgive our sins and lead us in that understanding in jesus name just one short scripture hebrews 10 5. wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith sacrifice and offerings our word is not but a body can stop a pirate thing yeah you may be seated lead us into what safety to you because you know there's been many things and we'll cover some and then we'll go into it and i have some prayer claws here and see what i want to do is when we get around to the ending of it we'll uh put them over the door posts and things or take them here in the under because i i believe in that my son was in the chicken business and uh terrence and he he he would take prayer cloths and stick them around you know when they come time to tear out some of it and get done everybody was laughing because every time they pulled something down a little fluff a little thing had come floating down it was a prayer cloth you know what he's done good in his business he was retired his 40s that was all right i guess so we can do that but we'll do those things right and do it but now there's been many times in the bible time to era period time or whatever that uh a place was provided for god to dwell right all right in each one of those times he came down and he you know vindicated that what they were doing was right he was happy about it right moses built it out of badger skins and things like that made a place and god came down you know and so then you see solomon comes along david wanted to provide but he couldn't do it but his son solomon took over and he he uh you know uh dedicated a building for god to dwell in and god came down in that building and and showed and proved that he was satisfied with what they were doing but see that was still not right that was still not the uh the place god wanted even though he was happy about doing it and all the things it was still not the right one because it was not to be some kind of a building you know of wood or stone or water or anything like that it was not to be that anyway but yet he was satisfied for the time and he he did then he came down and proved to them in his glory in the building you know you know the story that they wasn't even able to minister in things because the glory of the lord had filled the building right but the thing i you know i you say well what are you going to do what are you going to say well you know we know what the real uh building god wants to dwell in and that's in the body of his bride [Music] i'm not saying that i'm just saying that he's not as satisfied with a building situation something tangible is he is into the person that has had those things and he they've come and dedicated themselves to the lord see then i do believe that when the bride today walks out the door god doesn't just sit down here and say well all the way to wednesday he doesn't he goes with the people he goes out and he lives and he he manifested himself you know through you out there really we are the building that he wanted to have built we were the positional situation where i wanted to be you know in his right order and one day see he came on earth to prove it was right he came on earth in the form of a body because it was provided for him uh they gave the old testament it took all of that time the brother branham says the the the prophets built the body you know john came to be the the neck and the parts and then jesus being the head and then to bring him into manifestation and in suing so when he was walking on the shores of galilee there was the body yeah that's why it says the body now has prepared me now we don't believe in trinitarianism we believe in one true living so it's not two gods it's not a father providing a body for a son see brother ren said it like this he said he didn't send a son [Music] he said [Music] see then that was the situation he was pleased to dwell in that body you know and that's what he says there when he was baptized and thanked and come up you know and this is my beloved son and police as well he was pleased to do that he he wasn't uh it wasn't something to just say well i'll live here for a while because he'll never separate himself from that bodily form i'll talk about the body of the lord jesus he will always have that form that when we get over there we're not going to see a father here and a son here i don't want to go here i think we've got to figure it out now we're going to see jesus you know who he is because that's the body that he chose to come and dwell in all right and and that's wonderful because that was he said i'm pleased to dwell but do you realize the day he gave you the baptism of the holy ghost he was pleased to dwell in you amen he took up his abode i mean you yeah now now we know that uh god is not like cutting up an apple giving it out and you run out of pieces you know stuff like that now the more i like to express it this way the more god gives out of himself through giving new birth to the pilgrims other people the more he gives out the greater he becomes american the more uh what would you call it more more um he just becomes greater with each one okay that way he's dwelling where he wanted to do it see then we've come here today to dedicate a building which we will do and we'll do the things and we'll do all of that and because that's what we we came to do but the main thing is is a church see is the body of christ by the new birth coming and dwelling in each one of us he comes to that and it becomes christ in you paul would say the whole glory all right and see then now he has what he's always wanted you following me he was okay with with moses that was great and he came down and he anointed the place and done all the things it was great with when it comes to solomon and he gets to that and we'll we'll get to those things in the scripture but when he got to that place he was satisfied and he'd come in and dwell among the people and they couldn't even minister because of the glory of the lord that was over the doing but still that was not the happy time the happy time was when naturally speaking now the beginning of the creation of god amen what was that when jesus become in human flesh that's right at the beginning of the creation of god god came down in human flesh amen to dwell in us as a baby amen and he was pleased to be that little baby yes and i love it the way the prophet said it he said he he was jehovah crying in the crate that's right he said he was jehovah with no teeth because he was thanking him like us because that was the way he came he had to dwell into that flesh and and to do that but there was a day came that he had to do more than just stay in that flesh he had to come out of that place and divide himself among amen his people and he's been doing that now for 2 000 years dividing it and and the house of god is being prepared because you are the household yeah look at it and just consider yourself sitting in there and it's growing in grace and knowledge right you know add to your faith birth your knowledge of god you know he's him coming in you and doing more so he's pleased to dwell that's what i like he pleased to dwell in his people that's where he wanted to dwell not to just dwell with his people in the basis of him being over here and that's over here and that's that's wonderful that would be great but the main thing is he's dwelling in us and it finishes this situation of life as you call it and we all go to glory and children see then you'll see him what you'll see is his bride yeah amen amen and you know what she'll be she'll be the church amen of the living god amen that is the dwelling place of almighty god it won't be a building it won't be a building there that would have to all go to and we go down and we'll get out and worship now no he'll be right there with you and i all through the glory of time or whatever eternity can be and he'll be doing that because that's what i was reading the scripture for a body balance for prayer david yes so he's now happy to live in that but it's to the point of what i want us to think about for a minute because i said we come to dedicate a building we will do this but what good is it to dedicate a building when the people is not dedicated what's the purpose what do you want to [Music] uh bill gates i remember reading one time something like that he built a house it was like 15 million dollars and it showed this great monstrosity sitting out there you know well that's good but my little house is satisfactory to me yes stay there i don't know i don't need no multi-million dollar home to live in well that's well and good night which i think the purpose is to see that we dedicate these bodies see then that way you're as an individual it's not us just going to dedicate a building okay we dedicate this we didn't hate the drones we dedicate it we dedicated okay glory we'll do that that's what we do because that's the part of life right right but the main thing is for you to dedicate yourself all right and educate yourself to the living god to be his dwelling place and then that way you can do it from a child that comprehends we don't know about what the age of accountability is it can be whatever you know but the age of accountability to me is when you're accountable and when you have a knowledge enough to know that you are that so then you children here today you have your part of being the body of christ so you accept jesus christ as your savior and you let him come and dwell in you and then you will grow and grow and grow and see you have your part right that way it's not just an old age time you know it's not that it it's for everything from the bottom of it all right to do to what to just build a body for god to dwell in is what went for amen and to do that it is to dedicate yourself [Music] he doesn't expect a lot out of us i love him because of that i never get to know my dad he he passed away when i was about four years old and i never i didn't get to know him you know in this world but a lot of people tell me that my family tell me that i look like him and everything you know and i got his name his name was sam and i'm samuel so you know there's things connected to my dad but i just never did get to know him that well but you see one day i found my real day hey you know and see i hope that he was my dad's dad because you know that's up to him afterwards and god to be that part himself but yet all i want to do is just be what i'm supposed to do it's nothing i don't want it i could have riches i i had opportunities in life to do to take this job or that job or whatever i wanted you know and become uh you know uh maybe with money uh but that was not my choice right it was never my choice to do that right it was my choice to dedicate my life but you know what i asked the lord what he wanted me to do and he said um you know going back to work so i'd ask him how about working at general motors you know and uh he just told me going back to work well he didn't tell me what he's gonna do i was already involved in a situation of understanding a little bit about the message and hearing about it and things you know but it began to unfold as i begin to live in my life and commit my life to him my father began to take over and you know what he began to bring in different ones so he brought in a lot of the brothers from from the plant that we worked at he brought them into the message or the hour you know and they're there in the church today some have passed on and you know but yet they're they're they're part of the body of christ looking for god and you know that you're the only god they'll ever see yeah hey you know they're not going to see them out here but they ain't going to see them now you know what i'm saying they're not going to see them in these great big buildings right right right now oh that's well and good i mean they have a multi-million dollar church i could have with the church at lula could have been a places of a better situation than what we are and i like that we could have been to where that we could have a nice building we could have paid for it not but we chose to send our money out to help the missionaries and the things and to do a little bit for them you know instead of taking it and using it for ourselves right we'll see that i think that's what my father wanted us to do you know he wanted wants to go out and do all these other things right if he do this otherwise i praise god i have a wonderful time in my christian experience because i'm always as i did back when i was working at general motor and i was what they call an absentee replacement in other words you were you had a job but my job was not assigned but my job was to if you was out of work then i would run your job that day i was just announcing deal replacement well you know every day i'd say lord where am i going yeah i said okay now daddy what are we going to do today well some days it was just a normal day you know i just went through a day building cars putting on her putting on wheels putting on this and putting off all kinds of things and being done and uh setting motors taking swing it around set it down in the car bolt it down do that i do my job but then some days you know i start talking maybe like one guy did one day and he said if you believed in prophets me and you could talk today but he just made that mistake yeah that's right and he said we could talk today if you believe in prayer i said would you proceed i said i believe just a little bit so i didn't want to i didn't want to you know beat him too hard right and tell him i knew more about prophets than he'd ever think about but you know i didn't want to do that so i just said okay and my point is i would just say lord what do you want me to do bothered me about working it's always been part of my life let's see i was just trying to dedicate my life to be something you know that someone else would love to follow that or to you know walk in those footsteps because that's what you're doing when you're dedicating yourself i see children that's where you you you're dedicating yourself to just not to do nothing but just be yourself right let's not ask a lot right you're not asked a whole lot to do with children amen that's where i see the parents going wrong you know they try to make the children do right and they won't be right you know you want the kids to do right but you don't want to do right in front of them i've always believed let's just do it this way i've always felt that way you know the work that i didn't beat the kids about what they were doing i just tried to encourage them to do that and always encourage them uh our requirement was in life was the children were to get a high school education yes sir that was a requirement because you can't exist in this life without harassment and that was my my goal you know was to make sure they got a high school education but after that that's left up to them wade had an opportunity he was in college he could have went on kept going uh terence had a college offer to it anna wound up being a school teacher and you know and doing the different things and all and they were doing it but i wanted them to at least get that first part of the education because in my day you wouldn't understand it you're not old enough to understand i'm talking about the message people when i started in this message thing there was people that was making their kids take them out of school in georgia and send them to alabama [Music] well brother branham was against children getting an education i said best i can remember um brother perry green wound up meeting uh billy paul in college and you got time enough to talk a little bit about that denominational college and billy paul let his son go to a denomination check it out see he wanted him to get an education that's right he wasn't against us getting an education right let's see it's all part of our growing okay so then we've come today to do that one thing let's dedicate ourselves to the living god to to do what he wants us to do live the way he wants us to do and he's never asked nothing out of us that he wouldn't do himself that's one way you can find out what's true or not but if you think you if you think the lord is okay with you to do certain let's say to say some of your sisters and say well i think the lord says all right if we'd cut my heart we'll just go see me talking about him i'm talking about hope to see what he said about it in the world see it all comes out to where that we can follow him and walk in the line so then the first thing is for the church here together to dedicate themselves yes you have a pastor a wonderful brother and all and you just back him up you stand behind him and you you keep him in in your prayers constantly that's to do it he just he's in my prayer every day amen all of these sicknesses and we've prayed with him and been with him and associated and we still keep doing that you know because we pray for one another and say lord all right now you know what's needed and i i like this about the lord you know the lord he's i'm absent-minded okay i'm 80 years old i'm outside-minded all right but he's not you ever thought about i can pray for everybody in this building right here and the way i can praise it lord bless the church yes he knows who i'm talking about amen so lord now you know what we need yes you know what it is and you know the situation so i don't have to but i do i go a lot of times at the church and i'll go down the pews i mean in my prayers i pray for everybody individually but a lot of times like this i'm like i remember seeing this one time and and uh a guy said well lord bless his food amen and of course that's that next thing he said hey that was a short prayer he said god knows i'm hungry sometimes i'm sleepy i'm worn out i'm tired that's the lord you know the children right then the next time i'll go down the aisle and that way that i keep my prayers constant to everybody and do it because i believe in it and that way we can do so you pray for your passion tonight all right you pray for the song leader all right you pray for the musician well that's what we'll do in a minute we'll we'll take and we'll anoint these but just remember you're in the church so the anointing's on you first amendment right and that's what it set aside to be the word it is you you're the church and see the world only church they can seize you so you don't have to be something different right right hey wait no did i go into school i just walked right in you know and i remember one time i went in there to pick him up and they had lost his ballgame football and and then they just got slaughtered and and i walked in to pick him up and and the coach and the team you know a bunch of the coast people were sitting there around the table and come on in mr dale i went through it it was a man we did we blowed it today didn't we we we we got murdered they just beat us all over the place you had fun i said you busted heads i'm here i'm a preacher hold up your pastor amen hold the pupils hold up your your officers from the church if you'll get started and get things set in order maybe you now don't but you get your offer your order i mean your your people in line of all the things ethan et cetera and you get all of that in line and you you get it all done and you pray for them and pray for them every day amen because they have a job they have for them amen so let's just stand i hope you've listened to what i'm saying how much happier could your father be for you to do out from from within your heart amen from with inside of you do you just say lord we're going to make this church work we're going to argue about what that's right where we come from what went on you know or what they're doing down there right you know brother can tell you where we're sitting at the church a hundred feet over is another church like just a hundred feet over is another church there's a church that's there you say well don't you going the other way i'd certainly rather just see a church there than to see if you're going yeah or anything but yet we get along we're happy together there you know and and all to do it because we're not trying to to do that i i i'm sorry i see that most ministers are trying to beat people into understanding salvation or trying to be a church or be whatever it is and they're trying to force you into it by their ways and means of their doing what does it matter what brother so-and-so does that's [Applause] [Music] and i don't mean it's wrong because see you can take it and make a reflection so don't make nothing just tell me what i'm saying right you know that may be the the the the fact of what god wanted maybe he wanted brother pawnee out here with just a small amount of people compared to where he come out of a church with a lot of people and see that may be god's word that's right yes all right you know we at the church we we've dedicated churches and things to them and we did well in tennessee one time and dedicated a church and turned around and there was one two three preachers and uh about 10 or 12 15 maybe people and and the thing that i said see they were driving down to the church blue and i told them i said listen as of this day i am not your pastor i sit down to this day this brother here is your pastor i said because i'm turning you over to him you know i mean for you to come back here and have it there's no need to drive in 200 miles you know one way to just get to come to church with us you just come here we'll see you i didn't mean i i hope that you didn't think i was running the ball you know but i hope they didn't think i was trying to win them either and that's the way brother forney is he just just stay with him and watch him and just walk behind him and just follow his footsteps and watching his wives are doing and seeing it he don't throw off one of these people down here he don't throw up on these other churches he just tries to be what he's supposed to be man that's the servant of god amen that's someone who has dedicated their life to almighty god to be what he wants him to be and then i know brother forney well enough to know that if one of those brothers or somebody that maybe has done this if they wanted to come over talk to him he'd be glad to have him do anything because that's just that's just for another people yeah because that's what we're supposed to be you know we're supposed to be the body of christ that's right so let's just have a little prayer dedication as to the people first then we'll dedicate the building amen lord jesus we come to this place lord what we're trying to say is from a heart of love and understanding that father you are our father and your body we're your people we're the people of your pastor the lord we come this day to dedicate ourselves to the church that's what we're supposed to be the body of christ dedicating yourself to you lord for you to take them and use them and work through them and manifest yourself through and let this little bill in here just be alive we know the building it'll be here we're going to dedicate it but lord mainly we dedicate ourselves to the point a word that the world can look around and see and see that there is a light shining forward just hear the prayers of your people solomon got there to the point that we'll read in just a second that he he got to a point and he said lord if you're people anywhere yes sir get in any kind of trouble anything the lord you hear from this temple here they they turn their eyes yes and look at you yeah and they're old jonah in the belly of the whale he didn't know what was right left or whatever it was but he was just thinking in his mind and he said i'm in a problem he said but solomon said if i turn my eyes towards that table that you would hear yeah he turned his eyes and he said in the direction and he said he's right that away and he was delivered he was set free because he done what you said you heard from that temple and you directed him to safety [Music] we dedicate these people here to your lord just dedicate themselves to you lord and you accept that dedication and you just have your way and you make it to be a church sitting on a little hill there's a lot for the world they can see you we'll all be together on that day we thank you we committed to you now father in jesus name amen or whatever because now we're going to dedicate a building because uh let's see let's read this [Music] it's really taken from first kings 91 and it came to pass when solomon had finished the building of the house of the lord in the king's house and all the thanksgiving right all solomon's desire which he was pleased to do you know first kings nine and one then the lord appeared to solomon the second time as he had appeared unto him and gibeon and the lord said unto him i have heard thy prayer thy supplication the child is made before me i have hallowed this house which thou has built to put my name there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually and he goes on to do as i said he says now lord i'm saying back to you if these people hear a prayer if they got a prayer and they're off in their own place or doing something wrong or in situations and they did you hear you here amen you answered their prayers and you come and fight their battles that's right you know that's what he did he said well do we have to look at a building well that's what i'm talking about right we're we're getting it in the wrong direction we think we've got to but they had to have a natural that's right but we're the spiritual building yeah you get in trouble just call my phone's never busy that way it's called you get in trouble just call your pastor and say that you're okay i've got a problem that's right he's promised when you hear and give an answer so let's just do a little dedication it's kind of an odd way i like to do but that's reason we've brought these we brought some prayer problems so i said my lord what are you going to do with all them i said well i ain't going to give everybody in the building one and but you can have them if you want them i mean we'll lay these up here and whatever is left over brother you can keep them and you know and if you want to if you want to pick up one of these prayer claws and put it your billfold i'd suggest uh our kids were uh set to one time wait he had a rat hole you know you know what a rat hole is to him you know for rats but he had a place in his billboard that we called her at home what that raffle was and he'll show you right now he's got some money sticking in that rat hole oh all right okay now see i always give it to him he said okay now here's you enough money 20 bucks i didn't get it give them a 20 bucks since they put it in a rat hole you get out on the road you can't get home you don't have to call me you got 20 to play somebody else you know now naturally when anna got along it was a little more natural yeah they like to rub us about that one but anna comes on up she gets a little different you know but anyhow my point is that's your prayer club yes sir he's taking one page made it up right that's generally the first thing that you're working with is built for i'd say if you want one take and pin it to your face if you're taking a look at the head of our bed you'll see a prayer bomb you go in there and i suggest you i do these things i'm honest tell you there's a prayer cloth stuck over our medicine cabinet why not sanctify your medicine put that prayer cloth in the medicine cabinet put it in your bible put it in absolutely and just say thank you lord amen you'll see we can tell testimonies of people you know all forms were that they'd say this i remember one years ago with these people this uh lady was in prison and uh somebody had sent her a prayer cloth well you know it was kind of rough in the prison and things and this other lady she said well i just can't sleep she said well i feel good said i i've got this prayer call he said let me let me borrow she borrowed a prayer claw put it on her went to bed once the sleeves left all night but you know what happened the one that gave the prayer call to it didn't sleep she just needed two of them i'm saying this about prayer club i believe in it i believe in prayer claws i believe in keeping them in my billfold keeping them in everything i've got and if you you know you do it put a prayer cloth back that's right pray and say thank you lord because that's what we're doing tomorrow so if you want to come by and do these if the brothers will some of them take two or three of these and and uh you know we don't have to you can annoy them with all if you want to because we've already been prayed over yes and they already have been anointed but if you would take them and and put them some way over the door brother one he could do that later or whatever and uh just put him up over the door the other day when that virus drove when that when that thing struck everybody was talking about this on the other the first thing i done is went to the prayer claw and i put one over these dope here i can tell you stories about the prayer clock we have a chiropractor that we go to and uh it's kind of hard to pray because you have to pray for somebody to get sick where the chiropractor can make living it's hard to pray sometimes but it's true but anyhow they told us that we're our business is really bad y'all pray for it i said okay i'll just be dead i said here i always keep him i got my billfold and i got him in acts 19. behind them there with me i took the program outside up over the door we went back about a month later a lady said we can't keep oh that's what it's for all right let's just do that but let's do the other part if you would with the anointing on and let's anoint all of these instruments and these things here just annoying all of these instruments one do you rather just do it because they're they're part of the church amen we're dedicating now the building that's right you know and and and doing it to work that we can say well okay the building is dedicated to the churches why not why not have a good time doing it i believe in yourself it us and then you come and get these parkours here and there are plenty of these and all this yeah thank you we've dedicated every everything in our building amen that's the anointing oil and remember one thing i had this to happen one time and they said well i i i need to get another prayer call i said okay what would that do you know what happened well i washed it you mean work and wash away the anointing no because i believe in it i wish we could get them back now to where we had them we had them for years of things rose that brother prairie green actually gave to us that was originals that brother random had prayed over i believe in that i wish we had them i'm good we've cut them up and give them out well you know what we do now we got a red thing up here over the pulpit and it's getting holes in the side so we rubbed it off you know and it's a little cloth we'll see we're fixing to make that practical oh we're gonna have to put another top on it well we'll cut that over i i'm like this you mean tell me you'd rather have that i'm i'm not against i'm just saying you'd rather have that seat than to have a piece off of burnt you know right here where brother only had preached to you month after [Applause] [Music] he always will let's stand together and pray now for god to dedicate to building all of the things all the instruments all of the ministers and things and i believe it this way what can't you say lord that's dedicating everything that's right it's instruments and all but another way then you don't have to worry about it because it is following the word of the what we're doing lord father now we've come to the natural part of this day and we thank you for it our brother has a nice building here lord it's fixed up and ready [Music] this little building part here is just stuck in here and man stuck it in saying well i don't know what that'll do but we'll put something here but yeah you turn it into a church to where this can sit here and people will ride around and look and see it and they'll realize that he is the building of the almighty god because the whole world doesn't look for all of these fancy buildings because they know that in those fancy buildings there's a bunch of people that's not living right right we love you we thank you for giving our brother this building here and the situation and the people and all and all to be with him lord and to worship you and we just committed all into your hands thanking you for everything in jesus [Music] name [Music] i always you know use prayer call without but i believe in the supernatural they can quit looking at the and that's what we're
