get back you know to halfway decency brother Ernie Villanueva remember him he's having trouble with his feet and remember brother Longoria because he's having problems with respiratory and everything he was doing pretty good the other weekend but remember remember all of these and you know in your prayers and just hold them before the Lord anybody that announce other things that I forget yeah Bible study will be this coming Saturday right six o'clock what are we on we done forgot we can get the message but anyhow we're on questions and answers we're let's just covered the whole thing the whole getting caboodle and two if you've been trying to get us by phone this week landline phone at home has been out all Sunday afternoon and they say they will not be fixed until August the 8th so we're going to be without a landline so you have to call on the cell phones so just call my cell phone and and it'll be there 770-539-3377 you know we'll try to keep that on but you know they say they're having trouble all over the whole state of Georgia and so just you know pray to the Lord would get us back into a phone system all right Romans 8. the heavenly father we thank you for this day we thank you for your love and your grace and your kindness thank you for you we just ask you now that you'd come on this scene today as we try to speak about you and as we try to get to people's minds into the thought of what you would have for us this day we pray that you would come in Quicken that thought into our hearts in our lives be with all of these that are sick Lord and remember each one remember Richard are especially Lord the kidney problem that he's having the kidney stones and Lord we ask you to just touch him and bless each and every one of us have your way you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe it we pray now you'd bless and open our eyes that we may be able to see in Jesus name amen Romans 8 you'll begin reading in verse 28. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God and to them who are thee now what singular he called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called in whom he called them he also justified in whom he justified then he also glorified now I like this summing it up said what shall we say then to these things what can we say to all of that if God be for us who can be against us drop over to the ninth uh chapter verse 6. not as though the word of God had taken none effect for they are not all Israel which are of Israel neither because they are the Seed of Abraham are they all children but in Isaac shall I see be called that is they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God now why is there so much Doctrine in the message of of seed lean into flesh if you happen to be born from uh Adam you can be saved but if you can't be be born from the Beast you can't be saved why is it dark when he says the flesh don't have anything to it because the the children of the flesh are not the children of God but the children of the promises are counted for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and say or she'll have a son not only this but they but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac so he's showing that the Mom and Daddy was pure everything was right why would it fall one Jacob when he saw okay for the children being not yet born neither have done having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that call it it was said unto her the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved but he saw him I hated I mean you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been on this thought this is the third message and I come in every day and give it to him and in the back back there and say well you know we just got the same old notes we've had for three services and we just keep moving off a few quotes and keep moving on Down the Line trying to understand because what are we talking about we're talking about how does God predestinate simple thought simple form we know the Bible says he does we've just got through reading it that he did well how does he predestinate and in doing that how could he predestinate without um choosing sides are choosing some people as the doctrine of predestination is you know that some people are predetermined to be saved some are predetermined to be lost Prophet said well that's a false Doctrine you know the garbage can doctrine of predestination but that's doctrines that's the way people do and they won't take anything else as I said the other day there used to be a Baptist Doctrine back in the Independence Day or that they wouldn't even have take their kids to a Revival because they was afraid the kids might get saved when it was not the will of God for them to get saved you say well that sure is done well not much dumber than what's going on now around the message the seed doctrines and the ideas they have you know and the stuff like that so it's just the same old devil he just moves up and gets into a different Realm but talking about how does God then predestinate is it because you're a good person did he save you because you were good you know what did he say to you because he's bad you know we don't really want to go neither way right we want to go according to the word and I hope you'll listen especially if I get that far if not we'll take it up later but the next message following this one I want you to uh really listen to it about the mind of God we will do that maybe this afternoon but I don't know all right foreknowledge as I said is dependent upon the basis of whether or not we believe that God is infinite amen omniscient omnipresence and all of the things we've been through all of that and it's according to whether or not we can believe that there is a God our gods see if we don't believe in the infinite God we can believe in God's many of them you know would just have anything we want but if we're going to believe in one true and living God then we've got to believe that he's infinite never can have another thought he can't change his mind he he's no way he can and still be God so then if he once says anything that's it I like the way the prophet said it and I told you boy knock me for a loot when you know he said one day he said if you can find it in the word of God he said you can call God on the scene and said if he don't do it you can call him a liar that's that's that's what you call faith in God Amen you know I mean that a man talking like that has got to be one that's had a lot of experiences you know and knowing that God is real and God will keep his word all right well see then if we can believe it then predestination as the prophet would say is a bad word to be used before untrained congregations he said really it should be you know we should use for for knowledge all right for knowledge is what it's the fact or act or whatever oh you wouldn't want to call it knowing what will take place before it takes place having knowledge before is foreknowledge all right now we've read these in a minute we'll get back to it I told you that we look at predestination we see we can back up further now I know I preached her last message or one back in there and I laid down a few things that I don't believe some of you ever thought about but we'll get back and try to show that and prove it but see the way I look at foreknowledge as you look back and you see that God foreknew all things all right now then did he predestinate that is illustrating did he predestinate first or is for knowledge first that's right that's right because see if you go with predestinate first then everything is predetermined to be right and you have no choice there is nothing for you to do you just haphazardly go along and if you happen to fall off the right tree you know maybe some reason or something maybe God might save you but if we go to foreknowledge and have foreknowledge before predestination now you're going into the channel of what the prophet is bringing so let's read them and then because I keep putting that back in there let's go to numbers it's number seven we we did get six of them read so far number seven forgive me I say either put in cough drop or shut up so I put in cough drops sorry about that if you got some other way of getting me to where I don't care so much I'll take care of that look what the prophet has to say off of the message God's covenant with Abraham in this seed 56 223 you're going into e15. now Jesus didn't come to Calvary just for haphazard thought we allowed out to our perhaps maybe somebody will feel sorry for me and come down and get saved now he didn't do it that way no no God don't run his office like that you don't run your office like that Jesus come for one specific purpose that was the redeemed those that God foreknew would be redeemed amen all right now you said see now God's not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance but in order to be God he had to know in other word predestinate is as is used in Ephesians 1 5. predestinate there isn't a good word it means in speaking of predestination to the people sometimes leads them to think that God just predestinates predestinated you push you through a little path or something that's not right predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks to Destiny I think there's five times five or six times of that direct statement everywhere from the 50s up to the 63-64. all right now and we don't look at predestination we look at foreknowledge our knowledge before well then once we get into that we can see that it's not dependent then upon God doing something before it's dependent upon him knowing what will take place amen wasn't that simple to me you know if I didn't believe in God like that that you didn't know the end from the beginning didn't right um he's not much better off than I am sure I wouldn't worry about it see I believe that he forn you all things well that's what he says all right and then by his foreknowledge he could predestinate now drop a couple of points here we'll come back this evening what is the mind of God see what do you think about the mind of God I know people preaching and say if I was in the mind of God I can be saved well Jacob and Esau was in the mind of God Judas is Carrie was in the mind of God and even to prove it both of those are written about in the Bible so when we get back to it just laying that point where you'll think then the Bible is the mind of God what else you're going with no no he had this great mind here and we'll we'll try to get there one of these days but let's just keep it to the point of looking at it from what we can follow the prophet and the scriptures the prophet says that my foreknowledge God knew that he saw would be a shyster you know we spend a lot of dwellings I said on that but we don't realize that Jacob was a shyster amen right right so you got two shysters right well okay you said no Jacob was seed well he's always from the same Daddy so if you're gonna count your lineages you got to run the lineage from Daddy right you don't run too good to try to run into the women's side all right now but the point is if there is a God that is infinite then there could never be anything the prophet will stay and he knew how many gnats would never be in the world and how many times them gnats would bat their eye how much taller them gnats would make so we're not going to pull anything over on him with our doings we may be stupid enough to show who we are and what we're doing by trying to figure out the mind of God we'll read this afternoon we'll get down to it we'll run around talking about a little bird he said that little bird was so smart said he could say a lot of words did he real talk that man he thought I'm just as smart as in human beings he said but one day a college professor came in and started making a speech and he said he used some words that little bird couldn't understand so the little bird finally found out he wasn't smart well we ought to realize we're not as smart as God and he's been an argument over the times of to organize religion and it's even into the message of predestination so we're just talking about how does he do it so we see he does what he does by foreknowledge then by four knowledge he can predestinate or in other words he can set the destiny he could write in the Bible of Jacob in a Nissan and he could say before they were ever even born it would be he could write in the Bible and tell that they would have to be someone I'll get my point if there'd have to be someone to uh they'd have to be a Judas you know and it would speak about him in the Psalms of how his vows would gush out in the things would the Judas have a change well they want with the Lord for three and a half years pretty good change right amen and until he was such a nice guy as the prophet would say he would be the man of the year and said everybody voted him the treasure in pretty good position right one of the original but yet God knew what he would do well see we say that Judas couldn't be saved we saw it say that Cain couldn't be saved what the Bible said about Cain said would you not been accepted if you've done what your brother done you know paraphrasing it and we throw off on Judas as being such a bad egg but we don't go off on Peter for denying the Lord Jesus three times and then cursing and doing it was Peter better guy than Judas no Judas was just trying to make a little money he didn't deny Jesus he confessed him right yeah right did not he lead him to it you see Peter did not even know any well yet we want to make some kind of a line or a lineage to run it down we want to try to make something out of it you know but yet what is we make out of it garbage can confusion let's just keep reading a little bit let me read a good bit today okay because if we don't we're going to have these notes this evening all right so look at number eight let's read a little try not to comment much just read this is from the message the resurrection of Jesus 56 405 paragraph about brothers worry estranging reading taking his word now that God way back before the world ever begun I begin to see the thing unfold and know then that right there is a simplest statement could be made but yet an outstanding one that should confuse every scholar and Robert brain that'll get that across you know look how do you begin to see the thing unfold and no now little statement God didn't make a choice then amen amen okay it's up to you God could not could say the word predestination the word predestinated as I've always said is not a good word to use to the public because predestination means perhaps to to to predestinate things to happen but God could predestinate by foreknowledge he foreknew what would be not willing that any should perish but that all would come to repentance but being infinite and God he could predestinate and foretell by knowledge for knowledge all right as well as stated predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks on to the destiny and God in the beginning could see all things the way it would happen therefore he could tell this will be this way and that'll be that way and this will be this way in that that way because by foreknowledge and once he wasn't willing that the left side would be wrong you know or you know what I mean the right side be right do you what see he didn't choose see that's what we make it look like that God chose then predetermined everything got to be connected to foreknowledge he said well that's that old four knowledge Doctrine inside of predestination well sounded like your Prophet believed it so you know I think I'll just go along with it don't you because listen if he doesn't for no he's not God and and if he doesn't if he doesn't do that why are we worried why are we trying to find what side of the line we fall on or we did we come from Adam or did we come from the Beast or did we come from this or did we come from that why would we even worry about it right if God's not able to keep his word straight then he's not God that's sensible but yeah they'll read you one if we get time or the prophet says people you could you tell them that but they they're not going to believe it you can't win an argument with words it wouldn't matter if you could prove by words everything about predestination or foreknowledge if it's not revealed we just got words all right and that's what they've been arguing for two thousand years about what did Paul mean predestinate what did God mean by predestining you see I thought we were coming to the end where that this Prophet was to take up all the Loose Ends and and uh you know place in order the scriptures amen I mean that's what I thought he said right right so then what are we looking at are we looking at it as a just arguing quote I mean are we looking at it as seeing God that's it right and what he's doing and then leaving it to the point that I'd like this I don't believe he predestinated by stamping something right but if he did Paul said how can a thing formed say anything about it that's plain enough we'll get back to that scripture and why it's written like that me to me you got to get it in order then you can understand what's taking place all right but he could tell what was going to be going down a number nine we're just trying to read some of these parts of this taken from God keeps his word 57 407 in the morning service paragraph 2 31. they're gone at the beginning knowed exactly who would be saved Jesus come to save those that God knew would be saved he wasn't willing that they'd be lost but to God he knowed who would be lost and who would be saved therefore he could predestinate not predestinate he by foreknowledge he could set in order and make everything work to his glory right so he could do it Lord It's number 10. questions and answers if you'll notice the the dates that we're doing we're just going up up up until we get on the end of the 63s and I questions and answers uh 1957 1006 . should be paragraph 6 35. there are sons of God every man that's born in this earth is the son of God regardless of whether he's a sinner or what he is he's a son of God created in the image of God for the Praises of God he's created that way but God in the beginning and knew who would receive him and who would not receive him therefore he could predest tonight or not pre-dest tonight but before knowledge he could tell who would be saved and who wouldn't be saved for he knew which person would take up which spirit you know like I said I've heard people say like me and my wife would have another baby but I want to make sure it's a predestinated seed well that's pretty strong isn't it I mean if you think just because your children are even illegitimate I would still want them saved amen you know I mean don't you I would try to be finding some way to get them saved instead of trying to prove this much lost you can't do nothing with people look at the next one Queen of the South 1958 125. paragraph E15 and this great discussion he's been presenting the gospel in the power of the Holy Spirit and many other people had believed on him but as usual there are those who would not believe and the sad part of it is my brethren is to think of it in this light that those people that cannot believe were ordained to that condemnation now we're dealing with ordaining to condemnation now if you're going where you're predetermined look what you've got god making the man condemned but if you're going by foreknowledge that's right see the sad part of it my brother needs to think of it in this life those people that cannot believe were ordained to that condemnation that's the scripture see isolate that take it out you got a good predestination Doctrine that's the scripture if you're a Believer tonight amen you should bow your head in reverence and humbleness to thank God that he chose you in Christ before the foundation in the world house no man can come to me said Jesus except my father draws him and God by foreknowledge not willing that any should perish but by foreknowledge he knew who would so he could predestinate from the beginning all things Jesus come to save those who the father saw before the foundation of the world that would be saved for knowledge but yet do we believe in people that are ordained to condemnation and how does God ordain a person to condemnation let's go to Jude number 11 a Jude 1 4. for there are men certain men crept in unaware who were before of old ordained to this condemnation and turning the grace of our God unless he was just and denying the Lord God in our Lord Jesus Christ so Jude says it there were people that were ordained to condemnation another said how does God predestinate so we go back and see it's easy by his foreknowledge well then how does he condemn is by his foreknowledge you go by it any other way see you're going to make it wrong look what the prophet has to say about it living me this is the Lady of sin Church age page 347. go ahead and roll it all up you can read in between everybody get all of that and read it see all the scripture is mostly given then ever verse will be will dovetail if given a change all right he's proven up before there how correct the word of God is you know all right but how many believe in predestination unto election and reprobation under destruction do you believe in that right how is that done remember anytime you're using the word predestinate remember you back up one step in God's mind to foreknowledge always remember that and then when you read your scripture it won't give you any trouble just remember you back up a step now I don't like to do this but I like to do it to keep you thinking see once we get to foreknowledge correct we got to back up another step there's another step behind for knowledge we've got to be real careful when we get there to walk soft I like to walk soft my heel hurts now and if I stomp it it don't feel good Mr stomp it so ain't gonna Stomp don't do anything I'm gonna keep it up now you know let's walk soft but look at him see people no there's the next quote let me let me quote this and then if you want it would be page 357. another lady of sin Church age but not the same spirit and henceforth predest persecuted the child which was God did not reprobate for the sake of reparation now God didn't reprobate for the sake of reprobation in other words he didn't make something right right that away he didn't make reprobate because I told you my brother he says God made me a sinner he can't condemn me for being a sinner I said God didn't make you a sinner you made your own choice you're a free moral agent when she reached that you become a sinner you wasn't The Sinner before that the fact of free moral agency God never put us in the pawn shop we put ourselves in the pawn shop you'll get that straight it'll work a whole lot but look what he says people don't believe in it maybe but many people but how many believe in predestination under election and Reformation under destruction which one he says those who don't those who don't believe that what will they do well they listen no no see that's out on the hour now or even right here in your mind you're sitting there wiped out to the point of what's being said and you're refusing to listen amen well I'm hearing your words you can hear words all day long and not know what's going on come on those who don't those who don't believe in it will listen no they will not yet both are in the word and nothing will change but to learn about it and reconcile the truth of those doctrines with other truths that seem to oppose they will not take the time to try to bring it together it won't do it but they stopped their ears and mashed with their teeth and they lose out at the end of this age a prophet will come but they will be blind to all that he is doing and saying they are so sure they're right and in their blindness they will lose it all right and what about people refusing the truth refusing to believe yeah but brother Dale I've heard social principal predestination boy you got a beautiful job but what did you wind up with what I did is you conceive out of all the predestination ideas that you've heard will you not admit admit that it always pumps the place it always deals with the flesh you'll always deal your predestination doctors will always deal with the flesh and they'll go to the flesh that's why you got the polygamies in the so-called message people yeah because God can't condemn me for being wrong because he predestinated me like this he loved me like I am and to prove that he loved David you live what David done come on you ain't heard the doctrines but yet it sounds so beautiful it makes that old Flagship still good he just he gets a shaking after it's all said and done you're just tired okay sorry about that okay let's go to number 12. this is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 1958 207 paragraph or e50 gone by for ordination we all don't want to call the word predestination it's a bad word to use before The People now you remember what I was saying the other day the summit didn't hear it why is predestination a bad word to use for people it's because of what had been taught of predestination what people believe about predestination So when you say freedom oh yeah he's a Baptist I hate background of Presbyterian because that was two basics of predestinations all right so it's I've got one in here somewhere where he said see that predestination not too bad a word all right when you begin to understand well God by four knowledge can predestinate God is infinite do you believe that and you know everything that would be on the earth before he created it you believe that if he didn't he couldn't tell the end from the beginning sensible he knows all things therefore he could love Jacob and had Esau before either one were born he's not willing that any should perish no sir we buy it for knowledge let him know that they would perish anyhow so he could predestinate everything to work to his glory now I said while ago even you've had people teaching Don't Take Your Kids To Church back 100 years ago because he might get saved when God didn't want him to be saved but if I believe predestination like it talk the message I'd never go to church I'd never pray I'd never do nothing come on that's why I tried to tell the two Soul people I said all you trying to do is kill one of those Souls right yeah I said okay let's shoot to God that gets rid of one of them doesn't goes to heaven see if we hooked up on predestination if it's predetermined you can't change nothing we got into it there the other night a little bit about the man of aspirin 15 years and God gave it to him how many quotes go home and run this one little title into your computer prior changes thing now we know that God knew he was going to give that man 15 years right come on he didn't change his mind he knew he was going to give it to him but yet the story is he gave it to him because he had said and you want the quotes from The Prophet read them unto that he said thus saith the Lord he said the prophet went up and said thus say if the Lord set your house nor are you going to die he said the same Prophet had to turn around and go back and say thus saith the Lord you're not going to die but the man died it's just 15 years later but you see God knew what he was going to do but the point is you don't get this point the point is God gave him 15 years what you want to argue about what he done to do it argue with it he give him 15 years read all of them that says that you know prayer changes thing and see if God don't link your family to you praying for your family and that changes things then the prophet would make a statement he said if you can't believe for your family he said I doubt you can believe for yourself you're not pulling nothing over on God but the point is God gave the man 15 years you can't argue that you can flatter all you want to about what this is and that is you can't argue about it giving it to him but God before the world knew he was going to give that man 15 years but remember and I haven't got there yet that man was in the permissive will of God permissive will of God gave him 15 years perfect will of God don't give you a second write that down and why would you want a second if you're in his perfect will he's through with me right here today let me go I'm not worried why because I fulfilled my job all right look what he says now door to the heart number 13. 58 3 16. evening service that's the reason this paragrapher e84 58 3-16 that's the reason when Paul spoke of it in Corinthians there are Romans he said before either child was born Esau and Jacob both with good holy parents I like that now get our own seed in the flesh out of the way both of them holy parents you see you still ain't listening to the whole thing or what I try to bring Esau was a shyster Jacob was a shyster come on God said I hate Esau I love Jacob that his election might stand true now God is God elect I've got notes at home how does he elect if he elects by predestination we don't have to worry about a thing right let's eat drink and be married cause tomorrow we die but if he elects by foreknowledge see I this is three services of dealing with one word for knowledge amen you know that for knowledge places you into a greater position than predetermining you come to predetermine you you would not have anything to do with it right right if it's predetermined you have nothing to do with it right but by foreknowledge he knew whether or not you would want it amen that's right now he's come back into our laps that foreknowledge is a wonderful word because to think that he chose me because I chose him right amen now did he choose me before I chose him come on predetermined come on come on if he chose before I chose him that's predetermined right see his children and him before the foundation world amen amen but it's because he knew I'd want to be saved and watch where'd we get to both holy parents he said hey he saw and loved Jacob it is election might stand true how many ever read that and you can't believe in elect and you can't believe in election he know just exactly what would happen certainly he's not willing for his foreknowledge lets him know he don't just say I'm going to save this and lose that one he wants you all saved but it's foreknowledge knowing who would so therefore he could predestinate according to foreknowledge and that's election to predestinate according to foreknowledge is election remember that one we'll get back to that in another service or two Jesus come and the last ones that's to be saved will be saved the church will go home okay I believe in that I believe in looking for the live seat amen amen but I believe the ones is here that live seed is going to be dependent upon you and I that have had the time to study the message the day without us won't be made perfect but we're fighting the heat of the day all right so what is it look at the next one want to get the baptism of the Holy Ghost Holy Spirit 58 9 20. eight morning service reading I do that is because people on the internet system might not catch this so I read that the uh the date of it where it'll be there you know all right and we believe that there's born-again Christian sainted people in Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Pentecostals a lot more people in the message don't believe that ain't nobody after her I admit it's getting pretty shallow out to her but still ain't gonna argue because where's the last one coming from out there okay and he said he's born again Christians now you argue with him we believe that God's church is that seed that's mixed down through this realm down through here and it come in by what we spoke of last night and we'll further discuss it predestination not that God predestinates anything to be right but by his four knowledge he can predestinate for he knows all things and we found out last night that there's nobody ever got saved like tonight and had their name wrote on the last book of life your name was either put on a loud book of life before the world began or it never was and never will be if I we find out when God slayed the lamb before the foundation of the world he was slain with your lamb and you believe that find out just in a minute now if our names were written in the last book of life before the foundation of the world and we were saved before the foundation world what do you need to come to Earth to be saved for right simple question he said he even on group no I agree with that 100 percent I agree with what he's saying 100 percent I agree if our names were never written in the last book of life before the foundation were it never will be written in there that's right but I'd ask you to remember something until this afternoon the mind of God is the Bible right I think it's Revelations 13 8 isn't it the lamb was slain for the foundation of the world all names were written that's in the Bible and where do we get to it this afternoon where brother Reynolds said God's talk comes down to Prophet writes it it becomes part of the word God's thought comes down by the prophet and it's written and made the Bible so whatever it is in the Bible is the mind of God that's right amen and We Know by the mind of God in the Bible writing that for knowledge comes before predestination so we're in line aren't we okay look at the next one 1959 12 23 questions and answers and wanted to know you know what is meant by predestination for the foundation the world where is it in the Bible and the first thing I want to say this that predestination is a bad word for ministers to use before an untrained congregation see it is I don't use it sometimes here at the church but out in the audience is out in the big where everything's piled in from everything I watched that word I always use the word for knowledge because predestination is only the foreknowledge of God is that a sensible answer yes yes God being infinite by foreknowledge he knew everything or he is an infinite so you see he knew what would happen so by foreknowledge he could predestinate foreign that's the reason that I believe that God no we're just going to the other you just keep reading all right look at the next one 1962 706 Georgia reel two paragraph 33 34. now there's a doctrine of predestination which is rotten nonsense so what is a predestination Doctrine predetermined Doctrine see even people who would say and believe you know the point would come back to Revelations and say well okay God wrote your name there then that other Feller could never have his name retina so God predetermined it now is that the way you believe it come on we read the scripture your name was written in the last book of life for the foundation world if it wasn't written in the last book of life for the foundation word of prophet said it never will be written there okay now watch your predestination doctor you'll see it's a garbage can did you say well if that name was written that other name was left out so God picked this one you never listened to predestination being preached well I'm glad I'm predestinated I was in the mind of God before the world you see them preachers I was in the mind of God we say well wait a minute Judas was too I don't like that kind of idea well it's truth because you know the Bible speaks off not just the Book of Life or the book Lounge Book of Life it speaks in the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation of books books plural being at the white Throne judgment and the prophet says one of those is the book of The Sinner so the book of his name's written in the book are you getting what I'm saying you say well he just you do it this way and you just write down names well that means you left out names God don't deal like that he just went ahead and made a record right right of Judas Esau Hitler's whatever you want to bring are you listening see what I'm trying to do is drive Stakes down that were that mind of yours when it comes up to that at least you're going to have to bump over that you know well he dealt with that you see what I'm talking about yes you say the loud Book of Life was written before the foundation world Amen the Bible says it well then that means you let these other names out no the Bible says that they were the book written now you're going to deal with what your Prophet had to say about it that's up to you in the church age book he said there'll be people the names were never written over you're gonna do what he says that's up to you but you can't argue the point of what I'm bringing it don't make a predestinated Doctrine just because you got the book of land Book of Life written before the foundation world and making him predetermined in this group and breathing determining this group to be lost because his name's not written no he makes a record of that name foreign there's books books plural written in the Bible right okay he said there's a doctor in the predestination is rotten nonsense but there really is a true predestination God by foreknowledge could predestinate because he has foreknowledge God is not willing that any should perish but being the infant of God knew who would perish and who would not that's the reason he said before Isaac are or before Jacob and Esau was born he hated he's hated Esau and loved Jacob his foreknowledge let him know that Esau was a shyster and let him know that Jacob respected that Birthright regardless of how he got it he stole it right that's what I said why don't the preachers preach the Bible Jacob stole the birthright that's nothing to do with salvation you can't steal the birthright that was only talking about property land they owned you can't steal the birthright in the baptism of the Holy Ghost but you see we just well Jacob just well well he was a shyster and as I said the other day we don't cover we want Esau to die and go to hell we just condemn him out he's a serpent seat Well if he did he come from okay you deal with that but just remember the end of the story when Jacob was coming back as Israel Esau met him and fell on his shoulders and were crying this your family bring them on Esau said I got a bunch of stuff Israel excuse me Israel said we got a bunch of got a bunch of stuff I'll give you I don't need it I got more than you guys we don't see the end of the story we just want to make it one way right let's say about we want to ask Abraham and Sarah in a well of water but we don't want Hagar when Hager was sitting around God come down and told her get up that water over there right same water then you can't type go when brother random gets to Masterpiece and he starts typing Hagar what Methodist am I right I believe that's right he drops it coming down see denominationalism that God used to bring you and I to the truths but that's yes that's where it gets in here on me and I know when I bring it out it looks like I'm matters on it and I am so go ahead not mad at you and me but they're dumb doctrines that we have then we won't take the word like I read that while it goes Arena read it they'll hear what's said but they won't take What's led by the prophet well I think he ought to said this okay think what you want to sign mother sign Daddy okay going to the next let me get a few more don't do an action which should be the Super sign I'm wanting to get these where you're getting this is 63 11 29 so that way you're going after the seal to see if you understand what I come up with the dates up now we're above the seals all right God note at the end from the beginning therefore he could plant everything that it would work out just to his glory and that gives us courage to know that no matter what comes or goes God is making everything the clock is ticking just exactly on time sometimes we get we're reupset we get hastily we think oh we must do this or do that but remember God's clock will will be just exactly on time all these things has to be this way it has to all be done according to his great knowledge his foreknowledge by foreknowledge he could predestinate not by his desire but by his foreknowledge God doesn't predestinate by his desire amen he desired everybody be saved he's not willing that any should perish but he knew who would and who wasn't going read another one let's get the next one what do we got 64 12 the Harvest Time all right paragraph 122 23 24. then God after adamant failed Tried by the word and fail that's how he failed Adam was Tried by the word and failed right okay God continued I want you well because before he he knew before the world what he was going to do amen right he couldn't make Adam fall right but he knew when he made him he'd fall is he dead and he's not God right come on God continued in his creation to try to find a man who would live every word now look he tried to find man that is lived the word for his age now see that put Luther in which that puts everybody in right now you see God scattered his word out because he could how could he scatter his word out he is the infinite Edie's now I'm the president amnition therefore he knows all things he can't be present everywhere you know that he's not in that way by being an omniscient you know in all claims then he can be present ever were because that's the way he predestinates Us by foreknowledge not because he desired that this person should be saved and this one lost but he knew who would be lost and who would be saved see therefore by his foreknowledge he can predestinate and he makes everything work to his glory that's what I love that's what his attributes are doing displaying to his glory one vessel of Honor and one of Dishonor um but it's God that maketh it not him that will look through him that runeth but God that showeth Mercy remember when we get back into that I said we go to foreknowledge we're going to stop this evening for knowledge is the mind of God and writing of the word well we got to make another step backwards because God never gained attributes coming this way right he always was a savior right that's right he displayed attributes on Earth he didn't become a savior just when man failed he always was the Savior amen so you got to back up a little further so you'll understand then you can go back and listen to that message I preached the other night that I was jumping backwards and forwards and backwards and forth back telling you we got to back up a little further and just cabbage down on for knowledge see we cabbage down on foreknowledge and say we got it it's just for knowledge amen but don't cabbage down on it because you're going to stop and when you stop you got troubles okay go ahead with the next let me get these next too all right this is uh when their eyes were open 64 416. they knew him paragraph 205. just like the word predestinate it's a bad word I use used it a few minutes ago when I caught myself because I felt the spirit move back many people don't believe in predestination see that would have been preached in uh Tampa Florida so he's not at the Tabernacle so we see he feels it right because he said many people don't believe in predestination predestination is a bad word for knowledge God knows before who will and they won't who won't so therefore he can predestinate by his foreknowledge that's the reason he knows who will and who won't see he don't he's not willing that any should perish but he knows who will perish if he wasn't then he wasn't God he has to be omnipotent just the same as omnipresency omniscient omnipresent omnipotent infinite he's infinite and if he isn't he isn't God so he knows all things therefore he can tell the end from the beginning because he is the word right okay let's get the last one this is trying to do God of service without his will preaching Shreveport 65 11 27 B he only reveals his word in the predestinated now when I use that word preestinate now it's a bad word to use in public especially when we have mixed crowds between the Armenians and the Calvinists see the Armenians one way the Calvinists the other way so predestination is going to be split between the Armenians and the Calvinists all right now and I I've asked you not to think I know it all but they're both wrong according to scripture Grace is what God did for you works is what I do for him see then you've got it if you climb out on either one of the limbs you'll sure find yourself out on the end of the limb and can't get back the book of Ephesians pulls it together I think now but the word when I use it predestinated don't think that I'm that's the only word I know how to to make it's God's foreknowledge see that he foreknows he can't say he he died that all might be saved he did but by his foreknowledge he knowed who would and who would not see that's what he knows I don't know and you don't know so we work out our own salvation with fear and trembling okay but you see what I'm talking about God predestinates by his foreknowledge for knowledge comes before predestination comes into existence any form of predetermining of mankind and life and World exists now I said it the way I want it for later discussion so don't come up and say you trapped it no for life world existence of mankind Earth etc etc predestination can only deal with foreknowledge and even the mind of God will only deal with foreknowledge because Jacob and Esau is both in the mind of God which is the word of God Judas is in the mind of God which is in the word of God so then thereby that we're looking at it as foreknowledge and we see that God foreknew all things then he didn't make any choices we read that and he didn't choose back Darcy he just sit and watched it unfold you you don't believe God could look at the world and to see every day and every second every minute and every person everybody to be here and just go right on that you don't believe that kind of a god well see you're in bad shape because you got a peanut brain God but if he's infinite that he could know every person would ever come into the world or whether or not they'd be saved or not so he could go ahead and write down your name in The Book of Life if you accept him as Jesus Christ here but not remember one point we'll get back to this later the Bible said that Jesus Christ stood as a lamb slain before the foundation were if he hadn't come and died on a cross 2000 years ago that would have known that scripture you would cancel out your scripture so as I said the other night one more word did God see us before the world and all this unfold or is this this the fact of it unfold which one do you think what's the difference what's the difference in thinking about this is what God saw before the world or this is his mind see there's got to be this or that before the world would be false but there's got to be this you know they've got to be it's got to match that you remember years ago when I preached a message called matching pieces when Martin Luther one day walked upon upon Earth there he is I'm going to send my seed no telling how many Martin Luther preached on the just shall live by faith he was a great orator a great teacher he probably done series on those things but then one day he read it the seed came alive in the man's heart Hallelujah and he said the church shall live by faith God said yep got a lot of problems he makes the Jews he's still a trinitarian he wants to stay in the Catholic Church I'm ready story of his life so you know he didn't want to leave the Catholic church he wanted to convert to church they run him out he's a reformer he wanted to reform him would you see God saw that and he said there it is now I can move on the scene and start the great restoration to fulfill Joy I can start now I've got a seat on Earth let's stand come on brother musicians take on these things see we think about well what will be will be not to leave a lot out right we said well what will be what will be you know well just forget it then if it's what will be will be but if you're not getting anything about foreknowledge I hope you get one time I'm glad it's by foreknowledge because that gives me a link or whatever you want to call it to my salvation that he saw I would want it and he would have it ready and had them in the garden wasn't running around hunting God either God was hunting at him but he knew what it would take to catch old Adam's ruins he knew what it would do to cross Saul's path you need to be changed to Paul see God cannot override your free moral agency and save you if you do not want to be saved so then when we say salvation's of the Lord amen because he paid the price but you and I must accept it or the pardon is not a pardon unless we accept it now no problem then on foreign those who before knew he did predestinate those who he foresaw and all those words into the computer and see what the prophet has to say I'm trying to cut down not lay this thing out to make it long it's running these words for nowadays predestination you better be ready to read a long time because they're like 500 times before knowledge what church do we really believe it God's foreknowledge knew exactly who'd be sitting in this church today we didn't pull nothing over on him he knew exactly but you know what you had to get up and get red income so why not say Amen I'm beginning to feeling pretty good about me I do have a little bit to do with this go ahead brother that's 204 inspirable anybody ever need four cars foreign glorious day and thank the Lord that he sent me there'll be no sorrow there oh my God Glory oh Florida it's called sinuses in Jesus name thank you no more dear God her little sister
