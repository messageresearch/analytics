and my sister is a recipient of all these the T and things that brother Al does and you know there's just no telling how many people have been saved through those Tes that go out through the other people listen to that we don't even know listen and brother Al we just want you to know how we appreciate I do all I'd like to say that I appreciate all of you IE my you are my family brother Dale for 20 years it's anybody ever stood straight in the word of God he stood straight and they show no love for me I could never deserve on the Christ that a man like that show like kind love I love them all of them the entire family from the least to here I so my well I like to say something you know I I've I've come a long ways since God saved me and I remember when I first started going to church in Thomason Georgia my pastor was Clinton Gibby my brother and uh most of the time time my wife and I we would go to church we drive down there and we'd come home her crying and i' I'd go right to Monday morning I'd go right there and didn't realize that Sam was already my pastor because he'd preached to me all week and then on the weekend I'd go down there and I talked to Sam about it and he'd tell me to go this is just the kind of I'm saying this to show you what God does in a human being that the Christ the Myster God revealed tells us that we're to be the very expression of God the very manifestation of the word of God flowing through our vessels and I would tell him and he say go brother Dean it's the only chance they have and then of course I I went to I couldn't go anymore and then I had to come back but he never asked me to come to Lula Georgie H he made me he as much as I talked to him he told me that I had to hear the word wherever I was at I must hear the word and I've heard the word God spoke spoke to me one night as my wife and I went to bed and I've tried to say this many times and I just I never could get it out I'm going to try again now God said to me as I sat there on the side of my bed he showed me a Ministry and he showed me a Ministry of Moses he said now he didn't show me Moses he showed me a leadership of the holy ghost in a person he showed me that a Ministry would be built and I would be part of this this word that was to be built he showed me that I would be there and I would be built upon the word of God and not a sensation not a feeling but I would be built completely and totally upon the word of God God led me up that Highway and put me in the place that I am and I I appreciate brother Dale I appreciate what God has done through brother Dale I appreciate what God has done through the other Ministries and what God has done through you because each and every one of you has met words can't express what you mean to me and what God he God has shown me through each of you with the Holy Spirit God has helped me I have talked to each and every one of you and God has helped me through each every one of you and there's been messages give to me to give back to you by what you said to me so then how could I do anything but love you and I love you with all my heart I know that I love God because of the love I have for you because the way I love you is the way I love God and I want I just take this one moment just to tell you with all my heart I love you I love each and every one of you through your faes through your mountains and through your valleys I love you God showed me more of that this week than any time in my Christian Life he showed me that the grace that brother Dale spoke of this morning the love that he is he said I'm God and I change not and I said say amen that's the truth and I believe that each and every one of you can say the same thing you say I've watched God do so much this year that it's absolutely astounding I saw him do exactly what he said he would do through the message I watched him do it and I put my finger on it for most of you I've watched them do it and I believe that now that God's people is starting to move forward in that and I don't believe we're going to be here much longer and I tell you the leadership of the Holy Ghost is here and he's here Among Us and he's doing it and we recognizing what God is doing and there ain't one way to go and that's keep moving up all and God's going to do that I love you I appreciate you church I'm grateful I gu more than most of us in need but I thank God for a message being the message to bring us and to take us where we to go amen and I'm grateful to brother Dale for being a pastor God gave us pastor we need Pastor we need a pastor and I thank God for Brother D what he stand for and for the gospel in preach since I've known preaching I was nearly 3 years and I can really appreciate I can love him I can have compassion for him as being a pastor because he has a great burden on you and as brother Harris was saying he takes time out to minister us individually as we have needs and that's a p and you are pray for me and I love all the brothers at Lula they all have been a great inspiration to me you all have and I guess I'm one in a lot of ways do not show the love that I have for you but I do love you and if I can at any time ever be a Min service you know just call me and you're brothers and sisters me you're my spiritual family I look forward to you all more so than I knew my own natural family and I was thinking with brother Dale when I lost my mother he was a pastor to me in more ways than I've ever had and I love him for that and I appreciate him for that so Brother D you I have my prayers whenever I pray so you all I like that I appreciate all Church brothers and sisters all they've done I that I appreciate brother Dale years that I've been withing and we think of the lives that we live and the things that he knows about each of us but yet he treat each of us with love for what we live and the life that we live he precious none of us to change to fit the word or to fit but he believed he let us live the life that we believe and tried to show us the way through the gospel that he Liv the gospel that he sees and for years many times I I fail in life and did things but he's still there he never tried to condemn anybody for the life that they live for the wrongs that they have did for ways that they do do things even when he said do it one way and we do it another we still don't come down on condemn for doing it but he continue try to show us through the gospel how that it should be done and I appreciate him for it I'm I'm thankful to the Lord for this year I haven't had many failures I've had relatively good health had a job and I'm thankful for it and I just ask that each of you remember me each day just continue to pray for me and from what the example that the pastor set the example the way that I would live my life not by having to be told or being harassed doing anything but just by the love that he shown that God has shown him and I I just thank all of the church and I thank sister for being with him and keep him comfortable just ask Lord bless be with us thank everybody appreciate the Lord Brother and you know put up with me different things I've done that hav been you know like but the example that the word is a testimony I thank the Lord for you know me brothers and sisters strength me very I brother know they've been like father and mother you know here California brother ENC you know have HB I can you know how act the myself everybody you know thank being gracious and it's been a year and two months never I just hope live my life saying I like to say one other things would be all right I'd like to I'd like to just bring just a short thing here about brother Tom it's uh last night I was really praying about it and I was I was thinking about him and I was thinking about our lives together you know back when I used to do a lot of fighting in karate fighting everybody in sight also uh Tom used to we came together I don't even remember when I didn't know Tom that's how we came together so close but you know Tom would tell me he used to call them things War Stories you know he'd read the Bible to me you know and I would just I would kind of I would always try to respect him but I was kind of glad when he hurry up and get it over so I could tell him about some of the things I did but you know he never stopped he all he always he was consistent with that and then one night one morning I came in I said brother Tom I said you know I was baptized last night in a Baptist Church well I I I knew it was wrong you know I didn't know I didn't understand you know being baptized name of Father Son and the Holy Ghost I didn't understand I just knew that it was wrong it was something wrong there so what Tom did Tom went and bought me my first Bible he brought me I still got it I still got my little black Bible that he brought me but he means so much to me I've got memories that no one can take away from no matter what happens I have memories with each one of you brother colie he killed a deer this year I helped him bring it out and I told him I said brother colie I wouldn't miss this for nothing in the world because I've got memories now I said I've got memories just like you got memories men you standing here with this Digger and that's the why I am with brother Tomy see it's it's come all the way up to this point right now that's why I know that I believe with all my heart that he's a true Son of God I've watched him in him over the hours and over the weeks and over the months and over the years that I would talk to him about God I'd take those tables at work and I'd have my pencil and I'd wore pencil after pencil after to pencil after to pencil out drawing and pointing and this is the way I like to explain the word to you I like to take it and just point it you know and point you and show you how the word fits this one here and this one here and this one here and he's got such notes and such books that it's unreal I dare say that anybody outside Brother Sam has got no notes like he's got but brother Tom brother I can't tell you in this life what you have meant to me brother but you meant so much to me when I was out in the world you meant so much to me then how much more at first Bible that you gave me and then you had a big strong concorded not a strong but a a scoffield hardback Bible that he had marked up and I finished it off and I let him have it back but God knows that you have been to me the brother a big brother and as my brother my natural brother told one time times in my bosom Bey and I and I honestly with all my heart I thank you for being my friend and I praise God for you being my brother I praise you and my prayers and along with the church are never cease brother and one day we'll be on that other side brother walking hand in hand praising God that's one thing I'm assured of I know that God is good as his word and good as his promise and just before I sat down I want to praise God for the WiFi have and she's been a great inspiration to me and the times that I've been wrong she's always been there and says d That's not right and I appreciate God for that I appreciate God for her I can't say in this life how much I love her and each one of you I praise God for you and I know and I pray God's Rich mercies and blessings upon you and I believe that he's doing just exactly that oh I got such friends and brothers and sisters God I can stay here and talk all day day long about each and every one of you what youve meant to me I just said him because I will keep going we appreciate everybody appreciate everything you've done for us most of all we appreciate the Lord because it's been him it ain't been us anyway we didn't bring ourselves together just we're just coming in together and having to congregate together we've come from all walks of life and All Phases and all kind of groups and churches and things together just to to be together as one I know you have to travel a lot I remember telling brother collie one time years ago I said what in the world do you drive all the way to to lfar I said there churches down here you can go to church he said well I going ask you a question said what he said why do you drive to dorable every day I said well I I have to drive to eat he said well that's why I'm driving all the way I do to eat I said well okay we don't have no problem I appreciate it mileage y cover I was figuring up one time and it's over 10,000 miles a week is covered by this church two Church in back counting one just one to three services you come to and that's that way you're not even going home and coming back between Serv that's 10,000 miles but how God has protected us he's took care of everybody driving no wrecks or nothing like that to mount anything little fender benders or something but he's always been s gracious to us
