========================================

open the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart oh for you holy shining in the light of your glory in the house of lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures during what we've been reading revelation 1 in revelations 13 and remember to uh pray for each one there's your sister gwen back there with us this morning i know that she's feeling better sister johnny called and she's sick and just asked us to pray for her we're going to be with you brother alan just to anna both for sick but i don't have to go to the emergency room the other night you know about uh something they want to call it on his leg and leave bottles when he flee behind us everything he said i don't want to have him with fleas yeah i guess so y'all pronounce it where he won't get no dog picture all right but uh i had a wonderful time last night that the band quit as i did and had a had a good time and found out a lot of things about people we didn't know we really had to make the servers swear that they wouldn't they had to do in their blood last night they wouldn't divulge all the secrets we found out a lot about how people met their wives and husbands and things and you know and all of that so we we had a good time doing that looking forward to next year now we're going to announce it next year we're going to have it open for all the adults right like 20 years of age and up you know or whatever we may lower whatever we did but you know not the children but to the adults right that way then we won't be having it as a couples band quit we would just be having a uh time to get together as a band quit not to be sweethearts and we'll have to make some arrangements and some things to do with everybody like that you know but we decided we'd do that this coming year because we've kind of been leaving some out that wanted to come they don't get to sit down and fellowship because we don't dare tape it man we was wondering last night somebody said wondered how many uh fights was had on the way home after someone found out what the other one thought about them a little better the first time they met or something you know you know wondering about that but nanny done a good job she described us to a t how we first met and and everything wade did he had to read it off she forgot a glasses but uh we had a good time doing that i can remember that some of you can't even remember the first time you saw your girlfriend i bet you yeah that i can as a beautiful little black-headed girl the next morning i was on her doorstep wanting to talk to her come find out she could cook real good so i kind of held up she cooked me a meal and i swore because she's only 14. then i swore that her mother cooked it in disguise you know but now she was she was a good cook so we we had a good time that's right let's read our scripture and then brother dean has a testimony he wants to give so we'll we'll read our scriptures and get everybody seated and do that revelations 1 and revelation heavenly father we thank you lord jesus for the day that we've had the time the opportunity to be able to believe thy word thank you for life and joy and peace in our hearts thank you for the love of god that you would shed abroad to each and every one of us that we may be what you want us to be we love you and we thank you we ask you to be with those that are not here today that are watching in lord that you reach down and touch the bodies and deliver each and every one because you didn't say we had to be here but we had to hear thy word and then through hearing of thy word faith would come that we would be able to receive our healing lord we love you and we ask you just bless us now and keep us in your grace in jesus name amen we're going to have this brother let me ask me ask a question oh bad question i asked brother bob it's your dad rob brother black are you planning on being with us this afternoon we're going to have the the ordination this morning or do we need to have it this afternoon this morning but i need it this morning where they can go back home okay so we got a room full this morning on what we're doing okay we'll have the ordination of our brother because i wanted to get him ordained because you see i pastored church for 10 years before it ever ordained i guess it's longer than that i don't really know i've probably been preaching 20 years when they finally got around to ordain me i couldn't get nobody to do it all right let's read our scripture the revelation of jesus christ which god gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to christ and he sent in signified it by his angel and to his servant john who by record of the word of god and the testimony of jesus christ of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right revelations 13 11 and i beheld another beast coming up out of the earth notice coming see because it's over here in america there wasn't anything here and then it came up and he had two horns like like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exercised all the power of the first beast before him and caused the earth and them which dwelt therein to worship the beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he make a fire come down from heaven on the earth on the earth in the sight of men and deceiveth them that dwell upon dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of me of the beast so unto them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound of a sword and did live he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and caused that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed he calls us all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads and that no man might buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast and watch the mark the name of the beast or the number of his name here is wisdom that him that has understanding count the number of the beast whereas the number of a man and his number is 600 three score and six you may be seated lord at his blessing brother dean has a testimony of him he would just come ahead good morning i'd like to take a few minutes there in just a few years if i could get by with it until what happened to peggy about two weeks or so ago we had uh been down to her was down at her daddy's house in white plains in grand county and uh hadn't been there long and i was still in my truck and she was over to daddy's house and she called me on telephone and says dean you might already get over here and bleed pretty bad and uh so i just thought it was a nosebleed you know and uh i went away and god i'll tell you the truth it scared me to deal i'm telling you it takes something to frighten me but i guess somebody did you live like i love my wife it was it was it wasn't a simple nosebleed it was it was running it was it figured my finger and blood was everywhere and she had she had her hand out like this where it had clotted in her whole hand had a big big clot in it and she was swallowing it down and it was coming out of her so i began to pray and uh took her to i started to uh at the original hospital up there and i got to almost to grieve her and i said she can't make it somebody seemed to expect to speak to me says she'll never make it so i wheeled in there at saint mary's in greensboro and they took it right in and went to working on her and they couldn't they couldn't get it they were putting them things up her nose and all that stuff and and then finally after i don't know two or three hours we was there and they was working with her the whole time and the doctor knew about her absent disease and and all this thing in her blood she had lost so much blood wow and she was weak and and i i'm i'm just i'm just putting it in god's hands but but i'm praying and when you get so so burdened you can't even hardly pray correct but that's when god has to come along yep excuse me all right so the doctor said i can't do that next here you're gonna have to get her somewhere else so i i wouldn't wait for the ambulance to take her so i got in the car and i headed up to athens regional and we got there they took us in there and i've never seen such an incompetent punch a bunch of people in my life i'll tell you i'm in that mercy room there i'm just maybe i shouldn't do this but they didn't do nothing they just talked about well we don't really want to take this because it has slacked off and uh so we don't want to take this out i understand that but i knew my wife and she doesn't lost all this blood and and and she's got addison i know y'all don't know what that is most of you don't but you nurses do they they know what it can kill you and i i've had it to almost take her life several times since we've been married and uh so anyway they they we stayed there two or three hours and they sent us home i says i just shaking my head i said we'll be back so about 3 30 that morning she she said dean i'm bleeding again i mean and it was i mean they her nose they had those things stuck up her nose and where they pumped that air in them and her nose looked like a big bulb i mean it was so it was in the ent the ear nose throat doctor was worried about her nose when we finally did we couldn't get a ent to come to the hospital couldn't even get him to come out there because when it was a nosebleed because they wouldn't tell me how bad it was it wasn't just a simple nosebleed she was bleeding to death it was an artery and they still hadn't found out where it was at i've been in in in when we got out this that morning when i brought her back over there she uh uh they took these things out and put bigger ones in and it goes all the way up in the head anybody that knows what it is she got one up here and one here and got two hoses hanging out there they pump up and like an inner tube to try to you know put to get wherever that's bleeding to stop it and uh so uh they they run some put ivy on it and run some tests and and i if i'm wrong here god forgive me but but this is where i believe they put a bag of potassium they knew protection was low and they put a bag of potassium in it and and give her potassium by the mouth of the mouth and uh so it quit bleeding i mean you know i don't know how blood could have got out but it was going down her throat you know and uh so that morning that i don't know what time it is i get lost i was numb i mean i'm just all i knew is praying i couldn't leave her and uh she tried to get me to go get something to eat i i said i ain't leaving i ain't i ain't leaving your side and uh so that took us out i mean just discharged us again and we had to go across the street if anybody knows where anthony regional is he's just right across the streets of mcdonald's there's a street right there and you go right down that's about as far view to the street out there and this the ent is right there so we went over there and we went back in the back and he said well i don't want to take this out the same stuff that they did before and so they started discharges and uh peggy she couldn't she was in that and we uh walked into the window you know where you check out and i i was standing there and she was standing right here and she says i heard her say dean i've got to lean up against something and by the time i turned she was going down and i grabbed her and it was dead weight you know it's hard to handle and i took her and i walked away i tried to walk away to lay her down on the floor and her legs were just i mean just twisted all kind of ways and the three doctors was there and they come running out and all the nurses and later on later on out on the floor they're in a dress never did come up that that's a miracle of god and then he was i mean in a way they they took a uh somebody could come run out with a towel and put it up on her head and had her this nurse was holding her feet up but i looked at her and this is this almost killed me i saw her eyes just start to close and all at once they just roll back nothing but white and you want it now that's right i went down i couldn't even pray and i just took my hand and i squatted down there and i took my hand and i laid it on her forehead and just laid there and i in the scripture was there it says little hands that's right i was sick and he shall recover but she was more than sick i don't know how he seemed like an eternity but but all at once with my hands there and i i could never forget the look on her face i could i could never this it branded him in my brain and i saw her ass flicker and i knew the transition had begun let me add this in the doctor was down there with me and he was trying to find a pulse in her neck and he looked and i knew when he looked at me i knew and he was hauling call 9-1-1 call 9-1-1 he was just screaming call 9-1-1 but when they got there then i just moved up by the way and they picked her up and put her on there yeah what you put them on you know and uh they took they started taking her out and they said we're gonna work with her in here in the in the ambulance and if you want to stay here are going over we'll we'll uh we'll be there in a minute and i stayed and then when they went you know i i went on over but we got over there and they said that they they run all these tests on iraq yeah pretty quick they really went to work on and they said her potassium level was down to 2.7 2.5 is critical his last life you could die right and if they hadn't given if that hadn't been for that potassium which i knew her blood she her blood was gone her calcium was gone her potash was gone and she was gone right sir and god brought her back lord is it something in our lives it brought you some power boy it is i'll do anything right sure anything but i'll tell you something i found out i found out what the level was that's right i thought many times you couldn't live your wife no more than my little man come on hopefully wrong yes sir i found out that when the scripture says loving people more than you love yourself your wife more than you ever say if i i feel not about that and i was this morning i was sitting there about three or four o'clock in the morning and i have a bible on my right as a lord i don't ever take your book and use it for a ouija board right but i need to know something all right i said would you would you do it for me i want to read you a scripture that he turned me to it'll hit i believe he'll hit you because see you can use it for a ouija board you can you can you can look at it and see something it may try to make it fit you right but when god speaks back to you this is why he said no church no matter how fundamental that church can't thrive until a supernatural make known among us something that we could speak to that will speak back to us and identify and vindicate himself amen that happened to me and i just this is in isaiah 43 25. i would ask you to read that you read the whole book he says when i when i opened my bible it was right there for him i couldn't get away from this this scripture i had i already had to highlight it it said he spoke to me as well as i speak to y'all this morning god spoke to me he said i even i am he that blighted out thy treasure gracious for my own sake amen and will not remember thy sins amen so i don't worry about it but i will ask you to remember my wife because her blood pressure and giving her pills her blood is low and they give her pills to get her blood pressure up and it's got side effects so i would appreciate it yesterday i just i knew i couldn't do it before today i wanted to do it the first first morning but i just i couldn't do it god bless you we love you amen if you come up all we can do is do as paul would say he says we can lay hands on somebody just gift we can't give them a gift as to make them a minister and that's not what we try to do bob come to us and he told us about it and i said well brother bob just run as long as you can and then when the lord gets through running you down and you get ready you'll be able to uh and use it and everything so it didn't go too long until he came and he said well i'm ready i said well all right then you'll just be put in and be one of us is a minister but like i say we want to lay hands on him to stir up the gift that is within him because we didn't call him to preach god called him to preach for the foundation of the world that's right so in doing that then we lay hands on just to stir that up and to show that we believe that god has called him you know because we can't call him and we don't send him but we do join with him amen that the lord will bless him and be with him as he goes and ministers the gospel together okay let's pray together brother over our brother he is committing to the lord dedicating him to god father jesus our brother we believe you are graceful father we're so grateful did you sit there brother he sat down and he's listening he's waiting maybe is lord we dedicate them to you also and lord knowing that you are god and you change we love you and we thank you we commit our brother to thee now in jesus name a great thing everybody to be called to the ministry remembering that so emphatically of stating that they asked him when they said will the bride have a ministry and it was an odd statement that he made you know he was talking about the bribe the person asking the question wrote around and said sure she consists of apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers so she consists of that right not to just say that i've called a faithful ministry right but she consists i see when we ourselves make the ministry what it is we sit down and we listen and we pay attention and as i told brother bob i said there's something in there that god will use you and we can speak and compare and do the best we can and i told him even about myself i said the prophet said god could use you for training for maybe 30 40 years for a 30 minute sermon right i said one of these days i'm gonna find that sermon and i'll be able to preach and quit you know but i believe that the call to the ministry is not just your thoughts your ideas or your feelings or whatever you know or some word from somebody or some thought but it's a word paul said the mystery whereof i'm called see most preachers jump up and run off because they think that they're called but you see after a while they don't have much to say right and i'm sorry i'm gonna do this you know i just say it like it is the way i see it right but if god calls a man he'd give him a word now let's get on into the book of revelations and our thought for today we covered the reading there in our scriptures about how the you know that the image our last message was on the image of the beast and we know that that image of the beast was made here in the united states brother branham will read it just a little bit that that beast over there she started with the people and the multitudes and the kind but then when you see it here in america it comes that come up out of the sea which is people but this comes up out of the earth right because there wasn't a lot of people over here you wouldn't even count the people as being here as uh the form you know that we talk of christianities or whatever religious matters in the day that would our would be indians or whatever it was already here so he just referenced into the fact that it comes up out of the people right right now and it'll form as we read there a mark of the beast so that's what we're going to go into today and all of you know the the thoughts and the ideas and the quotes and the things but let's just go through it in in thinking about some things of where we're at we know that the revelations 13 is the chapter that the prophet refers to as being america right we came here for freedom of religion we started out as a lamb and then he said it will never become an old round because it'll end before all of that would take place but we're going to form our are are already forming the image to the beast all right now what was that doing as we talked about image of the beast an image is an exact likeness right so we came to america to get away from the religious world of things but what did we bring over here satan is so deceiving until riding in the very boat to come to america for freedom was both the good and the bad the ones that would start and take us down bring us to a position of actually forming a very image unto the beast would be riding in the same boat as the ones who came here to receive their freedom and we covered it where brother brown said that actually martin luther see when he came out with a protest in the catholic church to show that it would turn out to be like it is then it turns around and denominates now luther didn't denominate himself no right we know that so when brother around says luther denominated and you'll even find him one time saying luther denominated and died but then luther himself was the man of god for the hour but you got to remember that he was limited to what understanding he could have right so he already had the catholic doctrine right if you studied never studied anything about the history of martin luther he did not want to get out of the catholic church he wanted to reform that was what was called a reformation back in those periods he wanted to change the church well that's everybody's ideal you know i did it didn't you i i stayed about six or eight months in the baptist church or maybe a little over that almost a year after hearing this message and and even the kids when i left they said we know why sam left because he was teaching us all right because i was trying to get people to see the truth right right but see sometimes you got to wind up saying okay i've done all i can do i've got to move on well see it wasn't the day to have that understanding so brother brandon would say martin luther then would bring out of those things things with him that would actually start that church right back in the same thing because it would be the image all right see then you know it was his day and his time because that's why they're waiting on you and i too right yeah see john wesley he comes forward right around and stands with the message he said first thing you know they denominated but wesley even said i read it where he said i'd rather die than to see them to nominate my church as they did martin luther but you know what they did immediately after his passing on they took the church right back into the same catholicism well we come on into the pentecostals and we know what they've done they may have done it in a little different form but it's still the same old dealings right they came in to then more of a uh picking up of an atmosphere or religious matters or what does that work as america how you say it as they came on in and began to try to stir the people up and there was a wonderful bride part down right there they're part of the bride each one of those ages is part of the bride but also at the same time it was forming an image to the beast right but and the people themselves were being caught right into it you realize as we'll get to it the mark of the beast here of what it's just to have their understanding in your forehead mark of the beast is not a tattoo snapped on you somewhere right no this is in your understanding right right when we get to that in a few minutes we have time but not we'll get it this evening but the point i want you to see is we can be just as churchy right we can be just as denominated as any other movement that could ever be and you know you go down right now and you tell the baptist you say you already have the mark of the beast well they're going to run you out and they're going to make sure you leave from them right because they don't believe they have it that's right but i want you to think of this thought we'll get back to it later if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost this day you're already marked with the mark of the beast that's right amen because there's only two people right you're either out of the seal of god or the mark of the beast so the world we was born into life as we are the domain we live in which is satanic the best we can do were lost sealed away from god he said no no no i've been a christian all my life well even we that have been or some that have been a christian since they're very young years that's the point i want you to see you don't get nothing out of the message today get this one thing that you can be a christian and you're born-again experience in your soul have eternal life in that soul but yet in the other parts of you be just as organized as any catholic priest no now that's the one hard to swallow right you're not going to be lost and go to hell no but don't tell me we're going into rapture with a organizational mind all right man i've told you 40 years ago right at it i said the way i see it the biggest portion of the people of this message will die and go by the grave before the rapture comes because what are you going to do i have never de-christianized anybody intentionally you know to do but i don't see how you can go in the rapture with denominational ideas i just don't see that now because that was what eve put us out of the garden she said i think this is my idea this is my understanding i have great wisdom now isn't that the basis of all people are their thoughts and ideas but to just think about it as the great america that we came here in in my poor mother-in-law i mean i'm not throwing off on her i just tell it like he did she was a wonderful sweet mother-in-law greatest in the world if everybody had a mother-in-law like my mother-in-law you wouldn't all these jokes wouldn't be made about mother-in-law you don't see me making one you know because she was a wonderful mother mother-in-law but we were talking one day something about mark of the beast or some form and she said well sam said god wouldn't let that happen to this christian america see that was her thought her thought was is christian america you know it was in the paper the other day when they were talking about the pope resigning that they are 1.2 billion catholics in the world you realize that's one-seventh or how would you count that because it's seven billion people might be about one a little over one seven one out of every seven right let's be a catholic that's not cotton they have this message this presbyterian pentecostal and little ox and randomized that's not counting all them you just think that a big portion of this world is really in the realm of what you would even call christian or christianity but yet look how confused it is look how messed up it is but i'm still not i've always said that since i started here because i told god years ago when he called me to preach i said i won't preach against that church that know yonder this was back before there's everyone sitting over there you know they wouldn't learn i said i'm not going to preach against organized religion of method this baptism and all i see too much of it among us and i made that statement years ago and i still believe that the biggest portion of people this message cannot retain or obtain to the position of being able to change in a moment of twinkling or not and i may be one of them and i never did christianize anybody for dying but you look at a lot of people around this message of the past young people right that have passed on to be with the lord no well i never said they wouldn't say i've always been defensive just like that a word that you can actually quote i can give you a quote around like i said he said luther denominated and died he said look there one time i'm 99 i'm not sure he said luther died and went to hell run your computer and see man now what was he saying did martin luther that was a born-again christian a church-aged messenger to bring the message of the just shall live by faith was he saying that he died and went to hell no the lutheran right those who at the time even looked there were still alive was burning down the churches because they thought that's what he taught and he was fighting organized religions so much they just went out and started burning churches nobody brought around city it was about him holding his head high about all the fanaticism but then look at it as it comes on down to closer to the truth people come yet they're closer to the truth that the people come to bring it from justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost and the word is where the image of the beast comes from you understand we came over here what 1492 columbus sailed the ocean blue you know then we was reading there the other day since barbara gave me a couple of things the first man landed in america was a jew they had a doctor the uh the navigator was a jew it was about four of the great men that was with columbus and they even wonder if he was part jew he came to america you see we come over here to get away from a religious form and got over here and formed our own and just made an image to that was over there right if you have the same doctrine that somebody has that's an image right right he said brother them ever since i come in this message i believe in one god well the large number of the people that's mexican believe in two lords you go ahead and do all you want to about i believe that jesus wouldn't gone to the river jordan you just go ahead and see you're throwing off on people no throwing up on doctrines right see yeah my bible says everything you have god gave it to you you agree with that scripture that's right no matter what how big or how little god gave it to us we didn't choose to be what we are did you choose to leave your denominational churches i was running pretty good i was well-known god you know in my 20s it was well respected teaching adult sunday school class which was the deacons and elders in the church when i left but you see i had to one day walk out there and my wife didn't even know i was leaving we hadn't talked about it we had studied the message and i told her i said i'm not going to make you go i'll supply you a way to get to that church and i'll do everything i can but i've got to go honey but she walked out with me well but you see church we can come right here and sit right down and anchor in this message and holler all we want to that we believe the prophet's message and be distant organizational denominational is any catholic church that's right what's the difference in believing in the deity of the catholic church or the deity of the people of this message you know the difference is they vote one end voted nothing out their god can quit right i'm not joking or not making remarks i'm speaking but the people of this message their god doesn't change they made it william bradlem and they've held on to that but you see we can be just as we're we're the people that can really if you understand what i'm trying to drive at when we came to america luther started the message of the justice shall live by faith and look what it's formed into here in america as an image to the beast we say those are good people amen we were good people i thought i i thought you just got people when you was back there didn't you but did you realize that the thing that the prophet said started christianity you know the form of what we call it that wound up being the thing that would kill the christians well that's pretty strong there's your image to the beast that's what i was trying to say there the other day honestly we just get the point not to just say america's number 13 stars and stripes that's fine it's just like we talked about it that you know this this woman sits on seven hills that's fine but you better find a place that can control the world and not cincinnati ohio right now when we get down this afternoon and i won't this morning but when we get down to the 666 your name might figure out to be 666. but yet you don't rule the world mine might figure out to be that but it don't rule the world you know the religious points all right so we're looking at something that is a great thing at the same time now trying to lay down some things because like i told you when we went over into the seals and bringing it chapter 5 6 five in heaven you go over to seven just to start a number seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen it's all in a three and a half year period right called the tribulation the image of the beast is formed before we go out of here the rapture may not be in manifestation but how close is it that's why i'm not against obama or anybody mccain we didn't put him in there we'd probably be in worser shape everybody wants to try to find some something that's when gary had asked me a question about the nra you know that they used to believe the nra was a mark of the beast that's five or six quotes around selections i just happened to see it and run it up communism was the mark of the beast all kind of things turn out to be the mark of the beast and the people sitting with the mark of the beast because i restated i've stated a dozen times probably if we don't have the new birth we have the mark of the beast i don't care how intelligent you are or unintelligent we have the mark of the beast and we're part of the image to the beast i remember when i first began to find out a few things about the the church and all this before i heard the message and i began to find out that we were actually back in the 50s sending money to foreign countries madness was sending money to foreign countries to encourage insurrection into the governments where we could get uh the ability to put our literature at our because it wouldn't let us in a lot of the countries that was what the baptist was doing and i knew of that before i heard about around smash and you know what i done i said well now i'm gonna designate my tithe to stay in this building not real good but mine's gonna stay right here in this building i'm not going to help support insurrection i'm really trying to do a good job just to find my own stupidity but you know how it is i'm just honest to tell you what would you do it when you begin to find out about something we should move on and do something about it right right because it'll get to the point all right now remember how we were bringing out that that's why i love the fact that god sent us a prophet because we've been in this series now for 75 sermons on the book of revelations and uh i even mentioned it to the chiropractor one day and he said most people won't preach out of that i said they just don't know how beautiful the book it is to really see what it means you see we can only say that after the prophet come to give us to break the symbols to where we wouldn't be looking for some king kong walking across the earth and holding up that mark of the beast as a tattoo oh no no no no we we know better that than the 666's but you better watch it might be in your clothes you know covered up somewhere you know we all had it figured out didn't we but what about it what about our all right our ideas are they according to the word okay what a wonderful thing to be able to read the book of revelations like we did there the other day in talking about where brother randall says on the mark of the beast that to call fire down out of heaven see we looked at some kind of a something that we just read here that this man is able to do or this image is able to do he said atomic hydrogen intelligent nation like i said you you you standing over there and you're you're back and you've never even seen a white man or anybody with anything other than sticks and stones to throw at each other about that time here sets a helicopter down and not jumps out with a flamethrower just burns the grass or either freezes it or whatever he wants to do with it wouldn't you buy down worship come on a whole lot more than you told them polar bears doing you see what it means then to call down fire out of heaven it doesn't mean that they're calling fire down those two witnesses the word from their mouth is like fire to devour their enemy the words of america can take down a nation that's it when they send to you in meetings you know they send supposed to send so many from each country but we're already number one there on the ground before anybody else lands why because we're policing the world but yet each nation just keeps coming up and we're showing you how brother brown said how that those ten toes and the kingdoms and the things you know he said they're dictators he said where's these dictators lean they said they lean automatically to communism we take a country we put a man in and we give him everything in the world and about the time he gets his head big enough like castro and then was educated here in america what i heard he was actually a there's puritan girl thing engagement right now but our knowledge i don't understand that or maybe the the military kind right but still what happened he turned to communism taking all we gave him but then he turned to communism more demons more devils we were trying to be nice you see calling down fire out of heaven is not a fire-breathing dragon blowing smoke right it's a bunch of preachers in the book it's much more amen out of their mouth because they captivate the people and they control them but yet this beast the first one comes out as we read in the first of the beginning of chapter 13. he comes up and i said want to go out of the ocean to see the people came from europe brought around them even said coming over here but this one raises up out of the land raises up out of the land out of the earth where there was no people see we came over here sure we found the indian but as i said while ago that wasn't to be counted in the religious atmosphere all right but you see what it was doing you see what we come across here and it begins to set a stage you know if we believe in the ark was the dove and the crow why would you worry about what i said about the nina and potento and i can't even name them kids you're supposed to learn that thing but do you think all that was good people do you honestly think that they sent all the good people over here no that was two or three loads later they began to send some good ones you sent the garbage you know they wouldn't the others wasn't mean enough to be able to fight and die for the freedom we were gonna have so they sent the crooks first right now come on church it's honestly true right but yet we've come to america and what a wonderful land but you know the problem with us you think about it we're every day voting away our own freedom because you've got to get control of the american people through the mind you cannot force american people they got too many guns and things you can't control them that way you control them with their mind because that was what adam and eve was facing that's what all mankind has had to face intelligence look in america what is the greatest thing now this is the one thing that i see that is one of the greatest images to the beast and i say it's in the message people greater than anywhere else you think about this statement of fixing to make you know when we organize religion we would quote what so-and-so said about something when i was fine we would quote the scholars but everybody kind of had a little idea you know but when brother branham came along and began to speak the word of god to the people that formed into the people of this message what something i've always looked at that is very very damaging and you better listen to what i'm saying because you're misunderstanding the ability for you to be able to read this message is wonderful right do you realize what that's formed also eve is standing again with her ideas because you can tell people of this message run around said so but he also said making a contradiction out of it i've done preach to you then back under a few weeks ago on compound meaning but not compound or different revelations come into the same scripture you can't see a trinity in me see one god and say we're both in the bible right neither can we do it in this message i want you to read the message because if you don't know the message you don't know whether i'm telling you the truth or not that's right amen what are you going to judge it on your idea because of some face making that i do or something that you wouldn't like it you know some wording that i would say that you're offensive to me what does all that got to do with the gospel right you know when jesus called him a bunch of snakes i did tickle him to death did he you know they weren't killing him about it but you see church what i'm trying to say is the the biggest image of the beast to me is going to come out of this nation the biggest apex whatever you call it height amen and you know what i'm saying is true i read something here to you and sitting there watching some of you in your mind and some of you take your pin and start writing i said well they're not agreeing and they're writing down what brother brown said on another quote but just remember you can't have contradictions that's right lower meaning higher meaning compound meaning the prophet said even compound revelation he would say but not different meanings or different revelations one message 969 different denominations formed out of one message one bible how many of you got in this message right i mean that's right i believe we are the i believe we are the total apex of that situation because we're back like it was in the garden right as i said a moment ago we're back to i think i said well brother so-and-so said so-and-so you don't understand all he said yeah no but i know what i say i mean his brother mark turned around and said brother dale is a pink elephant out in the yard there might not be no peak elephant and there might not be no elephant in the yard but i know what he's saying he told me there's a pico if this prophet couldn't keep it straight we better be trying to find another one right right but i don't believe it i believe he kept it straight but my ideas or your ideas about it can form the image of the beast that's right amen and make us the very epic apex of all things and see once you see the image of the beast that's what i'm trying to lay down it's very simple to see the mark of the beast if you see the image of the beast is an exact likeness it's very easy to find out what the mark of the beast is and i'm going to repeat this about three times in this one message all right i like to do that for your thing you know we talk about the mark of the beast we used to believe it was some kind of tattoo some kind of something that was done we used to think it was communism we try to make it ever ungodly flame that flies up but remember it's got to be very close you realize in ezekiel it gives you a very good clue to the mark of the beast in ezekiel it speaks of a man with a writer's ink horn right he needs to go through the land and mark those who sigh and cry for the abomination done in the city the prophet one day said now you want to know what the evidence of the holy ghost is you don't hear this quote a lot do you he says if you want to know what the evidence of the holy ghost is he says whether or not you're crying and sign for the abomination is done in the city amen i preached that probably 35 40 years ago we're not talking about washington d.c right right because the prophet said i don't pray for that anymore okay i think that it's talking about in this city that you and i are associated in called a message do you ever just pray for these people that are so confused or do you damn them with your words right you condemn them and say they're lost what would you do in the days of martin luther with the ideas you have of organized religion and seeing martin luther had every one of those traits the yeti was the man of god and the word of the hour was through the man what would you do you know i love god for being the way he is and i try to illustrate it like if if we were going to commit way to the lord for some problem he had everybody said we'll just turn him over to the devil that ain't in the bible and ain't the prophet's message what it is see there's that quote writing it down quit right that's when you fight against it yeah quote from what how can you commit anybody to the devil by whose authority do you commit anybody to the devil that kind of sounds like catholicism don't it excommunicating see i knew that that wasn't right because i'd be in pastor i knew i maybe someday would have to face that situation of having to do something in the order of that i've done a lot of searching until i found a prophet he said we turn him over to god he turns him over to the devil that took the load off my back and i i was hurried to find that right because if i ever had to use it then i'd realize that hey wait just a minute now if we're committing wade to the lord then the lord take care of him what i've always wondered is we're over here at the church and we're committing way to the devil you know let's just meet together turn him loose to the devil and he's over the house repenting now what kind of a situation have you got and he's even saying lord forgive them people for what they're doing over the church right now now which one is god going to hear but if we turn him over to the lord and he's over the house god's working on both ends you see church what we used to think was word we have found out that it was grandma's idea i don't mean that against grandma but to see that that image of the beast would come down to finally be the mark of the beast the prophet of god they asked you one time about the mark of the beast he said if you don't have the baptism of the holy ghost that's what i'm quoting from he said you're already marked right yep but we're looking for some stamp some way some hands i'm doing instead of thinking brother random the mark of the beast he said it's the mark of apostasy i watch him not outwardly but inwardly that's right now if the writers ate corn that he was marking the people who signed and cried where did he mark them at according to the bible he barked them in their forehead well why was we looking for tattoos in the forehead right well what we'd look for is we'd look at warning now 666 but now jesus wrote on the edge or something is that the way we'd be looking and then you could just buy you a couple of tattoos and stick them on where you wanted them today because you know they got them kind you just roll up there and you can peel it right off you know so if i was around this group i just put one there another one i could just be whatever i want to be to everybody so the image to the beast is a doctrinal ideas of the catholic church hands down through protestantism right the mark of the beast is your very intelligence that you have right the doctrines now see i know you're writing it down now okay so that little computer's already started working he said don't wait just a minute i got him i like it that way i like to expose you because i already got exposed you know how many of you thought about what i was saying that that i was inferring that the baptism of the holy ghost is in your forehead you know everybody's saying no i hope that's true i was baptized by the holy ghost and not in your forehead but the bible see would be too close to where you couldn't get confused if the bible says that the writer's ink horn was marked on his soul right there wouldn't be no deception being able to come out of that it would be the ability to think well you know really the holy ghost just to my my brain that's the spirit uh won't work out folks but it is odd that the holy ghost is the seal of god he's in your forehead but at the same time the mark of the beast is in your forehead that's your intelligence right i thought lord this is not a six or seven thing for me to talk about to a group of people that already knows that it's not 666 they already know that it's not just some mark or number or something do it they already studied the message many of them for 40 50 years and they know that it's not just an image mark in the forehead it's a doctrinal idea that's why i love the scripture we just read because what's the difference in the name let's see if i can find it read it again in other words it names three things verse 18 talks about 17 18 no that no man might buy or sell say he that had to mark right or the name of the beast we could have either one right right so it's not a statute not tattoo 666 or the number of his name all right it's not it can be any of those three because all three are the same thing if you have a person's doctrine you have their name that's why this message people are quick to say who do you follow right you heard this one what camp are you in you in the two soul camp you in the seven country versus camp you're in the cruise you can't wait which camp are you in i said well they've tried to put me in every one of them that i get thrown out of all of them well i reckon i'm a vagabond i just don't have no count he said well you got your own doctrine hey man a church without a doctrine can't be a church okay come on show me where we missed it now right that's out there on the internet show me where we're off the message here that's what around the world but the phone don't ring because they know what i'm saying is the truth whether you've got a tattoo in your forehead or the backside of your head or in your earlobes or inside the roof of your mouth or whatever that ain't going to be no doing what not having on them the bible says don't put no marks don't put no marks don't get no tattoos you wind up covering them up one time trying to because you put them on there in stupidity you know you know maybe i'm mean for saying that but god just makes it to where you can't erase your stupidity you have to repent right that's the only erasing there is to stupidity is repent and say i'm sorry for doing that right but now listen brother branham on the message hearing receiving and that acting he calls it carnal esau now why would brother brown call the mark of the beast carnal esau all the way around esau was a pretty good guy that's right right right better guy on his brother we call it corn esau because you know what esau done he sold his birthright if we don't have the baptism of the holy ghost we've already sold our birthright because it's here for us all right he said well i don't know how to worry you could do that you want the quote from wrote a random word a priest or a pope i'll tell you his name in a minute but the holy ghost tried to come on him and he rejected him holy ghost tried to come on him and he rejected it he was the one that wrote the decree that was better to kill people trying to make them serve god than it was to let him die without being something done to him you know he killed millions of people he come out with that idea because he rejected the holy ghost right right see church we're looking for something to happen and it's already happened among us the mark of the beast right it's not a 666 yet you can take it and go down we will later probably where's my carriage billy idi you can do it with your roman numerals and come out to be 666. that's right like i said you can figure your name out and it might come out according what how you balance the book you know what i mean by that which way you do the numbers which way you spell things and whose book you use to write it by which church the catholic doctrine it's what we better be afraid of right now probably said don't fear communism he said there's no place in the bible that said russia will never rule the world right oh quote now how many wrote down him and he started a computer right then but around said russia will destroy us that's exactly right he said they got a bomb waiting for the vatican then bombs wait for us but that don't mean rule the world in a religious realm what is the mark of the beast to reject the holy spirit if you don't accept the holy spirit you're already marked right that's the truth these babies back here these kids and you teach them the best you can but you know what they are and that's where people don't like me they're not born again sure they're under the age of accountability and that's not counting then okay because that's what it means accountability and all babies who die under the age of accountability the prophet said automatically go to heaven all right but once they reach the age of accountability they have the mark of the beast that's an automatic process it's not something you have to work up to get if you were born in the back woods of africa and never been out from under a tree you're still the same way or the most educated people in the world that would all that mama and daddy would do is say jesus jesus jesus all their life they're still born in this domain marked with the mark of the beast that's why he said go through it acorn and change it so where did he start to change from beforehand working in the very position that satan works from you know it's hard to understand god you know how did god ever drop down through your thinking ability that was trained wrong all of your life taught a trinity taught all kind of things and dropped down in there and clean that soul and give you the new birth you're talking about a miracle that is a miracle amen that's right prophet said a baby being born not a miracle but the new birth what you see in that forehead is the ability to receive that's why i love the scriptures because the bible says when jesus was teaching them you know about the kingdom he said they took the word and held it now they weren't born again jesus hadn't died yet so they took the word and held it right and on the day of pentecost the holy ghost came upon that word that held right but what about the other stories of how the carers of life and etcetera and this that and the other took away the thing that you had heard because we're automatic you don't have to be i i preached a member of message years ago called the pawn shop and we say the devil put us in the pawn shop okay that's because of the fall we put our own self in the pawnshop why because we started the doctrine teaching our children how many of you taught your children to sing father son and holy ghost blessed trinity we taught our children we taught them about the doctrines and the ideas and then we wonder how did they get that way it's because we talk you know so we know what we've got to do i've got to touch that head say susan i'm talking to you i gotta hit that head and get that forehead part where your intelligence is at to get you to listen if not you're gonna sit there and blank me out and you're gonna figure out how to feed the dogs or how you can pull some over on donny to get you a new ring and you're grinning at me and shaking your head that's why shaking your head is a good way to be all right but shaking your head ain't amen that could be sleepy brother used to sit up here on the front row years ago come on musician i gotta quit brother you sit up here on the front row years ago and he crossed his leg and you could preach to him and he'd go his floor to go down he'd come up his foot and come up he'd go down his foot and go down and he'd sit there and do it i never didn't figure out which one was okay he was late he was double a man in me that's whatever i think that's why i like somebody to say amen now i have said amen when a few words later i was saying oh me because i found out what the person was talking about so i conned the phrase around here cause someone did one night with a fellowship meeting and someone jumped me on the way home he said you said amen when that guy said sort of i said i am in the first half i didn't aim in the whole statement that was the rest of the statement was wrong but you see church if you don't take nothing out of this mission take one time the mark of the beast is in your forehead amen right but the seal of god has to work through that same for him that's the only entrance to the soul what do you think it says faith cometh by what amen how can we hear without a preacher you see because what i'm trying my best to do is to destroy our human intelligence that has taught us the wrong way amen see because it controls us like i've told you they always talk and said that nobody could break them what let us now make sure i get this right four minute mile nobody could break the four minute mile that was a set thing you know well you know a boy was born and had a lot of problems with his legs and things he said he wasn't even able to be able to walk you know he pressured pushed and walked he started running and you know what they forgot to tell him the four-minute mile was impossible you know what he done he broke it didn't it odd that a bumblebee scientifically cannot fly but you know you go out there and you tell that bumblebee all you want to why because he ain't gonna listen to you when this bride begins to get to the bases here we're not gonna listen to man's ideas we're going to take the prophet's message and we're okay we we love to take it in the book of revelations about images and beasts and things what about all of it and we're willing to eat the whole book but do we have the mark of the beast you realize that we've got to get that mark of the beast out of her intelligence i hope you understand what i'm getting at baby i know it's been a hard way of saying martin luther had in his soul the baptism of the holy ghost which is eternal life which is the same eternal life you have today if you have the baptism with the holy ghost you agree with that but his intelligence in his forehead was catholicism right absolutely some way caught dropped through there down into that slowly from out of that soul scream to man the judge shall live by faith he could have never done it up here that's right amen go tell him how many times he read that scripture but he couldn't do it up here you and i can't do it up here right that's right preach to the soul amen let the soul decide what's going on what do we got in this team 5 39 and spiral books within me within me is me away in me me me me me oh every year
