========================================

left y'all with ear plugs and you're here this morning what a waste of chocolate yeah all right let's go to Revelation chapter six thank you next Sunday uh brother Joe will be doing the service here doing the Sunday school and after that brother Bob will be doing it that's the first time I heard of that in a few weeks I know ain't that great you're awake I was gonna call you Friday but next Friday it'll be just fine all right Revelation six verse 7. when he had opened the four seal I heard the voice of the fourth Beast they come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name that set on him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the Earth to kill with the sword he was Hunger with death the Earth okay we're recording Revelations chapter 6 verse 7 let's read it again when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth piece they say come and see and I looked and behold a Pale Horse and his name to settled him was death and Hell Followed With Him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and was Hunger with death and with the Beast of the Earth all right now we're going to stop right there they got you take your Bibles and turn to the Book of Ezekiel 1. now we're going to read Ezekiel chapter one because we're going to cover the four beasts the four combat beasts because after the four steal remember you see no more of the Bride because they're going to Glory and then you start as we were talking about last Sunday was the fifth sixth and seventh seal has got to be in here but but to to get us in the body of Christ and get us in rapturing order we must have justification sanctification of baptism in the Holy Ghost and the word that you are allotted and everybody understand that the word that you were allotted okay because there's a group here with this word that is allotted some are gonna die there were allotted so much word they die but inside here we're going to pick up co5 six and seven maybe later on and show how that there's a group in here that's got to be alive and remain to cause this to happen Christ has got to be here we know Christ is in the word all right and we're anointed by the word of God we have the actual anointing but you got to remember look here you've got anointed false prophet now brother Ryan said the anointing ones at the end time were Anointed with the true Holy Ghost they just used it in a false manner they would take one word out add one word to it all right so there's your there's your Antichrist spirit false prophet anointed false prophet and then the Beast because when we take a Rapture that Beast is going to become a Carne and a pope and he's going to rule the world he's not going to rule the world he's going to begin to Rule the World by what flattering by coming in as a religious man not coming in like some Hitler to take over or some Mussolini or or act madinaj or let's get current with you know Al Qaeda or something like that no it's going to be a religious man it's going to be a religious demon that's going to be left here and everybody's going to be at the mercy of that and he's going to do great signs and wonders in so much the world's going to think that's that God has incarnated this man and he's going to take over the world but we we know number one will not be here because the Rapture will take place before this happens right here if you see the if you see the uh the Beast or the Pope in that condition then you've missed the Rapture all right now who's going to see that there's going to be a group that will see that and that's the foolish version right and dude 144 000 exactly they're going to see this this is what's going to cause my alarm again because they're all going to come down against Israel even the United States at that kind of problem the United States won't be very much but at least we'll still have a little military power Maybe to come against Israel and what's going to happen reason Ezekiel on over in Ezekiel and he'll tell you and in Jeremiah how that God's going to come on stand and fight for Israel all right where there's your battle of Armageddon Battle of forces all right and then you're going to have an atomic explosion burn everything off of the earth that it can and we're going to come back into Millennium because remember the Millennium in the future owns two different things hey during the Millennium we're just gonna in a millennium we're just going to step back into this Dimension and you may see shells of buildings and and all kinds of things it's not going to totally take everything out because the devil's still alive and all this subjects are still alive but they can't work on us because we're all little massage little Jesus is walking around the Earth but there is going to come a time after that thousand years that that Antichrist beast spirit is going to raise back up which is Satan incarnate himself not the pope but this is going to be the man Satan is going to come and he's going to try to fight one more time the Battle of Gog and Magog which that's God's fire that's when everything's going to be burnt off that's when all the The Souls of man is going to be done away with that are that are sinful and then it's just going to be when the future home comes down on the earth there's going to be nothing left after that all right there's not going to be houses laying around or things but uh you know many times we watch those movies about um um after the what they call some great apocalypse that might be what it looks like it's not going to hurt us you say what about radiation you think after we took a change and went in another dimension and come back that that's going to harm us I don't think so so and I'm saying this for us doing the Bible study in a couple weeks that the Millennium is different from the from the new Heavenly New York from the city it's coming down totally different now there's certain things that in there that you can replace that you can replace back and forth but during the Millennium they're still going to be just like brother Graham said they are you know they carried over in the ark Will Ham was on the ark the sand was still there all right but he's going to burn it off that's when John sees in Revelations he sees the city coming down as a broad adorned for her husband so that's due to distinct different things yes they do have some similarities of the same characteristics um brother Brown had many questions about the Millennium that he couldn't answer and ask him could babies be born in the Millennium he said maybe yes maybe no but now when you get to the Future home read that future home book all that's done away with there's no more doubt or or what's going to happen it's going to be a new city that we didn't build because the Bible says you and I are going to build houses and inhabit them during the Millennium right here you say a thousand years look what happened what a thousand years back from now and look how much we've advanced just in a sinful condition in a thousand years so I you know don't dwell on the specifics of how we're going to build it and all this stuff just the Bible says we'll build houses and have it so but in a future home we will not build a thing it's like the great husband went and built you a palace and you didn't have a thing to do with it he's just going to give it to you and you're going to be able to live in it for an eternity but he builds it remember according to your desire that's right for him all right so you are the city all right now let's turn to Ezekiel and um and let's look at this line ox man and Eagle you see the parallel here you got this zoomed into here to these I wrote this little little thing here today for you to look at kind of to keep in your in your mind dude I got a problem but you got it you got your line Ops man an eagle that's your four combat Beach seal one two three and four justification sanctification of baptism of the Holy Ghost we already went through all these and then the word incarnate which is all these three it's not a different work it's working the same Holy Ghost but the prophet said to four Palmer worm candy worm caterpillar and whatever that other one is eat it down so four life Messengers had to bring it back well there wasn't four Messengers it was Luther Wesley Elijah what and then the word came in 1963 the word came to change our body so we are being restored back here and you know what even if you die the words you held when you went down is what's going to change your body right if the spirit of him to dwell in you that dwell in Jesus dwell in you it will also Quicken your mortal body on this side and on that side it's going to bring that body back up okay that's why it's not ashamed and say well I have the word for my day you do and you can die with it but that words what's going to bring you back up right all right but then you got the Rapture after all this let's read in Ezekiel just kind of keep this as a parallel because after the four seal has a Rapture no more bride all right but if you weren't here last week remember seal five six and seven is for the ones that are in this group right here is going to take a body change without dying five six and seven that's what five six and seven not not separate that's what they're for inclusive of all this you got to start here first to get to five six and seven if you're not this right here now you forget about five six and seven that's what I said last night in them in the uh banquet if we can't let our light shine just as being husband and wife father mother Pastor Deacon Elder if your life is hindering somebody from becoming a Christian then you need to start work right here not right here right here because I'm gonna read you some quotes when we get into this where brother Brown says you're not even a Christian if your lock can't shine that's what he said I'm telling you what he said it's gonna be me it's gonna be him so if you got something to do with you can deal with the problem but that's why that you've got to have this basic Foundation before you can take a Rapture so let's read Ezekiel one we're just going to skip through it excuse me because in my Bible I've got it written that this is Revelations chapter one and four which one is chapter one it's the bride already in glory right you've heard that brother they'll caught them and what is chapter four the Rapture right there's an Open Door all right so let's listen now it came to pass in the 13th year in the fourth month and the fifth day of the month as I was among the captives by the river chivar that the heavens were opened Revelations 4 1. after this I looked and behold the door was opened in heaven um right see the parallel ezekiel's tell showing you the same thing that the heavens were open now back to chapter one Ezekiel maybe keep your thumb there at revelation and I saw visions of God what did John turn and see you see Jesus standing there in this golden candlesticks what'd he say he saw a bride we saw one man but we he was he was in in symbol form of the gird about the pants for the golden girdle feminist bride form all right skip verse two the word of the Lord came expressly unto Ezekiel the priest the son of buzzai and the land of the Chaldeans by the river shoe bar and the Hand of the Lord was there upon him and I looked and behold the Whirlwind came out of the North a great cloud and fire and folding itself and the brightness was about it and out of the midst thereof is the color of amber out of the midst of fire now what was that Pillar of Fire Revelations chapter one verse 14 his head and his hair were white as wool his eyes are flaming fire his feet like brass as if they burned in the furnace his voice is the sound of many Waters so who is he talking about you know about Jesus Christ that's what Ezekiel was seeing all right verse five also out of the midst thereof came the likeness of four now look also out of the midst of that whirlwind Ezekiel Saw Whirlwind John saw Jesus because he was already started in Bride form when John saw him Ezekiel he wasn't and in the midst thereof turned back over to verse 8 13 chapter 1 Revelation verse 13. and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one life into the son of man clothed in the Garment down to the foot guard about to fight for the Golden Girl what was that showing the bride right in the midst of the seven Church ages Ezekiel seeing the same thing also out of the Mist thereof came the lightness of four living creatures listen to this and this was their appearance they had the lightness of a man now he saw four creatures lion ox man and Eagle but when he saw the vision he saw one man chapter 1 verse 13. because same thing Ezekiel sin Revelations 113 and in the midst of the seventh candlesticks one life into the son of man very same thing right and everyone had four faces and everyone had four wings their street feet were straight feet and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf foot and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass what does brass always mean judgment and they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides and they had their four faces in their wings their wings were joined one to another they turned not when they went they went everyone straight forward I know Ryan had a problem with this one time and I hope I can explain it have you ever seen a hologram you ever seen one of those things where if you turn it a certain way Deanna got one with Spider-Man jumping off of a a building well if you turn it just a little bit further around he's he's swinging turn around a little bit further and he's coming right at you so you see that in the same picture you see Spider-Man I hate to use this for an illustration but you see Spider-Man but if you turn it just a little bit you see what you see them in a different form you see him swinging that's the same way with this there's no way that they can be like that and be lying off ran an eagle and they all be going in the same direction at the same time physically impossible but we're talking about spiritual we're not talking about natural talking about spiritual because actually this is your Holy Ghost the four creatures is the Holy Ghost right the four creatures of the Holy Ghost if you need an OP if you need the spirit of the ox he's right there with you going forward he's not dragging these behind him it's just what comes to the Forefront the hologram I need the spirit of the ox not through not for Spirits I need to be bold like a lion the Holy Ghost will come forward with that and go forward with the line in you not not in me and you man the intelligence of the man if that's what you need in your Christian walk he steps to the front and goes forward so that's is everybody is that okay to explain it that way yeah they're okay because you can't have them in a square because they said they all were facing outward right you can't have them facing outward and going in the same direction physically right but spiritually you can District it's also too you're never going to be back soon that's correct that's correct because if you're going in this Direction with the ox then then see what's happening to these others they're going in a different direction physically right but spiritually if you need the this and it's not you see how close Catholicism is prayers of the Dead Saints they've got traveling Saints as they pray to well that's basically what they get it from from Ezekiel where a spirit comes up and you use that Spirit to go forward with will they do it on a Antichrist way and say well we're going to give you the spirit of of you know Saint Francis which was one of the popes that walked everywhere you know I never I've never been exposed to that until we went out to Colorado hunting and this lady she she was Catholic the mouth Catholic she said I want to pray a prayer for you so she prayed to this saint so-and-so who was a traveling saint who traveled around and did good and had Miracles and stuff like that and all that in his life but he always traveled well they've got a patron saint of travel she showed me the book it's got little sections in it that that's the prayer that you pray if you're going to travel so that's Catholicism but look how close it is to this you're not going to be laying in the bed and call on the spirit of an ox right no that's going to be inside of you as a characteristic of the Holy Ghost but you're going to realize that when you get finished you're going to think man that's what was then made to overcome the same as the ox spirit being in the fourth age for them to overcome that Dark Age that's right everybody got that yes so don't be don't be don't get it all in your head we're not talking natural stuff this is spiritual this is the spiritual being listen and they went everyone straight forward this is the end of chapter verse 9. as for the likeness of their faces day four had the face of a man face of a line on the right side and they four had the face of an ox on the left side they forehead the face of an eagle so there's your line ox man and Eagle everybody got that these were their faces their wings were stretched up where two wings of everyone were joined one to another and two covered their body now listen to this and they went everyone straight forward that's what I just explained to you now we're talking about the Holy Ghost all right the Holy Ghost you've got inside you today that's where those living creatures are you see who it says living creatures not dead creatures living creatures whether the spirit was to go they went who's who's Spirit your spirit the Holy Spirit you got wherever the Holy Spirit goes that's where they're at because brother Brown said he said the four combat beasts are seen no more from from Revelation um from the fifth sea alone he said therefore the Rapture must have took place on the for sale I'm paraphrasing that it's not a direct quote but it's close enough whether the spirit was to go they went and they turned not when they went see they turned not they wine it's like sister William said they can't turn any other way they got to go straight forward all right as for the likeness of the living creatures their appearance was like burning coals of fire and like the appearance of lambs what little lips of Fire it went up and down among the living creatures and the fire was bright and out of the fire went forth lightning and the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning now as I beheld the living creatures behold one wheel upon the Earth by the living creatures creatures with his four faces the appearance of the wheels now look Ezekiel Saw the Wheel in the middle of the wheel which was Jesus Christ with the Israelites going through the Journey in the wilderness but who are we a type of Israel that Israel never received the Holy Ghost like you and I do they don't receive the new birth like you and I do actually those most of those that were in the wilderness they died and God said they were spiritually dead never to be revived again in the living oh verse 15 now as I've beheld the living creatures behold one will upon the Earth where also it was down here not in heaven we don't need a holy ghost in heaven we need a holy ghost down here all right the appearance upon the Earth by the living creatures with their four faces verse 16. the appearance of the wheels and their Works was likened to the color of a barrel and they four had one lightness and who's that whose image we're supposed to be in Jesus Christ all right now listen to this and their appearance and their worst was as it were a wheel in the middle of the wheel all right but listen to this when they went they went upon their four sides and they turned not when they went as for their Rings they were so high that they were Dreadful and their Rings were full of eyes about them four remember what the Bible say the eyes of the Lord go to and fro upon the Earth right now listen to this verse 19. and when the living creatures went the wheel went by them and when the living creatures were lifted up from the Earth the wheels were lifted up rapture lift it up from where from the earth Rapture whether so ever the spirit was to go they went that's why brother Brown could say you don't see any more of these combat beasts because what they go the Holy Ghost goes the bride goes all right verse 20. where the soul the spirit was to go they went then there was their Spirit to go and the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels the ride those verse 21. when those went these went there's your rapture when the Holy Ghost goes we go if you got the Holy Ghost that's the whole thing's going to interact it's the Holy Ghost right right and who and when those went these went and when those stood they stood and when those were lifted up from the earth the wheels were lifted up over against them for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels right let's go to verse 34. 24 I'm sorry 24. and when they went I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great Waters what is Waters in The Bible people like the noise of great what a great amount of people as the voice I circled that word as as the voice of the Almighty in other words the bride's saying the same thing is what the almighty is saying all right the voice of speech as the noise of an host when they stood they let down their wings now let's read 26. and above the firmament that was over their heads was the lightness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone go to Revelation chapter 4. verse 10. and immediately I was in the spirit and behold the white Throne was set in heaven and one sat on that Throne now you all that that went off there all right just trying to give you a parallel because look Revelation chapter 4 verse 6 Before the Throne there was a sea of glass like a new Crystal and in the midst of the throne have you heard that before and round about The Throne were four beasts full of eyes before behind and the first Beast was like a line the second beast a calf third Beast had the face of a man fourth Beast was like a flying eagle so guess what there's your combat beast in Revelations 4 brother Brown said Revelations chapter four was a Rapture right all right Ezekiel chapter 1 verse 20. six and above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne as the appearance of a sapphire stone and upon the lightness of the throne was the lightness of the period appearance he didn't say men it said of a man above opponent one sitting on the throne and I saw the color of amber as the appearance of fire round about within from the appearance of his loins even upward from the parents of his ones even downward in other words he's shown above and below I saw as it were the appearance of fire and it had brightness round about it as the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain what is that rainbow so was the appearance of the brightness round about this was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord and when I saw it I fell upon my face and I heard a voice of one that spoke to continue the chapter two and he said unto me son of man stand upon thy feet and I will speak unto thee and the spirit entered into me when he spaking to me and set me upon my feet now this is Ezekiel prophesying and he said in verse three son of man I send thee to the children of Israel to a rebellious Nation that's us that hath rebelled against me they and their fathers that transgressed against me even this very to this very day listen for their impudent children and stiff-hearted I do send in to them and thou shalt say unto them thus saith the Lord God and they whether they will hear or whether they will forbear for their rebellious house yes you'll know that there have been a prophet among them now you can go on down and you can parallel this from Revelations chapter 5. here in verse 10 and chapter 2 verse 9 when I look Behold a hand was sent unto me a lower role of a book what happened in Revelations 5. the book was open right and he spread it before me and was it was written within and was out and there was written there in Lamentations and mornings and woes look at chapter three let's just read this see if this is not familiar with another chapter in the book of Revelation moreover resent unto me son of man eat that thou findest beat this roll now remember they had Scrolls Revelations 10 you got a book in intelligence Revelations 10 the angel come down and said eat the what eat the book eat this roll and what go speak into the house of Israel now Revelation is 10 says in verse 9 he went and took the book and eat it and verse 11 says that thou must prophesy again before many people and Nations and tongues and kings eat this roll chapter 3 verse 1 Ezekiel and go speak unto the house of Israel so I opened my mouth and he calls me to eat that Rome and he said unto me son of man caused thy belly to eat and fill thy Bibles with this role that I give thee then denied it and it was in my mouth as honey same thing in Revelations 10. sweet remember when he went in the mouth and he said unto me son of man go gift into the house of Israel and speak with my words unto them for thou are not sent to a people of strange speech of a hard language but to the house of Israel which is who you and I now if you'll continue to read the four beasts you can still read some more about them over in Ezekiel but this is pretty much the parallel showing you I just want to prove to you that it is exactly The Book of Revelation is exactly when the seal break or the seals are finished it is exactly when you see this line of oxman and Eagle come up from the earth and go up into heaven that the bribes there with him so I want first seal second seal third seal four seal Rapture takes place all right there I got that yes the living creatures will sing No More why they're nuts they're gone with us they're not here they they're not staying here for the 144 000 they're going to get the Holy Ghost but they're not going to get the new birth like you and I got all right so here we are with a Rapture taking place four seal but remember as the eagle anointing is on us so is this anointing is bringing this to pass to be the Beast same thing with this when you receive the Holy Ghost you have everything you need but you still gotta what eat the book and sometimes some of us just eat one page at a time but in Revelation 10 it should eat the whole book he took the book and ate it there were no pages left let's say about last night that just you know it may not stir up your hearts you may have just felt like it was nothing said but but when that scripture says honor your wife wives be subjective to your husbands that your prayers be not hindered and folks that means a lot because we got him in prayers because we're still here we're still here so we got prayers that are hindered why just goes the way we treat our life just because the way we treat our husband you know I've always said if you two were one then you know when we took on the name Jesus Christ that's why Daddy won't do them but wait and I won't do one and have a woman keep her her last name if you do that she's not even married to you the way I see it because she must drop her name's Center I'm talking to everybody now not just one person we have to drop our name Center and become who not Mrs Jesus Christ human being sinner you Dale no we become Mrs Jesus Christ that's the only way two can be joined is one right that's the only way you got to take on a name that's what we're going to get into when we start next Sunday not next Sunday next Sunday and I'm sure you all come up and say aren't you going to start next Sunday what's the date I don't know just some Sunday so just don't go be here just don't be here you know but that to me though that really I had been yeah I'm burning up too I'm sweating I shouldn't wear this sweater that's okay but what we're what we're doing is is we're we're missing something just in our everyday walk you know what don't you think that don't you think you're missing something in your everyday walk yeah I am I'm missing something in my everyday walk so I want something to not hinder my prayers to God isn't that right that's right I was trying to find it back over there in it's first Peter what was the first Peter three so that's how many that weren't there last night I'll uh listen to this we're gonna get into it real deep verse 7. first Peter 3 verse 7. likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge who do I giving honor unto the wife as into the weaker vessel and as being heirs together what is heirs heirs ain't like this Ayers is like this not join air with Jesus Christ that's the way you are with your wife that your prayers be not hindered and brother Brown says the reason our prayers are hindered is because we know to do something and we don't do it that's iniquity how many times have we read in Matthew 24 that iniquity will abound and the love of many will wax cold we're writing the scripture people we're right in the day like sister Brandon and I were talking about this morning or last night we were in that we are in the day we're not looking for a prophesied day to come no we're in the day right now this is the day that all this is going to be fulfilled and you know what it's like brother Khan always said don't come up here and say you're some Christian take communion and act like you know something and you live a hound dog life that's right you live behind dog life guess what you're a hound dog thank you you're a hound dog so we're gonna start working on the hound dog that's right all of them because we do have little things little iniquities that we know to do better that's right we know to do different that was striking last night I didn't bring a quote for brother random said that but he said I'll I'll bring it next Sunday and the next Sunday and probably Sunday after that but we got to get this straight first folks we got to have this right here in our life before we can start on a body change okay he give you your wife remember what I said last night brother Brandon said uh feel your love the ones I named the other day Eros and the other one that all had a beginning when we dropped down here into human flesh but that agape love never had a beginning and it would never have an end we just dropped down here in time but guess what we dropped down here in time to do to find our maid and then brother Brown said that mate will carry on with you into eternity when we go back up into puregopula the Bible if you'll look in your Hebrew everything in the Old Testament speaks of filial Love or human love but if you if you pick up love where Jesus says love your neighbor and love this one and love that one that's not excuse me that's not feeling your love everything in the New Testament go look in the Greek everything in the New Testament from when Jesus says Love Thy Neighbor it all goes into agape love it's never filial love in the New Testament Jesus is always talking about Higher Love a higher form of love so take care of that with you and take carry that with you during the week and just pray for next Sunday all right that we always
