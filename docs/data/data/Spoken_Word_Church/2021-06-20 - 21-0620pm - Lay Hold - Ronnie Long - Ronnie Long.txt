i've known some for some little bit of time and and uh some for a long time and of course my dad i've known for a really long time good to be with him on father's day hey man if we could just stand and open the word and brother joe's a witness because i sent him my notes that we didn't we didn't talk nope i almost had a change he almost walked all over me this morning but and we lived states apart and i had no idea what he was going to preach we just trust the lord's in control praise the lord you know it's it's most the time when you don't feel when you don't feel him that's when he's most at work you know and how many times each one of us could say that we would have given up a long time ago or you know how many of us and ourselves have said i'll never go back there i'm going to give up or i'm going to walk away or i'm going to turn back but i'm looking at you tonight because you're an overcomer you're still here and we're still here by the grace of jesus christ amen amen hey man we'll just try to see if we can't just kind of fill in a little bit from this morning and talk a little bit about lay and hold lay hold up here okay so i'll hold it up here sorry i'm used to holding something i just i get lay and hold first timothy 6 and the 10th verse for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they have aired from the faith and pierced themselves through with many sorrows but thou o man of god flee these things and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold of eternal life where unto thou art also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses i give thee charge in the sight of god who quickeneth all things and before christ jesus who before pontius pilate witness a good confession keep keep that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukable until the appearing of our lord jesus christ which in his times he shall show who is the blessed and only potentate the king of kings and the lord of lords who only hath immortality dwelling in the light which no man can approach unto whom no man has seen nor can see to whom be honor and power everlasting amen let's just bow our heads father we love you lord jesus your words are life to us and god we're just asking that one more time father you just come our way father one more time you just do what you do father and break the bread of life unto us lord there's no words that could be said to encourage or strengthen us but lord it would come from you father and lord just ask you to circumcise every word father open our hearts to receive lord and lord may you have liberty in this place lord may you have liberty and his soul in each mind father lord we have nothing to bring nothing to give father we openly confess that we have great need of you lord we're nothing father just a sinner saved by grace but lord you are the author of the faith lord and lord you have started to work in us lord and you said you would bring that to a finished father and lord we're trusting in you this afternoon father that you could just give us a little bit more of you father we pray in the name of jesus christ amen you may be seated amen so we we don't have to be rocket scientists or real smart people to realize that we're living in the end times we're living at the last of days and we're living at the fulfillment of all these things and and i believe we're all aware of that especially as christians sitting in here tonight we're aware that this is the culmination of everything that we've lived for and everything that we've been taught and everything that generations past have been taught and passed on to their children and their children and their children's children this is the culmination of that i believe we can see that and you can talk to just any old person on the street and they'll tell you something's different this is the end times and and before you know they'll ask you what what do you think about the end times and do you think this could be the end and and there's a groaning amongst the people about what our brother was speaking about today the whole earth is moving into position and and and this all seems to be hinging around one small circle of people and yet those people do not realize the power that they hold a lot of times you know those people in the middle of that circle they don't realize really that everything is focused around christ in them it's christ in you the hope of glory it's not my personality it's hinging on or brother wade's personality but it's christ in us the whole thing seems to be focused around that and yet in our faith we seem like we're so insignificant and and if satan has his way with us he'll have us thinking that we're not worth nothing and we we don't belong and we're just wandering through and we just happen to pass through this way and maybe we're just here because my daddy will get mad if i go somewhere else but but god has a different plan in mind god didn't just place seed randomly around but he sewed it into those that he knew would come forth at the end and fulfill that word right amen we know this but we're living in a great time not a time of worry not a time of fear not a time of nervousness not a time of rejection not a time to run not a time to get scared not a time to be afraid but we're living in a time of restoration where he promised that there would be a time and it would be at the last day that he would bring restoration to the church and all those things that we've preached about and all those things that we've taught about would come to to a manifestation in our life where we could see god on the move and we could see god in action it wouldn't just be words in a paper or or a tape that we listen to but it would be god coming forth into a life it would be god becoming manifested and even in ourselves we look at ourselves in the mirror and we we line up our own selves and we'll never measure up that way but god elected you i didn't choose you you didn't choose you but god elected you that you would be the manifestation of the fullness of his word that's big shoes to fill but god made you to fill them god created you for that purpose he he thought of you before there was a creation before there was a time before there was any fault or before there was any sin or before there was any sorrow he thought of you bringing to manifestation the promise of all things in this hour i believe we are the seed of abraham we're the spiritual seed of abraham and we will possess all things it's not it's not a question it's not up for debate it's not a maybe soul but we will possess all things and and and i believe the believer recognizes that deep in their soul but they're clouded over sometimes sometimes we get a little shell around us and we get a little nervous spirit on us or we get a little anxious spirit on us and we're afraid to step out by faith but that's exactly why satan has attacked us with that fear because he doesn't want us to recognize who we are and what place we have what position we hold what authority given but there's a day coming when the authority will be recognized i believe we're in that day if we could just use this scripture for reference it's in joel chapter 2 we know it the bible says fear not o land be glad and rejoice for the lord will do great things be not afraid ye beast of the field for the pastures of the wilderness do spring for the tree beareth her fruit the fig tree and the vine to yield their strength be glad then you children of zion and rejoice in the lord your god for he hath given you the former reign moderately and he will cost to come down for the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the vat shall overflow with wine and oil and i will restore this is the lord speaking and i will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar in the palmer worm my great army which i sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of your of the lord your god that hath dwelt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed now i might i might read that scripture and i might think differently if it was just some man promising those things or if it was just you know a great king somewhere promising those things but the lord god almighty has sent us a promise in this day now a lot of years have been stolen from the church of god a lot of years have been taken and a lot of scars have been added and a lot of distress and a lot of peril and a lot of defeat and a lot of sickness and a lot of poor health and but there's a new day coming he said i will restore all the years all those years that you fought that sickness i am bringing a restoration unto you it's not a promise from me it wasn't a promise from william branham or from the prophet joel but it was from the lord god almighty i will do it myself i will come and i will restore those things which have been taken from you i believe we're living in the greatest time that there ever has been there's never been an eye see what we're seeing in this day there's never been a soul uh commissioned to complete what we're commissioned to complete in this hour now enoch is our is what we look to but but he was just one man walking with god so much a man that brother man would say you can get so on fire for god that satan doesn't know what to do with you enoch walked with god so much that there was no room for the dragon to work in him there was no room for the serpent to work in his life because he was walking and striving with the living word now i ask you what difference is our life today enoch wasn't given some some great some great thing that was unreachable for us today but he was walking with the living word walking talking fellowshipping with the living word we're given the same promise in this hour restoration is promised to come to all things but you have to recognize your day and its message and i know i'm preaching to well taught so if we just you can just fill in the blanks and you i know that you know where i'm going but you are a chosen people maybe i'll just slow down for a second you are a chosen people elected called and we read that and we think well that's wonderful but that comes with an authority that's right that comes with a power we don't have to take what the devil gives us we don't have to take a back seat we don't have to back up and say well we'll just have to endure with this but the battle is overcoming the battle is looking beyond what's in front of us and looking to what we don't see the promise given out there by faith abraham saw these things and by faith abraham walked and by faith abraham received a body change because he was looking to the unseen he wasn't looking at this flesh he wasn't looking at this this corruption but he was looking that one day this must put on incorruption if we can get to that same faith but we have to recognize what day we're in you see god has a time and he has a place and he has a day and we cannot look back and blame those that have gone before us it wasn't the time yet it wasn't time to crack the wheat yet but now is the time he said now in this day it will be revealed unto you he said in this last day friends if this isn't the last day then what's going on out here there's wars and rumors of wars and men's hearts are failing for fear and there's false prophets arising and and everything that was prophesied to come is on the earth and even our prophet would say that up here we're not waiting on anything else to come but it's already being fulfilled now i believe by prophetic vision he saw this church assembly here he saw us sitting here and he saw our lives he said we're not waiting on anything else but it's already being manifested in the bride it's already coming into body form where we can we can touch it and we can feel it and we can see it and we can fellowship with it that's the age that we're living in in age like no other age before some of those people were thought of in the mind of god to be martyrs they were thought of in the mind of god to come so close but not far enough because there would be a chosen time for a chosen people that would bring restoration of all things into the church we can't just pick and choose what we want to bring back into the church we can't just take our pet doctrine and bring it in and we just restore that unto me but god said all things will be restored but we have to recognize the day that we're living in he says lord here we are again on the third this is the lifetime three is the number of life and here we are ready for the rapture the church is moving on the great scientists world the churches today setting full of skeptic believers tens of thousands with their names on the book yes millions and would laugh at the gospel and say that they're uneducated they don't know maybe that's so lord but what we lack in education you make up in grace by sending your angel of light by manifesting his power confirming the words to those who are poor and illiterate as we but we love you for this because it's the grace of god that has did it and we know that we were born you got to have that phrase down and we know that we were born and we're not lovely at all we're very unlovely but thou through grace reached down thy merciful hand and has opened our eyes as jesus prayed for us as elijah did for gehazi as he looked to see around him and today our eyes are open and we see the things of god and know we're moving at the end time when the gentile people's days are about finished he'll take a people for his name let us be included there lord humbly we beg we pray that you'll grant it amen he's taken to people it's not by our education it's not by our theology it's not by our great revelation but it's by his grace it's by his grace that we're saved it's i thank god for that because if it was it was up to me and my smarts and my my ability to figure it out i'd be lost uh i'd be like we were the other day trying to figure out whether joe's little puzzles you know just just a question in the mind well it's got to unlock somehow but i'm just not the guy to figure it out i just don't know how to do it but thank god it's by grace and he called you by name amen now maybe you haven't heard your name called audibly but you're sitting in here you've been presented with a light he said we overcame because you sent your angel of light and you manifested your power through him now you can't unhear what you've already heard you've already been presented with the truth you've already presented been presented with with these things that we believe in and we know that god sent a prophet and we know that he came and did the signs and wonders but we know what he preached that there would be a people and you and no matter how far you run away from that no matter how far you deny that he was a prophet or the word was vindicated or that he was authorized to do what he did you cannot unhear the fact that he that he said there would be a people that will take this word and they will bring it to manifestation it's not manifesting time it's manifested time i believe we're in the age where we are we are moving up into that realm that realm is moving down and we're remember that song we'll speed up and they'll slow down and we'll just get hand in hand with them that dimension is so close if it was only 15 feet away back in 1963 how close is it now that dimension is slowing down to our speed and we're speeding up to it and just very soon there will be i saw those pictures down there in the basement just very soon any day it might be a fairy tale to somebody but i'm a believer that very soon there will be an 18 year old woman walk through that door there there will be somebody that we've seen going on before and and you might think you'd get a little excited now and we might think we're going to get a little over excited and you say why is this guy up there yelling why is he screaming and why is he spitting because i've seen into that dimension i know it's real i brought back grapes from that and i can say taste and see that the lord is good i'm not preaching this from from somewhere i've never been but i've been over there and i've seen what god can do in his power and his mind how he can save a sinner how he can save a good old hypocrite how he can save just a message pharisee raising the message and sitting on the front pew and saying amen when you're supposed to say but god can even save that he knows how to get your attention he knows how to break you he knows how to how to mold you to get your attention but we must recognize our day and his message jesus said it will be the same thing at the coming oh then the evening light of malachi 4 comes shining through the darkness amen to bring the evening light on the predestinated word on who the predestinated word hallelujah that's the fourth message to be that's the fourth messenger to shine the light on the word the word is predestinated it has to come forth when god gives a prophecy there's not a devil there's not a team of devils there's not a there's not a hundred devils there's nothing that could stop that from coming to pass because god gave a prophecy so when i read this i don't think well maybe there's a people far out somewhere that's going to do it i read this and i say god said that no matter how many devils come against me no matter how many sicknesses attack my body no matter how many depressions attack my mind i will come out i am that lily no matter what you plant on top of me i'm gonna bring forth life because there's a seed in there that no man put in there that no doctor put in there but god himself planted in there before the foundation of the world and he said you will be an overcomer that's me that's you well who else who else is going to fulfill these scriptures but it falls on the predestinated word he says i will restore saith the lord i will restore right the evening lights come shining through now it's not light it's lights evening lights now there once was there once was a man that came and he was the evening light and he brought a truth and he brought a vindicated word but it didn't stop there he said now there will be evening lights those that actually picked up what i was saying those that actually believe what i'm saying and that they can manifest it in their life it's not just a fairy tale for some other time but there's evening light sitting here i believe matthew 24 matthew 24 comes in two phases right there's questions asked in the morning and there's answers given at night in the evening time the questions are asked in the morning of the day matthew 24 took place on a tuesday it's the third day of the week you have to recognize your day and i'm not an over typologist but these things are important it was on a tuesday the disciples started asking and the prophecy came forth that the seals would be open that these seals would be delivered and they wouldn't just be locked up and they wouldn't be hidden in parables and they wouldn't be but there will come a day and he said and at that day if you ask in my name and that was at the evening of the third day so i ask you what day are we living in you got to know what day you're living in so many things can transpire in just a few moments so many things can change in just a just a twinkling of an eye what day are we living in there was questions asked in the morning and there was answers given in the evening there was a prophecy going forth and there was a fulfillment given just just in one day's time in the evening light i think about another third day when it was the third day that was promised that there would be one resurrect now that day is also broken up into two stages i know we're studiers of the message and we know these things but there's two stages to that day as well and and and on the first day nothing just death second day death of course the prophet goes into this martin uh luther and wesley no life no life at the beginning of the third day there was a rumor there was a rumor went forth that he was alive there was a rumor went forth that he had resurrected and that the the the stone had rolled away from the tomb and there was a rumor that he was open but there was two parts to that third day and i think of it like this just real simple i'm just a real simple guy that cleophas and his friend were walking on the road to emmaus i love that it never mentions who he is actually brother branham tells us it was cleophas and his friend the bible says cleophas in another cleophus and his friend were walking and they were talking and they were they were visiting on these things and there was a rumor going around that there would be a resurrection and they they knew him in in flesh they walk with him they talk with him they ate with him they fellowship with him but yet there was still doubt in their heart well what what what are these things and what disparity are we into on it i just can i just be personal with you that's how the devil works we'll ask for many things in our life we'll have prayed for many things and we'll be seeking miracles and we'll be seeking signs and they don't come to pass the way that we want them and they don't come to pass in the time that we want them and then the devil creeps in with with that unbelief and he'll creep in with depression and he'll creep in with that anxious spirit and you'll get so nervous in yourself you don't know whether to trust god at his word or not because because it hasn't happened in the time that you thought it would happen it didn't happen just the way that you thought it would happen and the devil's right there to argue about it quick quick to bring out the faults and say well what about this and what about that and look at this over here and and look at the look at the back parts of israel as the scripture says and look at the faults happening in the church and look at the la the separation there and the spirit of division and this one's off here and this one's off there before you know it you feel so isolated you don't want to leave your own home and you just want to stay by yourself because you feel anywhere you go is treacherous ground but god said he would restore all things all the years that your mind has lost and it's not lost out there somewhere but all the years that you've given over to the devil just just just anxious in yourself unsure of your faith unsure to step out on god's word and say that promise is mine all the years that have slipped by worry not they're going to be restored if not us then who we must recognize the day that we're living in and so these two were walking on the road they began to talk about these things and they begin to to say is he resurrected really is this ward really alive is it come back and you know there was a they took a hundred men to roll that stone in front of the tomb now it took a hundred men to roll that that stone in front of the tomb and there's no way he could have got out in there just think about these are just men like us that have rational thoughts like we do we think how impossible would it have been for peter and john to roll away a stone that took a hundred men to do it but when the evening light comes it doesn't matter how big the stone is you might have a hundred denominational powers behind you to tell you that this goes this way and you can't access that and you can't get there and rapturing faith is out of grass but it just takes one light one evening light to come through and roll away the stone it doesn't matter what's in front of you it might have taken a hundred men to put that stone in front of you you might have been in and out of church and you might have had this preached you and that preached to you in falseness and false doctrine and you feel that your foundation is weak and it's crumbling it doesn't matter if it took a if you went through a hundred churches it just takes one light one light to roll away the stone the third day is the first day that life would come on the earth genesis 11. the third day is the day that abraham offers isaac as a sacrifice and the sacrifice is accepted and iran comes forth you see you got to recognize the day that you're living in the third day is the day that god comes down in a pillar of fire and begins to speak directly to israel by by thunders and lightning and that's the day that he brings forth the ten commandments on the third day on the third day in leviticus and numbers and and and those old testament scriptures the third day was when the sacrifice was to be accepted touch not to sacrifice until the third day when it's accepted friends what day are we living in there's a day when there's going to be a people come to authority that recognize the day that we're living in the message we've been given the light that we're walking in it's not just something to debate about it's not just something to have quote wars back and forth about and i'm right and you're wrong but this is a vindicated word to a vindicated people and i don't know who's going to be in front of me but i'm going to receive everything you got to get out of my way that's for me i don't care what you look like in front of me i don't care how big the mountain is i don't care if the stone took 100 men to roll in front of it that vindicated word is for me that's a promise for me that's a that's a victory in my camp we've got to recognize it was in the book of esther the fifth chapter on the third day that she would put away her robes her sackcloth and she would put away her robes of mourning her rubs of nervousness lay it aside and she would enter into the king's room and he would grant her authority esther was given authority on the third day where are we church esther esther had to go beyond what she felt like had to go beyond her her physical faith and go beyond what she could do in her own power she said he's either going to take me or he's going to kill me but she knew that there was something there when he first looked at her in that room and there was a there was something in his eye that told her he loves me i'm going to go in and receive my authority and you know what esther received up to half of the kingdom she recognized her day friends we've got to recognize where we're living what day is this this is not just a another day just another sunday just the the 20th here another father's day but this is the final day young people don't be despaired by this and think well i'm not going to get to live my life and i'm not to get live it to the fullness but god thought of you for that purpose because you can handle it because you were made for it you were you were given a flesh body to fulfill that purpose because you were made for this generation you were made to be an overcomer in this age when it's the darkest stage you have to go through many things that i did not have to go through i remember when texting and phones first came out i was just i was a teenager already but but but it's been here since then this generation that that's coming up is going through things that we could never imagine that that they would have to go through but you were made for it that's right you weren't just made to go through it you were made to overcome it you were made to be victorious on the other side god's not going to lose one he hasn't forgotten you he doesn't he hasn't lost place of you but he knows exactly where you're at and he's going to bring his word to fulfillment in your life is that all right walking in the third day hosea the sixth the sixth chapter if we could turn to that or you could pull it up remember we're talking about laying hold what day are we living in yeah you got that up there yeah yeah sorry if i get a little excited but just just how it comes out with me six one well i got a new bible on the way down here it's not really broken in yeah i'm gonna cheat come and let us return unto the lord for he hath torn you didn't read that wrong he hath torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days he will revive us and in the third day he will raise us up and we shall live in his sight we're going through many struggles we've been through many battles and we've been through through our hardships i couldn't imagine there's there's older believers in here that have been through trials i could have never imagined i go through i i don't have kids old enough to be praying for that they'd come back into the fold and i haven't gone through some of those trials but the lord has torn the lord did it not not not just your inability or your lack of faith or don't let satan say it was your unbelief for your mistakes or you turned the wrong direction but the lord had torn but he promised he would heal the lord has smitten but he promised he would bind it up the lord has done these things and he said after two days will i revive that's not an empty promise but we saw a revival after two days we're in a revival that started at the second day something that god promised would come he said i'll i'll i'll tear it apart i'll rip it apart because i'm going to polish it fine but i'll heal it i'll heal the wound over i'll smite it but i'll bind it up and then i'll revive it remember i will restore but in the third day what day are we living in friends in the third day i will raise it up i will raise up a people that will manifest the very works that will manifest the very word that i promised not just a just an empty letter but a manifestation in power and demonstration and god did not take mark 16 out of the bible he did not take the nine spiritual gifts out of the bible if anybody took that out it was man and it was man alone because god changes not those things are still in the bible am i right those things are still in hebrews 13 8. god changes not they shall lay their hands on the sick and they shall recover that did not die in 1965 the ability for god to heal i've seen god do so much in just my short life i've seen him do miracle after miracle after miracle and you don't need to be overseas to see it it can happen right here in america it can happen right here in your life it can happen right in your own family i think just in the moment if i could just share another brother's testimony that's all right my i i have a friend brother brother wayne lawson made me know him and he was preaching in in louisiana one wednesday night just seemed like an insignificant wednesday night he was actually down there to work on the church for the for the new building so he wasn't even down there to preach and they said well you're gonna preach for us and he was just preaching a regular old message and he began to preach and just barely touched on the prodigals just touched on the prodigals but a young sister there maybe you know this story young sister there rose up and came up in the prayer line they had a prayer line for two and a half hours on a wednesday night you got to want it and and that sister began a kid came up just a young girl and she said i want to stand for my brother he's out in the world he's falling away from church he's he's for forgotten the faith he's just a young man and he's troubled and i just want to stand for him and claim that promise and they began to pray over him and the brothers and and and she went on and began to kneel at the altar and pray and about 20 minutes later a car rolls up in the parking lot and a guy runs out in his pajamas the doors opened the car he took out a stop sign in the way in the parking lot and he runs in the church in his pajamas and runs up to the front of the church and openly gives his heart to the lord and it was that girl's brother now you tell me what did that he goes to brother tim's if you want to ask him he still goes to church his name's justin he said he woke up in the middle of the night and his family wasn't home and it was wednesday night and they were supposed to be home and here it was midnight nobody was home he said they were at church he said i missed the rapture i missed it and he said i fear gripped him so tight said i've missed i knew the truth i knew that it was the truth i knew that that was the right thing and i've missed it he ran to his car and he drove as fast as he could to the church and gave his heart to the lord now you asked me what did that but a light came forth a light woke him up it was the evening life if god could do it for justin god can do it for you if god could do it for justin he could do it for your son and your daughter and your loved one and your cousin and your mother and your father he could do it for whoever whosoever will we got to recognize what day we're living in this is the day that the lord has made and i will rejoice and be glad of it this is the day not tomorrow not yesterday but right now a right now gospel those things did not die back in the day well you you've been around this is a missionary-minded church you probably have more testimonies than i do but just in my short life i've seen god do amazing things heal families heal marriages restore bodies straighten out crooked legs raise people from wheelchairs raise people from the dead yes in this day in this hour we live in why because he's god and he changes not his word change is not it's just as powerful today as it was 75 years ago it's just as powerful today as it was when he walked in the flesh and he ate with the disciples and he said if that will be clean that can be clean it's just as powerful today i was in a meeting in uganda some time ago and a young man came up for prayer and he had epilepsy said he had it since he was four years old he was about 20 22 years old he said he's had it since he was four just breaking his seizures and and just you know have you know what it is epilepsy and he had had caesar so strong that his eyes were loose in his head and his eye would roll back didn't speak english had to speak to an interpreter had never been to a message church before i don't even know if he'd been to a christian church before he actually came in from kenya brother he came over from the kenya border into uganda and he's he said somebody invited me and went out and witnessed to me and said if you come to these meetings you'll meet the lord and through the interpreter he said i don't know all everything you've been preaching and some of it's confusing to me he said but if if that god that you're preaching can heal me then i'll believe him and i just use the words of the prophet right back at him i said if what i preach to you is the truth and god will vindicate himself to you will you serve him and love him all your days would you believe this is the truth with all your heart because he'll heal you if you want it and you know that i wouldn't be telling this story if he didn't get healed and the men of god we began to lay our hands on him we began to pray and we began to rebuke that spirit and that spirit got up out of him and left him and his eyeball went straight his eyeball went straight in front of him the same god today as he was then he's still hebrews 13 8. if he can do it for him what could he do for you if he could do it for somebody that doesn't know anything about it he just walks in blindly to the faith and he says oh yeah i'd receive it if he'd heal me what about you who know these things who know that god's a healer who know that god's a savior who know that god has touched you he's he sparked something in your life and maybe it's been years gone by since your last holy ghost experience but he's the still the same god today he still lights fires he still he still least releases the captive he's still sets free i'm a witness me and brother joe we're talking about living witnesses that were there to see these signs and when brother branham was here in the cloud and these different things and as i went to bed that night i was just thinking man that would have been awesome and something just came by me and said you are a living witness i am a living witness that this message is the truth i am a living witness that is still the same word today as it always has been it still has the same power today as it always has it's by our faith church cleophas and his friend were walking along the way discouraged discouraged in themselves a great trail of discouragement and then a light comes forth and one of them just starts walking along with him where'd he come from right he just came out of the bushes seemingly that dimension just and he begins walking with him but what are you talking about well what do you mean what do you mean what are we talking about do you not know are you are you a foreigner are you from another world and he says what things what things friend that's what it's like when we we're so troubled in our mind and we see no way out there the the the the son of man is standing in our presence there he's here he meets us he meets us every time we come together he meets us every time we call on him and yet our battle is still too hard for him to overcome what things what was that again that was so troubling to you what was that again that was that was driving you to the end of your rope and you're just about to give up what was that what things and they began to tell them all these things oh is that so they began to fellowship and he began to just drop little nuggets to him here and there here and there remember this is the second stage of the third day in the evening time they begin to walk you know how far it is to emmaus seven miles they begin to walk seven miles and just little nuggets begin to get dropped out and little faith building things and little things that that he's the same yesterday today and forever and and just like the shunammite woman he can come to you and and just these little things and he began to go back to all the prophets had taught and began to encourage their hearts that's why we can't forsake the assembling of ourselves together all that the prophets had taught and began to encourage their hearts and they began to rise up in faith and they began to walk down the road and and all of a sudden they really liked this guy that came out of nowhere seemingly and it's time for him to go but you know what they did they laid hold of him they didn't let him go they said come come come visit with us and come in to sup with us and and i wonder how many times that he's been right here in the middle of this aisle and we haven't constrained him to come to our problem and to come to our need and to come to our household and to come fix our marriage and to come fix our thoughts how many times has he walked right by us and we just let him go but you gotta lay hold lord he won't walk by forever but he's here today his grace is still open today we've got to lay hold of the manifested word of god he's here he's not coming he's here [Applause] and it constrained him to come in cleophas and his friend and it was by the way he broke the bread right the prophecy was fulfilled by the way that he broke the bread unto them they received the same authority as esther did by the way he broke the bread unto them recognizing what day we're living in and in the third day i will raise it up yes they knew there was something different about him they could feel a different presence in him they could feel something different and just the faith that was given to them but when he broke the bread in the evening time their eyes we're open what day are we living in remember in john 16 he gives the same prophecy he says there's coming to time yet a little while the world will see me no more but you still see me and in that day in that day friends we're not living in some in somebody else's day we're living in our day this is our time this is our moment where's our faith at i know i know it's in there i can preach to you straight because i know god puts you here to be an overcomer there's got to be something that will activate our faith that will let us rise up and say i'm not going to take what satan gives me but i am a child of god i'm a daughter of god i don't have to take what satan gives me he doesn't have dominion in my mind or god said i could have a sound mind i don't know i don't know everybody here enough to preach to your problems but i i know the lord is he's able maybe some of us are battling with confusion in her mind and maybe somebody's come and sown some seeds of unbelief and some discord and we're unsure and even in our mind we'd never admit it but we're questioning yeah but you know it just takes one light one light to pierce through that darkness one light to set it up i you know brother brown said that the hardest thing for god to do was to get one mortal man to believe another but yet that seems the easiest thing for satan to do he just spread a little drop a little line here and before you know it it's it's this huge rumor out there somewhere so a little discord here and before you know it the people are weak in faith and you know it's just so a little negativity there and seems to be really easy for him to do but we are an elected people said that you were predestinated to receive him in this age in this age we were designed to receive this word we were built to receive this word we were made to receive it we were made to manifest it not anybody else us seems to be seems to be easy for satan to come in with an unvindicated word and unvindicated ministry and so seeds of doubt and before you know it our mind starts teetering right right that's right tempted in all things if thou be if thou be the son of god if thou be who who did that who was that tempted in all things like we are you know brother branham was walking with a friend one time i don't know how long i've been up here but i'm gonna cut some of this out brother branham was was in a vision remember he was walking with a friend he never named the friend said he was walking with a friend can we just read the quote praise the lord right then as i sat there a little bit this is out of paradox a side of this chair then all of a sudden hear it come again then i knew that it was a vision and then when i come into the vision again it seemed that i was lifted up and sitting on a highway a narrow way with some brother i never knew who the brother was i looked around i said now i am sure and know this is the vision the lord god is here and it seemed like everybody was afraid said what's everybody so afraid of almost like brother brandon was stepping into a situation where it was already unfolding and it was already going on and he comes down into in a vision into the middle of a situation where everyone is afraid and a voice came and said there is such danger in these days there's a great hideous thing that's death when it strikes you and i heard the weeds mashing down trail of the serpent and i looked and here come a huge monster snake crawling through the weeds and i thought now knowing this is a vision that i shall see what this animal is or this beast is and he crawled up on the highway and as soon as i as soon as i got sight of him i knew it was a mamba now a mamba is an african snake which is the most deadly biden of all things there is there's nothing as poison as a mamba and the snake of course represents sin death see in division now remember brother brown is an outdoorsman god speaks to him in things like snakes and squirrels and and things of the outdoors and waters and rivers and fish and lures and this mamba represents something it's the deadliest thing there is it's eternal death represents sin and death and there that we have of this country the rattlesnake and the copperhead the cottonmouth moccasin many of those snakes that if you're in bad health and one would bite you it would perhaps kill you if you're weak in faith and one would bite you it would perhaps kill you but if you didn't get aid of some sort right of way and then if we go into africa and india we find that the cobra there's a black cobra he's a bad snake he's a death bite there's the yellow cobra which is far beyond him and the yellow cobra the patient dies with such a horrible death and you think why am i reading all this because god's god talks and types it dies from suffocation it paralyzes the breathing system and they can't breathe they just open their mouth and gap and trying to and die like that and that was the type of snake was just one look from getting billy paul when we got the snake in africa and then comes the mamba he's death he's so fast you can't see him he goes over the top of the weeds and propels himself with the back of his tail just whoosh and he's gone hits you in the face usually stands up high and strikes hard and then when he hits you you just got a few breaths till you're finished turn real it don't only paralyze you it gets in the bloodstream it gets in the nerves everything you just die in just a few seconds them native boys and track boys you can't say mamba and they'll butt their heads together and scream because it's death just in a few seconds see when one hits you i don't know i'm not a snake expert by any means but have you ever seen a black mamba they're not black they're gray they're in between white and black they're they're a gray color an uncertain color there's something that can blend in real well with anything and but why they call them a black mambas because when they open their mouth it's pitch black it's like outer darkness black i mean it's ink black when they open their mouth it's something in there is the blackest i've ever seen if you've ever seen a picture of a black mama with his mouth open i mean it's black black that's why they're called the black mama but in color they seem like they're not that dangerous they're not brightly colored they're not yellow they're not they're not this glossy black they're just a gray snake but yet they possess the most deadly bite now why is that come on you know when a mamba bites you its venom is going straight to your heart it works on the nervous system and the nervous system is the fastest way that it can get to that heart muscle it works on your nerves come on come on reach brother yep yes come on come on brother god god never intended for you to be afraid or for you to be sad there you go that's black black right on brother joe man nasty i'd be afraid i'd be scared of it but god talks and types so why would he use something like that something that just blended in with everything else if fellowship may be with everybody else brother bam said he would send somebody that would have a toxin with him and come into fellowship and rub shoulders and visit and talk and shake hands and hug and get a relationship and you exchange phone numbers and all of a sudden he's a black mamba [Applause] come on mamba's venom is cardiotoxic leading directly to the heart stands up like a man when it strikes too and here he was on the highway and i thought well this is it so i looked at him and he looked angry at me and he licked his tongue and here he come but when he got right close to me he would run up fast and then he would get slower and slower and just quiver and stop then something would hold him off he couldn't bite me he would turn around on the other side try to approach from this side and he would get back and get us started and swish right towards me and get slower and slower and slower and then to a stop and then he would shake like that and move back he couldn't strike me remember one time when a snake like that struck a prophet of god before it didn't end well for him remember that remember when paul reached his hand and he was gathering wood and that and they say it was an ad or possibly a mamba struck him on the arm and he shook it loose you know brother brown said he couldn't die because his blood was too rich that snake had a fear in him of the of something that was inside that man even in a vision something inside that man was was so was so fearsome to that snake mambas don't back down to anything you go out in the wild they don't run they don't retreat because they are the ultimate predator out there but when it came to a prophet of god who recognized his authority who knew where he was standing that snake couldn't do it couldn't get to him couldn't attack him he'd already made that mistake once remember on calvary when he made that mistake and he said now i've got him i'm going to cut right into him i'm going to get him and his stinger was pulled out watch this though and then he turned and looked at my friend and the way he went after my friend and i see my friend just jumping way in the air and over him and over him trying and the thing was striking at him i thought oh if it ever hits him it'll be an instant death no wonder everybody's so scared because when this thing hits you it's an instant death and it was just striking at him like that and i threw my hands and i said oh god have mercy on my brother i said if that serpent ever strikes him it'll kill him and just then the serpent turned to me when i said that and looked at me again and a voice came from above and said you have been given power to bind him the worst or any thank you come on friends where'd that voice come from you have been given power to bind him or worse or any and i said well god what must i do and i've heard this quote just preached to me and preached to me and preached to me in myself just feeling so condemned and he said there's one thing you must do you must be more sincere see you must be more sincere and i've been stuck there for so many years i had been stuck there i've got to be more sincere it's by my works i've got to get there i've got to crawl on my knees i've got to bear a cross i've got to you know how we do in our mind you know we think i've just got to be so spiritual but look how the prophet settles it i said well god forgive me for my own sincerity and let me have sincerity and when i raised up my hands to him again there was a great something came over me just lifted me up seemed like that my whole body was charged with something now you can't get upset at me for getting a little excited in church because i've had connection with my theophany a time or two i i know that it's out there and i felt its touch at time or two and you know what brother brown says it energizes you it gives you a jolt of something in your body that you know you make connection with a supernatural being and you feel like shouting you feel like getting a little excited you feel that holy ghost power come in your life because there's a you out there that's not of this world charged with something and i looked at the serpent and he started towards me and he couldn't do it yet and i said satan in the name of the lord jesus christ i bind you and the serpent a blue smoke flew out of him and he curled up and made that sign like a s capital s made backwards and an ant sign and means bind this one or anything below him because he was the worst blue smoke fell out of him and his tail choked his own self that's why when you said that today i got so his tail choked his own self around his head when he made this s backwards and that sign like a conjunction you see it choked it to death and the brother went free questions and answers somebody asked brother branham will you please explain to me matthew 10 41 what is it to have a prophet's reward what is his reply he says you're the friend of a prophet you see him and a friend were walking down the highway and the prophet's reward was to speak for his brother and say satan i bind you in the name of the lord jesus christ i will not be ashamed of this message i will not be ashamed of this messenger i will not take a backseat and back up on what i believe because i am a friend of the prophet maybe he never knew me but he came into this vision he said i didn't know the brother but i stepped into a situation and everybody was afraid [Music] what is it to have a province reward it's not just to rub shoulders with him it's not to shine his tires it's not to to buy them red hots i bind you in the name of the lord jesus christ and the snake formed himself like into a pitcher remember we read in revelations earlier this morning and he cast out of his mouth like waters he was pouring like a picture like a pitcher a water pitcher and he formed into this picture and brother brown said and he just in the blue smoke to think that the worst of them all was was was tied up in just a few simple words can i take it out of another angle and he told me i had seen a big mambo running that's an african snake he was trying to kill people it was after my brother and i screamed out oh god what can i do he said you've been given power to bind him said be of good courage i spoke to him and his tail went up in the air and whirled around and just like this pitch pitcher handle here he choked himself to death blue smoke flew out of him next morning when i woke up i was laying there said i better get up and take the children to school i looked over and there was a hideous looking thing looked like it was alley hoop in the funny paper great big horn sticking out of it he was going sound like a hen cackling or singing like they're going from the barn and i looked at it wasn't that funny it sounded like a chicken i said me to honey media she didn't wake up and i thought yeah that that scared her to death i waited there just a minute to stand and watch people talk about devils and don't even know what they are sometime that right but you run headlong into them every day maybe but you will notice and after a while he was accusing me said you have no power with god how many times has that been thrown across your your thoughts i would say it's your thought but it's been thrown across your thoughts thrown into your mind you have no power with god you're not sincere enough you're just a bluff you have no power and i said satan you're an offense to me get out of my way in the name of jesus christ and he left now friend i don't know what you're at i don't know where you're at or what you're struggling with and i really feel that that god's just pulling on there's there's there's some people in here that have been bound in their mind afraid to step afraid to walk afraid to venture out in their faith afraid to take god at his word may be afraid to use a gift that god gave you afraid to be vulnerable in front of the people of god afraid of something but you have the power to bind it in the name of jesus christ that's not presuming without authority but it's a promise given by the prophet you have the power to bind him or any worse thing we're not venturing without authority we're not taking a misstep or walking on on ice but this is what we work we were put here to do we're dragon slayers we're snake stompers our heels to bruise his head our foot's to destroy him my words are to condemn him into hell where he came from i have been anointed and placed in this age to overcome every devil that lays in front of me and you have been placed in this age to overcome every devil can i get some fathers in here since this is father's day you have been anointed and placed in this age to overcome every enemy that will try to get into your home that will try to affect your wife that will try to affect your children that will try to rob your victory out of out of your headship of your home you have been anointed to overcome that spirit in this age oh i'm not sincere well god forgive me of my insincerity lord make me more sincere and when i rose up there was a charge that came inside of me you've been anointed to overcome in this age not just take a backseat and not just be a pew sitter or a good a good singer or occasionally raise your hand or occasionally say amen you've been anointed to to cast out dragons you've been anointed to smash the head of serpents you've been anointed to destroy every sickness that tries to attack your home anointed by what the power of the almighty god the greatest power there is on earth this day this scripture is fulfilled in our ears we're not waiting for another time to come i'm that friend that was walking with cleophas and he began to break the word of life to me and he began to take the veil off of my eyes and i began to see there's a light there's a light coming forth and i heard a voice say arise shine thy light has come this is your day this is your time this is your anointing get in the flow of the anointing of god it's not just for another age far out there but it's right now are we the bride of christ is this not our h is this not our time is this not an overcoming time we should be the most victorious people on earth of course we're going through battle of course we're fighting but we're victorious you were predestinated to overcome him in this age god knows how many struggles you've been through in your life untold untold hurdles so many sacrifices made so many loved ones pains you it hurts you he's torn yeah and he's smitten yeah but he said he'd revive it he said he'd bind up he said he'd bring restoration he said we could receive a prophet's reward you see what was different about those two is they tarried long enough to see the manifestation of the third pole they didn't have to fake it they didn't have to go make something out of it they tarried long enough with the word until they saw it come to pass in their life it's in the third day yeah i believe we're in the evening light i believe the evening light has come i believe there's been a light that shot through the darkness of laodicea it's shot through the darkness of this chaos around us when the world seems so uncertain and and and the government and don't think that you're settled in yourself we had an 11-day conflict with israel and hamas a while back that could have been it right that could have been it yeah i mean the united states was that close to turning their back on israel under the under the name of humanity and humanitarianism this world is setting itself up but the bride is taking herself up i'm not of this world i'm not of this chaos [Applause] we have to recognize the day that we're living i believe we do as a church friends satan you're an offense to me that seems too simple brother it worked for him not only did it work for him it worked for his friend [Music] satan is attacking the faith in this message so hard yeah and we know there'd be a shaking of a tree and there'd be those fall away and those stand but he's shaking that so hard why because he knows what a prophet's reward is i can't get to him if they're under the coverage of that light this evening light this fourth light that we're living in will drive back any enemy drive back any sickness you might be inflicted in your body but you don't have to stay that way you might be fighting a battle in your mind but you don't have to stay that way you might be fighting a battle that you've never never dreamed that you'd have to fight this hard but it doesn't have to stay that way this light that we live in is the gospel light amen all power all power given if we could just stand to our feet you know it was on the third day there remember the story of of in in in memphis when the prophet was on his way somewhere supposedly you know he thought he was just moving in the perfect will of god but god had other plans and his plane came down and grounded itself and he began to walk and you know you could go through the whole story and see how he turned this way and turn that was just listening to the voice that still small voice and there he comes across a woman who's leaning over her fence she's got a whole rag on her head and she's just out in the morning do and she says she does something that that man's done his whole life yeah she tells him who he is she says morning parson i knew you were coming she tells him who he is and they're just like the shunamite woman i skipped over this quote but i'm just going to read this part they want to know what a prophet's reward is it's to be a friend to the prophecy that's your reward he's your friend like the shunamite woman he says it might come in handy sometimes amen she begins to tell him who he is all right there you go he said i prayed i prayed and here you are and him not knowing where he's at or why he's there or what's going to take place and they walk inside and then they find a boy lay down on them we know the story is the boy laid out on the bed and he's just oh it's dark it's dark it's dark there's no light remember you said earlier there's no god there where was he brother bannon had been where that boy was at oh it's dark oh and she says this is the third day that he's been like this she says would you pray he says well why don't you pray first mama you know prayers don't have an expiration date there's a quote i don't have it here but it just comes to me now he said there's mama and daddy's prayers laying up under the altar and they might be years passed on but those prayers are still there under the altar so your grandma might have prayed for you or your mama might have prayed
