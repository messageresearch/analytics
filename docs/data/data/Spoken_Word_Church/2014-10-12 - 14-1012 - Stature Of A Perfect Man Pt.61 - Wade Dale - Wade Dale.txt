========================================

time last Sunday Matthews and mobile brother Bob at the Monica and then we're with us yeah we just had a wonderful service that's right wonderful service we did it never happened see it worked see it did that it must be you yeah this accessory is not supported by this iPad anyway these are upgrades so I'm going to read this though on Statue of perfect Memphis got your book it's paragraph 328 it's not gonna be on the screen but we're going to get this red I want your glove but I want you to get this red and he either has a app the uh table you can read along with me okay paragraph 328 Rebecca you got it on yours crack out 328. go to paragraph 328 stay now in building yeah yes okay I usually try to use the paragraph number because usually it doesn't change now when they started writing the different books and the different fonts the pages have changed but usually the paragraphs have stayed the same so paragraph 328 okay um now in building The Virtue building this Monument he's talking about building this statue see it starts off with the foundation stone fade virtue knowledge tempered questions regardless brother kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the headstone see we got to come to a place and wait for the headstone we're not coming to a place and there it is we're going to come to a place and wait on it because remember there's other people in their Journey this got to come to that also you may come up here and say I got brotherly kindness where you at Lord well that's okay he might be dealing with you over there but I'm still down here trying to get my temper out of the way so but if I'm if God saw me make it you know what he's going to wait on me right he's going to wait until I get some get it first some can run faster some can run slower so you don't all come to the same place at the same time all right same way with adoption and all these other things all right we come to the east at revelation we may sit in a sermon and listen to brotherdale preach and say and that's best I've heard and and don't start working with you and the guy sitting beside him you going you preached out about two years ago I got that you know but still you can add to that right you add to the Revelation all right you don't just sit there and sleep say well it's not for me today Lord right unless somebody get something preaching nothing then you you know then you say well maybe Lord that's for somebody else not for me building this Monument building this statue see the it starts off with a foundation stone face virgin always the information Godly brothers and kindness now what does it do then you're waiting for the headstone which is love for God it's love and he controls he is the strength of every one of these things that's right yes sir now stop for a minute and go back to our example of Jesus Jesus went to the River Jordan at the beginning of his journey not the beginning of his life but the beginning of his journey as the Messiah he was born to Messiah but God identified who he was on the River Jordan now look you weren't born Messiah you become a messiah because you were born in sin you were born different than he was that's right he didn't need a new birth he was born right the first time so he didn't have to come to a journey and realize he was lost you know I I pray for me because I'm doing the ministers meeting next time on uh what happened to the Soul at the new birth so it's going to be a touchy situation but you know I thought all these people are saying well I always was eternal and I just realized it and you know I remember when I got down on my head and you know when God came to me and saved my soul I didn't realize I was always Eternal I realized I was lost yeah because a relation realization of me being lost put me on the journey towards realizing that yeah I was always Eternal with God see right brother Brown preached two ways he preached God's mind to you and then he preached to the people that needed it right everybody understand that because remember in God's eyes Luis your angle is already eternal never sinned a day in his life because remember one Speck of sin in front of God he has to destroy it every person has to boys brother Anthony can't see you he hears your voice through the blood right he hears The Sinner and the saint that's right amen but he knows you're a child because he birthed you at the new birth you're a child of God but you always were a son like his brother around said you always were a son in my mind of God you always were a son God if he looks at you any other different way but if he made you a son that's why I was preaching the other day a chosen in him not chosen by him the Bible says chosen in him so whatever he was in Christ whatever Christ was if I've accepted that that's what I am but if I was chosen by him that'd make him a respective person right right I've chosen by him then Adolf Hitler could walk up to the white throne and said you chose that man before the world and he had no other choice and you told me I don't you're saying that I didn't have a choice so you're you can't be a just judge God right amen let's just get real with this he can walk up and say oh well there's a mom black standing up there on him on the podium with you you know they want to throw them why is he up there God says well I chose him and I ain't Choose You ain't right right he'll say this man I offered it and he chose it therefore being omnipotent and being all-knowing and being infinite he could give you an angel at Birth he knows when you're going to get born again so I settled with God but it's not with you you have come down through permissive will that Genesis 1 never dropped down into permissive will right yeah Genesis 1 26 never came down into permissive will until you received it at the New Birth when you call out to God it was God calling you really that's right you heard from your theophany you heard from this that God already saw by foreknowledge he saw this before the world and you would want it more than Adolf Hitler and he'd give Adolf Hitler a million years he Adolf Hitler would never change his mind God knows that so we have to put it into the mind of God that when brother Brown sees you always was eternal you never sinned on any day now listen he's lying if he's talking about this guy that was out in the world that's right I'm gonna preach this morning come on you know he's lying if he said that but he's not looking at that person yeah right right he's looking at that part of me that and I had a brother tell me the other day he said well well if your soul came to you at the new birth and that's that's a pre-existence of souls I said there's only one pre-existence of assault yeah and that's Jesus Christ right my soul didn't come to me at the new birth that's right God's Soul came to me at the new birth that's right hmm your soul came when you were born when you were born born in sin Champion iniquity God give you a soul perfect able to communicate with this world but it had a nature on it that was a damage that was Fallen that was you understand how we preaching here yeah but you heard from that theophany that Genesis one man that Genesis one man never failed Adam fell but Genesis one man that was in him never failed right the flesh man Adam is what sold us out brother Brown said then every soul after that I got close brother I said Every Soul after that has been blackened blackened by sin because see then everybody got a choice all the way through and Adolf Hitler can't say well you chose him and didn't choose me no God's gonna say Adolf I came down on December the 4th 1937 and you turned me down I would have give you what this man's got if you would have accepted it just same way with Abel and Cain there they stand Abel and Cain stand here today yeah right right able and Kane are standing here today able accepted the sacrifice Cain couldn't accepted it and turned it down to me that's just the example because remember Genesis starts everything right exactly okay and there was a seed preparing with you before the foundation of the world and when you were young when you were little there was no seat in here right right it was the word right here is what he knows you're going to accept you're going to accept the c word of God the brother told me he said well what's that deep colony of the day it's my free Mall agency I'm able to do that there's got to be a deeper never respond you know your brother Brown said that sure right sure but it's my choice it's what's calling I chose to call out I chose to accept Gotta Have Fish Gotta Have water first right so God's here God's here he's the water he's already got it ready for you but the fish has got to be put in the water to live same way with us so who are we man how about something 329. right in here oh let me get back to my point Jesus went to the River Jordan and was baptized and there was a Dove came down and said this is my beloved Son and who am I pleased to dwell right then about three years later three years later he goes upon a mountain and God says this is my beloved Son and whom I'm pleased to dwell here ye him put his stamp of approval on that man that that's me you got to hear from that man right there all right same way with Billy Brown he goes through all that you know down at the river in 1933 he says your message will forerun right four run the returning of Jesus Christ he didn't say you would right that's right how many times have you ever brother I've never said the angel said you would forerun he said your message or forerun the coming of Jesus Christ so it's the message not the messenger that's Forerunner that's why the people who believe he's going to come back that's why because they think we would call them the second time right but he never said that go back and put in all your quotes you want to put he never said you were before he said your message or a dumb message is the forerun the coming of Christ which is exactly the truth so there brother around was and the angel come down and said your message before one second coming across then you go skip you know 30 years later 30 years later 1963 or 62 he goes up on the mountain God brings the cloud brings the angels He says go back to Jeffersonville in other words this one is going to begin your message because remember 47 to 63 is not what Malachi 4 is supposed to do in its entirety right nobody understand that but if you do away from if you do away from 47 to 63 everybody see what I'm pointing out you do away with 47 to 63 that's a building right process if you say well no we just get the third pull or we just get what brother Brown you know we just we're we're the third four people uh to me I don't like people preaching stuff like that but anyway that's just me right here's the third pull yeah right here is the coming back of Christ when Christ came down to reveal those Thunders to reveal the seals that's what he came in in in tight you see what I'm saying this is this is it he's become the Divine love you at the new birth but the Apex are the uh The Headstone remember it was rejected now I don't know if I'm gonna get cut today but we'll get to it next week this right from and I say again from here to here the apostles had that yeah so brother Brown didn't bring us a new message but from 47 to 63 he was bringing the hearts of the fathers I mean the children to the fathers that's right right faith of the Father the children babbling Pentecostal babies from children to the fathers now this is the faith of the father this is Paul this is all the ones before uh back in the first church age calling those people Peter that's what was lost down through the church agents was this part right here this position so God when he started with brother random what's the first name preached 1947 look on your table you start freaking faith right then his last sermon was communion all right so that's what he preached from Faith to communion but right here is his message that's the message of Malachi 4. yeah that William Branham according to Revelations 10 7 because you can't take this Malachi 4. mankind four is restore that but remember the brother said he'd do two things in the church a book One turn of Hearts of the children back to the fathers and they literally literally remember I preached a sermon on literal literal is not a type it's the thing if you're literally who you are then that's who you are you're not a type of anything and that's this that's the headstone the aspirins when the seals broke the brother around them The Headstone came down sealed him off as an adopted son of God and God said if you're going to hear anything from him because remember this had already been preached this has already been preached down Through the Ages Paul preached this right Peter preached this now John Wesley didn't preach all this I'm sure he preached some of it but he didn't come to that he wasn't required to come to it you got it it was eaten down in this church age here and brother Claude made a good statement I read a few months ago well paragraph 330 what's been done it's manifested through seven Church ages and seven Church age Messengers he parallels the church ages with the statue of perfect man right so then we understand so far what I'm talking about if you don't raise hand I'm saying again don't worry about it I don't want to lose anybody but this was preached by Paul Peter James John probably even Iranians and some by Martin but then he got eroded here in this age and it was either way go back to the bride tree or go back to Joel right it was either way and this was all lost so brother Reynolds came back to preach us to hear I will restore this is a restoration okay he will restore right all those things that were lost but this had never been preached only by one person Jesus Christ Jesus Christ was The Headstone right he's a headstone Jesus Christ was The Headstone still is the Head Start all right but remember all through the Bible and all the pyramids this was left off why man couldn't understand it they got him in partial down here man when we were talking about putting them put a little line right there that's that's the Cornerstone the pyramid is the little pyramids and it grew into a great Mountain but this right here is what caps everything off this right here brother around says three paragraph 329 right in here right in here you see I've got in between all these Works in here now the original copy I've seen it one time but I ain't seen it since he's got Holy Spirit right here and there's waves coming down through here remember in Sister Shepard's dream she saw water flowing out right that always beer coming down through Christ saying Holy Spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding this together now see once you've reached this right here he's welding you together okay he's welding you together down here he's putting you together that was good I just got that got it sometimes I can come up face the Lord but now see he's putting you together here see but you put the studs up for the house and not put One Nail on it and go and then I'll go but once you put them you put your nailing it together he says right here he says welding it together so there must be a piece there to weld you can't weld air and a nail can come out and they all can come out wish that happens down here brother Brown said though if you stink that nail which means you drive that nail down and it's sticking out about that far yeah it'll hold for a little while but something can pull it out or something can knock it over but if you drive that thing down for them pneumatic guns that we got it will drive them nailed outside well there's no way you can get a hold of that and pull it back out so the pneumatic nail of God's word nailing us together welding us so there's got to be a two pieces to weld you can't weld one piece all you're doing is put a little solder on the end of something welding it together is that that's what he's doing with us he's welding us together building a what a perfect church for the Capstone to cap it off we need we have to go let me start we'll start this there next Sunday he says when will it when will it when has it been what's it been doing and if y'all can't bring your book or or bring your uh tablet or whatever he says starting back here where was the church first founded what was the Pentecostal Church first founded by Saint Paul and Ephesus to start the Ephesus Church Aid then he goes through and then we'll talk about the rest of them
