God Amen we can gather ourselves together and uh in in different places but without God it would just be in vain and I I want to read maybe a a strange couple of strange little scriptures um that have just you know as I sit out in the audience and I've been listening to a positive attitude and and faith is the substance and uh the shout the voice and the Trump you something something just begins to spin and and and I don't know how you the Machinery begins to work and and uh there's something that's moving because when you hear the word there's a deep that calls to the deep and it something to respond there's got to be something and I believe that uh what what I'm going to speak on is is kind of what began to wor as I listened to the last few months of of of the message and so let's just let me stop talking and read Acts chapter 9 verse one and Saul yet breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord went unto the high priest and desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues that if he found any of this way whether they were men or women he might bring them bound under under Jerusalem and he didn't know God was about to change his Direction exactly right but you know what God saw something in this man that whatever Direction he was going he was going to go full speed that's the direct he was going full speed and when God called him and turned him around he went a different direction but he kept going full speed and as he journeyed he came near Damascus and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven and he fell to the Earth and heard a voice saying unto him Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and he said who art th Lord and the Lord said I am Jesus whom thou persecutest it is hard for thee to kick against the Pricks and he trembling and astonished said Lord what wil thou have me to do and the Lord said unto him arise and go into the City and it shall be told thee what thou must do and the men which journeyed with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man right now let's turn over to acts 22 and we'll read from verse 6 down to verse 9 and it came to pass that as I made my journey and was come nigh unto Damascus about noon suddenly there Shone from Heaven a great light round about me and I fell unto the ground and heard a voice saying unto me Saul Saul why persecutest thou me and I answered who art thou Lord and he said unto me I am Jesus of Nazareth whom thou persecutest and they that were with me saw indeed the light and were afraid but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me now this is a strange strange little scriptures and I what I uh before we read the last verse and then you can be seated just give me one second I I apologize for keeping you standing so long but I I what I want to ask I want to ask a little question and that is can you hear the voice of God and not hear the voice of God now that's a strange little question that's right now let's turn over to John chter 8 verse 39 I'm sorry verse 47 I'm going to read verse 39 later on after your seated he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because you are not of God and you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the word so the question is really I want to speak tonight on the voice of God and the question is can you hear the voice of God and not hear the voice of God and you know as Jesus walked the shores of Galilee everybody thought that they had a handle on him all the Pharisees they thought that they they had a handle on all of the the ins and outs of the Old Testament scripture they had every uh they understood uh so they thought how everything should be placed how everything all the different ins and outs and uh of the scripture of of uh uh how everything was supposed to be put together but then Jesus came on the scene and uh somebody that they they grew up with maybe from Nazareth you know they is this the man you know they the man that we went to school with the man that we went to synagogue we we were little when we were little somebody that they were familiar with and and uh isn't it strange how God uses call instead of HE using the Sun or the moon or the Stars to preach the gospel he uses he pulls but from from from the things that you're familiar with he chooses one of your brethren somebody that you're familiar with and and it it it's always becomes a stumbling block to people when they when they looked at Jesus this this person is not somebody that is nice to look upon or uh he you know it's somebody that we would want to parade in our church and and get new members with so it it just baffled their mind that's right and they thought that they understood the scripture and then the the he was the voice of God to them because he was God in flesh God in flesh walked the shores of Galilee and and prove that he was God because the things that he said the things that he did came to pass by his uh by the word of his mouth he showed that he was the same God that the scriptures talked about but yes yet they could not they did not hear the words that he spake they couldn't believe that this man had the word for their day they couldn't believe that this man was the one that would lead them to Salvation and that's always how all all down through the the scripture all down through our lives the devil will send voices of confusion to confuse and distract away from the voice of God to to to take us away from the real true voice of the age the real true thing that will take us to freedom to deliverance and you know brother brandom talked about how that uh I was listening this afternoon to as I worked to the the voice of God in this last age one of the ones that he in that he preached I think it was 1961 the one that I was listening to and he talks about how that God how the the devil will will send distractions of of of different like a a political voice that you want to uh get away from you know even in my work I can see how politics people will try to see how many people they can get under them and see how many people they can uh collect to them and and uh move and there's all these politics and things trying to weave and distract from the real issue at hand this is just even in in the work world that you have a problem but they instead of trying to solve the problem they want to to to collect different people and make their organization larger and that's the same way it works in the in in the religious realm is the devil will try to get people to uh you know a big church a lot of times even I catch myself asking at Fellowship meetings well how many do you have going to your church but that's not the main thing you know the strongest Church in the Bible had what 12 people thank you just 12 little people and one of the strongest church if you can get just if you can get one man to believe brother brandom said then he can you he all it took to defeat all the Philistines a thousand Philistines was one man that went and found old rotten Jawbone of a donkey and picked it up and slew a thousand Philistines because he believed God's word he believed who God said he was and what God would do with his faith right and that's what the devil tries to send distractions to distract us and one of the one of the greatest distractions today is Hollywood how he'll try to he'll come into your home with it get in the home with the television and get in the home with movies and things and preach a message that's contrary to the word brother Brown talked about how that the little kids know you know there's nothing wrong with just putting on a cowboy hat but they know more about the Cowboys and or today is more about the comic book characters more about and Superman and those those different kind of things and then they know about Jesus Christ and you know I I I mentioned in Sunday school if you go back to Genesis Chapter 18 it it talks about the Lord said he told Abraham I I I reveal these things to you I've called you because I knew that you would teach your children and it's so important for us to teach our children to carry on to keep to keep that spiritual multiplication going because you know they're a captive audience you got the Bible says train up a child in the way that it should go and when it's old if you point that eror it's important to train it up when you when you pull the air back not when you let it go I mean it's by by the time you let it go it's too late you got to point it in the right direction when you when you pull that ER back and then when you let it go it's going to continue on in the right direction while they're a captive audience you can sit them down and have a little devotional every night and teach them to teach them the ways of the Lord just like Abraham taught Isaac and Isaac taught Jacob and and and so on Down the Line because you know I I mentioned before God has a trickle down economy it works that way it trickles down all the way all the way from Heaven down down down and now so Hollywood is a is a voice to distract us to distract us from the voice of God and what about the church voice you know numbers prospering empty promises yeah you know in the church world today there's so many empty promises of prosperity and things that we've got this this word faith movement that that pre teaches that if you'll say it without there being anything there that's my interpretation of it you how can you speak it if there's nothing there amen but you got to have something there first you have you have uh women that aren't even uh living according to the Bible with their bobbed off hair and they uh the dress that's not conforming to God's word and they're saying if you'll speak a big fancy house or speak your problems away then you can walk into it but I I believe that first you if you've got the voice of God speaking to you inside of your heart that speaks out his word to you then let you then you can you have something to say you can speak it but first you've got to get it to speak it first you got to receive the shout let that the the voice of the Archangel live in you and speak inside of you that that which is Christ live inside of you and speak out his word and and that is is what I'm what I'm getting at how can you hear the voice of God how is it possible and you know in this in this day it should be more apparent than ever that it is possible for someone to sit and hear the voice of God be preached and spoken and not hear the voice of God what a strange thing right you know if you talk about hearing the voice of God then you're automatically branded in the same category than some of the people that I see on the train now I I've SE I've seen uh I I I like I've told this story before one time I heard this Street Preacher on the train that was preaching about vegetables and things he was not preaching about the word of God he was preaching like a sermon uh you know because they're they're not in their right mind he was preaching about eating broccoli and different things it wasn't even about religion at all and they when you when you say that go God speaks to you that you hear the voice of God it puts you in the category of a lunatic it puts you in the category of somebody that try going to work sometime and say God told me to do something and they'll automatically lump you into a crazy crazy category but the it isn't that amazing that the gospel is brought through the foolishness of the Gospel through the through the foolishness of preaching it it seems crazy to the Natural mind the natural eye but to to someone that wants to hear from God it's more precious than gold it's more precious than than Jewels we should be so fortunate because think think of all the scriptural types and things about how few there would be Elijah thinking is there is there even even a few that still believe God's word and God pulled them aside and said yes there're still you know I still Reserve 7,000 that still believe that still are standing by and you know it seems like it's getting fewer and fewer but I I want to hold to God's unchanging hand and keep right on because you know God's given us something that if if you hear the voice of God which is so rare today if you hear it there's nothing in the world can take it away there's nothing in the world can take that from you now it's always rejected when they heard Jesus who was God himself veiled in flesh Veil behind his Badger skins they they rejected it so what about what about a little old us you know that will come and and and try to try to preach a little bit of the of the Gospel one of one of the things I think is so amazing is is Psalm 82 4-6 I'm jumping around here a little bit I know y'all just bear with me but that's the scripture that talks about how that Jesus quoted you you know you have a problem when I say I'm the Son of God but the scripture says that ye are gods to the ones that the word came to are gods and that's in Psalm 82 4-6 and it's so amazing how it starts off in verse four deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked the poor or needy are the ones that need to hear the voice of God they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness all the foundations of the Earth are out of course I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high and you know when God sends a voice he sends a sign to to declare he sends a pillar of fire to declare that The Voice is coming he sends us he does something to declare that that something's coming he to catch the eye of the people he sends a sign and and that shows that something is taking place a sign in the heavens a cloud a sign over the Tabernacle a sign uh a sign in your personal life a sign to show that God is moving on the scene and you know he showed all of these sign I I just wrote down a lot of the signs that were in brother brandom's life the messenger of this age to show that God was about to speak in April 6th 1909 when brother Brown was born his little 15-year-old mother had a baby 15 years old and the pillar of fire came in in the window and identified you know it scared people and something strange is happening when he was just 6 months old something touched the heart of his neighbor to come and say the little the little baby and his mother from freezing in the cold when he was 7 years old he heard the voice from the popper tree Never Smoke Drink or defile your body in any way when he was 3 years old he had his first Vision that he would live near New Albany when he was nine his vision he had that vision of the bridge where six men died and you know that's some that's one of those things that's contentious today how many died how many you know we think men can think that we've got our you can't reason out the word now look over in uh where where I was just reading from those two stories of Acts it looks like different things are taking place and how would you understand that we know that all scripture was given by inspiration by the by the by the pen of a ready writer the by inspiration of the Holy Ghost and everything is just perfectly in line it's all true and you can't there's so many scriptures that you can't reason out with your own with your own you can't if you can't study enough you can't uh try have figured out enough but the only way that you'll really know what without a shadow of a doubt what is written in God's word is if God comes and the voice of God speaks within your heart and reveals it to you and and I one of my favorite quotes is what brother Wade says about how if Paul said you'll be judged by my gospel and if you believe if you have the same voice of God inside of you that's speaking out that same gospel that Paul preached and it is the same gospel and it do tell just perfectly then you'll be God that you'll be judged by my gospel if it's the same thing if it lines up that's what that brother Bram when when he went beyond the curtain of of time he all the saints there said we're resting on your gospel being the same as his gospel it's the same thing and uh we're resting on it because it's not the voice of a man but it's the voice of God and you'll never understand the voice of this message the voice of the prophet of the uh the what's in the books and the tapes without God himself coming and revealing it to you and speaking it from your heart right and you know when God comes and speaks it to your heart then you could you have something that you can rest on you have something that uh will bring what's written in God's word to pass and when he was a teenager that astrologer said young man did you know there was a sign falling you and one day as he nailed in a Woodshed to pray a light came in and formed the cross and something swept over him as he said something swept over me that I had never felt before and you know then keeping moving on down the the pillar of fire on the uh when he was I think 22 years old baptized in the 17th person at the end of spr Spring Street the pillar of fire came down and identified with that Messenger as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ you'll have a message that'll forerun the second coming of Christ and then that Pillar of Fire came and appeared in 1950 in the Sam Houston Coliseum and I was uh just messaging back and forth with some Believers and I think that was the Philippines and they you know they were talking about how they had never uh had a privilege to come to the America before and they heard so many people say that that photograph was faked and this these different kind of things and you know all the different things about how that there's not really a a a hall of religious art in the Library of Congress like brother Brenham said things like that but I told him well I was there because when I was 10 years old my parents took me there and we walked into the Hall of religious art and I it might not have exactly that name but that's where they put all the religious art and it was there and the lady at the front desk had it at the desk because it was so often resp requested and they would come in and people would walk off with it because they wanted that Pillar of Fire and they had to keep ordering another copy of it and you know the the word of God is true it's a true testimony a true Vindication it it is true and not just because of these testimonies but uh well let me I'm trying not to get thee of myself actually that's where I'm leading up to you know then God sent sent sign different two signs in brother R's life the sign in the hand and the sign in the the to discern the spiritual gifts to attract the attention of the people but you know how we really know that the message is true it's the same way the same way that all the prophets were identified all down through scripture is by the voice that they had the voice that that rang out that trumpeted out that bore record that all the it identified them with the Scriptures it showed that they lined up exactly perfectly with the scriptures and it showed that the word that they spoke was true when they said uh uh when when when the when the prophet made a made a statement made a declaration that this is thus sayith the Lord and then it came to pass then that showed that there was something at work an undeniable evidence and that is uh I'm leading up to something here I'm moving a little bit slow y'all hang on you know all through scripture you had to compare the voice with the word to see whether it was true or not you had to take it in the Old Testament they had the urum and thumm which was you know that's no who would even know what the urum thumm was unless a prophet came Scholars and and what more they they probe and and poke at that issue what what is the urum thumb was it this or was it that and then a prophet came on the scene and told us that it was the breastplate and when that when the spirit Came Upon that breastplate to identify what the speaker had said what their testimony was it would flash or not flash or or show an identified that what they said was true and now today's urum thumb the urum thumb today that we have today is God's word that we can go and open it up and and and see what how it reflects back our life and identify as whether our lives are correct or not it shows what's wrong with our lives you know know you can take the you got to take the message and the Bible and line it up together and it just exposes every one of one of my favorite things is to get on the on the train in the morning that's my little meditation time and I open up the Bible or the message and it begins to reveal things whoops I have was wrong there I had a little something it's a little problem right there and it begins to it begins to meddle in my life it begins to uh Roo around and and find little things that needs bit straightening out and that's how God will straighten us out by his word he'll chip away and chip away until we begin to be reflected in His image so that he can you know that's what we're all going for we're all progressing for until he can look down on the earth and see himself reflected back and then he'll come down and catch his catch his waiting bride away because he sees us living and walking and talking in the word not denying one word not not like Eve did that just took one word off but a a bride that's staying absolutely spotless believing every jot every tit oh God help us to be like that well we'll stay perfectly perfectly in line with God's word and I I wrote a little quote down here I don't think I gave this to them in the pergan church age now I want you to be very careful here and see this God has promised that at the end time Malachi 4 is going to be fulfilled right it has to be for it is the spirit quickened word of God spoken by the prophet Malachi Jesus referred to it it is just before Christ comes the second time by the time Jesus comes all scripture must be fulfilled and here we are fulfilling the scripture that's what I believe we're fulfilling the scripture that was spoken by the prophet of Malachi 4 you got to have it couldn't have been just Jes uh let me let me State this right when when the uh the woman with the issue came to be healed there's got to be there's got to be two in the in the uh there had to be one to give and one to receive it's got to be like a deep a deep that calls to the Deep there's got to be a a a a radio radio tower and a receiver a tower and an antenna that picks up the signal and it it's you know that's what's happening tonight is the the voice of God where whether you're sitting and listening at a table or with to the tape or sitting in church listening to somebody preach there's a there's a back and forth a deep calling to the Deep there's a voice that what just gets me so much is when you could when you're sitting in church and go God begins to uh put together scriptures that you never even thought went together and begins to speak to your heart and show you things bring things to your remembrance and show you things to come and show you things come on y'all excuse me I'm going to get carried away here he begins to put things together that you didn't even know went together because there's a voice that's speaking to you a voice behind the pull pit a voice in the tape a voice that's calling out to you a voice that's calling and there's a deep that's responding a deep that's that's answering back a deep that within your heart Thank You Lord hallelujah let me calm down a second that's so I can continue and God gave a pillar of fire as a sign that his voice was about to speak and the urum Thum Vindicator that it was the truth in the voice of God in this last days brother Brown talked about how that there was a woman that that said she called up and said I am a uh I a prophetess and and she said uh I heard that you have Vindicated my Ministry and he said I I don't even I don't even know what you're talking about how can I do that when you're you're not you living according to the Bible you're not you're women are not supposed to uh preach and and all these other things and and uh she said well you I'll tell you what the Lord told me to go to the uh I think it was Phoenix Arizona and dig up the lost Dutchman gold mine and he said right there on the tape we all know and I don't believe we all did but he said we all know that the lost Dutchman gold mine is just a a legend and that ought have stopped everybody right then from going to look for the lost Dutchman gold mine but he said now if you want to see if God told you that then go there on that certain certain date and start digging and if you come up with the lost Dutchman gold mine then you know that God told you that now that's how you know that God told you something if go if you continue on and and and what you believe that God has revealed to you doesn't come to pass you I think about so many people who have said well God told me to marry such and such a person and you know when they're standing on your doorstep and and you say God's told me to marry this person and they're not living right they're not doing right they're not conforming to God's word and something's off there let's continue on and maybe down the road they'll come to the Lord and start living right and doing right but you got to compare it with God's word you got to compare with a urum thumb to see to make sure that you're going in the right direction because without God's word without the voice of God to guide us to direct our lives where would we be we'd be like lost ships on the on the sea we'd be uh going to and fro we wouldn't know which dire we wouldn't know what's where North was on the compass without the message of the hour we would be so lost without God's Prophet to show us where we would where to go to to to call us out of the denominational ideas to call us out out of our own ideas and our own thoughts and to show us that God's grace to us you know when Moses came and and he threw down the stick he knew what was going to happen because God told him it was going to happen and he just waited here comes Pharaoh out and he throws down uh he does his thing and and his little magicians and and Moses didn't get all worried because when the voice of God speaks to you there 's no fear perfect love casteth out fear what are you going to worry about you know I I used to when I was a kid I used to worry about something under the bed and something in the closet but then one day I got uh you know I I used to have a problem with the dark even until I get I got you know my teenagers and whatnot I you know it's spooky rooms at night whatever but then one day I got uh I heard from the voice of God and you know I never had a problem with that no more and I that's that's my personal experience perfect love casts out fear you're not you don't worry about what people say if you know what the truth is it doesn't matter what anybody else says it doesn't matter if anybody disagrees with you because you know where you're standing because you've got that that anchor that holds the voice of God it's not my voice these are not my words it's and that's why it's so something you can you can just anchor soul in because it's not something I came up with it's not something any man came up with but it's something that was written it from the beginning to the end it holds together it's so cohesive it ties together so perfectly when God opens it up to you that everything is beyond explanation how everything from Genesis to Revelation ties together and we know it's true that's how we know that the message is true that's where we know that what the prophet taught was true that's how we know that the scripture is true because you can you can come at it with your own ideas and end up in who knows where but when God comes and sheds the Gospel Light on it then it it it uh it's something that man there there's no right there's no way to explain how perfect how perfect it is now look at how Jonah and Jonah came forth with a sign that he was down in the belly of the well and then he came forth preaching a gospel message of Deliverance first he had the sign and when he came out all those people that had been worshiping a fish God de gone they saw that Jonah come out of the of the sea and walk right out of a fish and they said something's happening you know what they thought they thought that God was about to speak and that's exactly what happened because Jonah was the messenger he was the voice of God to them he was the voice of God to those people in Nineveh and they heard it and believed contrary to his expectations now that's something a messenger going down to preach to people who I don't even think I want to preach to them but yet they believed him yes sir and and Christ Jesus said I I'll give you a sign I'll give you a sign that just like the prophet how the prophet Jonah was down in the belly of the well I'll the son of man will be down in the belly of the Earth for three days and three nights and then he'll rise up and I'll give you a a what voice follow that sign the voice to show that it was the truth what he had said came to pass and then what he had said all all those three and a half years before begin to come to pass because the voice of God was living inside of people that living inside of the people that that stayed true to God's word and went up to the uh to Jerusalem carried and waited until God's word came to pass and his word his word came to pass in their lives and and lived in them let me let me stop here for a second and and let's look at that uh quote number one now this is the quote that that caught a lot of people off guard when he said it and it still catches a lot of people off guard yeah in my commission now I'm just your brother by the grace of God but when the angel of the Lord moves down it becomes then a voice of God to you if I offended you by saying that forgive me but I felt that might have been resented but I am God's voice to you see I say that again that time was under inspiration see and I I felt bad about the first time but it repeated it right you know whenever you make a declaration that God has done something for you it it tends to offend people God has done something for me he's delivered me he's helped me then it makes people nervous and I hope it doesn't make any anybody nervous because there is a bomb in Gilead there is something there there he said come unto me all ye who who are who labor and a heavy laden and I'll give you rest he'll give you a rest that uh if if you hadn't uh if you're still out in the world you don't can't even fathom what kind of rest it is how great the rest of God is not have to uh you know when when the pressures of Life come upon you and begin to Heap upon you you could we have somebody that we can take our troubles to take our our trials and and go before the Lord and say you know such and such thing is bothering me help me you know I I wonder you know how Robin Williams was in the news and how do people live without the Lord how they they cover up with a mask of of that's the American way and the American Spirit to just laugh through troubles and and laugh and make a big Jolly out of everything but um you don't have to hide behind a mask you know one day all things will be unveiled whatever we we are whatever we're hiding the things that are deep down inside it's all going to come out sooner or later so it's better to just unveil it now just let loose and let God let God come and probe your life and see what's inside there and start changing you that's and you know Abel one of my favorite stories in the Bible is this Abel's little Abel sacrificed how Abel came and you know where Abel Abel's trouble began when that voice that Revelation that he had began to speak because you know it says that in Genesis 4:8 that Abel talked with Cain or Cain talked with Abel uh they were talking one with another and you know what happened the Bible doesn't spell it out but Abel told his Revelation right he he he told Cain what the problem was and you know uh Abel's sacrifice was Vindicated by a sign and his sign was followed by a voice he it was followed by that message that little conversation and he gave his life for what his Revelation was and you know when Abel offer he he abble offer that sacrifice he he brought that sacrifice up and it looked like uh I I compare it maybe with with Jesus walking on the shore of Galilee what are you doing Abel is this the man that we're supposed to follow what are you doing is brother brandom the man this little man from out of nowhere is this the man that we're supposed to follow that don't even know his ABCs that doesn't come out what what Seminary did he come from is this is this the word of the Lord able when you're bringing your little sacrifice up dragging up this oh uh why are you starting cutting on this lamb and and he threw that lamb up and brother brandom explained it like this he doesn't want just he wants you as a sacrifice up on that altar he wants you to lay up there and say God whatever it takes to to clean me up to get me walking right and that's all of our problem I I was I I was read there's another story I love about Charles finny how Charles finy was actually preaching and there was these two little sisters that said we're praying they saw something that was laughing in Charles finny's life even though he was up behind the pull pit preaching the word of God but they saw something in his life that was lacking and they said we're praying that you're going to receive the Holy Ghost well Charles finny hadn't been exposed to him what was lacking in his life until one day he was at work and he went behind the work and he prayed every day now think about that now he prayed every day yeah but yet he hadn't heard the voice of God right he was preaching but yet he hadn't heard the voice of God and it went beyond Behind the the the his little uh uh work building and he and he knelt down and he heard a branch crack and that revealed what was lacking in his life amen because he he became embarrassed he realized it what he he quickly jumped up and he looked around and he realized that he was ashamed of the gospel and right then and there he had a conversion experience and he his conversion experience was so real that he had to he thought he said I'm I'm afraid that I'm going to bring reproach on the gospel so he he went and hid behind the door while he shouted and had a Glory Hallelujah time because something real had taken place and that that's what I want to say tonight is that if you've lived a holy life if you think you've got all the ins and outs discovered of the message if you've got everything figured out where you got uh because you know Paul said though you understand all Mysteries though you have all knowledge though you you have all these different things those are just like tinkling symbols cl cl cl cl you go to somebody and say well let me tell you how much I know when really you know the Bible says if you think you know something you don't really know anything at all because the more you know there's actually even in in the the the non-religious realm there's a a word for that it's called um uh impostor syndrome with the more you know like when you get a PhD you think well I you begin to realize how little you know and you begin to feel like you're an impostor that's almost the more you know the more you realize you don't know right and and uh I I I went around in a circle and I forgot where I where I was amen now so now Abel sacrifice he y'all just bear with me Abel's sacrifice it was Vindicated by God and we you know we w we talked about how God Vindicated Abel's sacrifice just the same way he Vindicated all the other little sacrifices down through the Old Testament by showing that it was the truth by coming down and consuming it by fire a a visible evidence that something had taken place but then how do you really know the Revelation is that it compares to the the message has to go out there's so many people that today that um that that you know lay hands on the sick and and they shall recover and and do different thing you know they they pray for the sick and they recover uh arms restore different things happening all these different thing you know uh uh TL Osborne had a he said he went before the Lord and prayed that God would give him the same kind of gift that was in brother bram's life and God did he he because he prayed and asked honestly he gave him a gift of healing in his ministry but yet he didn't have a message that followed that he didn't have there was no voice you and that's how you know that God is really on the scene is there's a voice that proclaims that trumpets out that compares back with the scripture and that's how you know that God has done something in your life and that's what I'm getting at you know brother Brandon preached that sermon doors and door and about how amen uh you we want to have a life lived by the word and the way to do that is for to let God's word probe around inside to give him free access that's one of the things that we we have such a problem doing is is opening up our heart to let God take a look inside and see where we're messed up at see what the problems are about a personal life what your personal life is he said uh he said you go into the door of the heart and right there on the right is that little door to the to your personal life about how you uh don't let nobody talk to me about my dress yeah or my hair and he started running down through all those things don't let God's word meddle with those things but you know that's what the voice of God does the voice of God and that message the voice of God to this age was calling out and if the voice of God and the people would recognize what the voice of God behind the pullit was saying then their life would change that's what brother Brandon was talking about when he said there's a deep calling to the Deep when you lay in bed at night and that deep from Beyond calls to the deep down inside of you there's a deep to respond the deep is the soul of man man and the soul of God you know the soul is not just some that that deep it's not just some wispy thing floating around and you know we've heard that for years it's taught here that it's not just some wispy thing but that deep is a person it's a person of Jesus Jesus Christ calling out to the person that's inside of you the soul that's calling out and there's a where there's a deep there's a deep to respond when when you feel that call then you you had better respond because one day it'll be too late right one day the ark's doors will be shut you know the Bible says that in the day in the in in this day in the day of the coming of the son of man it will be like it was in the in the day of Noah and you know in that day he went all around the world all uh as a type Gathering up little pieces of wood from here and there and he pitched him all together and today little people are being gathered up from all over the world and they're being gathered up together in the great God's great big building his his statue of a perfect man building the pyramid and they're being pitched together by the Holy Ghost into a great building that will not be sinkable it will Sail on and and and and sail forth based on God's word because that Ark was designed by God and this building is designed by God and the only way that you'll know how everything is fit together is by the voice of God in your life the woman at the well the woman with the issue of blood the Deep calling to the deep and in the Old Testament you there was so many things that they could not see they couldn't really get their mind they couldn't really understand about what why was circumcision so important what what was circumcision what was communion what was the the the Resurrection The Rapture who they were what they had what uh even when Jesus told Peter I give you the Keys of the Kingdom uh well you know if I put myself in Peter's place and the Lord told me that okay what next and and you just uh they they didn't know until the voice of God began to echo through their life through the new birth right that is when the voice of God begins to because the voice of God puts everything into place you know after the voice of God came into the heart of man he he began Paul began to put together and show why what circumcision really was that circumcision was a circumcision of the heart to take away all the the all the doubt all the unbelief and excise it from you so that there's it's a sign to the believer a seal that shows that something has been done because where once you doubted now you're standing upon God's word and believing it now you have an anchor something to hold where before uh you you wishy-washy you uh went back and forth you know one day you were uh on High Ground the next on on the you like an airplane Christian but when you get that when the voice of God came in on the day of Pentecost and began Peter quickly ran down because the voice of God speaking into him told him what the Keys of the Kingdom were and he said repent every one of you be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of your sin that voice of God and that the circumcision became was a sign it's a sign to the believer that something is taking place and what follows that sign of the circumcision I believe is a voice that's echoing out in the heart of the believer to show to to bring to you remembrance to show you things to come to show you where danger lies ahead to show you my wife was talking about um the I don't know if you heard that about that shooting that happened a few six months ago and uh in the little town that we live in this man rolled up on the courthouse and he jumped out and he began to shoot up the place and he ended up getting shot shot by all the policemen what my wife was out and about she was going to the to the post office and a still Small Voice said something's fixing to happen and she saw all the policemen come woring by and going down to the courthouse but there's something that speaks out within you that shows you things are going to happen something's something's not right something uh that that shows you shows you where you're wrong where you're messed up where where your children are wrong what you need to do to them that that it's a guide to you a guide to your life where would we be without that guide to show you to show you what you need to do where you need to go to church what you need to uh how you need to dress how you need to act how you how you conduct yourself and whether or not you compare with God's word because every sign has a voice Philippians 3 3 says for we are the circumcision which worship God in the spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh right Romans 4:11 says and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also and brother brandham said I just put a little quote of cutting off all doubts and unbelief to believe God's word is pure and holy and it's the truth circumcision cutting away all unbelief amen everything Cutting Loose every Shoreline saying God I believe you live or die sink or drown it's your word I believe it when you got that seal of the sign of circumcision and then that voice of God begins to speak out then you compare that voice that speaks out in your life with the urum thumb of God's word and see if it's right because that voice that spoke out the the voice of the messenger of our day we had to compare had to compare everything that he said back with the Yum thumm now that voice that speak out from your heart that's how you know it's if it's the voice of God or the voice of the devil is that you can pair it back and see if it's a voice of distraction or if it's a voice that takes you back to the things of God's word makes you continue to grow and progress and and grow more and more closer to God more these virtues are birthed into into you through the opening of God's word and that's how that's how you get the voice of God to sound is by eating eating eat more and more of God's word and he'll open it up to you eat it and he'll bring it to your knowledge and understanding eat and eat I it you know that was like a little Discovery for me one time is that the more you read the the more can be open to you the more you study but oh God is so good glory John 16:13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come right it he will guide you into all Truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen that's the voice of God in life the voice of God speaking to you how rare it is that brother Brown talked about it's so rare that you Elijah thought that there was there was nobody else that heard the voice of God what about today when it seems like people are after sitting in churches for years and years and years and hearing the voice of God being preached to them being spoken to them hearing the tapes singing the songs but they never heard the voice of God right right and there we don't get second chances to hear the voice of God you know you never know when your time might come we were talking the other day about how brother brandham said that uh brother Bram talked about how when one of his family members were about to pass then the Lord would show him and it's just striking how many in office you know went quickly you know people people leave the Earth all the time there's no Second Chances now is the day of Deliverance right now is the time to choose because God said that he would write his laws on the table of our hearts you take them from the pages of his word and write them on law on the table of our hearts and I I feel like I'm kind of winding down a little bit so let me just before we close I want to just finish up I guess we'll finish a little early tonight and we'll read a few a few more quotes just to kind of nail it together because you know my message has to compare with the prophet's message that's right which Compares with Paul's message all the way down through and if anything that I say does not compare then there's a problem right and so let's read let's look at number three let's look at number three the voice of God in this last days I hear somebody that was raised on theology that his mama had Moses mama had set him on her knee and told told him all about who he was and explained to him the theology explain to him about the message and he had heard it his whole life and we when he got older he thought well I understand enough to take matters into my own hands but then God had other ideas and he went off into the Wilderness until he was 80 years old now let's see what brother Brown has to say about the voice of God in this last days paragraph 86 Moses heard the voice of God he was full of theology he knowed all the ins and outs but it failed he heard the voice of God Moses was never the same and no man is never the same you might hear in your ears the voice speaking but when you hear in your heart the voice speaking see then you're hearing and just the way he said this on the tape he slowed down and said it real slow so the people could get it the message that I was listening anyway you do not see with your eye you look with your eye you see with your heart you see something say I just don't see it you mean you don't understand it you do not hear with your ears you hear with your heart many times your ears hears the true voice of God and it falls off of you like water off of a duck's back but when you really hear you hear with your heart right and all this is this is the kicker the point all the theology that Moses had he hadn't heard the voice of God you can sit in a message Church all of your life you can have the Seven Seals written down in little notes and all ordered up you can have Daniel 70 weeks all scribbled and just ordered up in a little binder and everything you can have all the theology straightened out in a little notebook all organized with little alphabetical things along the side all arranged just so that you can show to all your friends and flip through and pull out notes to impress about how much you know but without the voice of God without the new birth right it's just tinkling symbols it's just tinkling sounding brass and tinkling symbols what good does it do to impress somebody CU they don't impress the devil the devil knows whether you've got the voice of God inside of you or not and he said that script there scriptures that says that they shall cast out devils in my name and all these other things you've got to have the voice of God in your life you that that doesn't come by just theology but by a real experience where you know who you know amen but one day God called this 80-year-old sheep herter over to one side and spoke to him and he called it he proved that he was God first thing he done to Moses was vindicate his word I'm going down I remember what I promised that's right and that's the first thing he does when he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost say vindicate his word by making the things that were written about the New Birth come to life in you making it be manifested in you every promise every scripture in the Bible is mine because he gave it to me it's it's written that same voice that wrote the Bible is now echoing in our lives if you've got the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth number four Abraham's Covenant confirm confirmed what's the matter with me anyhow I'm only telling you the truth someday you'll catch it someday you'll know that I've told you the truth amen my voice may be silent you might might be able to silence the body that's speaking but you'll never silence that voice it comes from God they ston Stephen but they couldn't stop his message it'll move on you know I never really understood what it we were let me let me let me back up a second we were my wife and I spent a a a night with this little widow woman uh a while back and she was talking about how her husband had deceased and how that he had such a great testimony while he was living and now that he's gone she still is telling his testimony and it it his testimony his Revelation continues to live on and you know when she says that something struck me and I remembered out it says that Abel's blood spoke from the ground right because he had a revelation and when he died he gave his life for it even though he was dead that Revelation continued to speak amen and his Revelation was that blood blood was involved that something had to die something had to pay the price and think about how long that Revelation continued to speak for 4,000 years it continued to cry out until the blood of Jesus spoke better things and what does it speak it speaks a new life when Jesus died and went into the ground that blood the life that was in that blood now speaking through his bride speaking in US it speaks better things a circumcised life circumcised from the things of the world that now you can believe and have faith in God because he's living inside of us showing us things to come and uh that's right showing us things that cannot even be expressed by words that let's um let's see let's look at number five Lakeport California and scroll on down to the highlighted part brother when you want sit still enough and listen till you can hear that still small voice of Christ is different from any message you ever heard in your life and you can listen to the that's what I'm going to keep saying it you can listen to the books the the tapes read the Bible but until when you get that voice of God that speaks back that Echoes back what's written on the books and the tapes what's what you're hearing then it becomes a different message it becomes a different book right it becomes something that you couldn't even have fathomed before the voice of God began to speak in your life it's different from any message you ever heard in your life it brings a peace it brings a satisfaction it does something to you that stirs your innermost being you're never the same right man cannot meet God and talk with God and ever remain the same again I if I if there was a way that I could last night I was praying and I God if there was a way to take from me something and give it to you that you could see then I would be willing to do that if there was a way to convince the young people that there was something more real than the comic books and the Thors and the Superman there's a Superman that gave his life for you that's more real than anything than you'll get out of a comic book if you'll give your life to God he'll makes he'll make something of your life more than you could have ever imagined he'll take you out of the dunk he and make you a vessel of Honor instead of a vessel Of Dishonor if you'll listen to the voice of God he'll show you that you're a vessel Of Dishonor and bring to your just just show you I can't even express it Lord help me right let's go to number six the voice of the son actually I'm sorry I'm I'm going to just skip over that one he's talking about what the new birth is let's go to number seven every true sign is followed by the voice of God and and this is what I was talking about the the Deep calling to the Deep when you listen in church when you sit in church there's a transmitter and their receiver when you listen to the tapes there's a transmitter and a receiver and he was the transmitter that said he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me has eternal life see verily I say unto you that that he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me ha eternal life now that word has went out from a transmitter he said one day verily I say unto you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that what you have said will come to pass you can have what you said that's right and he said that same thing in the in the voice in that in that sermon I was listening to the voice in this last agage he because you know know it's so hard for us to wrap our mind around it the promises of God are true if you really believe it if God has revealed it to you then you can have what you will because your motives and objectives are lined up right with God's word and and that's what you know it sounds it sounds strange when you tell somebody that if you have faith to be healed it's yours that the Lord said I I am the Lord that Health all thy diseases if you can believe all of the promises of God are yours for the the taking if we can just believe and that's our problem is something's blocking our faith now if paragraph 116 now if you can just be the station to pick that up by some control inside of you by faith it'll move you right into the cycle of God to the new birth and be born again then you'll always be in contact to hear that voice that will always warn you when danger is alone now think about that you'll always be in contact right to hear that voice that will always warn you when danger is long when things are wrong going wrong it'll always be a warning to you and then instead of someday being like that rich young boy that we're speaking of be a man like Apostle Peter Paul or somebody that one souls for Jesus Christen number eight and I'm going to finish in just a minute here y'all bear with me Jesus might have said now in order to get back to the original God has to speak again that's what he does when he gives you the new birth amen your old life is gone and you're back to the original word of the Lord right if you're not you're hybrid into Church's denominations but when God speaks his peace and the Holy Spirit then your back in the original family of God again you don't have to be baby then you're a rugged Christian who can stand it go to the Cross go to the fire furnace to the Lion's Den or wherever it might be because the word of the Living God burning in your heart and soul and all can backslide all can turn against you and everything else but that won't stop one thing that rugged word of God stays right there when he spoke that original voice into your heart you are mine that's right let's look at one more the voice of the sign number nine I I'm sorry let's skip let's go to number 10 I'm trying to save a little time hear his voice let's go down to paragraph 80 now there's a Code of Ethics to it God has a new birth for you but listen to his still Small Voice every one of you people who profess to be Christians get yourself quiet before him now that's the ones that have been listening to the theology but have not yet heard from the voice of God those that profess to be Christian I am a Christian but I haven't if if you say I am a Christian but I have not yet yet heard the voice of God and you know maybe there's some that don't realize they haven't heard from the voice of God right which is why he's saying get yourself quiet before him like Charles finny who thought you know he was a preacher he prayed every day he understood the Theology of the Bible but yet there wasn't there was something lacking in his life you know a lot of times like those two little sisters just it's easy ident to identify someone that has not yet heard you know that the conversation is just different there's something lacking in the uh there's something lacking as far as Faith there's you know well here's what he says every one of you people who profess to be Christians get yourself quiet before him don't let the washing hand hinder all those voices that distract from the real voice of God don't let the work hinder don't let nothing hinder don't let nobody know what you're doing just go before him get up in the woods somewhere get out on the side of the road go into the secret closet and close the door when the kids gets at school they get down on your knees you've heard all kinds of voices everywhere but just get down and stop stay there until those voices are silenced and you begin to lift up it'll change you it'll make you different like it did this little Samuel it'll do something to you if you'll just do it now it'll make you what you should be it'll make you the kind of Christian that you ought to be and I'll kind of stop there you know you've got to hear the voice of God won't sound forever I we were talking at work I've got some people on my team that work in San Francisco and we were talking about that big earthquake that just happened and uh you know all these things are signs Jesus talked about how that you can you can look at outside the color of the sky at night and see that that you know when the when the when it's red at night you know what they say sailor's light red in the morning sailor take warning you can look outside and just tell by the signs of nature that something's happening and you can look and see that Google's now got their little egg-shaped car this they' passed laws in California and around the world that these little egg shaped cars can drive by themselves and they're beginning to test them out and you know that's what that that believe the sign website says that there are no egg-shaped cars well I've got news for you all you got to do is go to google.com and type in egg-shaped car and you'll get back a long list of egg-shaped cars many of which can drive themselves and now there's earthquakes that are shaking all around the world and signs are happening but the real way that you know something is happening is because God's word is being fulfilled God's word is being brought to pass and the evidence is The Voice the voice of God in this last days the voice of God that's echoing in my heart now I wonder if we'll stand and and maybe just think about as I asked you when we started think about when you first heard that voice and if you never heard the voice if you just have been to church and you've heard the theology then there's a remedy for that that brother brandom his own words just the voice of our messenger called out and told us the remedy for that that is to get along with God get along with God like Charles finny realizing there's something wrong in your life something wrong that there's an answer for there's a bomb in Gilead like Jeremiah said is there no bomb in Gilead is there no Sav for the problem for the Affliction there is a bomb amen so let's just stand our feet and I'm going to pray a prayer over you and then turn the service back over to brother Dale cuz we believe that God's word is true amen and amen everything that's written in God's word at the end of that sermon brother brandham said um everything that's been spoken will come to pass right all the things that are in God's word have to come to pass right and I want to be one of the ones that believes it that it can be made manifest let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God you see every hungering heart Lord Jesus every needful Heart Lord Lord God and I pray God that even through my stammering lips and and stuttering and uh staggering around and not knowing how to say Lord that something was said to help Lord God and not to hinder Lord Jesus but I pray oh God that as my voice went out Lord God is is the words that I said the words that I spoke Lord that they'll drop down and Lord God that you'll bring it bring it to life Lord Jesus bring to life your words Lord Jesus and I pray oh God that the voice of God and the believer's hearts Lord Jesus would just Echo back and cause your word to be made manifest in them Lord Jesus that's all of our desire that's my desire Lord Jesus to see your word made manifest in my life Lord that you'll take away all the doubt and all the fear that you'll circumcise every bit of unbelief from our lives Lord Jesus make us Lord as the As It Seems like people are dropping off Lord help us to be more steadfast and more true and more true to you Lord God more seeking more than ever to stay perfectly in line with your word Lord Jesus and Lord God I I remember when at the end of that sermon brother brandom said all the people that are living lives that are as much as they know how living for you let them lift up their hands and ask God for healing in their bodies Lord Jesus now Lord God I ask Lord Jesus that all the ones where that voice of God is echoing back lord Jesus that you'll come down and touch us Lord Jesus touch our Affliction touch our bodies Lord Jesus and give deliverance and fulfill your word to us Lord Jesus and the ones Lord God that are poor and needy like that Psalm and song in Psalms that says ye are gods that the word come to Lord Jesus preach it to the poor and needy Lord God the ones that haven't heard that voice of God yet Lord I pray that you'll call out to them and prick them in their hearts like you pricked Paul God gr it Lord that you'll call them to know that you're calling you're calling still and that you're you're still able to respond you're still able to hear Lord grant it Lord God while there's still a chance Lord Jesus that all those that will come will come Lord Jesus and we believe and we thank you Lord God for the opening of your word and for all the things that you've done for us Lord granted Lord that you'll touch our afflictions Lord touch the little sister Lord Jesus is going through chemotherapy tomorrow Lord granted I pray that you'll continue to be with this church and bless the pastor bless the other ministers Lord Jesus we ask believing Lord
