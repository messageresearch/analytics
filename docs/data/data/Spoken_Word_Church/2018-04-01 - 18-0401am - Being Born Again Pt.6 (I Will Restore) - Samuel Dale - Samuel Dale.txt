with us as we Lord speak about you and to minister your word that you would come on the scene and speak to the hearts of the people Lord you've already spoke to our heart as to what to say but yet still we need to wait to say and to speak what you have given us to bring to the people we pray that you'd bless and just bless each one that's not here today there's many sicknesses and things among the people and there's many out on that many out for the kids going to youth camp and the things Lord and we pray that you'd be with each one and give them a safe journey back home that everything be for your honor and glory we really appreciate more than Easter time because we firmly believe in a resurrection and Lord we thank you that resurrection is in our heart and it's not just a physical part it did happen there but that didn't do all the holds thing if you had not to come back onto that Pentecost then the resurrection would have been useless yet you came back to live in the hearts of the people we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen we've been reading in Peter so we'll go with our to the first Peter 1:18 for as much as you know you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who was fairly very very overly was ordained before the foundation of the world but was manifest to us in these last times for you in other words it's this day manifest in this last day who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory and your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren so that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not a corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever now we're going to jaw will go to jaw to but I want to read Joel 1 for I didn't give this to him now but I want to read it to word it'll be on and then you'll see Lane says Joel - Joel one-in-four says that which the pommel worm has left at the locusts a eaten and that which the locusts have hath left half the cankerworm eaten and that which the cankerworm hath left half the caterpillar eaten all right now we go to verse 23 of the second chapter Nevadan rejoice ye children of Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God for yet giving you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat and the fats and I thought I can give them this I just left a part off our floor shall be full of wheat and the facts shall overflow with wine and oil and I will restore to you the years that the locust now remember the locusts what one left the other one ate well there's some left that one ate until he was 8 down to the stomach now but remember it was not destroyed it was 8 to the stump all right then he said I will restore to you the years that the locusts have eaten the cankerworm and the caterpillar and the palma were my great army which I sent among you you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now don't get confused are where it says in my great army that I sent among you and that looks like that he literally done this and sent this and that no he permitted it to take place he didn't send it of his own that's not his army that came Wurmple Wurm locals caterpillar that's not the army of God it was what he permitted to come into being to be able to talk about the restoration we'll get to that later on in the message if we have time all right but now I'm trying to get to a position and what I'm doing is cutting out about four sermons that I'm going to try to get in this one today and then we'll start some more later but I want to instead of tying tying your thinking up into a lot of messages I want to try to put it all into one and just kind of run through a little bit to begin with and then you know we'll see how it fits and how things goes together all right because we've got up to the day of Pentecost we've got up to the point of the new birth in studying the new birth and we've got there to find out that the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the being born again is the one in the same it is your experience that you travel through and then you come out to a place to were that we are beginning to get a foundation to speak about the stature of a perfect man all right let's see now you've got to go through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost brings you to the new birth all right now once you receive the new birth then you receive the new birth that that we read and talk about it and we'll go back over it again in second Peter worded it talks about to them of like precious faith all right now that person is Peter was addressing it to them that were born again God is not addressed to the world all right and he says those of like precious faith I would that you still would listen to or read the statute of a perfect man to get a better understanding and listen very carefully to his whole we did last night listen very carefully to the plan that he's talking about trying to get us to see out or what God wants for you and I in this day all right and how he wants us to make manifest that which we see okay all right because now what we're going to dealing with here today is I will restore our restoration we talked about revelation brings restoration alright now we know that mankind you know the the the baptism with Holy Ghost came onto their Pentecost okay that was a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to us or to them or whenever we receive it it's to us which is the new birth all right then you're developing into each one now I've always tried to make it a point to you to try to keep you ahead a little now I believe the new birth is is and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the born-again experience is one of the same all right see then your new birth is brought to you in stages the being born again is brought to you in stages alright and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is being brought to you in stage you see that's that's what you need to listen to the Prophet that what he's wanting us to attain unto is to something that was already dire because you cannot deal with restoration on something that's not been previously brought all right now so then listen to what I'm saying for a minute and then we'll back up on it in another message or to see the seals is not restoration because the seals were never here now sirrah they were written in Matthew 24 we'd never preached by mankind never brought into being it was waiting till the last days all right see then that's not restoration because they were not here the revelation of the faith of the fathers is restoration that's why there's so much everything you listened to brother Branham when he gets into it and he keeps hammering back to the faith of the fathers because that's what you're dealing with restoration all right now you're not dealing with the new birth as restoration the new birth is not restoration the new birth is of Earth remember the point restoration means whatever it is has previously been there and you can talk about eternal life bend iron in coming down to you glory we got that but just get the point of what I'm trying to bring me the church started on the day of Pentecost with the new birth that was not restoration me it wasn't restoration you'd say well they felt we fell from all right that's all back in the mind of God and everything but we're on earth we're not dealing back before the foundation of the world stay down here on earth with us and let's talk about it don't be so heavenly minded until you can't be with any earthly sense or vice versa you know keep it all in the right order to understand alright that's what I'm saying now so when we talk about it and I mentioned faith of the fathers and I keep laying on faith of the father's I want you to realize what I'm talking about alright the faith of the father's is the restoration because that was what was in the early church that's why there's probably five messages there that I should bring to try to show what was there and what it is we'll pick that up as we go into our day all right so you talk about what's back dars wonderful and great all right but we want restoration were in our day all right now so that's what I'm saying I'm trying to cut short some messages to get you to think about it but to think about what it is that we're talking about restoration as to be dealing with what was here before lost went away and then has to be restored now what's that in a minute Reformation is not restoration why would why would brother random where long as the wanders the world called Lutheran Wesley now they take with Luther and Wesley brother and take Luther Wesley and he'd even bring it to Pentecost why don't they call reform when was that called reform to the new birth at Luther received was not restoration cuz the new birth was never ate eating away come on it's the word that was eaten away the word is what failed the word is what went down not to baptism with the Holy Ghost you've got to remember one thing I don't care what you think about Luther Wesley Pentecost you can listen to these great guys explain all of these philosophies but remember it's the Holy Ghost in every age now listen now you tell me it's not then I'm going to say one thing to you you said well oh the Holy Ghost wouldn't the new birth wouldn't then that age is lost I'm pausing intentionally for you to think about that if it wasn't the Holy Ghost in each age and you lay me down one age you said well Luther Age wouldn't hold ago like the nine Age is lost they would have to go to the white throne to get anything do you see where you're at you see what people yeah but it sounds so good oh but I've got this quote here was it that Luther was in yeah and I had a brother one time and he was real bad to say say what the Prophet said I said okay you say this and I'll say the rest of what you're saying he saw it I said I gave him a quote where brother Owen said Luther died and went to hell or something like that there's a quote to though the wordings of it you know and I said now you say that Luke the denominator England you say that he wouldn't say it because he knew he's trapping his own self if he said Luther do nominee Luthor never denominated the Lutheran Church Wesley never denominated the Wesleyan Church right they denominated after them see so you can take quotes and make anything as I was saying the other day that you want to try to make out a would take it and line it up before and after and it'll all line up see then you got a teach than the new birth in three stages now not just in some case the baptismal over that reason that's coming to the new mark the new birth is in three stages the born-again experience is in three stages the statute of perfect man is in three stages the Holy Ghost is in three stages if you don't if you don't follow it like that yeah but what is that we'll just go to prove on the future home and just read the message of the future home or listen to it and you hear him explaining what I'm talking about because II you can't explain it without it but now listen see then revelation is what is to bring restoration right now as I said Luther's age they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost for that age Wesley's age had it for that age they had the new birth for that age they had the morning experience for that age but yet they will be called Reformation now there's a reason for that that's very wonderful to open to our eyes to see what God is trying through the Prophet to get us to understand we can follow right through the messaging and be in good shape all right now revelation will bring us to a place that we can talk about restoration all right now listen to the point that's trying to get across the life's message what is the new birth the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you right so then the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ that will bring you the new birth that ever born-again believer down through ever age had that new birth all right see but they they could move up and down a little they could be you know gang ground there was people that had understanding of things and all but yet the statue of a perfect man was not completely restored back through there it has to wait until this life stage all right now there's where the restoration we'll get to it in a minute all right but think about it now I made an outstanding statement for you to keep in line because now watch the point of what I was bringing revelation puts us in stage for Reformation I mean for restoration now we're going to read one in a minute we're brother Branham was talking about Luther any talking about him and being a reformer he said but that reform was the foundation he said that was the foundation all right so keep it might not listen to what we're trying to say trying to bring you to a point of thinking about something you say rest restoration woo it's all things to be restored shields and now listen no it was never here I didn't write the book the Prophet said the headstone did not come I got it in here I'll get to it in a minute the headstone he said to never come yet huh sees in the headstones not restoration he said well I don't understand how in the world you can think about the seals in the fire this goes all the way to the little message called seeds not air with a shot and goes all the way into the point that we're brother branham will say Mary was a carrier of the seed but not the seed okay so we're not lost we're going a long ways but I'm cutting out messages to try to help to get up there instead of trying to you know and maybe I shouldn't do it maybe I should fly straight on and do but I try to help you I try to plant well surely now by now people understand that the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ I mean what else you gonna call it surely you're to that stage to think about it that it's not speaking in tongues out in Christ those are the after-effects the new birth is a revelation of Jesus Christ to you revealing God to you in the age you're living in and this is the age of the complete revelation of Jesus Christ right see if we have time we'll get to it work to think about it you take your life I mean you take your thoughts and you see the things of what has been restored because come on the one God was eaten away the water baptism the serpent seed the thing all of that was eaten away it's got to be restored well see think about where you've traveled to surely by now you understand serpent seed surely by now you understand what God surely about now we understand predestination we heart - what are we so blinded until we can't follow the point I'm trying to bring it to a point to show you what we need is this in this bracket we'll call it right here of the stature of a perfect man and why it had to be taught not doing away with watch before and after no way brother branham I've told you over and over go back to her go back to the to the inner veil where he's talking about a living moving instrumentality of Christianity and go to the statue of a perfect man and see if there's not a statement almost identical to the wording that he brought in 1956 and he was looking at it he said on that day that he preached the statue of a perfect man he said I just got these things up in the woods or the faith works or knowledge temperance patient he said oh what I was trying to bring a message on his whole message was coming down from the 40s 50s the coming to try to get us to the Statue of a perfect man or get back to the faith of the fathers do you remember what we we read there one day where Bertrand said if you don't know what the Holy Ghost is he said how do you know whether you got it or not then he turns around and says the Holy Ghost is so missed out by mankind incorrectly Akali sin less famous names what were you doing that day I know all about the baptism yeah yeah that's that's the way things goes but listen now to try to back up just a little bit and cover what we're talking about now we're not going to be talking about the headstone because it never come yet that's what's your profits it is to come in the last day the seals was to come in the last days and not in the early ministry so that's not restoration that's the seed are you with me come on now if you'll go back to the seeds not air with a joker masterpiece you'll hear what I said while ago that Mary was a Carrie the word yeah I need to preach that message Mary carrier the word yeah because the word was in Mary right she gave birth to the word but she was not the word the word is Christ himself right all right so she was a carrier of Christ she gave birth to cry but she was not she was the word of that age yet she was the word to represent the same thing of Azusa Street to represent the book of Acts right she had her place study what I'm asking you to study you come to me like that well what I need well then when I do it do you do you go back and do it do you get the message and listen all right all the way back into the message now for just a second of what we've been trying to bring a very important thing happened on the day of Pentecost then come about back are now the day of Pentecost what took place was a wonderful thing because it explains and I know you get tired of me quoting over and over something but it explains things if we'll listen you just say the day of Pentecost I told you talking with some brothers about it and they said we just don't see how we got the Holy Ghost like they did on that pinnacle I said well I didn't say it brother Branham did it well I don't see how he could say well I said you gonna talk to him about it because I'm just saying he said it but you see I tried to explain what I'm going to explain that I've explained to you a hundred times and I tried to explain it no I said well you explain it you know you explain it one of you says you ain't got nothing the other says you got everytime I said I'm gonna stay in the middle but I don't believe I got everything but I know I got something yeah we've listed in life not worth a lady you know suitable or I was really just warning them said I'm not what he want to be not what I ought to be not what he used to be though at least I come from somewhere all right all right now think about it on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fail it fell on first 120 in the upper room right now that Holy Ghost gave them a new birth place them into the body of Christ positionally placed them because of the word they had heard are you with me now we're going to read in a minute code on one will read it from brother Branham - were right around this one it says he said those disciples had those virtues they had these qualifications all right but now he didn't save the 3,000 outside see that's what I was trying to explain to those brothers why can't you see where brother Branham said I met people with the Holy Ghost exactly like the day of Pentecost nah I wouldn't want you to look at me and say brother Dale are you are you that guy to wear this I know I may not be there but at least give me the Holy Ghost let me be born again you know give me something to see that that group in the upper room they had been tutored and trained by the Lord Jesus for three and a half year then when the Holy Ghost fell look what it did if brother Branham was right and we read it and then he said he said they had these virtues okay that's in the same message it's in the statute of perfect Lent the hitch don't let him come in just keep listening you'll find it isn't that so they had these virtues why because they had heard the word for three and a half years and it persistently placed them to a place when the Holy Ghost fell they could be the teachers of the Word of God that's why Peter could would say you know add to your faith virtue or not esteem for faith one because he had experienced that Paul could cover it of adoption because he had experienced those positions in his life both of them saying then the same thing because they God doesn't use a novice to write his word he uses someone who is trained in the word an elder or whatever you want to call it to bring his word see because you don't this gladness get a guy off the barstool and bring him in on Sunday morning or Saturday night and Sunday mornings preaching no oh we're so fiery then you say you ain't gonna preach brother Dale he's doing the best he can do don't you think he's got a right to preach no Cody don't know what he's talking about yeah he can get up and say my candle got lit last night on the barstool but what else can he say he can't prove he ain't gonna drink no more you can't prove you ain't gonna be a drunkard or anything like that cuz he had no time you get what I'm saying be sensible about your thinking if your health revolution go to me revelation is the most simple thing that there is it is the simplicity of it that God can reveal something to you in simplicity but we cross it all up well don't you think don't you think he's been around long enough no let him sit down listen you guys wait what I told him when wait--come told me he was this is called operations that's good run run run run son until you run yourself down is that what brother branham said you need that I can find it for you he said I told him I said run until God runs you down because the Prophet said if you volunteer for something he said you're not worth it but he said when God has to break beat you down and bring you to a place then he can use you because you're not a novice with the best way thing that I could tell him of anything to do maybe not in this words to tell him but he knew it study the word study the word and be prepared get prepared then he come to me and they say daddy how come so what's on so-and-so I said because that's what you study the word when you was 12 years old it's coming back to you now do you understand what I'm getting at that group in the upper room it gave them the virtues when the Holy Ghost came because they had been tutored in the word and it placed them positionally and I used it deliberately to where it says Holy Spirit under there because that's the Holy Spirit that seals all of this and then the love is the headstone but it hasn't come yet we'll read that in a minute from the profit all right I've told you what I believe the hitch telling is I always told it I believe the headstone is the open of those seven sealed so the headstone didn't have to be restored because the seal didn't have to be restored they were never preached by nobody the Lord Jesus preached them in in what Matthew 6:24 excuse me but nobody knew what he was talking about so don't deal with restoration this to stay with what we're at and then you'll be able to understand reform so you'll be able to understand why Luther Wesley's called reform or Reformation if you'll get the Holy Ghost right and get it correct to what was eaten away when I say go to the restoration to the bride tree and look at it listen to what he says it eat it away but listen what he says we'll return now listen so that group that were with him and tutored for all of those years the Holy Ghost gave them Burke and placed them that's why I encourage you to study the Word of God whether you have the Holy Ghost or not whether you have the Holy Ghost or not study the word get prepared but if at least put to you know put it in the field at least get to exceed in the ground then the Holy Ghost can quicken it I've told you reading six books a day and listen to two tapes and General Motors riding bikers and forth and all that during the time when I said I did not have the baptism when all together but yet I knew that that word is if I could get it planted then when the Holy Ghost did come it could quicken greater than just oh I'm born again oh I'm in the messy I believe the profit all right so you see what I'm talking about the Holy Ghost positionally placed those early apostles and I use it that away because somebody out there they're all smart addicts listening to you well I think he was only the twelve was with the only one see that's that old Church of Christ you know we got 11 or 12 we got this or that or the other I thought you got that in man's mind is he gonna have it anyway I don't say all that I've told you before I don't say the whole 120 s in the Upper Room went up to the faith of the fathers because if they didn't how the word planted in the field they only went as far as they could go some of those people could have been anywhere up and down through here whatsoever as God quickens a word to but the Apostles went right here where it says Holy Spirit then they would be used to teach the word to teach others how to come to where they were what's the purpose of a teachers are our preachings are our instructors or what is to try to come to one of the position one today you know go brother Tom for boys he told me one day he said you don't learn too well I feel and I'd like to he said then you just meet me over there he set me down and he said this is what you do know there's old stick welder so a lot of you know that hard to do it's hard to get that thing to our talents you can't just go down there you got to get it to arc and that takes a long time now there's nigs and Tigs and Miggs and all of these other things you didn't turn it on with that old stick welders hard to do so he said sit down right tire and he kept on practice and he said you're doing pretty good because he taught me some tricks you can't get it to arc you just turn it higher it's gonna hark it might not be what you want but it's gonna arc so he kept turning me up until they got into arc then he kept turning me back and where I could an arc it all right and then he said wailed I said what he said from that end to this the end of that piece of metal bit rep me a bead hey pretty good what now he said one right side of it what net one right side of that one the point why he was teaching me how to weld see what a lot of people think oh yeah I got that lets go well something I wound up with a stick welder - well fenders on a Volkswagen now you know how thick the metal is on the Volks owner on any car I could weld it probably could right now if I played a little could wail that fender together a Volkswagen why because he taught me how to weld me not pretty but I can do it see that's what those apostles were they were tutored of the Lord he trained him he tutored him he told him remember they were together 24 hours a day seven days of the week I mean there's no vacations in all of this if it was he said come aside and let's rest he was with him all right are you with me then when the Holy Ghost fell on those that had been tutored it positionally placed them and then God could use them to write the word he could use them to write the word because they were capable that's in the statue of a perfect man if you've read it we see in the 3000 outside heard one sermon they don't matter to me though they got the Holy Ghost the Prophet said if you don't know what it is how do you know whether you got it or not now unquote is that what he said you want me to find that one for you you read it enough but listen see then what happened to the group outside hours later they heard one sermon and were quick in their heart what a wonderful sermon everyone these days I'll get around to preaching what I want to but it's hard to do you go back you you go in that book of Acts in acts 1 and you read that situation and you listen to that sermon that Peter brought all the way from the fathers and the wilderness all the way to bring it down to this man it was Jesus Christ oh what a message what a time no wonder they were pricked in their heart and they said me and brother what might we do to be safe said repent everyone every be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost they got born again they got the new birth they got the faith at the bottom of the pyramid if you've been over the the message of the statute of a perfect man you've heard him say that that is how faith and be born again how faith in people we again read the Word of God they don't need to read the Word of God to get saved boy you're really a good child why don't you want to know about your Savior let me put it this away you got that attitude you ain't gonna never get saved that's as plain as I can make it you want to argue with me you got that attitude of nonchalant and not caring you never will be saved in a way why don't you going back to the world and forget it brother to hell at all well why not what good is it he'd heap a turn around and get you killed I'm talking about spiritually but listen search see then when it did when the Holy Ghost came on that 3000 they received the baptism of the Holy Ghost but were not positionally placed with the Apostles they were only placed at what they could receive the new birth and then Peter is writing to them in 2nd Peter to try to tell them how to come to where he was Paul comes in with the adoption 'el parts of the Romans and the Galatians and the thing to try to side along with Peter to help the people to realize what they needed go back and learn reading the statute for a man we're brother branham's constantly talking about the divine nature of God the divine nature God's divine nature there's God's divine nature is the whole revealed Word of God ok let's get started then okay go ahead ever who brother Anderson pull up number one listen let's read a little bit let's see what those disciples had and remember what they had is what they're teaching that we've got to hire there's no such thing as saying well maybe I'll get that I don't know if I get time I'll try it's in the statue of a perfect man you got to have these virtues so look paragraph 14 I can imagine them apostles never acted like us they went around probably being a few words now that fits us all pretty good place Tony right we've got a bunch of blabbermouth they had a man a few words I said us that puts me in there with it and the rest of you okay any problem they went around problem in a few words till they got in the pulpit they walked in and they done what they were supposed to do and walked out now remember these are not to novices these are the Apostles they walked in they done what they were supposed to do and walked out yes sir they had power they had virtue they had no arguments with men they knowed where they stood that's all they knowed who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit doing only just as I said the other night one little nod that's all God had to do nothing's there nothing going to stop them a little nod in other words a little leadership God speaking to him too they didn't question and study will order that's you see we make those jokes we think we're so wonderful you know we talk about the guy hanging up and the Lord says turn loose and trust me and we say let me get a second opinion we think I'll let it so wonderful one of these days we're gonna find out you blaspheme and the Holy Ghost making jokes about God okay we think it's beautiful I didn't get a note I got knocked down we'll get up and tell me what the Lord told you no problem I trust what's within me come on tell me about that's why I'm on the Internet it's open to the world faint right come and show me number one I could be helped number two if I'm right then I ain't worried about it I'm not concerned about it one little nod that's all God had to do then nothing gonna stop them they didn't question and study in whom Hall and worry like we do whether they should do this or not remember brother Branham preach the message called why cry speak okay you know all the soul story they went ahead and done it anyhow just one little nod from God that done it just as soon why how could they know it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all these qualifications okay somebody had it know the first little nod of God compared with every bit of this and with this word they knowed it was the Word of God and the way they went didn't have to worry about nothing else when God spoke they went we speak I was thinking the other night about when the brother was preaching one of them they were gonna get in a statue of perfect man and we're gonna find out even if you have these virtues and things are still a human being you remember when Paul come along they were scared to death of him they wouldn't any of them wanted to saddle with him right until God spoke to one of them the rest of was still scared to death had the virtues come on that's where we want to do this see you you got any temper no bless God and I got born again I got rid of my temper well why is your face red now according to the Prophet according to the Bible you can be born again and still have problems with a little temperament now not that uncontrollable cussing temper now that's supposed to be gone before the bird gets tired that's supposed to go with sanctification we'll get to that we talking about John we're talking about normal things of life come on you've got almost patience but I don't have and the only time it I've ever said anything God spoke to me that's what he spoke to me about he said if you'll have patience with the people that approve you've got patience well I haven't had patience with the people so I ain't going arguing about when I get patience I'll tell you I got it oh yeah it works sometimes but it don't work all the time okay even though you're born again but we folks get rid of them come on but listen church is better brendham said how could they know that it was a nod from God he said they had these virtues they had these qualifications all right I brought it to make sure that you wouldn't argue the point it is in the statue of a perfect man at the life of the message he speaks of the headstone that is to come go back and listen or read it let's see Holy Spirit coming down they had the virtues we'll get to it eventually faith is not a virtue so you don't have to worry it is a gift it is God okay but now listen boy to number two quitsies questions and answers 1964 they remember statue program 62 and what does he say about it and just a little like pyrimidine it would we find in that pyramid they never did get the headstone on it why the headstones yet to come okay like I said you go to the statue of perfect man you get right over to the live part of it then you're even talking about the headstone Christ coming God coming down through Christ Holy Spirit welding all these things together to make a pyramids or something to be captain that's that's pretty close what the headstones yet to come look what he said the seven steps in the pyramid so he's talked about the pyramid sixty-four the headstone hadn't come yet he said all right that should settle that enough for no problems I don't care what brother so and so says the headstone is here that's his business I believe it is here by now but when he was to saying that it was from tyre he's the one who said it not me and you listen what about these wonderful virtues go ahead and number three let's pick up a thought while we're on this what about these wonderful virtues now brother branham in the statute of perfect man is also blaspheme is nine he's one of the two for sure he said a lot of people have a portion of these virtues and not even born again you've met people that are really nice and good and honest people and sincere and wonderful friends and time he said they have these were a lot of these virtues you know the the old condo priests had a lot of the virtues he wasn't a mean old devil it was a condo priest that was where the deception comes in well he could have had a lot of them virtuous there doesn't mean a thing brother Branham talks about that Moses had patience well Moses never had born again Holy Ghost feel patience for the stature of a perfect man because it wasn't back there he had patient you can have a lot of these virtues and still not even be a Christian he said but now look what he brings it - on the way back 1962 if you try to act like you've got them before you have listened it's like I said the other day like a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings then you see you see I'm a peacock he is a that's something he's stuck in himself it has to grow from the inside out that's what I like these virtues has to grow from the inside out why because faith puts him on the inside faith puts him on the inside the born-again experience puts him on the inside of you and listen it has to grow from the inside out and that's the way the Holy Ghost is it's not something you some your own or something like that it's a new birth you've got to be born again and these virtues of the Holy Ghost has to come from the inside out so if you didn't get the new birth how can you expect the virtues to come I'd like to give you these because I think brother Brennan was at a pretty good place cuz now listen he said it took him 33 years and he's talking about patience on the statute of perfect man he said 33 years now what about preaching for all those years now I didn't write the book you know didn't say what'd he say it he's once said it he said I just got this the other day where this tied into a message ain't saying he had never read that Scripture and preached on that Tereza no it was where he got it to connect in and tie together on what he was preaching though I believe brother Branham had those virtues okay let's get that point better Brown had those virtues and they was on the inside of it because you don't want to believe that he had the virtues you could say this because they said well I got one thing to put it on they had to be somebody if you and I are ever gonna get these virtues there had to be somebody to come and teach us the truth so that solves the whole problem you're gonna argue about this part of that for they had to be somebody and what did he come for I thought that we believed Malachi for the worthy what he'll do turn arts of the children to the father's fathers his children back interval I thought that's what he come for I thought he says in the statute of perfect man he said Lord fill me up with this virtue knowledge to enforce patiently to wear that I can teach others did you listen to that in the message did you read that in the book when brother John wanted to bar my my statue of a perfect man book and what I handed it to him he looked that thing over because it's got a lot of writing in it and probably be by now he's way if he's read three pages he's found a lot of quotes from other books besides this diet because anything that but I I think thought about that I thought when he goes on and turned that burger that ain't stature a perfect man that's blasphemous names player Seung Jo that's where it goes back to okay go ahead let's go up number four see I believe he had to come this Peter now listen you'll see the point of what I'm driving at the reason they had to three five years compared to the few hours message and one message they had three and a half years of the Lord Jesus teaching them these things right let's see here comes a Paul never the other day was trying to explain here comes the Apostle Paul he said he got the Holy Ghost right his eyes are opened he goes but where did it go he said I just conferred with them just a little bit then I left one time he says I conferred with no one but you know what I'm talking about he runs he went down through sure he seems to know them said hi how you do it I'm glad you're a Christian I'm a Christian too he went on but then he went to his self to get the word because he was a prophet you'll see why it's called Reformation Luther couldn't do it he was not a prophet Wesley was not a prophet Zeus's tree not a prophet come on that's why it was wait until the last days of the Prophet to be sent to where we could get back to the faith of the fathers the faith of the fathers is the stature of a perfect man if you put them together by now you'll see that it's the adoption on Paul goes to itself and comes out preaching the same thing Peter is Peters preaching statute further then get born again and then growth development to come out to work that God can trust you Paul comes over in college and adoption he says you're born into a family by the birth he said then you take a tutor and the tutor tutor trains you until you come to the place to your name just as good as on a checkbook that's teaching the same thing the Paul didn't have to have Peter to tell him he was a prophet brother Branham didn't have nobody to be able to tell him because nobody didn't have it maybe versions of it or different things yes but they didn't that went out to teach to him so he goes to the backside of the desert and he gets the message and when he comes out he preaches the stature of a perfect man he preaches the faith of the father he preaches Malachi 4 he's talking to one brother and one brother said do you believe your melikhaya for he said yeah he said why don't you get on telling it he said because you can't do that he told it enough like it went but he couldn't just walk out there hey I'm Matt I'm Malachi forward well but he proved what he had that's what I like I like it this way brother Branham would say I am a Malachi or he wouldn't say I'm the prophet of this what he said now when this man comes you ever listened to it this way he said when this man comes of Malachi 4 he'll do this and this and this and this he'll have the discernment he'll have the women he'll beat Nizhny he'll have his back turned to the congregation calling out people he'll have all kind of thing and then he's turning around right there doing it right in front right he was declaring who he was by the signs and the wonders he was telling you what the man would do and then he turns around and does it then he turns back that's what people don't like he said you come on you want to show me come on right should come show me where I'm wrong oh they knew better than that let's see he had these virtues he could receive the virtues or qualifications because he was a prophet to be taught the word but they had to come by the word right so listen what he says on the Statue of a perfect man he's talking about an incident happened where somebody would had really I guess they died because of what he said and dead who said Billy you come a little late I said never too late he's here I've had a battle and you're the other boys some more voyage centers was standing there are some of his relatives I said you see boys make ready cause you'll come to this place they said what I like about run around is one thing you call him to pray for somebody laying on the floor dead and he turns around and talks to the boys right you know what screaming hollering let me get that let me get that because he knows what to do it he said right here I said never too late he's here he turns around and talking to the boys and says boys get ready because you're gonna come to this you got to come right down here say maybe not with this this cancer you might come with something else out there on the highway bleeding to death or something you've got to come to it we talked to them I was waiting to see what the spirit said do waiting first thing you know now he done said he's here know what to say first thing you know I felt that little nod lay your hands on him I walked around said all you bow your heads they all bowed her head - it's really young fellas I doubt the end of it it tailed it he was raised up next morning he was setting up talking to him I wish he would tell you this messenger malachi forward this luke 1730 man he's gonna do this this did he turn around and do it you know I don't understand why people I don't maybe forgive me for saying dumb and stupid but he ever thought about when brother branham's up there preaching and he says what's man's number six and he said that's said we've never had a man that his name ended in a a.m. until this day and said we've got a man now Billy Graham said that's GRA six letters but said now that that's not right said we need seven letters and we've got this man to the world that has the six letters to match that of Abraham you know I don't count myself to be smart but I'd probably look at the track that they give out and who is this guy William Marion Branham seven letters see snow and it ends at 8:00 a.m. so you know this guy must be the one that he's talking about the stage with Abraham because Abraham representing instance other part makes am said now here's this staying here like sister Barbara gets hurt a Lakota it really comes out to ATM because that's where you get the part of God's name and come on most of you know all of you should know the story letter randoms nine last name was not Brando it was bray hem his daddy changed it and made it brown him added the end that right he added one letter to it to make it come out eight Rock right he put the letter to it now listen he's talking about this little nod he's talking about that God gave him just a little nod he's talking about the coming to the Statue of a perfect man yeah it's coming to the Statue of a perfect man cuz you see now we'll back up on this cuz it won't stop right here on this point we'll back up on it alright so you with me what I'm talking about that the three thousand only heard one sermon but they got the new birth the Upper Room experience of the Apostles brought them to be the teachers of the others of how to get were they were act to bring the virtues the disciples had the virtuous like I told you Paul he went to his self he come out of our teaching the same doctrine that Peter talked I may not mean nothing to you but I've always wondered why would he say it like that because I'm honest I'm praying come on I know I'm dumb and stupid but I don't put it to the basis that Peter said cat Paul says cat they said the same thing when we get to say the same thing now we'll all be right so now everybody come on when you enter cat no one have you said it yet oh okay thank you hey he's with me now the rest of y'all get women we got it made we got a revelation we all said the same thing what does it mean Peter and Paul Brenner Brennan said they did not have any problem in doctrine he said they had a problem with Peter in the way that he behaved himself you know what there's not another record anywhere that Peter ever said one word about that except one time he did finalize it one day when he said it he said Paul says things that are hard to be understood that many wrassle wept for their own destruction he well remembered that going on but you know God didn't see they had the same doctrine uh-huh Paul priest one God Peter preached one god Paul brought serpent seed so you know Peter them could bring serpent seed it's just according to what they were needed you find the Apostle Paul after a while if you really keep reading you your your Bible you'll find that Paul is kind of up graded just to higher above and he's really coming to the place that Peter now this is personal way I look at it and read it Peter finally wound up listening to Paul yet Peter opened the door Peter done all the things what Paul wrote it down to explain it right but they talked the same time they talked because they had what they were teaching brother Brown said he wouldn't preach on hell until it was revealed right there's a lot of things it is marked I marked my old I wouldn't give a brother John my oh I found him at Daniel seventy weeks because my old book is worse or mark talking the others because there's a lot in that old book that you'd see if you want to read it it'll say question mark I don't know what he's talking about page three question mark poor five six ten twenty question but then when I'd read it and I'd see what he told me then I mark over that but I don't never write with a pencil or you can erase I put mine in plain bold you know ink and I I'll write that and then underline it well then I mark over that and say okay you know what I mean I understand what you talking about now I'm not going over and I still a question I don't understand what he's talking about but when it comes and I would not preach that message and brother mode I told him about he said he told the church he announced it he said brother Dale's gonna preach on the statue of on Daniel seventy weeks and I wouldn't preach it until I questioned him to his point I said you know that I might say things that are contrary to you on this message I'm not saying I did I just said I had it on his straight talk with him he said preach it he said then we'll handle the rest of it later because he was the pastor but I would not preach it until every one of those question marks was gone I've made this statement and ministers look at you like you're you know and I am I don't know what you want to call me and I ain't worried about but I spend more time trying to tear down my sermon than I do in trying to get it that's an odd statement in it I get a thought I get something from God to speak I'm part of this that I've got in here it's been two weeks waiting for him to give me an okay to move up another step I wrote it over yesterday and you all receive my notes I wrote over to one spot stock got up went in the room with nany and we talked and everything was going on and all at once in there where she was at walking through the house here he come just another thought to put with that to make it clear all right see because I ain't gonna preach it if I don't understand it and like I said I spend time trying to tear down the message before I preach it cuz if I can turn it down then there's a loophole if all the ministers would do that you'd have it a whole lot less trouble I'm just as honest to say that as I can say it if you don't agree with that they something wrong with you mentally because you ought to know they ought to try to study it out first to see whether it's right or not like one big brother one time I remember he said he said I don't worry about I get I just go preaches and God fell interested that was one he got caught he never doctorate there was that come down through that and I'm not joking but listen church get the last word and it won't quit those apostles when they came out of that upper room they had that same Holy Spirit that the Lord Jesus had and he told him he says now after I'm gone he said that comforter will come to you and said he'll teach you things I said not only that said you teach you things to come you know whatsoever I've said he said he'll teach you things to come but the runs that he took him further into the revelation and they were able then to go out and write the word the three thousand down stars could take what they said and start moving in that RIM as babies because that's what the Bible says newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word the apostles in the upper room come on the Upper Room experience wouldn't you warn babies they were the one telling that we need the newborn baby stuff they told us the weight of God that's all that the minister's supposed to do is to teach you the way to God that they've been brought in their own life what about it but Stan come on brother I go any further I got to go into the point but of the next out but ending it up while you're thinking Luther then was called Reformation it was a reformer a reformer I'll give you the quotes brother Branham said a reformer came for tried to reform the former age listen and brought his message and said but his message never carried on to the original day of Pentecost of the signs and wonders he said that's where the trouble went he said he's reforming and he said then it goes down then the next would be Wesley coming up and looking at Luther and trying to reform the Lutheran Church and he starts heading toward the truth and goes with it after a while he goes into the ground he's a reformer even the suits the street you got a key in Azusa Street that's real close brother Brandon will call Azusa Street the baptism when the whole to go Reformation but then I'm gonna say something because there's a statement I made about a week ago were you baptized into the body for the gifts brother Branham said if you're not in the body you can't have the gifts of God yet gifts forever were sinners give what's he talking about what gift is he referring to why would he call Azusa Street the restoration of the gifts the gifts was in the book of Acts and needed to be restored but that ain't all of it just what I said why would he call it Reformation when we called it restoration why would he say Azusa Street is the restoration of the gifts then put it in a statute of perfect man or blasphemy as night he said that the gifts without these virtues is a stumble it's not stumbling its stumble as to you mble stumble block they don't put stumbling you'll never find it trying to hunt it stumble its to you mble stumble block to the unbeliever real genuine gifts could he be talking about these gifts because you to be in the body I mean you can have speaking in tongues without being in the body but what about a gift in the body of Christ oh well we got best thing anybody having a distinct time it's lighter than you think the bride is preparing now for what about it are we in reform are we in restoration the combined I here let me we don't have to go there but in case y'all do go take this park problem okay that's me and you pray in the belief that God's going to touch him and then you just having that we've prayed together okay it's gonna be your prior that got here Lord Jesus our little sisters asking for a Popoff so you just come Lord now and you make everything right bring it
