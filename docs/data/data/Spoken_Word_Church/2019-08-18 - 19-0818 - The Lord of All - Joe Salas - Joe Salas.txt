sisters that are safe blown by your stripes there are healed just them that's our little bit little class today I ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen sorry I brought my trial came in this summer with the air conditioner I always keep that like ice or thought so I did it one time on angels and there's so many posts and scriptures on angels summer new angels and so the score of regulations chapter 12 [Applause] in chapter 12 verse 7 to 12 chapter 7 said I mean verse 7 says and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out of that they all served on called the devil and Satan was deceived the whole world he was cast out into the earth and his angels were cast out with him so we're gonna battle every day so they can fight us here now it's time happening what is an angel I thought let's quote some I realized porks on Interscope and almond kilogram I said what is the angel and messenger you said get the dictionary [Music] some of them have an angel someone else earthly messenger that God willing to bring his earthly message and these are angels these are missing your angel of the Lord messengers to you and they're standing there with their hands up to obey what God says they hand on a sink in they shot your cover it has to happen the greatest battle ever fought for them I said now here the Bible comes right back and tells us here that God sends four angels glory what are they ministering spirits God ministering spirits sent where from the presence of God what to do to minister his world amen you not to minister some cannot theology is some denomination group but to minister of his word this is ministering spirits sent forth how do we know they are in Bible said that the word of the Lord came to that prophets is that right these angel ministers that servant Joe see that plan how God wants to redeem us when we left Eden it was a beautiful pair there in the garden I mean that lovely little sweetheart in the husband and then by failing God just bringing us right back again through the redemption to redeem us right back to a reason again we're not taking taking us back to the Angels so we're going back and you oughta go in this restaurant and hear that all squeaky juice boxes or everywhere we call it squeaking Bright Angel waits for me nonsense if you the love wife has borne us somebody she waits for you there the human being immortal God made angel but he made us man he made us humans he ain't redeem us back to angels he was he's redeeming back to where we was in the first place human being an evening thinking you see when God Himself was made flesh and dwelt among us he became think folks to the human race that's right the only way it could be what God was made placed marijuana's became temples not to Angel but the human being he never came in the form of an angel but he merely humiliating himself and stripped himself from all his heavenly floors and come down to came for the man in order to fulfill the kinsman redeemer I got some more but I just wanna take birth we went to the mother Joseph stuff Green Knight kept meeting and we Rita had a good time and we felt like to say to her in the atmosphere we didn't want to come down to us and we're so brother or Donna system I love it now they're they're sweet people could imagine having you spend them in your then there's that this Eliza do you know I'm not saying it's not a little brother already like that song says this world is not my home I'm just passing through pressure elevated energy somewhere beyond the door I can't feel it [Applause] Moses Commission without a leader or helpless and Christ our leader is our leader and dr. it was mostly durable to send an angel to lead him us and my angel before thee to keep thee in the way to bring me to the place which I had promised the angel was to be a leader the angel kept on it the miracles most of never perform any miracles angel of God and Moses performed a miracle you see what I mean the angel of the Lord was with him angel let them perform the miracle God as always as always by one man through the scripture through all the edges are as ordained angels to guide the people there was most of there was Daniel and how many more we clip to say I found it for - well Graham says that when Moses was born in Egypt what he said to thinking he was gonna take over you know and with his wife supporter that donkey he said there might hit that I don't think it's a scripted when you say there must have been intent the other angels with him water and the Ministry of Christ God has 10 many angels all of us that 14 angels the children of allergies are saying take heed that you despise not these little ones for the angel oldest behold my father's faced which is in heaven that's true be careful what you do against Christian say it would it better to be drown in the sea where they walk around your neck that between even and the pastor to them to one of them be careful the restoration of desperately God Oh a sense is is warning just before the coming of Jesus did send an angel down out of heaven by the name of April no minor angel comes by yet you see angels everyone has a guardian angel according to the scriptures Jesus a they're angels always behold my father's face which is in heaven well there sports false angels true just like this false spirits and so important to angel of God would always point you to Jesus yes sir Paul said if an angel from heaven will come preaching any other gospel than that which you've already heard let him be accursed that right so watch what the angel teaches if it is bringing it long and bringing it long and the gospel stunning doctrine and everything according turn to the Bible and believe it so God always send in jelly beans we need that they are on jellybeans and her to be in our warned the warning the world of judgment to come he said I could go a little bit on the line of sausage we all have guardian angels like 20-30 years ago I had this lady hit me head-on in the only place that was it wasn't all brick I think everything was breakfast where I was sitting so and I was telling my boss that he said it was up in a letter between the letters or something and there was his wife that and having somebody to hold the letter never get up on the letter basically of all before me and he said I can't do this I can't believe this and start reaching way up there and they later start going down nothing to stop hey we say so on god with the red cold one and you stop the letter and even I look for the guy he could never find out and nobody stopped nobody was it even people in denomination you know that there see the first one angels they were saying that a celebration was in heaven but the first time they ever spent on earth was to Shepherds at the birth of God Emmanuel another the first human beings ever heard an angel sing was humble shepherds and we know that every time that the crucified Christ is accepted there's a new birth there's a new horn sheep there is singing them in heaven by the angel over one sinner that repents the angels sing again positioning Christ but being that he was God then there must be something to worship him because he loved worship and his own being create really Christian to worship Him no temporary let's hit it and came temporary now we won't go through the whole thing but you get it on tape but then because that he was thought they made angel and angels worship them angels still worshipped him while the angel dust and that president got have six wings they clearly too on their face 200 feet and fly the two and his presence crying day and night holy holy holy Lord God Almighty that's what the scripture says they worship Him now that really something to worship Him brother Graham said there's no such thing as lemon angels on the bottom and they are shorter than ever I guess the words it's true business take this one yes flammable of God's work our promise is hoped between God and Christ and we're between them with the angel he said he will give his angels charge over thee in the desert or a camping and camp it about those who fear Him and all up and down when we're making this foundation climate you stay higher and higher your state brings me one round hotter and hotter as I move up anything happens if I fall along the road or something happens to me there's a great husband angel standing there to pick me up come on emotional marching on to sign and they are on the road something is done testing and trying your trial child trend as you go along remember is then - it will vary angels to comfort you angels to give you faith angels community alone does that a host angel all up and down the ladder and the angel that God ordered us to miniature ministering spirits blessing to us and to help us along the road and encourage us and we see the deal of science on-site sorry one property I'll have to go and drive around what all this sign that some of them churches it once said make prayer your steering wheel not your spare tire because prayer does work if I had this guide will work at the same time your brother for it and I pray for him he said that yes I'm hurt anymore I don't know pastor you know it's not moving on what and you said keep-keep Franklin companion another one said life is like a grain of sand but eternal life is like the sea shore another said our life a lifeguard can walk on water I saw in this church ok now we know we are saved by grace God has on a little string tied up and the weight said all the spirit is a gentleman he's waiting on him so we do commit a sync with brother Brennan said who senator date way so when we sin got cuts a little string off okay when you repent that gets a little string and ties it up it was that dude ain't you to harder and harder and harder all about Megan where's your stamina which one yeah that won't hurt her even query query do me okay make prayer to sting a Widow's match a spare tire on this joy in trouble questions and answer see Satan was an original Archangel of God he wants trill in heaven he was once the greatest person in heaven and heaven outside God he was God right-hand man to fellowship and he got up you'll get up I gotta talk about the other guy too so I want to hit on and sin did not start on earth since started in heaven Lucifer devil was a condemned creature for the disobedience before he ever struck the earth sin began in heaven for God but the angels and so forth upon the same basis that he put human beings Knology the Tree of Knowledge atrial I've and the Tree of Knowledge were meant to take his choice and when Lucifer was given that preeminence to make his choices he wanted something bigger than God this started the whole trouble the piece of cake now each one of these churches according to the scripture there had an angel and the angel was aminos but it angel meanings the messenger and there was seven seven angels to the seven churches I don't know whether that there's a lot engine I mean that mic important is full of angels but in that technical in Campania things dangerous to the seven churches meaning seven messengers now and there were stars and his hand and his hands he's said a star that was to reflect the light of his presence in the day other night that we are living as the stars reflect the Sun to the earth makes it light so we can walk and get around at night I'm the same man that I had here I know about a revelation that they were angels to the church that the ministry they these did at the beginning and they minister cannot change it mistake had to cause all the way through so now instead of an angel they're keeping them away from this tree is up they're driving them around to this tree an angel that at churches is to every person bring them back to the name of our Lord Jesus Christ who the Tree of Life that stands in the paradise that's good Genesis [Applause] let's go to Genesis 3 1 through 4 and we're going to change a little bit enough of that important now the serpent was more subtil than any of the beasts that I feel it's an order ok chapter 3 verse 1 now the circle in which the Lord had made and he said to the women yeah and God said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden so notice that God said he made the beasts he made it so if he made it even better many times I want to it and then woman said unto the serpent we may eat other trees of the court but in that truth the tree which is in the midst of the garden God has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not surely die so what are the what is the devil's weapon to make us this believe the word or change it to fit him Scofield goes in to a little bit he said even as a type of the church as a bride of Christ the serpent and his intended for me is not to be thought of a reptile that is an effect of the curse the creature who lent itself to Satan may hell what my whole been the most beautiful as it was the most subtle a creature less than men traces that beauty remained as private accursed every movement of a serpent is graceful and many species of beautiful color and the serpent Satan of us first appeared as an angel light everybody things that saved them they will admit God with horn if they said he was and everybody's waiting on those tattoos I saw this guy get off the pickup he has shorts on that but we don't worry about the people he's already got them now he's trying to get us so we have to learn the tactics of the enemy which way is it coming you know that they won't been using anybody has to use somebody to let me read what they were there's nothing in demonology brother and says now the first thing what is the demon you may hear so many people talking about a demon with my demon devil all comes one world one word in the English language is called tormentor so does the same use people to torment us probably so we gotta learn detective that enemy you know so we can name if he comes and tries to get you with something but sorry I'm the karate guy becomes you going to be really too brought it with whatever is thrown at you like this red a fellow that torments is a devil and evil one they say now the bottom of today's is to most to many people is somehow that looked and grandpa and grandma read or something like that there's not so much not much to this with all folks and so forth but that's wrong it's for everybody in dmoz or tormenters that torment us now there's demon that comes into the soul of a man and that is psychology that would be it would be in I say there's though the demon that comes into the soul is something that torments the soul many times you can see a bevy of insanity there may be yet a converted person filled with the Holy Spirit and yet be totally insane see that's right that has nothing to do with a soul is safe torment or see something that torments them now all sickness we have to find out first of all that all sickness comes from the devil it's not the after a sickness no sickness comes from sixes No God sometimes permits safe to put sickness on YouTube with you and bring you back to the house of God when users disobey Him but sickness in the beginning come from devil could you imagine that person would leave that God our Heavenly Father would be an author of such a thing as sickness and dead but no he is never was never will be God promised death because of disobedience God promised death as one writer said on that to do God harness it to bug me pulls it into the presence of God and believer but the work that means separation Jesus said neither hear my words and believe it or me the semi and everlasting life he said I'm the resurrection might be hid they believe in me through he was dead he showed he live and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die and we pack the bodies of each other or the Saints are a great place shall never die now taking the subject demon Allah is speaking about demons now people when you say demon right away they begin to think or some and that fantastic or something demon is just as real as angels and the devil is just as real a real devil as Jesus Christ is the son of God these are they will heaven is just as real and if there is no such thing as hell there is no such thing as heaven and there is an eternal bliss eternal 20 pence there is no eternal bliss if there is no day there's no night but it sure is there they there's night give it as soon as sure that there's a Christian there's got to be a hypocrite as sure there's somebody that's genuine from God there's somebody to be impersonate that see it's just a sickly throw and come back and white I don't not to the life on everything true they're false everywhere and there's a false gospel there's a two in custody there's the true baptism there's a false baptism as the main believe and there's a real there's two American dollars there's a false American dollar there's a genuine Christian there's a genuine hypocrisy that's just imports impersonating so you find that it all goes together now we can separate it because the rainfall that's it I was just gonna mention something regarding diving angels you don't mind I was gonna mention something regarding the angels of your mind no I figured stuff it's just interesting uh you know because you know the Bible says that the angels are ministering spirits right and it calls brother Brenton many times called ministers angels you know prophets were pastors you know angels and that's what the Bible says regarding the the meaning of the word of the word angel decisions and Strong's Concordance in the New Testament in the Greek is the word I had loosed which means to bring the tidings of messenger especially an angel by application of Pastner I need a messenger envoy one who has sent an angel messenger from God so you notice that a man an angel sent from God usually when when they're asked you know they always say I come from the presence of the Lord they're very humble they're usually meek and they get gift they give God the glory they give God the credit right so that's why you know a true angel of God or a messenger or a pastor or a minister that's what they should be doing is giving God the glory showing that humility so I just wanted to drive it out but also I thought it was interesting that the city of Los Angeles that's the Spanish word of which means the city of the angels but originally that city now now it's very interesting because you know Sodom and Gomorrah had angels go to the to the city and of course the city was destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah was destroyed but they no but originally that city was supposed to be called was supposed to be called up says the name Los Angeles comes from the Spanish language and it means that angels the name is an abbreviation from the original name of the place the original name is el pueblo de nuestra senora la reina de los ángeles a real force in Portland which means which means the town of Our Lady the Queen of Angels of the river pour simcha low so it was originally I was supposed to be called originally the queen of the angels but then they they they renamed Los Angeles so that's good I know her that and of course you know the Los Angeles ISTE is the capital of Hollywood and you know movies the music industry is huge there so which was the same thing was in Sodom and Gomorrah right it's just bill yeah bill theory would fallen angels and I just the kind of thought that was just to throw that in there are you making tea let's go to number 12 12 start mister started wanted to end and Marian and Eric spec against mostly because of the Egyptian woman whom he had married before he had married and his chip Ethiopian moment and they said had the Lord in his home or by Moses head Venus pokeman also by us and they were herded down and Moses was very meek above all the man that which were upon the face of the earth and the law respect suddenly unto Moses and after Aaron and to Miriam come on you three into the tabernacle of the congregation and they three came out and the Lord came down in the pillar of cloud and stood in the door of the tabernacle and called Aaron and Aaron and they both came forth and he said here not my words if there be a prophet among you I the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision and I will speak unto Him in a dream my servant Moses is not soul who is faithful in all my house with him I would speak mouth to mouth even apparently and not in door speeches and assimilate the Lord shall be behold where for them where are you not afraid to speak against my servant Moses and the angel of the Lord was killed kindled against them and they parted and the power departed from out that cabinet and the whole mirror became leprous white as snow and there upon Miriam and behold she was leprous so God doesn't brings six another said before they marry I need a little whipping you don't mess with my you don't mess with my profit is it so Ephesians 6:12 6:12 chapter 6 12 through 17 chapter six verse 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armour of God that you may be able to stand and evil day and having done all to stand therefore having your loins Girt about the truth and having on that press PLAY muchness and your feet shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of faith wherever you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts but awake it and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit so you have to know what you know what's coming at you did you three to be ready and the CEO governors of Silla safe is to reject the gospel or change it is only about the same people yes and Paul said I am a prison of the Lord either your prisoner of Christ or you're a prisoner of the devil so let's say it's two sizes on your two side so you choose between which one [Applause] save me a few places and save is 814 but I said now then let us look mouth to this great for great for a few minutes distance great simple day that we are not living in I don't believe there's ever was a day that I had read in history there's been later days that persecution when the children I God was put to death on every hand but to see the seaplanes of the enemy we never had a day like this we were not living in it's the most cunning the cease full day and when I see that it brings this that the Christian has to be more on his toes today than ever with any age now but I can today's a prosecution of wrong to take the church a Christian made a mistake he went into the arena was picked to the Lions or something like that then they found him not being a Christian for his testimony but he stole was saved because he was that Puri an adulterer believer and God and gladly share his testimony with his verb and the things that loose or holes in his body and the blood bled it out he would scream up the real world famous a receive my spirit or Jesus but now the countenance that the devil now makes the people believe that they are Christians when they are not there is the thing you don't have to seal is more cunning than you would be that when you had to see your life away we're testimony that they've always said every cunning trap that he can - it's the deceiver and Jesus told us the magic 24 how this day would be that we're living in the most deceitful day never live suppose that he would deceive the very elect God evil possible for him to the sea but brothers for the pumps that you would not to see the bride that's what Satan does he perverse the nation's he perverse the church she perverse the people he's a deceiver and perverted their original words God made a man he made a woman and he dressed them different and he meant for them to stay that way to act that way one is feminist and the other is Muslim he's separate Adam in the corner even and did this separately from him now but now they were aware of the bangs she cuts her hair like this like his and he tries to wear his like her see she wears his outside coat and he wears her inside clothes now there's some sacrilegious but I don't mean it that way but it's an absolute gospel truth you don't know then there's something wrong with you you either blind or never being on the street and she thinks and she thinks and you think that is right there get along some way I've been here on the news for all these people that in the morning there might be a gamma in the afternoon they might be a girl so you better you better tell them what they are because they might magic you're this or that I don't know they call me see they don't want to sum up don't want to be called he or she they have other other from now right and whether the thickness like 100 zone now this is the place that was horrible miss Rita revelation 21:3 and I heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of God it was a man and he will avail the world to them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God and God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying so there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that said upon the throne said behold I make all things new and he said unto me write for this horse of two and faithful and he said unto me it is done Alpha and Omega the beginning in the end I will give unto him that is empty first the fountain of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and shall be my son but beautiful an unbeliever unbelieving and then Automation abomination and murderers and whoremongers and sorcerers and adulterer all Liars shall have their part and the life was part of the fire and brimstone issue ii did and we know where the devil is going like any comments and i've still got
