been redeemed they never been lost so they're going to have to be what silent a moment of silence because they can't understand why we're shouting they can't understand why we're glorifying God they can't understand why we say Lord if you had to come we wouldn't have been here they were just Angels they were created to worship some of them he created to make a choice some of them he created I don't think he made a choice I think they they all went with one went with the other and and then you and I are the whole reason that they were made Angels were made to take care of the redeemed of the earth Amen to do the things of the Lord do to to show and lead and guide us and always said and I know some of you same way here my poor Guardian Angel bless his heart he's going to look like a ragged a ragged young and when I when I get over there brother John he's going to look pretty rough cuz he's had to stop me from doing a lot of dumb stuff and he's allowed me to do a few dumb stuff when God goes hey let him do that just go ahead and let he's going to learn something from this okay just go ahead and let him do that now Angel's going let him do it let him go that way just for a moment he'll come right back the other way don't worry he's coming back so we appreciate each one of you let me remember brother Joe Solace on January the 7th at 10:00 at where brother how is at The Landings of Gainesville and he'll give you the address if you need it and so we'll brother Joe post it if all anybody wants to go play instruments and all that we sure would appreciate it also brother Bob and then be coming back from Ohio tomorrow just remember him brother Luis will be coming back from Brother Jee Williams this afternoon I hope because we're keeping his little dog praise the Lord yeah well I'll take him to your house next time sat's a good little puppy she's a sweetheart she just he's poops everywhere but anyway so brother Aaron will be coming back from wherever he went and then uh this coming Wednesday I'll be speaking and then next Sunday we'll have no service next Sunday call somebody you love call somebody you don't love that's probably going to be the best thing to do call somebody you don't love and tell them you love them and mean it let this be a Thanksgiving not this be Thanksgiving past but let this be a Thanksgiving because you know what God came to this earth not for your that's right he came and endured hardship trials tribulations little boy little child grown adult gave his life for me and you amen so he can have a bride so let's call somebody and extend that Grace to somebody else amen that' be no Services coming Sunday the next Wednesday brother Daniel Martinez will be with you speaking on Wednesday night December the 30th um keep that in prayer at 7:00 regular service with brother Wayne Lawson if anybody needs to stay Friday night and Saturday night please let somebody know uh actually who would need who would need a place that would like to to stay over if I know most of you are local now Regina different ones if y'all want to whatever y'all want to do uh we got um places open for you to stay and then December the 31st will be at 8:00 we'll have regular watch Night Service I know n 99% of you people have been through it so not going to announce what we do start at 8:00 going to have some food then January the 1st which will be Sunday we will have no service on that day because we'll be here till probably 2 to 3:00 in the morning so uh just keep that all in your prayer that's why we had prayer meeting last week to pray about this and pray about everything going on in the church and we'll also have another one in January because we'll have a youth banquet at the end of January on the 28th and brother Daryl Ward will be here with us all right he'll be with us the whole weekend so also keep in mind and in prayer February the 11th the uh Valentine's banquet brother Dutch Scott will be with us that weekend and he'll be speaking at the banquet and the Sunday after that so just keep all that in your prayers also remember keep that in mind because at February the 11th is when the banquet is we're going to there's going to be at least I think 14 people coming from Ohio so all the Ohio groups coming here plus their in-laws so we're going to put them up somewhere uh don't want them to stay in a motel because they've all bought plane tickets to get here so I think we ought to put them up somewhere if anybody's got place for them to stay I sure would appreciate if you'd uh move the dirty clothes out of the way and oh I'm sorry never mind move the dirty clothes out of the way and let them sleep in the bed that y'all throw your dirty clothes on even clean clothes whatever we've done it for Regina so let's go Son of Man part 77 at least she turns the lights off now we love sister Regina don't we all love sister Regina we were looking we were at Mama's house couple days ago and she had found this book of their 50th wedding anniversary well they've been married 60 something years so that 50th anniversary and we had it in Gainesville at um at a holiday in or something somewhere up there Ramada in I think it was and well reg there was Regina right in the front doing her job telling people what to do what packages who it came came from and she had black hair some of us did too and some of us were a little B kids too little children so uh we appreciate mom and dad I like those pictures to look back at the old and see what what we look like uh 10 years ago set for me I don't want to see that no more so but just keep all these things in prayer we got you know that's January and February we've got a lot going on so we appreciate each and every one of you I'll have a wedding to do the end of uh February so one of the sisters in Ohio is getting married so I'm going to do the wedding for him so we'll be up there so just keep these things in prayer and also like T said everybody's going to be traveling everybody's going to be going somewhere we're going to be fellowshipping eating Satan would love to make us have a wreck but we're going to pray that that guardian angel will put on an extra extra suit put on an extra suit of feathers I believe in feathers I don't believe in armor I believe in feathers amen so um just remember that and and and like I said before this church has been like as brother Aaron said so well Wednesday night this church is built on the truth from the Holy Ghost it's not been a man it's been the Holy Ghost to keep us all straight and we appreciate brother Dale and what he's done absolutely we could not have what we have without his generosity for paying for all these things that he pays for uh the children listen a lot of you kids if you went to another church you'd be paying your own way to these camps I know that for a fact amen people are blown away by what we give out in this church from from Brother Dale that doesn't really have to it's his money I mean he you tithe him and he gives it back to you he gives it back to you in many ways and we appreciate that and I believe it helps the church it help Help the People amen we're still humans and we still have human lives and we still but we love our children and we want to make sure that they get at least get started right and whatever they do with the rest of their life their business but we try to get them started right this one right here is done well it ain't all from his mama I don't think it was I think it was too she's she I love I'm just going to ramble here for a minute like I said downstairs I try my best I I ask all of you widowed sisters and ones that don't have husband anymore I say hey how you doing how's everything going everything all right I try to give if we have something to give out I like to give like deer me that we're giving I want to give to them first and let them have a chance to get it if you don't like it that's okay I'll give it to somebody else and that's okay but I want our sisters and and brothers that are single to be taken care of right they've lost a piece of their self right sister you know you talking about that little other day you've lost a piece of yourself you can't live intimately with somebody for 20 30 40 50 60 years and not just lose a whole piece of your life that's right so I I don't want to feel that like Al filled it but I want to make sure that she's happy as she can be and that she has what she needs and if I ever find out any of you sisters are having a hard time and don't tell somebody about it you going to have a problem with me cuz we can help you in this church everything can be we can we can help our young young sisters we can help young in heart but uh I think we're um we're ordained to do that to take care of our own people first and then as we take care of our own people then uh I think God will take care of us and bless us it's just a big circle he'll turn around and bless us back the other way always has always will never seen us outg give God never but we try to give as much as we can so we appreciate our our sisters that that that are widows and don't have husbands here because like I said it's hard enough with two much less now one and you've lost one Partners we really want to U you know not hug them physically but you know hug them up by the word of God and make sure that y'all have what you need to have and uh yeah we're family we're that's right we're family you lose we lose you lose we lose you gain we gain all right so I just wanted to make sure that we understand that being Christmas time here that we make sure that um that we have everything we need all right not our wants but our needs God will fulfill your needs your wants you're going to probably have to work overtime to get your wants but uh had a job but to get your needs God said he provide your needs amen so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day that you give us Heavenly Father Lord we're just as the prophet said one time we're just humans off of a off of a human tree and we've all come under the curse of sin born wrong Lord without a chance till you come but you said you would come and you would redeem us back to what we were before the fall and father we pray now that this journey that we're on that you'll take us back through this journey Lord and that we'll see today and the days forward that you are Jehovah Gyra you Jehovah Rafa you're all the seven compound names plus that you'll provide our needs Lord and you'll just be with us and hug us up when we need need to be hugged Lord you'll be our comfort in the time of trouble you'll be our partner when there's not one there beside of us you'll be our strength when we're weak you'll be our song when we can't sing anymore you'll be our comfort when we are not comforted by the world father I pray that you just be with us now be with us now more intimately than you ever have before Lord we invite you into our homes we invite you into this church we invite you into ourself we invite you Lord into this realm that we're talking about of spirit with memory reason conscious affection imagination Lord you said you love to be invited as you stood in the door and knocked and we know that the door knob is on the inside so Lord may we today let you in and let you commune and S with us Lord we love you with our heart Lord and we pray that you'd be with each one forgive us of our sins bless each one on the Foreign Fields bless the ones that are not here today Lord as you give them safe travel back bless the ones that are sick sister fra and different ones Lord that couldn't be here we pray that you'd give them Supernatural strength Lord to help them through life just Lord may we always remember this is not just a season of giving it is to the world but you're a giver every day of the week every hour of the day every month of the year and every year that we live You're The Giver Lord and we give you all the praise and honor and glory for that in Jesus name amen part 77 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father father full of grace and truth Luke 6: 19 says the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them all we're going to get to this right here Proverbs 31:10 who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies you may be seing the Lord At His blessings to the reading of the word her price is far above rubies Priceless is this verse virtue that you have being the Bride of Jesus Christ but we didn't start out that way we started out lost we started out needing God we started out needing a savior somebody to save our soul all right but there's a journey somewhere that we've got to come to you and I the world has a journey and their journey is going to lead them to hell if they don't get born again come on somebody they going to lead them to Hell their leaders going to take them someplace but our leaders going to take us to another place amen thank God we're on the winning side thank God I'm going to read here in just a few minutes that he that overcometh he that conquers what Jesus conquered death hell and the grave where's he at today he's inside of you so you conquered death hell and the grave all right if you'll just believe that let out that what's inside of you brother BR said that atomic bomb of Faith you've got that inside of you brother Brown said if you're born again he said you got enough power in you to create a world and go live on it wow right now not just I mean a baby Christian has got power with God everybody with me but then God had to send us a messenger we know that a Malachi 4 he sent us a messenger to come and to deliver us the truth not a truth the truth there's been a truth down through time but these great mystery TR truths as he's talking about Malachi 4 you know Malachi 3 is kind of a lot of Destruction going on and and different things but and then you know it'll Smite the Earth with a curse you hear all these cursings in the Bible that and God's going to give you that if you don't accept him like I said before if you're not covered by him then you're covered by the other guy and the other guy he's going to lose okay so that's the choice that you and I have to make but now we're called into the end time as we were talking about this morning in the end time we're called for the culmination of everything there's not any Loose Ends brother R come to get all the loose ends tied back together to bring that faith of the fathers back to us listen so we can have faith in something the Catholic church has faith in their Pope the Baptist have faith in their leadership the methodists have their leadership and and I hope that they're you know you you got to put your heart somewhere so if you put your heart in Jesus Christ he will lead you to this message and then what will happen with this message it'll help you grow up it'll help you to where God can use you where he won't use the world he's going to use me and you to destroy the effects of the devil remember the devil will not be destroyed until after the Thousand Years so we're not going to try to destroy him we just going to try to keep him out of us right cuz we can't destroy the Devil we can destroy the effects of the devil everybody with me there's a difference there cuz the devil's still going to be according to the Bible he's going to be alive for a thousand years while we're on the Earth and glorified bodies then he's going to try to gather a bunch of people together and whip us and he can't do it we're unhip for those of you that are not from the south that means Invincible we're unhip look that up in the b in the dictionary I don't think Webster ever even got to that but these mystery truths that literally turn us back is what we're talking about now we're going to go up the statue of perfect man we're going our mindset is going to be we need virtue but we don't need to be a virgin now don't get me wrong you do need to be let's don't go over into greasy Grace and you do whatever you want to no no but to be a virgin to Jesus Christ is the greatest thing you'll ever be amen not a physical virgin everybody with me don't be a little plain but I guess I'll have to be because if you put everything on being a virgin then there's a lot of people ain't going to make it all right if that's all solely you put it on but if you put it that God Makes You The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ he does it by his blood see the Catholic Church sister Anna is not too far off see they get a little truth they'll get a little anointing and they'll say okay we have power to turn you back to a virgin well that's you can't do that physically right all right brother Bram said she can be forgiven but not justified in other words you can't walk up and say I'm a virgin and had three or four guys you or vice versa we always say say that vice versa the man needs to be one to come on somebody but he said sanctify them through what though how can we be Sanctified the Catholic Church says we can what we can turn you around throw salt over your shoulder say okay you're a virgin you can marry well see that's not so far off if you'll take it in the spiritual sense that God has made us that are just Outcast of the world we're the whors of the world come on somebody we're the rhabs we're the the woman at the well amen but God has done something for us he by his what by his transforming power he sees us as a virgin I'm going to read you the quote where brother B said The Virtuous sinless bride of Jesus Christ if you are in Revelations 19 and we're going to read it maybe in just a few minutes if we get to it Revelations 19 said it is the righteousness of the Saints is what you got on not the not the righteousness of God the righteousness of the Saints when you come to be a wife you have come to a position bride you know Lily and Zach they're just I mean you know Roman candles every 10 seconds and it's just oh it's just oh just okay I hope the Lord don't tear another 10 years but give them 10 years you always say the honeymoon's over well it can't it don't have to be but there are things you got to deal with because what's going to happen is you you have never and Lily and I were talking about it today there's things that happen that's never happened before and you got to get used to that you say well no you put two people together that's never been together before yeah yeah mhm you're going to go why didn't you tell me this before we got married Lily said amen you need to wash that cast son you need to wash your cast your cast stinks your wife told you to do that she's your wife now she's your bride use just some EP some salt or something do I put something on it sanctify them through thy truth look the word is what's going to sanctify so it's not anything that we can't be we can't be washed by regular water right it's got to be the water of the word and that's the only thing that's going to what wash all that away from us all right sanctify them through thy truth truth Thy word is truth and that's why I believe we're standing in the truth so as we are standing in the truth we can be washed white oh I had forget that oh I did see there you are in your memory reason conscious affection imagination go to the soul and listen to what your soul says if your soul is born again it says hey you didn't do that I'll read it here in just a minute brother Brown says you didn't do it in the first place what the real you didn't do it this is not the real you right this is permitted by God to keep everything together for you to live a human life to do what to be redeemed but it's not going to redeem this one first it redeems your soul first excuse me then through your body memories G imagination and then this thing's just in for the ride this thing's just here for the ride okay some of us as we get older we get roll a little bit harder but look as thou H has sent me in the world even so i s so what what we were saying the other day Jesus didn't say well I'm going to protect you and I'm going to keep you in a cave no I'm going to present you to the world I'm going to put you in the world and I'm going to prove to the devil that you can live in this world what the worst world the worst time it's ever been is right now the things that you have to put up with I have to put up with oh my word think about it 50 60 years ago no internet no cell phone no computers in the house you got your information from the newspaper or word of mouth or maybe the television but now it's instant you get whatever you want on your phone right well guess what you get the good and the bad amen yeah you get a lot that you don't want but you know why because we're we've entered into that fourth dimension that fourth dimension is just wide open now it's just going through this building a million times more than even when the prophet stood in 1963 and he said there's people going through this building voices going through this building he said we can pick the voices up right here we'll put a recorder out or we'll put a turn the television on well same here but oh my talk about internet talk about websites talk about WiFi we talking about the other day or today everything your watch has got Wi-Fi on it your car has got Wi-Fi in it we got Wi-Fi everywhere and it's bombarding your brain subconsciously and you don't even know it that's why that we have to be the most protected people in the world because and God knew that that's why brother Brown said you're astronauts now you're not just airplane drivers you're not just one of them little old what you call them hang gliders no you're made to get in a spaceship you're made to be as he said pressurized for this time so listen you say oh I can't stand it yes you can Provisions have been made for you to make it don't than God is going to put you in this age and go oh I shouldn't have done that no he knew exactly he gave you all the provisions you needed he gave you a pastor to preach for you for to you for years a fivefold Ministry that we bring in tapes to listen to people to to sit around and discuss hey I got this issue young people when I was growing up folks there was no such thing as a youth camp no there was no such thing as a youth camp they started those was only maybe 10 or 15 maybe 20 something years ago and and and thank God that it was able to give you us a little bit of a chance but when I was growing up it was just you know make it or don't make it listen or don't listen and for their sakes I sanctify myself this is Jesus Christ that they also might be Sanctified through the truth and then we're talking about now the inside guy the spirit realm memory reason conscious affection imagination that's where listen if you're born again today you have virtue inside of you now to let it out is a different story right to let it out through those Outlets of memory reason conscious affection imagination that's where it gets tricky because Satan can do as we were talking about and we're going to read it later on where he comes in with his white horse rider he comes in with his oh it's okay just go to church that's false it was so real though and so pretty till two people was deceived by it John and admired it brother rown said if that if that angel hadn't got his attention away from it he was admiring that church it was so beautiful I admired it John said in other words I'm I'm I'm just I'm just oh I'm I'm just am it's overwhelmed that this is God this is the devil the angel said yeah you need to get away from that John come out of her my people and then also brother Brandon preached a mighty con was Revelation 6 which it was not we know that but he progressed in Revelation just like me and you there's a lot of false Doctrine we thought that was right hello that we don't think's right anymore why the Holy Ghost our guide tells us what's true and what's not so the memory reason conscious affection imagination it's bombarded by Satan it's bombarded by God what did the old Indian chief say he said Chief which one wins he said the one I feed the most so whatever you feed on young men young women older men older women whatever we feed on that's what we are that's right all right and it's your free will nobody goes in and turns on those websites for you nobody listens to gossip but you just put everything in there it's your free will to say hey stop your free will you you're a free moral agent you can say nope anytime you want to the problem is is Satan has throw just enough of desire in there a Humanity that'll override sometimes how many of us have made a mistake and really didn't want to do it we have some Liars in the building so we need to pray for those people we all have done that every one of us has had a thought and it be just a complete lie amen well that where'd that come from God no came from the Devil right he took a thought that you should had of God maybe and he turned it into what the Bible says turns it into lasciviousness if you hear if you hear something from a preacher and you say boy that's right and it's as wrong as rain on the moon God didn't give you that the devil got involved and made you think it was the right thing to do that white righteous church that white righteous horse that he got on to ride he didn't write it out there in the world he wrote it in the church he wrote it in me and you come on somebody let's get close let's bring it here and not start pointing fingers out there let's bring them back to here if it's the spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God if it don't it won't all right then right here is where we got a point this morning obeying what God Said do what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of God so if we're not getting what we need from the word of God we're just not obedient we're not doing what God said we're disobedient children didn't the Bible tell there would be disobedient children in the end time lovers of pleasure more lovers of God disobedient incontinent and all those other list of things well that's not out in the denominations my friends it's in every Church there is but the prophet told Saul do this and God will bless you Saul took it on himself and said I think we'll save him two guys I think we'll save all these Rams and all these we can sacrifice them and save ours sounds good but Samuel says Noe to obey is better than sacrifice to hearken than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft wow we think witch C there something done in a basement somewhere you know and they got black lights and they got uh whatever that devil sign is and all that M Rebellion is right here all of us Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness amen that's what we were talking downstairs we were talking about disrespect and that's what happens when we don't do the will of God we disrespect God and he doesn't have to give you any respect to disrespect God as we were saying you know it disrupt the service or or come in late or something or bring a bad Spirit into the church that's stubbornness and what is Iniquity knowing to do better and don't do it or doing it know you shouldn't do it all right we all fall under this right here stubbornness iniquity idolatry because thou H has rejected what the word of the Lord right that puts us right there we we rejected the word of the Lord just like like Saul did and Saul had the kingdom ripped out of his life let's don't have the joy ripped out of our life for doing something we shouldn't do the joy of the Lord is what our strength amen the joy of the Lord is our virtue the strength to do what we need to do to get through our daily life as Ryan said don't be listening to um and Sean Hannity is okay all right different ones but why listen to that when you can listen to the voice of God thus sayith the Lord amen nothing against Sean Hannity I think he's a pretty good guy but uh he has really nothing spiritually for me to listen to I mean so naturally it might help us you know Dave Ramsey and different ones in which we think that you know God's put these people a lot of people in these capacities to help people with I don't think God is the kind of guys that no only the bride I'm just going to help them no there's others that he he helps the world if they want it all right look he's talking about we're not building an organization I read this morning so let's go through it real quick God didn't send him to build organizations it sent him to build individual people one person at a time individual people that they might be the PowerHouse and Dwelling Place of the spirit what by his word not by your thoughts not by my thoughts not by my false Doctrine or your false Doctrine but by what by the spirit of God by his word by his word build up that individual to that place to that place what place a moving breathing instrumentality of God all right now we've been talking about virtue we know what that is so let's just keep on going through virtue anyone knows what the world virtue means see it we must have it if virtue went from him to heal the woman that was sick he's expecting the same virtue in his church expecting the same he's expecting the same it's a requirement if Richard Roberts was here he'd tell you churches he went to before didn't even preach on the statute of perfect man didn't even think anything about it but when he come here he heard somebody say it's required and then he read the quote where brother brandham said it was required and the Bible says it's required so if the Bible says it's required brother Brown said it's required and brother Dale says it's required it's required it's a requirement for us to grow in this church age it's a requirement for us to overcome in this age that we do and have these virtues working in his life what look and if he had virtue to give to the people he expects us expects us to have virtue to give to the people and I read you here down just a few minutes ago not just to you but the whole world Listen folks you know as well as I do the whole world is looking for something that's why they're going out on these crazy tangents that's why they're going out and searching for first one thing and another if they just sit still long enough and listen to a good Holy Ghost filled preacher it would satisfy a lot of their needs because there's a craving inside of a human being to be right somewhere inside of them to be right to be morally right but now Satan takes over and twist it turns it pulls them in a wrong direction that's where our kids are where they're at that's why different ones are where they're at it's because Satan has pulled them and they've listened to him not listen to God all right but we're praying that now they'll listen to God because you know what me and you listen to the devil for a long time amen somebody and now we're listening to God yes all right we're listening to the word and what he listen he didn't change the Bible when you got born again it was already in there your provision that you went through from age 12 age of accountability to in my case 37 this was always right here what I needed was always in here there was not a development where 10 years ago you know they had to write a book about or 30 years ago they had to write a book about computers well not 50 years ago they didn't need a book about computers cuz they wasn't computers look at Mariam Webster's Dictionary the word computer is not even in there now it is on the revised Edition but we don't have a REV this is not a revised Edition this was wrote before the foundation of the world and got you in it so it didn't have to change what did we have to do we had to change to fit that yes we had to change to fit that but everybody in the world I I talked to some people the other day and that they talk in the political realm I said you ain't going to ever satisfy the political people Democrat Republican libertarian that's the world trying to fix their self that's the world trying to fix theirself and you know what they going to fix theirself into the tribulation that's what this is all heading up to everything you see political Putin Russia China all these different plac they're moving and we know what's going to happen but praise God's name forever we won't be here to see it we'll walk out on the ashes of those Wicked people popes Kings great people they're not born again guess what there are ashes under the SES of your feet and I hate that and I and and God does too God hates it he hates to have to send somebody to hell cuz you send yourself to Hell really he don't send you to hell he made the hell for the de for his devil and his angels He didn't make hell for you but there not a place to put you if you're not in God so he had to make a place to put you you have to crawl over the cross you have to crawl over the blood of Jesus to get to hell that's right now talked about Mr Reverend Mr Lily we talked about this morning what did a lily have what does a flower have a flower has something that what they give out so we're talking about this as a human giving out virtue or as a as a member of the body of Christ it opens itself up for honey for the bee to come and get his part don't complain and see that's the same thing with you and I about the world the world is looking for something listen show them something different show them something different show them you don't we went to a party last night they were drinking so did I coffee like where's Esther I had a sixpack Coke but now see you said well you shouldn't have went no they're people I work with every day so they know we're different praise God they know we're different so they never offered me a drink she actually had to find a coffee machine and she had cleaned it out with vinegar several months before to put it up and the C first run a coffee tastes like vinegar so they had to make about six cups so anyway but we had just as much fun right as they did drinking their alcohol and then it shames the Hound out of them because they're even the owner of the house she's over here in the corner I said y y or Darlene I said what are you doing over there and I saw she had like ginger ale or something whatever she had over here on the side she said I said no that other stuff Jun said that white stuff right over there it was tequila that water in a bottle bottle water that's what she call bottle water it's a bottle water but you see that you mingle with the girl with the world though but you don't have to be of that world you can sit there and they sit there and drink their uh Strawberry Wine didn't bother me one bit I drank my coffee but you know what it was it was a condemnation to them because they to get over in the listen in their own house now listen in my own house I do pretty much what I want to cuz I pay the bills right king of my castle all right June tells me that all the time she tells me what to be but I wear the pants in the family cuz she can't but you listen think about it though you have they have to get in the corner of their own house to hide what they're doing because of of the condemnation that we bring just walking into the house them knowing and hiding everything you know hiding everything you know putting the bottles up but they get over there and they get in the corner you know and they well you know what they're doing but it shames them so much and that's okay but I tell people I said look dad's always even even when we were hunting and Gro daddy is same way he said look he said guys don't stop drinking because I don't drink actually one day he said I'll go get you a beer if you need one well I mean they're going to drink anyway so what does the matter but don't be sh I mean don't make us and he told me he said look if we make you uncomfortable I'm sorry he told a bunch of group of people over there a long time ago he said if we make you comfortable so I'm sorry but this is just who we are you be who you are don't worry about me you be who you are I'll be who I am we'll have a we'll have a party a man last night we had a party we laughed and cut up they drank their alcohol we drank our coffee and and Sprite or whatever it was we had and and but see maybe something will come out of that one day maybe a condemnation will become more than just going over in the corner and pouring the drink and and not cursing you know around us that's okay but they knew we were different they knew not to even tempt us and offer us a drink why cuz they know our background just like we're going to read here in just a little while where Ruth Boaz looks at Ruth and says the whole city knows you're a virtuous woman the whole city not just your immediate family or your immediate employees or or your employer but the whole world when you go in Walmart you open the door for people and you say God bless you you do like I said you now listen this is Christmas time there's toys laying all over the floor I didn't try to pick all them up the other day but normally I'll pick something up and put it back on the Shelf but it looked like Santa Claus had blew up the blew up the bag you know and down the aisle so I just said oh sorry Lord and you know what though he reminded me though or the devil did says hey you told them people that you put it back better than I said I do I said but I'm not going to pick up a a napkin on the side of the in the um parking lot of the post office and it looks like it's got something on I don't need to have my hands on that's right amen I mean there's stupidity and then there's doing what you do now the other things like the other day there was orange peelings or something and I picked them up throw them in trash can that don't make me know better but you know what it does somebody may be looking and say hey he's trying to make it better and so I said for the whole world that's what brother B telling us for the whole world you got to have virtue for the whole world cuz this whole world is being kept together by me and you cuz when we leave it's going to be utter chaos those people that you think are good people they will cut your throat they won't cut ours cuz we'll be gone but they'll cut their neighbor's throat for an apple that's right smart educated people will be the worst cuz they don't know how to survive they'll come out of them inner cities and they'll come after us not us but come after people that know how to raise crops they know how to do this I don't know why I'm telling you this but this is part of life but that's the virtue I want to draw virtue off all of us brothers and sisters every one of us even you young kids in school when you say no and everybody else says yes yeah they're going to persecute you yeah they're going to call you crazy they GNA call you different so what praise God praise God that they noticed that you're different cuz there's a lot of people I know in that's been in the message have grow up that the girls as soon as they left the house and got on the bus they had their britches hi in the well I ain't going there anyway so that was not really a uh that wasn't very much of a witness but girls y'all don't do that please please don't please don't be a false witness be a true witness you wear your clothes cuz it's different from the world all of us we wear our clothes you know you how many tattoos you got now that's what how many tattoos how many piercings you got cuz it's a normal thing but for you and I you you they look at you and they go what do you do I go to church on Sunday what yeah I go to church on Sunday you ought to try it sometime he's not selfish he's got older Jesus Christ was not selfish he died for every person but he knew who would and who wouldn't he knew when he came here all seven or there's now 8 billion people in the world now you know we just turned over to 8 billion just a few days ago there's 8 billion people in this world there probably not 10 million people that are Christians could you imagine wow and then when those 10 million leave the Earth guess what's going to happen utter chaos CU everybody's going to be killing everybody else we're the only people that bring sanity to this world you and I the daily things we do the even even listen even paying bills and we should be up here from everybody else we should be up to hear and and not be like the world even in that way cuz you know what everybody's watching everything I know your credit score I hope not but what am I talking about something is pulling us something keeps holding me and I the song I didn't hold it it held me something keeps holding me what pulling me up something keeps pulling me to this church not just this building something pulls me to listen to the ministry of this church something pulls me to act different than the world something's pulling me not pushing me that's what the problem is we get pushed a lot of times and we don't want to get pushed you get pushed and you know what I'm talking about it goes up there for temperance we'll talk about that a little bit later amen don't push me I want to be like the treat people like the Frog you know how to boil a frog right you're supposed to boil a frog when it's live Michael you understand you know what you do you put him in a pot you don't put it in boiling water he put him in a pot of warm water then you just keep turning the heat up a little at a time he's boiling right and you don't he don't even realize he's being bald all of a sudden he's he's a bald he's a bald frog same way that's why that's what the devil does me and you too he doesn't long time Jump in on us and say he'll say I'm going to get you in the pot and I'm going to turn start turning the heat up but look to attract the third poll the three polls we we preached many years ago about the three polls of our journey and we still believe there is justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost but it came as what brother Brown would take him by the hand bumps would come on his hand he say okay you got this disease' then he would look at it again he would grab their hand and he would pronounce them healed or that they still had it then you got to the discernment where he could actually what pull out everything in their life pull out where they came from where they lived what they were going to do I see you as an old man I see you as a young man he's that he's just pulling he's pulling their life out I want that to happen today we're under that pull right there of discernment as the discernment of the words going forth is pulling out and what it's you're either letting it correct you or you're dying one of the two you're letting it correct you or you're shutting yourself off and God can't help you if you shut the door all right then the third pull is the opening of the word brother B said it can't be impersonated all right listen brother Ram said these virtues are god-given virtues but there's a lot of people in the world that have these virtues that are not born again some of them but they can't have them all the way like me and you cuz there's not a Holy Ghost there to keep what pulling us so we'll get to that later on the opening of the word you can't impersonate when you get to Revelation when those seals open to that prophet and they open to us in the end time then Satan can't impersonate that he can't stand the word so he's not going to be able to delve into it like we can all right so now brother Brown was talking about the apostles talking about how they acted they went around probably me a few words till they got in the pull pit they walked in they done what they were supposed to do and they walked out yes sir they had power they had virtue they had no arguments with men they knew where they stood that's what I want us to be I want us to be a church that knows where we're standing knows who we are at every time anytime any time of the day they know who they believed they kept on walking in the spirit doing only in other words doing only what they got that little nod how could they know it was a nod from God they had all these virtues in here all these brother R calls them qualifications now if it's a qualification it's a requirement all right if it's a qualification it's a requirement you you are you have a requirement to what we were talking about the twins back there getting ready to turn 16 years old wow yeah you ain't kidding well well it's a qualification that they that they take driver's training that they take a year of of U of what you call um you got to have somebody in the car with you you know uh got to have training wheels on their car and all that stuff but then it come but you got to do that before you get your regular license it's a qualification that they go through the Learners permit part all right same way with God there's it's required that we go through a learner's permit part God doesn't mind if you're a baby he doesn't mind it at all he Minds if 20 years later you're still a baby the first little nod from God compared with every bit of this and with his word they know it was the word of God and the way they went didn't have to worry about nothing else when God spoke they went you know why because they were taught by the word of God so now that we see if the son of man Ministry is back in power now in us then we're being taught by the word of God the same word of God that the 12 or 11 disciples were trained up by the Lord Jesus that's why that Ministry had to come back that's why brother brandom had to be the end time Prophet the one to bring everything back together again everybody with me those of you that are awake it's hot in here that's for sure Revelation 6 verse1 says I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard it with the noise of Thunder one of the four Beast saying come and see now what is the voice of Thunder brother rown said that was the voice of God when the seal breaks so when something breaks forth what happens something happens there's a reaction one of the four beasts said come and see now what was that four what was that Beast it was a lion it was a power you can see where I got it on the on the screen not lying lion l o n that was a lion pile which was what it was the true righteous Church listen there had to be a true righteous church for there to be a false one Satan cannot create Satan cannot make the first church right I looked up that word yesterday first church that's about hund and something quotes where brother R talks about the First Church Catholic Church says they're the first church brother Ram agreed with them he said if You' have stayed like the first church you could have been the first church but the first church was the disciples Silver and Gold Have I None Paul all doing the things he did and all the different things in the book of Acts then what happened is brother R said they got away from that first church we'll read it here in just a few minutes you've lost your first love so have we lost our first love think about it and I saw him Behold a white horse boy it looks good he's not dirty he's not muddy he's white and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and Conquer now that word white means what it means light Satan is what Satan has become what a messenger of light he has become light that is the most Darkness there is he has become the light of this world not our world this world cuz everything is illuminated by the devil he wants you to go to the biggest shows he wants to put the most football games on he wants you to party the most he wants to have all the glitter and all the glamour 5G now four whatever HD everything what more plain so that you can see every detail well thank God we got a message that's more than 4D it's give us back from the foundation of the world all the way to the Future home and it GI it to us in Vivid color I can almost see the lights of that City I can almost see that I see them gathering around the what great white throne but look brilliance looks kind of nice if you just took that scripture and said oh well that's that's that's that's the mighty conqueror he's going forth conquering in to conquer well brother R didn't read that one little part right there that says he had a bow but no arrows he said therefore he was a bluff he had a bow and no arrows he was on a white horse now brother BR knew that that lion power l o n power was in that first church age and it was a white righteous Church they didn't have the denominations they didn't have all the different things all the Scruples now it got started that right but then there was Scruples involved but you see this scenario and you think man this is great that's the same thing that you say why are you doing this because look you can take every one of these and you can claim to have them all and pretend you have some of them what brother M talking about the peacock the black bird with the peacock feathers he said you can stick the feathers in the in the crow but it's still a crow so they're going to what they're going to interpret or or ride their White Horse brother Brown says riding all the way into eternity that why horse is still riding today those people think they're right they have the white righteous Church in their eyes everybody with me used of white garments as the sign of innocence and purity of soul boy Satan would love for you to look at him as being innocent wouldn't he that's what the deceiver is he wants you to think that but there is a group of people that's going to put on white robes and they're going to ride white horses and it's going to be us all right but this conquering was what Conquering the leoty or what they overcame the first church age all that first three Church ages Satan got in the church he didn't get in the world he got got in the church me and you and he prevailed he conquered but there's a group of people that he couldn't conquer Revelations 2 ver4 says nevertheless I have somewhat against thee because thou Hast left thy First Love remember therefore from whence Thou Art fallen and repent and do the first Works listen that may have come out from the churchur first church age but that's in this age cuz we had to go back we lost our first love we had to go back to the first church age before they lost their first love come on somebody remember therefore from when you're fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and will judge you that's what that means I'm going to pull your Candlestick out except thou repent but this thou Hast that thou hatest the Deeds of the nicadan there's a little bit of Light which I also hate he that hath a near let him hear what the spirit sayth to the churches look to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life now who's the Tree of Life Jesus Christ which is in the midst of the paradise of God listen there was a false power that came in but there's a true power this here there was a true power even in the first church age but what happened was Satan said hey this is the way to do it I'm going to make mine louder I'm going to make mine all white I'm going to make it a Purple Rope I'm going to make it a Vatican I'm going to put diamonds in it I'm going to put jewelry in it I'm going to I'm going to actually I'm going to take from the poor and give to the rich I was reading a quote just now brother Brown said no it was here remember here when he said he was over in Mexico he said little Pedro will go take his little two pences and put it on a million dooll altar that's what the Catholic Church did they stole from those people and gave them nothing in return right zero but now not me and you but see that was that false power now a devout Catholic will tell you the pope is God or Jesus Christ or instead of right exactly and he's infallible yeah if he says something contrary to the Bible you take what the Pope says now is that not deception that is a false power that's covering this whole world this whole world's going to be deceived folks if your name's not written Revelations 138 all all on the earth will be deceived except you have your name written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world you're going to be deceived if you're not bride and bride really is going to be deceived up right up to the last moment sorry he said it would deceive the very elect if it were possible all right let me read this and then we'll close y'all ain't getting a thing cuz y all asleep let me read this real quick pinch yourself just a minute now the mystery of the book now the mystery of the book look are revealed when the seals are broke the reason I'm going to talk let me read this whole thing and it's going to fit with what we're talking about and when the seals completely are broken hold on now when the seals are completely broken the time of redemption is over now look the time of redemption is not over now cuz the seals had been all totally broke oh yeah they're open but are they open to you are they broke to other people are they broke to other brothers that need to have it broke to them amen cuz look when that last name comes in when that seal when you come to that Sixth Seal and the Seven seal comes on the earth which is Christ in you and me redemption's over there's nobody else going to be saved and I pray that that's not happen cuz I got kids out there I've got Ken Folk out there I've got friends out there that need to come in get in this Ark before God shuts the door and you do too so you better pray for them pray Redemption is not over I know it's not cuz I keep I still need it so when they're completely broke the time of redemption is over because the lamb lamb left the intercession post he's talking about Revelations 5 in symbol to walk out to take his claims now what is his claims a redeemed Church he's not claiming the world or the Earth or he created it it's his he actually give it to us but he's coming to claim that group of people because the lamb left the intercession post to walk out to take his claims he was a mediator between that he was a mediator but when the real Revelation happens on the seals as they begin to break the lamb is coming forth from the sanctuary now there's no way he can come forth from the sanctuary and get into a group of people until we have these virtues working in our life we can't just jump from Rong one all the way up to number seven we got to go through a process and that's our process it's according to the word we read it last night talking about Revelations 5 out of the midst and took the book so he's no more mediator because they even they called him a lion that's the king he's not a mediator then now watch this he's bringing in a word here I want to bring in although the ACT of these seals began at the first church age all right now remember we'll get the background of it thoroughly if we can or as thoroughly as possible the actors I'll place it like that because an actor is a man who changes his mask all right and in this act tonight he we're going to see that it's Satan changing his mask now watch hold on a minute he changes it right here and all actors dot dot dot he he pauses Christ acting the part as he did when he became from a spirit to a man he acted the part of death right now think about this hold on a minute it'll give you it'll help you with this cuz you say well why you talking about an actor somebody's acting up no be careful listen to what brother Brown's saying he's saying the same guy is just changing his mask he's not changing his person he's changing his mask he's changing his form everybody with me he's God I'm God and I change not but for one moment in time he changed himself two time put on a mask which is this put on a flesh mask and what redeemed us became from Spirit to man look he only put on an actor's garment human flesh and came down in the form of a man what in order to Be Our Redeemer and he brought every one of these virtues with him when he came on earth now now you see it's only an actor's form that's the reason they are all in Parables and symbols the way that they are here like beasts and animals so forth is in an act and these actors begin in the first church age both sets Jesus Christ was in the first church he become what he become from what savior to bride the bride put on that same mask he said go to Jerusalem he prayed in John 17 that they would be one like we're one he put us all back together he just took that mask and said I'm going to be a bride now for seven Church a cuz what did he do remember what John when he was on the aisle of patmas he said I heard the voice I turned and looked and what he saw what son of man son of man with his mask on but he was in feminist form because he was what G about the PS or breast so he's in the feminist form but John knew who he was these actors begin in the first church age so the look and I'm listen there's a difference in being an actor and acting right all right so be careful we can act these virtues but if we are the right actor if we're the bride if we're Jesus Christ now veiled behind that Veil then these virtues watch right here I'll read it right here because it was Christ revealing himself to may I say the bride that says seven Church ages but that's the bride revealing himself now wait a minute brother brandham take you for a minute we'll be done in just a second wait a minute he's talking about revealing himself to the seven Church ages but hiding behind a mask hiding behind me and you hiding behind us now you understand it all right no they probably didn't but he wanted to what reveal himself to the churches or to the bride or as the bride but now we come down to the church age and we'll keep reading we we'll go to the next not today but when you get to the end it's the requirement that you and I what become him she is him all right hold on a minute see look Christ revealing himself to the seven Church agents in other words he put the mask on to the world you and I today are an absolute mystery to this world right cuz we don't act like the world we don't look like the world we've got on what that robe that mask of Christ we've got on that actors but we know who we are behind that brother Brown when he went and watched that play he said one man played many different parts he played Hamlet he played who was it Julie no Romeo and Juliet he played several parts same man the same man has played every part for seven Church ages and had a characteristic in every Church age read Revelations 1 through3 but when you come to the end time there's one person he says I in Revelations what 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God not an actor the beginning of the creation of God the son of man back again inh human flesh in me and you hid to the world but we know who we are behind that that's right listen all the people that are associated with us they know who's behind that mask cuz there's a revelation because you know what one day he's going to do he's going to pull that mask off come on somebody she is him then he's going to be standing on the earth in her and the whole world is going to know it just for a moment at a time right they're going to know who we are cuz we're going to be a Powerhouse I'll read it to you in just a minute look then at the end of the church age the seventh Angel's message now what he's identifying coming up to this actor all right is to pick up those lost Mysteries and give it to the church now we'll notice that but look but the not then revealed in their true State because if it would been revealed in the true State the first church age would have took Rapture everybody with me just for a minute the first church age would have took a Rapture that's right but it couldn't happen that way it had to come through seven Church ages or seven What actors of God but God knows who he is all the whole time and we do now cuz we look back and that's why brother Bar says I don't call you church anymore I call you bride cuz there was a church that got behind a mask too cuz old Satan buddy he's right there too he put on his mask and said I'm a white righteous church but I'm going to make you pay I'm going to kill you I'm going to make you disbelieve the word of God I'm going to make you under the guise of a crusade I'm going to make you either take me or I'm going to kill you 68 million people give their life because of that actor called the devil all right but look not then revealed in their true State now not that it's false but remember Revelations 3:14 says what the faithful and true witness not that he was once false but you get a true ring if you ever had one of those things that you that you um um the guy comes up here and you know and he Tunes the he Tunes it with a tuning fork that's a true C or D Brother D you know it's a true whatever he's got if he hits it and it goes see then he adjust whatever that is in there they're strings right same thing with the next one he'll do and it'll be the it'll be the sound of f well that's what's happening now it's being being revealed in his true state it was open partially in the first church age because there was a white righteous Church went riding out but they didn't know what to do totally you and I now what do we do we look back and see every bit of it we have no excuse the seals have been opened so we can look all the way back and see how that that first church AE started the second Church AE the Third Church a and even know the characteristic by the person that brother brandham said this one was Paul this one's aridus that one's Martin this one's Columba this one's Luther this one's Wesley and this one was him all right now watch just for a second now in the Bible times the Mysteries were there so remember brother B didn't bring us a new Bible the Mysteries were already there and they seen these things happen the way John saw it here now he said there's a white horse John saw a white horse right right off right all right and everybody in the world believed that that was the Lord Jesus and that was the Holy Ghost it was the devil John was only commissioned to write what he saw but the symbol that he saw took a prophet to break it down for us he's got a bow but he don't have any arrows he must be a bluff well now if he's a bluff then that everything else you know is the devil when that first seal broke he knew then that second seal was not God he and the R horse and then the black horse he knew each one of these symbols from the very first one that opened what are you saying brother way if we don't have virtue we'll never get to the next step we got to have virtue flowing through us where we're a virtuous Church a virtuous person listen to this there's a white horse rider but what the mystery of it is there's a mystery that goes with that Rider there's a mystery that goes with these virtues it's not living a virgin life yet that's good it's having power over the devil is having power over this world is having power over false Doctrine having power over somebody trying to change your idea of what's going on trying to make you believe the brother rown wasn't a prophet trying to get you to believe that you can sit home and listen to tapes and and make it I doubt that very seriously but what we talking about by Way full Redemption so who are we redeeming we're redeeming this white righteous beautiful bride that's wearing white that's in Revelations 19 that says his wife has made herself ready and then they come down start riding on white horses much different than Revelation 6 that's a Tripper uper brother R says that's the devil this is the true God with his bride listen Proverbs 31 10 I want you to listen to this I want you to listen and know that we are we are come off of a human tree we are born in sin shapen in iniquity all right is everybody with me we ought to know that in this church okay so let's don't put oursel above anybody else let God put us up there everybody with me let God put us up there let him give us a position if we take our own position we're in trouble That's what Satan did right he took his own position if he' stayed in his own if he' stayed in position God give him he'd been fine right he said but iniquity was found in you buddy you want to be me and you can't be me CU I'm the Creator and you're not proverbs 31 now watch this who wrote the Book of Proverbs Solomon who was his mother his mother was the girl that David defiled took her before she was and then made his greatest General In the Heat of the battle put him right in the middle of it and said withdraw I want him dead and you know for basba and her husband to be that close to the Palace he had to be because remember he was a gentile so was she H right he was a hittite right he wasn't a Jew but to be that close to the castle for David to look down and and see her on the top of the roof and she wasn't up there to show him off she wasn't up there seductively she didn't have nothing she didn't have a clue what was going on cuz remember God didn't blame bash Sheba for anything he blamed David everybody with me but for Solomon to say who can find a virtuous woman for her price is far above rubies knowing that he that his mother was defiled by King David and then he married her and then Solomon came now watch Proverbs 12:4 a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband but she that maketh ashamed is rotness and his bones you would you would say okay let's take Rahab and she's she was rotting to to what was his name URI U the hitte no she was a virtuous woman David's the one that had a problem like I said before sometimes we look at these things and we think man it's all bash sheba's fault no it's David's fault David committed adultery he asserted himself as king King over basba and he took her probably against her will but he was the king and you refuse the king guess what you die she knew that and God didn't send Nathan to baseba he didn't come to curse us he didn't do that he cursed David remember the story yes Nathan said there was this man that had thousand sheep and he had this visitor coming in and he had one little guy that had a little U lamb a woman 's are women right girls had this little U lamb and only had one and that man takes that one lamb and kills it for his visitor I'm sure David stood up and he took that Seer and he banged it on the on the pull pit hello somebody he banged it on the pull pit and said the man ought to die kill that person bring him here and I'll chop his head off Nathan looked at him and said David you're the man but he said one thing that saved David's life he said but David I prayed for you he had a prophet we had a Prophet come in tell us the same thing right told us the exact same story in his sermon it was in the exact same story it was not bash sheba's fault it was David's fault sometimes we look at things a little bit different cuz David was a murderer premeditated if he had had to go to court they would have took his life he premeditated that murder he didn't murder him out of anger or out of out of passion he knew what he was doing he calculated exactly when Uriah was going to battle and he said all right put him in the Heat and withdraw yourself whoever was joab or somebody joab remembered that cuz later on in the scriptures he tells David he said I've done I've done done this for you one time I don't think I'm going to do it again but you see you understand what the devil does though the devil makes everything look so it's always the woman's fault but why does God use these women why did God why did now God used one virgin girl to produce his body but all these other people look at this right here Rahab she was a prostitute she was a gentile she was me and you brother Brown said a type of the believer that believed without seeing but she marries salmon not Salon she marries salmon which is an Israeli General after they destroyed the city of Jericho he says who are you she says well I'm Rahab she didn't say Harlot she said I'm Rahab cuz remember everybody in the city died so her accusers were dead all those men she had been with they're all gone boy talk about Grace but now remember it really did happen she was a prostitute come on somebody are you not getting this she was a prostitute but by being obedient to the word of God and hanging that red rope she saved herself and her family but she was still a prostitute but salmon said hey you're beautiful I love you let's get married and guess who came out of that Boaz type of Christ comes out of a prostitute and an Israeli gener en God's got a little sense of humor doesn't he but that types me and you that's where we came from now look Ruth now you got Boaz marrying Ruth and here comes OED well now Ruth was not a virgin when she married her husband was dead but she wasn't a true virgin when Boaz married her Boaz knew that David took basba and there's Solomon that whole line looked like it was messed up in our eyes but in God's eyes that's the way he wanted it that's the way he wanted all this to come that's the way he wanted us to come up this statue of a perfect man he used all of our imperfections and all of our junk and all of our inadequacies he used every bit of that to make us a virtuous woman after we get born again listen to this right here you to listen to this I'm going to skip through that in adoption series I pulled this up just a few minutes ago listen to this we'll close right here predestination looks back to forign knowledge I mean election election looks back to for knowledge now what is election election is what voting all right as brother Brown says and I've always said you got one vote on your side God's got one vote on his I mean the devil's got one vote on his side God's got one vote on this side you're the vote swinger you going to either vote for the devil's side it be two to one or vice versa all right everybody with me so you still have something to do with even election so somebody people preach election and predestination like you didn't have a choice all I see nothing but Choice election is what you're going to vote you're going to swing the vote one way or the other election looks what back to forign knowledge and predestination looks to Destiny all right for knowledge knows what your destiny is you don't now watch don't forget that election looks back here look everybody says you want to be born with this certain thing in you and listen to this I was a cuckle bear I was born in sin shapen in iniquity come to the world speaking lies born amongst Sinners father and mother and all my whole family Sinners that was probably rough for a prophet to say but he was honest I was a cuer but all of a sudden I became a wheat germ or wheat grain how did it happen that's what it is folks election God before the foundation of the world elected that the cuar was to become a grain of wheat he knew what you would accept now I know I'm a grain of wheat because I'm saved how do I do it look back and see that his predestinated that he predestinated it long time ago by for knowledge he seen that I would love him by for knowledge he saw that I would love him and therefore had it ready for me when I wanted it all right so he what he made a pretu through his own son that through him I might become from a cuckle bur to a grain of wheat how do you change a cuckle bur to a grain of wheat you take the life of the cuckle bar out and you put the grain of wheat in you may still look like a cabar but if you get planted and you got wheat germ life in you you're going to bring a wheat plant up everybody with me say Amen now where am I at now I'm saved I'm walking in the grace of God I'm Rahab but I've been taken by a general he took on my shame in my sin I'm walking in the grace of God what does predestination look to Destiny where will he take me to and where am I going that's got you there you are it's invisible Union let's stand our feet musicians come on he the bridegroom took away your shame and put it in the sea of forgetfulness by the washing of the water of the word and the blood of life that's what the Bible said your first husband that you were married to the world the anointed bridegroom which for ordained you goes back to what I told you just second to go for ordained you has washed you by the washing of the Water by the church congregation says no that don't sound right does it no you might find that in Alman night but not in God's Bible by the washing of the Water by the word in the word by the you are standing completely Justified as though you never did it at the beginning this is my message to the church now as you we go off the air just in a minute this was Thanksgiving message you are standing if you're standing standing on God's word and with God's word every amen every jot every ttle what every amen every jot every ttle all right everything lined up right where you standing I'm trying to tell you pull away from them Shucks get out here in the wheat other words quit listening to your past I hear the coming of the combine you get right before the sun I hear the coming of the combine you're standing complete Justified like you never did it in the first place Hallelujah talk about a Thanksgiving I feel real good I'm more thankful for that than anything I know of me too turkey and dressing will not cover that you are the pure virtuous boy how' you how'd that happen I thought I just said we were a bunch of prostitutes according to the word of God we got his life in us and we're walking up that statue of perfect man with his life in US portraying and projecting this pure virtuous sinless Bride of the son of the Living God every man and woman that's born of the spirit of God and washed in the blood of Jesus Christ and believes every word of God stands as though you never sinned at the first place you are perfect the blood of Jesus Christ Revelations 19:7 said let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife hath made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of you am I can can I say that are you not a saint you should be you're either a saint or a ha is what brother Brown said for the fine linen is the righteousness of you now who wants to accept that we've got to be able to accept that we got to be able to accept that Rahab listen Rahab in all that she was she knew she was was a prostitute to begin with she could not take that out of her mind but somewhere down the line there had to be a transforming power of God to transfer her into not being a prostitute no more cuz listen there wasn't a new birth back then there wasn't a new birth to change her there had to be something come upon her I believe her husband had a lot to do with it this Israeli General that knew the Jehovah knew God knew the ways of of of the Jews and and the promises of God he started telling them to her hey I know you're a gentile but I've took you for mine in other words I've took your shame and now what Jesus did for us I'm going to take your shame I know you've been a prostitute but I'm going to take your shame on me and guess what we're going to live happily ever after we're going to have a Boaz and that Boaz is going to have a OED and that OED is going to have a Jesse that Jesse is going to have a David and that David's going to have a Solomon and that Solomon is going to have on Down the Line till we come to Jesus Christ actually till we come to Joseph that line that we look like we would never Brother Gary we'd never draw that picture too much prostitution going on in that too much too much world too much too much filth as the world would see what do God see all salmon saw was when he looked down through there and saw everything destroyed except one little stick of a building standing up with a red Scarlet rope he said is that where you live she said yeah that's where I live she said he said oh you must be Rahab we heard about you you helped our spies you're sure pretty what you do for a living he knows all our faults and failures he knows what we did but he's come though to give us look if you can believe what the word says that you've become The Virtuous sinless pride of Jesus Christ you got to overcome all that you got to overcome all that Rahab business all that all that basba business all that uh woman at the well business looks like she was just not even I mean who would have went and talked to her even the disciples was like why is he talking to her why is he over there remember he sent him in another direction to get them naysayers and doubters out of the way come on somebody so he could talk talk to her one onone and not have Peter going why is he doing that why is he doing this why is he doing that' then you got Judas going well he shouldn't be standing over there that close to her right so he got rid of all them he said hey y'all go buy food I got to go I needs go buy Samaria brother John there was a pull going on in a in another realm that nobody saw but Jesus and that woman she needed a savior and Buddy when they met she throw that pot down she ran back and I don't believe she went back to that number six guy I don't believe that I believe she said hey come see a man that's what she needed she needed number seven and she got him amen she got number seven which was the Lord Jesus and she didn't need anything else and she was what she's going to be counted as a bride she went to the upper room got the Holy Ghost she going to be counted as bride and you're going to go weren't you the no I don't remember what were you because we can't remember that part of our past remember same way Rahab we're going to meet Rahab we just going to know her as salon's wife that brought forth Boaz one of the greatest men in the Bible that actually typed in every way Jesus Christ Our kinsman redeemer he acted our Kinsman through Boaz that came from Rahab the Harlot What a Mighty God we serve What a Mighty God that can that can absolutely forget what we were amen we've just got to learn to do like he and forget that cuz what's hindering us us us and our past but I hope I want you to do this one this year I want us to fill it this year with so much good and so much positive I want us to fill it with so much of the word of God so much the love of God that all that Fades [Music] away Time Heals all wounds and it will if you'll let God be the center and just let him work and then all those former things will pass away the Bible tells us that you say oh that's over under well can't we start now can't we start now hold our head up high and say hey I'm bride I follow the message of the hour oh you follow that man no I follow the message of the hour which is not a man of Jesus Christ yeah it is a man of Jesus Christ that's who I follow and I follow what the Bible says I follow what the word of God says I am a man follower I guilty Jesus Christ is who I follow and he came to me through a little Prophet called William brandham and he brought a word to a five-fold Ministry that now we can learn that we are started as Rahab but we're going to end up the ver virtuous sinless prde of Jesus Christ by the opening of the word no other way you're not going to get it by your neighbor telling you you're not going to get it by somebody telling you on the radio come on somebody you're going to get it from church you're going to get it from listening to somebody telling you who you are that's why you need a five-fold Ministry to tell you who you are
