to see everybody in the house of the lord we appreciate god for an easter time and if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn to ephesians 1 and galatians 4. ephesians 1 galatians 4. uh remember wade is out in arizona preaching for brother long uh this weekend and they'll be flying back in tuesday so remember that and remember that a lot of people are traveling for this time of the year and everything like that part of our families is down in florida and they're going this way and that going that away and then part of our church family is going this way not a way so just just have a good safe time in the lord and appreciate him because we do appreciate him for all that he has given us and been able to do okay remember this afternoon lord willing brother bob will be ministering the message for us uh this afternoon then this coming wednesday uh brother louise he's back there somewhere he's going okay as long as he's going to be here okay all right brother louise we'll be taking this coming wednesday and then we have just was trying to get scheduled and and going through the time let's see uh remember uh richard and anna and them are in florida and lisa and the kids and some of the others i heard the announcements there of the ones traveling so just pray the lord would would give everybody a safe journey let everything be all right okay let's see any other announcements uh i guess that's about it father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us thank you for our great opportunity to be able to stand and say he is risen because i know within our heart that it's not just he has and some thought or idea that we talk about some place in time or history or something that we speak about but it's a personal experience within our own very hearts and lives that you're living inside of each one of us and that's a wonderful thing when you sent a message back to the disciples it says tell them he is risen you knew what you were going to do and what was going to take place and you were right there with them and you've been here with us all of these years all of these for 2 000 years preaching a message on the resurrected lord jesus christ now we're coming down to the end time to see it and to realize that lord all of these things are taking place in the last days is the signs and the wonders and the things that are supposed to be here to see you manifest yourself among us and we ask you to just bless each one open the eyes of our understanding to thy word as we speak this morning and have your way in jesus name amen we've been on ephesians for a while we're trying to pick up the thoughts of predestination made plain and i don't know how much more we're going to continue our thoughts but we just keep picking up the scriptures and going on with it so we go to ephesians 1 and verse 3. blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted into beloved in whom you have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence having made known unto us the mystery of his will what is the mystery of his will now to adopt us what is his will his will is his word so his word is going to tell us all about these things if we'll study it and keep going with it all right having made known unto us the mystery of his will or according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him and whom also now what in whom also we have obtained an inheritance all right see there had to be a death burial resurrection and thing to have an inheritance we had no inheritance whatsoever as gentiles there's nothing that was in the word promised even the scripture says that adoption was pertaining to israel we didn't have no promises we didn't have no inheritance but he came to bring the inheritance to us to where that we could have eternal life all right having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purpose in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together and want all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will that we should be to that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ all right go to galatians 4 and we'll start verse 1. and i say that the heir as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all now that's that's a marvelous scripture right think about what it's saying that the air this person you know the children as long as he's a child he differs nothing from a servant though he be lord of all something's got to take place right but it's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because you are sons god hath sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts cry crying abby father wherefore thou are no more a servant but a son and if a son then an heir of god through christ i got written in my part here the christ the christ because when you see anything in the scripture and it says thee before emphasize that and think on it the the the christ because that's what we're talking about father we thank you we ask you just now bless us together in your love in jesus name amen you may be seated i've always noticed that throughout the scriptures that when you when you find that thee it's simple it's emphasizing something very important at that part so that's where we're going to see our inheritance and how it comes to us all right but think about it now what have we been talking about i don't want to spend too much time on it but we you know we we do the best we can of trying to to express uh what we see about the message and then move on into other things but we've been talking about how that your predestination is made plain throughout the scriptures and all because that was what it was doing predestination was a great thought a great understanding to the apostle paul it might not have had much emphasis and i don't mean that they didn't think that much of it but say the apostles a lot of them didn't have understanding paul picked up these things and began to bring them you know to through the ephesians to the galatians to the romans uh each one bringing forth an understanding of what the scripture is talking about all right what's it talking about adoption is a marvelous thing to think of and we should keep it in our thoughts and i won't spend with just a second but in the bible times you had what was called the adoption and a man would have a child born into the family and that child would be a child all right but now as long as that child remained as we read here from galatians long as he remained just a child he never got his inheritance right he would only have the earnest but now remember the earnest of your salvation is the baptism of the holy ghost is that true now the earnest of your inheritance is the baptism of the holy ghost so don't degrade that point or think there's something wrong with it when we make a statement like and say that here comes the great apostles but yet paul is the greatest of all of them to bring the word you know for those the days and the biggest portion of the writing of the bible was to the apostle paul all right and he spoke of the earnest of our inheritance he spoke of predestination he spoke of those things uh you know that we we needed those tutors and governors and things to be able to raise us and bring us to the right place and and to be able to see what christ is trying to reveal to you and i but it's marvelous to understand the word and think about it see and i'm saying it now with the best love that i can uh without throwing off on anybody but i remember when we were back in the baptist and et cetera we talked about adoption we talked about inheritances we talked about uh the things of the bible and sure we had a an understanding to a degree of things that was going to take place and like brother brown says you you better leave them baptist alone because they they're they get settled in that word well see that's where he said now like if baptist said he'd know who it was he'd know his father and he'd know how much inheritance he had but yet he wasn't able to bring it on forth your pentecostals they could see what they was to a degree and bring it up to a degree and bring it into the new birth right around and said they come to the new birth but said they that's where they messed up they stopped and they said well uh you know we we've got what we have we've got this we're greater than the baptist they're over the artist they're just reading the word they're just reading the word you know and the letter of the word and we've got the glory and the shoutings and the and the things and all like that and the prophet said they cabbage down on that in other words they stopped when they come into the new birth well we can't afford to stop and the prophets was was trying to explain to the pentecostals he preached message after message directed it and exactly to the pentecostals because like i said now that i'm not throwing off with the baptist methodists and things like that they couldn't talk about the baptism of the holy ghost they would talk about it as just believing and just stuff like well that was good all of that and there's a lot of salvation there but still your pentecostals picked it up in the new birth and begin to express it but yet they couldn't understand well here comes the prophet picking it up bringing the scriptures and showing how that that child born into the family it's a child of god you get the baptism of the holy ghost you have eternal life in your soul you have eternal life all right you get justification sanctification that might just be an earnest of your inheritance until a time would come but when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost see then it becomes the new birth within you and that was why the zeus street was such a marvelous situation to bring it forth that the people understood that new birth was the power of god the moving of god the gifts and the signs and the wonders and all that was wonderful well yet they stopped why because at that time then look what i'm saying follow me see under luther wesley et cetera justification sanctification that would be an earnest of the inheritance all right an earnest of it part payment all right then when the baptism of the holy ghost came to azusa street and they cabbage down on it it became an earnest to them the baptism of the holy ghost became an earnest to the pentecostal people because it was the baptism of the holy ghost it was the new birth but yet it wasn't all because there was more to come peter would say a a child sincere miracle you know desiring the sincere milk of the word that you may grow there by those apostles like peter paul and him they knew greater understanding peter preached the stature of a perfect man see why that paul never picked that up i don't understand but it's the same thing the statue of a perfect man with peter bringing it add to your faith virtue knowledge temperature it's the new birth and then growing up in the grace and knowledge and coming out to to the tudor being the holy ghost and it's the same message but paul would preach it as one way and peter another but not a different meaning now it was the same message brought in different ways and paul and peter never never differed in doctrine sure they might have had problems but they didn't differ and doctrine your prophet said why because the baptism of the holy ghost starts your new birth at faith and just starts it well that is my new birth i got the new birth when i was born again amen but you know what it was a child one day he was born from your mother and come forth into the world but what if you just stop right there what if you just stopped at that situation no see then what you have today i've always tried to say this in the right way listen what you have today is marvelous if you believe it and accept it and want it present tense because see if it is then tomorrow hasn't got here yet but when tomorrow comes what you had today is just in earnest do you understand that it's just an earnest what you had what you had you moved on to something else something more marvelous to an understanding of god's word and that way you can see that peter and pauline was preaching the same thing paul preached it peter preached it as the virtues and things you know statue of perfect man paul preached it as the tutor the governors and the things and all like that and teached it as an adoption message and it's the same message but it's a growth development of the same message as it just continues on growing greater and greater and see then here comes the prophet with the message to the zeus street people not that he was a uh you know a pentecostal anything like that i'm just saying it to the weight he comes to bring the message there and then go on because see they stopped oh we've got it what do you mean brother branham we need this we know we've got the gifts we've got the signs we've got the wonders and they had it right that's right big man stood right here one day and said then pentecostal said they didn't have nothing well i told him before then that they did of course that didn't change him because you see he was he was the top guy you know and i was a peanut you know trying to talk to him but it was true what i said because the baptism of the holy ghost is your new birth but in relationship to what we're going out of here it's only an earnest see we've got to go somebody has got to go to a change of the body and that is involved in adoption the change of these bodies is involved into that adoption and the stature of perfect man brings a person individual up through there growing in grace and knowledge which is the holy ghost being the tutors and governors that would teach us those things well look at what i'm talking about see you you've got the apostle paul bringing a great message but he wasn't the only one that brought a great message peter brought a great message he brought the same message in just a different turn or way or thought or whatever a concept or that you could understand it because see to take what peter's doing without the rest of the word you would know about the governors and tutors and the things that would start you would know the adoption because peter didn't cover adoption in the wording of adoption you know in other words he didn't call it that he would call it growing in grace and knowledge i mean he would call it sincere milk of the word that we may grow there by see they had each one had a different way of expressing their thought but it was the same thought it's the same point of doing and having it coming to predestination what destiny determined beforehand well all right peter just tells you how to climb that pyramid see then it's not to just say one is greater than the other but yet they are cause look at it then i don't mind putting it this way see then when the prophet came in the last days he brought it to the apex the heights the growth development the thing to tell us about these things we wouldn't have known about peter and the statue of perfect man had the prophet not preached it he goes back there in it read it statue of a perfect man he said i've been preaching on this for 30-something years 30-something years he'd been preaching on the stature of a perfect man right to try to get the people to see what god is expecting out of you and me and it's not hard because that's what i say when you look at something and you think it's a hard thing well just keep studying because you may run into it like i said you read in paul and he talks of governors and tutors and things well we don't know nothing about governors and tutors because we're not the old testament people we're not english people like that or the start of it we're not the ones that begun the adoptions and things we're the gentiles which is grafted in and and no right of inheritance whatsoever for me and you as gentiles we didn't have anything it was to the jews well see then here comes peter to bring the message who'd he bring the message to isn't it odd the way it happened peter brought the message to the gentiles come on peter went and brought the message to the gentiles but he couldn't get them to see totally what it was all about maybe just using words so paul picks it up and he calls it adoption he calls it growing you know bringing it to that position of adoption all right then now we have to go back and see we've studied those things like i said we could read in the baptist we could read about adoption i read about it and could could tell you about it before i come into the message part of the adoption that to to understand i didn't know that it was connected totally into the redemption of the body because that was just a little bit part that was withholding from us but we did house some things each church age has had a word to bring forth each church age each group of people has a predestination because what is it what comes predestinated from god the word or seed the seed the word comes predestinated eternally in other words it's bound to how it's going to happen it has to happen it is going to take place and it will because that's what god said all right see we we study the bible and a lot of times we we we baptized all of the things that we've read in the scriptures and then here comes the prophet going right back to that word and taking you and i through all of these great uh avenues of adoption and all of those years there especially from the say the mid-40s or on up maybe to close to 50 you'll hear him when he when we first started getting the the tapes and different things he starts talking about adoption and then he lays in something that is beautiful and marvelous he picks up malachi 4. sure he understood paul and peter and all of them understood those things and began to preach about him all right about the gifts and the different things but then he began to talk about malachi 4. that something was to take place what the message was to come to tie together all the loose ends all right so you had loose ends in your your adoptions you had loose ends in your statue of a perfect man what i mean by that is you had it to the point that the the people couldn't understand it they could understand the natural story that's what i said we understood the natural story we taught the adoption anybody can just say adoption you can get in there and just start reading the scriptures you'll find the scripture immediately said the adoption is not to the gentiles it's to the jews then you can go into peter and you know with bringing it then you can go in with paul bringing it and you just you just keep going on and on and on once you get the key well see the prophet had to bring the key see he brought the key but see the people no i'm i know people think i'm hard but i also remember not only what we taught in the baptist i remember the early part of this coming into this end time message like i told you one brother said one time he said that statue of a perfect man is deep i said that that uh adoption said that's just very simple it's the same thing it's the same point it's the same uh point to get to it's the same thing to talk about but see to him he could see it one way all right that's that's baptist i'm throwing that putting the point that's that we could see adoption we could see that there had to be this it had to be that and we could talk about what happened in adoption and really if you'll go all the way back in your adoption you'll find out that you're romans and a lot of them was picking up on adoption and they wasn't even born again christians not even talking about that they they had the the things in their their own languages and ways that they were teaching adoption because what was adoption when the child that is born into the family he is a child at birth but he is not in full inheritance he just got the earnest of an inheritance even though he's born into the family and that's what paul in galatians reading is reading that and today with see paul is talking about these under governors and tutors he's an heir he's no different he's not no he ain't got no money he ain't got no death ain't got nothing that he's out there working with the rest of them no no you say well i see that's where you go wrong you say oh no them them kids they just babies they just you know they just no you're talking about i'm talking about when a kid become a child of a age it was put out there and given a tutor and when that child become the right age under that tutor he was adopted into the family the very family that he was born into and see that's the point of the of the peter james john all of them all of their teachings and that was to take that earnest new birth because every church age had a new mirror that's what i said to you over and over luther had the new birth wesley had the new birth they had a new birth of the age of the time they were there but it was eternal life in their soul but when it comes in comparison to what the next age is it becomes an earnest right luther had it it was running great but here comes wesley once wesley had brought the message of sanctification then what luther had would be just an earnest or talking about it or trying to show it then the same thing would happen to the pentecostals when they come in with the baptism of the holy ghost luther and wesley's message become an earnest yes but yet that earnest is the baptism of the holy ghost and that's what the prophet you you read all of the the quotes i've got for you here do whatever if you'll read it if you'll just get those messages on adoption they're wonderful to hear ye him's messages and things i used to read those and study those and just just enjoyed the things of what he was telling about it because he told it in a language that i could understand he said the holy ghost would come back some some and sometimes and have to say to the father said i made your son sick i've done this i've done that we said he's turned out acting just like you that's right but you know what if that child never did come up to act like the father he never was adopted into their family he stayed in the family he lived in the family he lived in the house he was in the big house you know he was up there with mom and daddy but yet he didn't have the authority the authority was what god wants to instill into his children and bring us to that position are you understanding see then as those things begin to take place a growth development is seen in the teachings of the of the disciples because that's what the scripture says what is it ephesians uh where it talks about he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelist some pastor for the perfecting of the science but you see here we come along we read brother branham i said we i'm talking about back in the 70s 60s and 70s people started talking a little bit you could mention adoption people just going haywire don't tell me i need anything i got the baptismal life i got everything when i believe he said yeah but that's just bad this doctrine but i got everything you can't tell me i ain't got everything i got all this like one brother said he said if you teach the statue of a perfect man like brother branham said you're going to turn the pyramid upside down so you see you'd try to put holy ghost down here for a birth and going up see destroying the message the prophet was bringing because they thought they knew so much about it you could mention those things and they just that's why i'm honest to say and not bragging nor complaining i just never was very popular because i'm sorry i just tried to be what i am i tried to teach what i believe the prophet said and tried from the from the best that i could in a in a line to to be a good brother in christ to try to help everybody and it just turned against him well that didn't hurt my feelings it hurt me to think about that people would not accept god's word that's what hurt that hurt to think about all the days hours like i said there are a minute ago when the prophet said in the statute of perfect man he said 30 something years to bring this how do you think he felt like waves somewhere somebody was the other day one of the ministers about how do you think he felt when it comes to the seals and he said now i want questions and answers on the seals he said now don't put it on anything else because we're this is what we're studying here said put it on the seals and have questions and answers he had one question fully relating to the seals another one close to it and the rest of them was women should they wear pantyhose or what else how about water baptism brother branham doesn't it say father son and holy ghost how do you think he felt you know if he was a school teacher and they put these kids in front of you and and you tried your best to get them to see what you're talking about and you looked there and they would just deal it out and you know they're not getting it that hurts don't because you've done all you can do that prophet not he would i'm sure he would go to bed at night crying because he knew they wouldn't get what he's talking about so he finally winds up on this what is the questions and answers read the letter the sixth seal he said it's gone from you and said there's no way for you to know it right now he said right around the coming of the lord but he said how do you think he felt did he preach all them years and what he was trying to bring the people couldn't see he said it's gone from you in other words it's not for you so what's happened god had to let 50 years pass and let most of the old ones you and me are in the class of old ones so don't think i'm throwing on anybody else i'm throwing it on me and you right we're in the class of the old ones now but look at the old ones that have died off of the message then how do you think i felt back there when i made that statement that the lord showed me that the biggest portion of people this message was going to die and go by the grave because they could not come to the statue of a perfect man or the faith that would be needed you think that made me feel good that makes my heart because i've spent 50 years trying to get you to see that 50 years trying to get you to see it but see what see the things that the prophet has brought us to see his message and what he's saying how would you like it that way but you see that's part of what we're supposed to be i have no problems i'm not down and out about it i rejoice in the fact of one thing i believe god has at least put the word here in this little building within your reach anyway i believe that and that don't make me big no nothing because it ain't never made nothing but when i tried my best to get you to see jesus christ what has it always been now anybody who wants to say this word they can do it what have i always taught you present tense i always taught you moses at the burning bush i am that i am that means ever present for eternity right so you see why did even just little things like i said when i started when it says there in the scripture in matthew you know he is risen not he has risen and some day will raise he is raised right now that's why i'm not down and out about the point or anything i'm trying my best to get us to go on to see who we are and what we're doing and to see why that paul would cover it like that that an error is an heir but yet if he don't come on to adoption and get into the adopted end of the family he stays that error that form you know that form until he dies but he never becomes into maturity he just remains a child but see at church i don't want to remind a child i want to i want to at least grow up enough to be able to say i believe the word but listen what have we been trying to say in this part predestination predestination made simple or plain we took the series before of of the baptism of the holy ghost the godhead and thing as to be simple and plain and brought out at declaring that i declared in 1969 in athens georgia declared that the baptism that the the church would the bride would be the baptist in the baptism of the holy ghost would be in the bride in the end time to be the fullness of the godhead bodily because that's what your prophet said i ain't had to change that i believe it i still believe it i'm still looking forward to that but i want you to see your part to bring out to you one of the things that that how many of you heard things out like this see the prophet said to the bride he said god is not complete without the bride turn on your internets and find me one one man out there it's making that statement no they ain't gonna make that statement about god like that because they think you're making too much out of the bride i'm not making enough out of the bride the bride and god are one husband and wife supposed to be one all right which you see predestination means a destiny is determined in what has been the life two or three messages i didn't even pick up any more notes and they just stayed with the same notes to try to get you to see because this is what i'm trying to get you to see in the bride of jesus christ there is a position will be reached by someone that will be the adoption in the form of the completion of adoption even to the fact of the body being redeemed amen somebody's going to do that somebody's going to stand here and say i'm redeemed you know what god's going to step on the scene and make it manifest but if we don't come to that what have i always tried to get you to see you know you can't be healed if you don't confess it because god can't override your free moral agency let me put it this way it ain't that he can't because that can't puts a big old word up there and you swallow it again he will not override your free moral agency let's put it that way he will not override it and heal you so what do you do you say buy his stripes i'm healed now he can step on the scene and make that manifest he cannot save you or won't save you if you don't confess because that's what paul is saying in the scripture well with the mouth which one one of them said it in the script but with the mouth the confession is made you know and with the heart you believe all right and see trying to get you to see that the adoption shows that we are the only people we the end time bride is the only people that will ever come to the position to where that they could walk off of this earth in a rapture lutheran wesleyan pentecost and all sure all of those ages had the baptism of the holy ghost for their age and time they had the new birth they had eternal life they will be there in the resurrection and things like that but they they you can't just say you know now i'll be there no it's going to take something to walk off of this earth the prophet said it what'd they say when the bride begins to say i and my father are one and these other things he said to shuck will pull away well he said well we we've heard that brother dale we've said that for years it's never been said from the heart because if it's said from the heart it'll work salvation like i'm saying you can't be healed until you're confessing but when you're confessing you're confessing from the heart not confessing from the mouth the new birth is not for you to confess with your mouth and just believe it from your heart it's for you to confess your from your mouth what is revealed in your heart what is alive in you then you can say i and my father won he said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for well i don't see nobody but then what are you doing if you're grown up enough that you can't see it i mean you you know if you if you're up enough in god to where you can't see nothing happening then you must be above the rest of us so come on i'll give you the pulpit because i want to get out of here i don't want to have to go by the grave i'm 80 years old be 81 in just a few days but see i want to get out of here i'm not afraid of what's going on out here yeah i don't i don't have any fear whatsoever about what satan can do because i know he can't do nothing that god won't allow him well i just don't see it well open your eyes i've tried to explain it do you understand what i just said if you can say you can't see it then you must be above those that are trying their best to at least be a little bit right so quit hollering and complaining about everybody else and start manifesting it yourself it's not to just say well we just don't know i've been down too long with that i stood back there in the 70s when these things was going on and tried my best to help people to see the word of god i've been preaching brother moat preach the statue of perfect man 1971. we ain't been playing around we've been talking about the word of god we've got the tapes to prove it we preached on the 70 weeks of daniel when everybody else was so scared they wouldn't even pick a book up they wouldn't even read the book we went to a minister's meeting on the daniel 70 weeks a minister's meeting on the daniel 70 weeks that they called invited us to come me and wade went and some of these others went because we had to hook it up to get an internet system but you know there was probably 30 there i'm just given a number about 20 of them didn't even have a daniel 70 week's book well i've never read it down yourself why oh i'm afraid i might don't be afraid you all ready you're admitting it by the fact that you won't read it and study it i don't know i'm hard i know that but this is going out on the internet too they can listen if they want to and declare what they want to out of it to be good or bad right i'm just making it plain as i can make it i don't understand the seals you ever read the book no i i just never have felt like i could read it i'm waiting on somebody to oh see you prove what you're doing you're waiting on somebody to do something well the church listen to what i'm talking about we say we can't understand brother brown's message if we understood the bible we could and he spent 30 40 years preaching straight out of the scriptures to get us to understand the bible then the seals broke then the things began to unveil you see what are we waiting on at least let's declare it as here and begin to move into it that god can do it come on how many times you want me to say it you can't be healed unless you faith say you're healed you can't be saved unless you first say you're saved you've got to confess it well then there's no way if you'd understand the seals if you ain't never read the book now that's something well i'm afraid i might get confused now glory you're afraid you're gonna get confused honey you already confused we was born confused the only thing that'll take us out of the confusion is this message now let me put it this way this message revealed i made a statement the other day about it and people just look at you and say i have never went to a service and sat down and listened to anyone that i didn't get something from it i don't care whether i believe what the pro the man was saying or not i'm gonna get something because my heart is hungry there's a desire in my heart to understand well i ain't going to listen brother so-and-so he's already confused now you're just as confused as he is if you if you're afraid of the fact of listening to him you're afraid me and brother mo we just get kind of tickled at each other because you know somebody come along and say with a brother so-and-so over here but he's off the message we'd both look at each other so what we're going to be doing this weekend that's four we started pastoring and running a church we we looked at each other and just you know because he knew what i was doing and i knew what he was doing we're going to be setting in that church because we wasn't going to be taking what everybody else said we were going to go here for herself and you know what we found out a lot of times that the ones that have said they were off would want more off than the ones that we went to here of course you don't want people don't want that but come on church this is the age that is predestinated unto adoption this is our destiny that was the life's message right this is our destiny our it's determined that a word is going to be here in the end time a seed word what did brother ronald say that the bride is to be delivered of a new birth from according to malachi 4. oh well i didn't know he said that well go read the book get your computer and look it up i ain't got time that's what a brother moat said one day he said something about stature of a prairie man he said this brother he's talking to and the brother said i just ain't got time brother said well i only preached about 60-something sermons and he looked at him he said i ain't got time to listen to all them sermons he said york too you ain't got nothing yet that's what he said back to you ain't got nothing yet you ought to have time to go listen well i didn't think he was being sarcastic i didn't think he was being hateful a smart aleck or whatever i think the other guy was being the smart athlete because the other guy was saying we don't understand we just believe we we we're we're waiting on something okay what is my way of saying waiting on somebody whether you're waiting on brother branham to return or whether you're waiting on whatever what is my way of explaining that you can't it don't do you no good to wait at the bus depot for the airplane to come along what are you saying at least get into our port at least get in the message and read it and study it unto adoption is the subtitle part that we've been we're covering today unto what the prophet say unto unto the water fountain going through the door unto it means something that you're in a travel journey of doing unto all right what have we been in all of these years i'm doing all these years what have we been in all these years because of brother dale you're just an intellect well you know i from my understanding of the word intellect it doesn't necessarily have to be smart you know it just means that you have the ability well you know what i've always tried to explain on that i might not be smart enough to tell you something but i am smart enough to find out where it's in the book right does that hurt your feelings yeah it hurts your feelings you don't like it because you ain't going to get into books and study you're going to read with all these other things won't you do like my brother's a methodist minister why don't you get you a playboy magazine rack put it in your house where you can read them instead of studying the message you send me no brother yeah my brother's got that but i've heard him preach messages that will make the most of the ministry of this message ashamed of his direction and his point of what he's trying to bring you mean you'd go listen to it yeah like i said he can out preach a lot of the preachers in his message now don't back up i ain't over there today it's just up the road up here but listen church what am i trying to get unto adoption this is the age get this one thing of nothing else out of the message this is an age that ever ever age there were seven church ages right each church age had a word to be brought forth for that age all right see that means we've got the word to be brought forth what to be delivered of a new birth from according to malachi 4. right i mean that's one of the things that just thought but i'm getting you to a point of thinking about what i'm talking about this is the age that the adoption is to come point to where that we're not just being babies playing around we're not just saying i'm born again i'm in the family glory hallelujah i'm i'm in the family i've been in the family i've been born again 40 years i've been praise god but what about your inheritance the way your prophet was explaining it if you want to go through it that's just an earnest for us to have the understanding of the bible of the apostles and the thing that's an earnest of the finality that the prophet brought an earnest a part payment those pentecostals had the new birth he never denied that you can't do that you can't do it like i said that brother standing here and he was down there a little at the gills with and said them pentecost didn't have nothing i told him i said according to the prophet they had the new birth well that didn't change him he come right here and preached it that night and said pentecostals was didn't have nothing brother branham you show me one place where brother run them ever said the pentecostal didn't have nothing i'll show you a whole lot of message where he said them people had to do the street was the genuine baptism of the holy ghost the new birth into the body of jesus christ right that's why people ain't going to say nothing to me about it because they know it that's why i don't get it back off the internet because they know what at least what i said is right but i'm not doing it to try to be smart i'm doing it to try to get me and you to wake up oh you're just being nasty you been there no i was praying yesterday and today especially and the lord showed me something and i said lord i ain't gonna try to explain that i already have and it went wrong trying to explain it i've tried to explain that the biggest portion of people would die and go by the grave genuine born again children of god i've never said nobody wouldn't right because they didn't agree with me or my thoughts or ideas i'm just asking you to consider that it was said 40 years ago if we don't get out here pretty quick we're going to have to be doing to the nursing home and i'm not a joking i mean you think you're going to live a long time brother dale he talks like that he just expected to die no i ain't expecting to die that's one thing that i ain't expecting to do i may be in the nursing home i may be in a lot of things but i'm not expecting to die i've fought for 50 years this coming fourth of july will be 50 years this church has been in operation odd that it's fallen on the 4th of july that we started on the fourth of july on a sunday it's come back now until that fourth of july this coming is going to be our 50th that's a jubilee that's a jubilee that's a joyous time a joyous festivity what do you think about it see i know for sure that we're doing one thing for certain we're going to up or down one pretty quick right we're too old come on come on don't play i'm not playing games to try to throw stones at anybody whatever a lot of the people that's in this building is over 50 years old and it's kind of like we're talking about outside out there you know we used to when we had a car you know we used to buy a brand new car and we'd drive at 40 000 miles and we started getting ready to trade it in right am i right we started getting ready to get rid of that thing because it was wore out right but you know somebody just happened to push the foot feed and this price that 40 50 000 mile bracket and it just went on and they got to a hundred thousand mile now they got the two hundred thousand mile another 300 400 there's people driving cars around it's got 500 000 miles on them well well it's gonna quit one of these days well so what are you gonna quit no i'm gonna fight it out as much as i can and stay with it as much as long as i can and i ain't going to worry about the rest but in my fight now there's one thing for certain i'm going to try my best to get me and you to realize where we're at right here at the end time [Applause] right all of these things coming upon us but yet if we've been in enough to understand you know to most of the people all of these plagues that have come upon us it's done put us in the tribulation period well that ain't so that's right i don't care who teaches it it's not so why because tribulation is the wrath of god poured out we're not under any form of tribulation that the wrath of god is poured out we're under tribulation of tribulation that worketh patience are a pre-tribulation the prophet covered it in the seal book we're not in the basis of a wrath of god in the wrath of god means there is no mercy i'm going to ask you but how many of you took an aspirin or pain field today a lot of you did ain't no gun against it i'm not talking about that i'm talking about one thing what about when it comes a time when you can just down a whole bottle of pain pills and it won't stop no pain what about a time coming the bible speaks of it to where the animals or birds and things are just eat your flesh off of you while you're still alive and they ain't nothing you can pray to the only thing you can find them praying there is praying that the rocks and things fall upon them and hide them from the wrath of god that's the only praying that can be done but you see then i'm not worried about that part i'm just trying to get you to get away from thinking about those silly like things and get down to the bases of where to know to realize where we are and what we're doing come on i don't mind you saying it because i know what people say well we've heard this before yep and if you come next time i preach you'll hear it again because i believe it's the truth i believe we're in the end time how much longer of time wise we got that ain't got nothing to do with it ain't never had nothing to do with it but yet i have to admit one thing that still lays there that you can't argue about in 1974 i proved by the prophet's message in the bible we could pass the year 2026 and not break the message nor the prophet's message no way but how many people wants to look at that oh they had dates of 77 73 and a half and all like 80s and 88s and all all right i didn't try to get that to be anything to say that we could do it i was wanting the lord to come i want him to come right now i don't want him to wait until 78 2026. but i just proved the point that we were spending our time trying to run about of this that or the other and god had already shown where he could where it could go to your prophet stand there and he'd say like this he said it could be two or three years one time he said more than one i guess but i know one time he said i said it could be a hundred years and that was probably somewhere around 1960. he said it could be a hundred years i'm not concerned about that what i'm concerned with is what about me and you but yet we know everything else it's never been an age like this age when the internet just runs everything they don't have to have a mark of the beast you got it you've got it in your pocket where you right now called a telephone [Music] that they can handle you anytime they want to they can call you anytime they want to and they can pick you up anytime they want to right where you're sitting they can drop right out here and walk in and say we want you we want you i don't i'm not afraid of that i've never been afraid of being so that they could come in and get us and everything that's not that's not the fear of a christian the fear of a christian and god am i serving you right lord am i serving you am i following you no matter what everybody else says but what about it unto adoption this age is going to come to the adoption that has never been there now that's what i'm talking about there's never been a people that was fully manifesting adoption the only let me say this well people jesus raised from the dead he raised a natural body into a glorified condition right but ain't nobody else been able to reach immortality that's what the bible says but him but you know what if we can get him here enough in you and i then mortal can be turned to immortality right then you don't have to worry about it i gave you most of these anybody that wants them here welcome to it your adoption is not your new birth you get the new birth by the baptism of the holy ghost and you grow into adoption your adoption is your placing putting you into family adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing let's see if i can find that because i mentioned it the other day and i noticed it when i flopped over you know what brother branham says that that god even put it there in the holy ghost speaking and said i killed the people the same son that was born into the family had to be placed in the family or had to be the law of adoption as paul speaking of ephesians 1 5 predestinated to be the adoption of children by jesus christ the same thing that happened to jesus christ on the mount of transfiguration when he said this is my beloved son hear ye him see the pentecostals found the new birth but it didn't go on the church ought to be in adoption right now now bring it into the full favors of god we're up and ups we're ups and downs ins and outs and ups and downs and ins and out until god can't trust us with nothing am i reading it pentecostals missed because you're to remind you were a son when you was born into the family but yet they missed the adoption i'm reading these scanning off some of you have these you can have them what about it god has predestinated us unto adoption of sons if that son never did come to be the right kind of a son he never became come heir but he was the right but if he was the right son and the son that would obey his father then he become heirs he was adopted like jesus on mount of transfiguration just looking at a few things welcome for all of these i give them to you he says you're predestinated unto adoption before the foundation of the world you're predestinated unto adoption before the foundation of the world before the world ever begun so what are we worried about why don't we get into studying the message but he says you only have the earnest now notice we're predestinated with the lamb the holy spirit is our seal the earnest means more is yet to come we only have the earnest of it now the earnest is just the down payment so no one else can touch it it's the earnest of our adoption the holy spirit is now the earnest of god in our hearts sealed the adoption of sons waiting us at the end of the road sons and daughters of god waiting for the redemption of our body we have the earnest that god is with us we have the earnest that god has not forsaken us that we are his and he is ours because we in our bodies we now tabernacle the holy spirit of god that cries out abba father and there's nothing can ever take that away we are anchored in christ now i'm looking at something that can't be taken away my eternal life cannot be removed my position of coming to adoption cannot be removed by no devil or anybody you think i'm afraid of any of those things we're waiting for the fullness of adoption this will take place when at the first resurrection it's going to take place at the first resurrection he made man that little god he made man a god a god in his domain the world is waiting for the manifestation that's from the true sons of god field sons speak the word and see it create god's waiting god's wanting to place his church sons and daughters of god i like that because see i said something there the other day and i said well i hope it don't hurt your feelings sisters because it is not covered in the bible of adoption of daughters it's only covered in the bible form of adoption of sons but yet your prophet knew when it turned into a new testament dispensation that's why he could say that sons and daughters he puts you right back in right where you're supposed to be sons and daughters of god not just sons of god well we're the sons of god boy yeah that's what you're you're doing you think cancer or something the bible says there's coming a time when men will rot right in their flesh and the buzzards will eat off of the carcasses before they even die cancer is a toothache to what's coming but remember that horrible thing was forbidden in that day to touch those who had the seal of god i'm going to end with this last little poem you know some say well this viruses that we've just had and all of these things that so-and-so teaches that nobody's supposed to get it if their bride if you were under the persecution of the tribulation of god's wrath being poured out i would agree with you you see why did i don't agree with that you see why did i stand where i stand that we are not under the tribulation or the wrath of god that is poured out we are under the tribulation that work with patience we're under the pre-tribulation time we're not under the tribulation of god's wrath poured out because there's no mercy for that that's why just you why don't you go back to the message when somebody makes a statement well brother so-and-so said it am i right did it enter into any of your thoughts or anything as you go forth it's saying well brother so-and-so said that uh we weren't supposed to get none of these things well i've had people to tell me that back in the 70s that we weren't supposed to get sick and i said well you know it's kind of odd that the lord jesus got sick i said i just i just don't understand that but you see church i've tried to study the message to be able to have the answers to you that would have the questions and not just how well we don't know we're just we're doing the best we can do brother dale why you want us to do i want you to read and study i want you to be ready i want you to be ready because you read and studied i want you to know the word of god i want you to know what the prophet is taught i want us all to know where and to see what to expect or what to take place but you see back there the 40s your prophet was bringing the truth he hit the 50s it started increasing it hit the 60s he started increasing 70s now there's where you think when it ended with the prophet when he went off the scene in the 60s no it just got started it's just starting now to those who can recognize who they are and what they're doing and i'd like to see something well why don't you start practicing right right why don't you start practicing why don't you start calling on god it's not meant for all of us to call on god it's meant for you to call on god for what you have neato then we call we help we pray god sure what you see we can't even understand it was listen one night's not where brother random was talking and he said um something about you know have you been to the doctor well see here's a a prophet asking you have you been to the doctor and says you don't have no right to go before god if you don't go to the doctor first oh now it seems like he's really putting it back in the doctor i believe he's just trying to put it in our faith because we don't have enough faith i'm just as plain as language can be if you don't have enough faith for it to work then the best thing to do is go to doctrine i mean if you're sick and you're feeling bad the best thing to do is go doctor all right that should be your first time well i ain't depending on no doctrine depending on god well i think that's why the prophet put it that way feller a woman one asked him about a thing and he said one day and he said it like this i can't remember exactly but it's pretty close but he said it was a stomach problem he said won't you go down here on the corner so there's a doctor down there that specializes in them stomach operation why didn't your prophets pick it right there well you know what god don't do everything we think he ought to do sometimes it might be putting us to the test come on you position sometimes it might be putting us to a test but do you see the day that we're living i want to get that part in there because it just keeps coming back coming back the day that we're living or time then we can move on into some things the prophet has taught right we can get into a fivefold ministry that is an office now five fold well brother branham said it i don't mind it if i say it with him do you he says there's a nine gifts that's in the body he said you can have one of them and lose it they can go back and forth you can use this one time but he said there's five ministries that are offices that are predestinated but do we believe that because may i quote the rest of what he's saying he says our problem is we don't trust the people that are praying for us it's kind of like somebody told one time said that they they prayed for this lady or something said dad wants to come back over a man or somebody watch it come back over here do you believe god heard you well maybe that's the way it is but we need to have confidence in our brothers and sisters when we ask for prayer we need to have confidence that god will hear us that may be your pointless stance what we got brother yeah i like that song she sang later this morning that was good keep singing from bethlehem [Music] came forth a stranger on earth [Music] you love me [Music] step out [Music] down into a body and became god [Music] manifest upon the earth see what he wants me and you to do is step out and let him do that again but in us [Applause] he won't actually believe it [Music] we know our brother's having some problems and let's just believe with him because god's word is true we've seen so many things happen with a prayer cloth just give somebody a prayer claw and say just take this just pin it to the head of your bed because you're going to be there most of the time go back and talk to danny about one time he was in the hospital and we took him a prayer claw got one to him somewhere i forgot even how it happened but he still got that prayer cloth underneath his watch the band of his watch well that's something good to do i got him in my billfold i've never been broke [Music] i got them in my billfold i keep them there always teach the kids hey put back some money in what we call the rat hole you know just a place to put it and keep it there a prayer cloth with what money you got and see how it works put everything in him and believe it father we know our brother has a problem he's facing a lot of troubles and if you don't step on the scene then he's not going to be able to work and things but we believe you and we thank you that by your stripes he's healed and we commit everything to you lord we go forth now confessing that all is well father just bless our brother and give him strength in his body give him his energy back give him his health back because we believe you in jesus name amen just believe it you know it's not hard to have faith if you know who you got your faith in in other words if you were trying to believe in a god that would never come on the scene there's no need of trying to believe it [Music] but if you've seen him come on the scene and do things then you can believe just to be like jesus [Music] the things and having troubles and having still a lot of problems so let's just believe and ask god to just step on the scene and take care of it you believe it father our brother stands in place of his natural brother to speak for him to say he needs help so we just say back god is on the way help is on the way just reach down and touch his brother take all of this away the the viruses and the things lord the plagues and things that striking the earth all the things that's hindering him lord we believe you and we thank you in jesus name [Music] anybody else [Music] you're just messed pray one for another father just be with each other [Music] jesus
