and I I hope it's taught you one lesson that I am capable of sitting down and I don't have the preacher itch you know where you just have to preach all the time that I I've enjoyed it had a good time

thank you for it amen Matthew 1 and Deuteronomy 2 3 our heavenly father we thank you Lord for your love and your grace and your guidance unto each and every one of us we thank you for you Lord because without you what good would it be with any of us God we wouldn't be here there wouldn't be anything like we are if had not been for you we we thank you and to realize that you chose us Lord that you've given us your word here in the end time to be able to walk therein and that Lord you you haven't just left us with them that that You' come among us to to vindicate yourself as being with us as we were hearing the testimonies there while ago Lord and we just thank you we know that you're with us always to take care of us and we Praise Your Great Name Just Have Your Way Lord forgive our sins keep us cleanse us to be with all of those that are sick you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we depend upon the promise that you made unto us guide us now as we read your word you come Among Us and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen amen okay Matthew one scripture we read one uh last Wednesday and so we'll come back over that again so Matthew 1:18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother Mary was spouse to Joseph before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost then Joseph her husband remember what we used last week was talking about it it's always everybody's always talking about you not to take unto thee marry thy wife you know and all like that but see the Bible said then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was mindful to put her away privately but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream saying Joseph thy son of David fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her of the Holy Ghost and she brought forth a son and thou shallal call his name Jesus or he shall save his people from their sins now all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying Behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son they shall call his name Emmanuel which by in being interpreted is god with us then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him and took unto him his wife and he knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son and he called his name Jesus now if you'll notice in those scriptures there that that Jesus is kind of italicized us a little bit right cuz that's a very great thing you said well that doesn't mean very much well just look in your Bible while you're if you're looking at it look down right down below and look at the second chapter and you'll see it uses the word Jesus with a small letter it does mean something for those things okay Deuteronomy 23 verse 21 and thou when thou shalt vow a vow unto the Lord thy God Thou shalt not slack to pay it for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee and it would be sin in thee now follow that line brother R said if we watched that he said we wouldn't have the marriage and divorce problem I was reading that just the other day he said we wouldn't have them if we watched that part what if you make a vow and don't keep the vow what has it become sin right and look how he he emphatically States it in verse 22 but if Thou shalt but if Thou shalt forbear to vow it shall be no sin in the now forar means to not vow so he's saying if you vow don't keep you vow it's a sin but if you forebear to vow you haven't sinned so just don't vow that's what the prophet said all right that which is gone out of thy lips Thou shalt keep and perform even a feveral offering according as thou H has vowed unto the Lord thy God which thou Hast promised with thy mouth you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word remember in Matthew there we gave the other day that it says you know by your words you be justified by your words you be condemned right all right so then we're doing it now tonight I'm going to do it a little different because I want you to keep these and we're going to give you the the quotes and but yet we're still going to read them off of the off of the the the view and and you know somebody calls or whatever they do and something goes wrong uh remember tonight the we're not live CA something wrong with the system okay so but it will be on tomorrow cuz we are videoing and everything all right now we were talking Sunday I mean Wednesday because we were started at a point of like marriage and divorce so we're starting on the point of just like what is a marriage and then we will get down to you know uh the word divorce on another message but I want you to think about what I've been trying to say you can say well we've been taught this we've been taught that all right and I believe it's this way okay by the Constitution of the United States you have a right to believe what you want to believe right but not by the Bible okay not by the Bible but by the con intution that gives us total right to believe what we want to believe but not by the Bible so that's why I always try to take everything back to what the Bible says and what the prophet says right and then uh if you have a different thoughts on it I will be glad to discuss it with you you know at any time and all like that because you know I'm open for any instructive that I can receive because it really helps me and all and I I I enjoy that receiving what people have to to say right but remember what we were bringing out that how that you're married not and we'll read it again in a little bit not by uh going down to the justice of peace are going to a preacher and vowing your vows you all you know and then the other things going with it but you're married as far as God is concerned when you're engaged right amen and we'll give that back over in a minute as to what you know the engaged part of it now I want to make something clear that I said last Wednesday that I thought about it later in kind of reviewing in my mind what I had said and I said that when you know that when before I would marry my wife I had some things that I had to confess to her you know right and uh but none of those things I had to confess to her was that I was I just dropped it and I do that a lot so people can make you say anything you want to that's okay that's that's your business cuz they're the one putting it to it and they're the ones going to have to back up when they hear what you say later you know but see I never was engaged to anybody right and and I certainly wasn't married in any form to anybody but I I was a boy as all boys and I don't how to explain that all right but I did explain to my wife even as a sinner I would not of marry her until I went through my life with her because I wanted no trouble down the road right all right and that was a wonderful thing to do and then come along and find out the prophet said that's what we should do so that was good you know I wonder how many of you have um you know confessed your rights and I mean your wrongs and things on both sides you know men and women right you know uh how many times you've been engaged people say well well I you know I've never been engaged uh because they they'll think engaged means that you you got some kind of a public announcement now the word engage and espoused and things is when you ask the girl to marry you and she accepts right yeah then that's a wedding as far as God is concerned right right all right you say well no we haven't done all these others we we'll read some more tonight but you just think about it that's why it's serious amen and we're going to get on to The Vow you know that a vow is so serious that a man there in the Bible one time vowed that if God would let him you know destroy his enemy that whatever came out to meet him on his way back we'll get to this he said I'll I'll sacrifice it to you and you know it was his daughter that came out and he sacrificed her to God that's how much his vow meant to him you say I wouldn't do that well then you claim to be a Christian right and this guy don't claim to be one that was back there he just vowed his vow and he believed it and he done what the vow was yeah all right see it it means a lot of things so just don't make a vow right and we'll try to cover things you know because I don't want you to misunderstand what I'm saying and and think about it that we say well a vow well you know you say well when when you go down to you know when the when you go to the to make your vows is what it's talking about well I'll read one in a minute where the Prophet said whether you made your vows you know like that or whether you live together what you married and he was talking about his own son right all right so then you know that would that would be a a bad thing because when I'm talking about vows now I'm not talking about when you come up before the preacher or the magistrate or whatever you know and they say do you take this to be no no I'm not talking about that now that is further into your vows that is what follows after your commitment or agreement right because you you've got to have it to where you can tie together with the entire world as far as what they're doing with their type of vows whether it's stepping over a stick you know I covered that Wednesday you know I mean they didn't just walk out there in the man way and grab a woman with hand and go step over a stick we stepped over a stick well you're and not married no that was a long period of time and very sacred things with them right know if that didn't stand the mergency test it was very serious wasn't it yeah in things all right but now see just remember what I'm trying to get you to think about that an engagement is an agreement right that's and the spouse or whatever you know you're doing so think on these things now and let's get started on it and listen to what the prophet had to say in this message we have but number one brother look what he say this is E18 Fellowship let me get over I gave you this cuz I want you to take them home with you you know and and I want you to read on them and study it but look what he says you cannot be married without an agreement yep you cannot have a wife without some kind of an agreement and that agreement is based upon your vow so it wouldn't matter if it was the stepping over stick it wouldn't M matter in in in forms to where that it would even the uh pre-arranged weddings of foreign countries that that they go through that to pre-arrange their own children's weddings you know and doings and and all the different things it would cover everything see because it would go into uh an agreement now I made a statement there that I want to make sure you understand I said uh you know we've accepted Jesus Christ and he's accepted us I really said that backwards right it should have been he accepted us and we accepted him because he has accepted a lot of people he gave salvation to the world right everybody can come he called them everybody all right now some are going to accept him yeah well sure then he will accept them on end to the marital Parts yes but see what makes the pros stitute system a problem the denominationalism and things is see he gave them an invitation and they publicly State their confession that they've accepted him as their Savior and then go out and live with the devil right that's right the world of sin you know in the things and showing them that they're a prostitute and I I'll get to that more when we get down to the word divorce and the things like that and and I like what Wade said there the other day you know to two two two Christians married together there's no such thing as a divorce that's right where would you have it right you know two true Christians now I said it to way I meant it me it the way I said it at that time okay two true Christians young together not just this person and nothing over there you don't even talk about a divorce why would you right but the re said is a man and woman they divorce and he said he he joined them back together and redone their vows he said they went off and live single y back he said and come back together he said they was married the whole time that's right amen that they wasn't divorced they was married the whole time CU see there ain't no divorce no cuz I hope you caught on to what I was saying about it a wedding is a vow right right a divorce is to break that vow right that's what you're doing when you go in to apply for a divorce right you're breaking the vows you made amen and a separation to pull apart and that makes it into a divorce then is what we call it in our terminologies right see we deal with talking like that when the Bible's dealing with others but now follow what I'm trying to say now you cannot be married without an agreement that's right you cannot have a wife without some kind of agreement and that agreement is based upon your vow all right now good to see our brother back with us and you you know I covered last Wednesday as I said that to me the Bible the prophet's message is that when you're engaged as far as God is concerned you're married right now you go break that engagement Y and marry somebody else you're living in adultery amen I don't care if man or a woman right see that's what we pick on the woman all the time yep see we get into all the problem we want to beat the woman to death leave the man let him put a suit on his he's good brother no but see once you're engaged as far as God is concerned he's taking your word right they said Matthew there in the scripture says by your words you be justified by Your Word you be condemned right and like we just read from from Matthew 1 and read it word it you know it was fear not to take unto thee marry thy wife we want to read that way but it said and also in that same scripture thy husband right and see they were only a spouse because that's what the the scripture says that we're doing all right now let's go to the next one you say but now brother Dale uh we're we're we're engaged but we're not married so you're wanting to go on over and try to make your marriage some deeper point they are calling a marriage we're not living in America when we're talking in Bible terminologies right what we were taught to be a marriage now is see as I said you couldn't do this in a court of law in America right to go into a court of law and say she agreed to marry me well theyd laugh you out to court you know cuz they don't care what it is cuz their words are so much different and their doings they only to them the marriage is not even when you're standing up you're going through the vows through the world that's not even America it's when you go down and sign the paperwork you know and you make that sign seal that you're married and you go home and live together you know that's what the world calls a marriage but we're not talking we're talking about Bible amen all right so doing that look what the prophet said on the message invisible Union the Bride of Jesus Christ paragraph 83 look what he said Joseph fear not take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her it all the Holy Ghost he was minded to put her away privately see after he'd already engaged to her when you're engaged to her as far as God is concerned you're married to her all right when you're engaged all right not the vows at the pullit right you know or the pre the priest or you know whoever you made you you're I promise to you know you take this to be your awful no it's when you're engaged right all right so we use the words turn back on the front of your thing there and forgive me for coughing and everything thank the Lord for touching me amen uh finally went to the doctor and got some antibiotics but I buy Stripes I was healed before the antibiotics I thank God for antibiotics amen just we just get what we can I call it double that's what I said one time we was going to we come by my mothers I think it was and and one of the kids was sick and they said well you going to the doctor I said yeah we're going to the doctor we're going to church first and then we're going to the doctor you because that's what we believe we believe God's the HEB right right amen but look in Luke now we covered which is the same one but it's to to you know spouse to a virgin spouse to a man whose name was Joseph all right right that word ver uh espouse D is the Greek word 3423 which means a spouse and watch what it says to woo her and ask her in marriage to be promised in marriage be betro right all right now as I said when you when a boy asks a girl to marry him and the girl accepts then that's the vows brought that's their vows now if you ask a girl to marry you and she does not Excel that's not a wedding that's not an engagement right you know so don't go that way you know and people say well well I I asked her to marry me she's got to do it no that's not exactly no you know see it's when Joseph and Mary were a spoused y and by being a spoused then he had asked her to marry her I like that right there I like the way to woo her and ask her in marriage now that don't mean you walk up hey Daddy your honey dollar let's go get married no not not exactly not not that's not the word brother rown said Joseph and Mary would sat out on the porch after coming home from church and talk about the Bible Well it's going to get into that he going to get into the girls and the boys and the dating and what you should do and shouldn't do right all right you say well we already married well you might overthink about some of the things you've done back there right and ask the Lord as you made sure you cleared your record right amen and you might order ask your husband and your wife to make sure you cleared the record right right that's right I tell you one it' be bad well it's going to be bad if you don't because we're going to get down of that at a while where I read you to start with if you vow a vow and don't keep the vow it's sin right so go ahead then you'll see why brother randam said to the lady you know when she said if I tell my husband he he said God's already left you yep now that's what he said you going to read the message that's right he said he's already left you yep you said no wait a minute you putting no I'm putting what the prophet said right amen all right look at the next one let's see what the prophet had to say about this one what is it go to uh we still on the word of spouse go to 2 Corinthians 11:2 all right Paul is using the word jealous over you we Godly jealousy for I have espoused he had espoused the people back there which is you and I right if we're Christians he spoused us to Christ all right that Greek word means which is 718 this is the New Testament the other one's an Old Testament right it means a spouse it means a join to fit together to betro a daughter to anyone to join to oneself in other words to marry the daughter of anyone to bet trol to give one in marriage to anyone right all right so it's holding with the right form right look at the next one which the word ESP spoused is used in the Old Testament in 2 Samuel 3:14 and David is talking about get my wife and bring her back over here remember sa's daughter and all because even though she done been married to a guy he said she was espoused and that word espouse is to betro 781 the Old Testament form engage to bet betro man or woman right to be betrothed to the word engaged now appears with a spouse and betol so then it must be the same word right amen coming all the way through right all right now let's see I gave go to Jeremiah 30 and you'll notice it uses the word engaged for who it is that engaged his heart in other words I gave that to just show you a man commits his heart he commits his that's called engaged right to commit something to agree to something to to to make it your own thought and idea right it turns out to be and that's what we was using that far because that's what it means it means to pledge exchange mortgage engage occupy undertake take far give pledges uh for shity to take a pledge or give a pledge see that's in your heart you say well now it wasn't in my heart when I asked that girl to marry me well that's probably about right it was in the flesh right but it still was dealing from the heart so that's that was why I used that one it just to that point all right so look at the next one which is Deuteronomy 22:23 which is the word betro that was the word engage and here's the word betro if a down soul that is a virgin be betroth unto a husband and manf finder now we're going to get back to that scripture in a little bit but look what it says 3259 is the word to fix appoint assembly meet set betro to appoint assign designate to meet to meet by appointment together assemble by appointment to cause to meet to be set be pled placed before are to be fixed all right so the word betro the word engaged and the word espoused is the same word all right right now let's get down to the to the next one on our quotes now go down to number three let's just let the prophit be the answer to all of it this is paragraph 165 questions and answers number three 3 64 8:30 the morning service and watch what he says and I'd be a hypocrite if I stood here because my own son sitting here that was promised to a girl and I said it if if he never ever had the ceremony said over him yeah now read it if he never even had the ceremony set over him right no matter if he ever live with the the woman or slept with her the girl or whatever it was when he made that vow he's married Billy Paul or no Billy Paul that's actually the truth he's married when he made the promise and he refused he remember to do his son's wedding that's right that's how strong it was now but notice what he said if he never even had the ceremony said over him so there's your vows down here do you take this to be your law wted do you think that's your ceremony right no matter if he if he ever lived a woman or slept with it no matter they married right see we don't play on things on what we're trying to do here we try to be one straight things straighten if we can and I like it the way the prophet do it look at the next one number four the choosing of a bride if we would study what we're doing when we're going to get married when we choose our wife or husband if we'd study it over a man should pray earnestly for he could Ru his entire life right Remember The Vow is until death do we part now listen to this one real carefully and he could Ru his life by making the wrong choice but if he knows what really he making the wrong choice and is marrying a woman that isn't fit to be his wife and he does it anyhow y listen to it then it's his fault y right see you can't come along one of these days and claim ignorance at least now you can't I like one brother R said from now on you can't right you can't play it play it plead ignorance well I didn't know these things don't plead ignorance watch if the woman takes a husband and knows that he's not fit to be a husband to you then that's your own fault after you know what's right and wrong so you shouldn't do it until you thoroughly pray through right amen yep you see if you know it was wrong to marry the person you well I didn't know what was wrong to marry the person that's why I always tell you you know what I tell you any of you ever asked me to do your wedding I say what have you ever been engaged to either one of you is either one of you ever been married right then I say this to the husband and the wife the woman and the man sitting there now it's up to you to go explain your life cuz I have no right to to to ask her are you a virgin or ask him is he a virgin that's not that's not my responsibility that's what I'm telling you that's what he's telling you right so you join them people together knowing this that or the other it's like one brother said one time he said you married them people when it's wrong I said what I said you know it yeah y I said you was the best man so the sin's on you yep I didn't know it I said you got the problem and I said if I tell you you you remember in the wedding vow I said from now on keep your mouth shut that's what the wedding vow means when you're asking if anybody can say anything for reason if not forever hold your peace I said you're supposed to keep your mouth shut cuz you stood as the best man and didn't tell me about it see it was something else it wasn't the vows it wasn't but that's what I'm getting at see we we all had problems cuz we didn't know the truth right see we didn't know the truth it's the reason we done what we done amen but now does that dis know the truth no no it just made us all into problems right and and doing the best we can do about it but he said if we' have studied that he said if we have just to studi that out now let's go ahead we get the the two quotes out and then we'll drop back on what we were talking about on the vows brother brother Anderson so go ahead to number five now go ahead and go ahead to number five quote 30 165 4 five okay let's use this one all right I got something back here I got to read on rest but let's get these out read these out of the way and then we'll get this is questions and answers on of book three which is 6 830 the morning service paragraph 154 and said we were married 21 years ago by the justice of the peace was it wrong yes it was wrong for you to do that marriage belong in the house of God but being that you are married here's when you're really married you're married when you vow one to the other when you promise one another that you're that you'll take one another the justice of the peace could give you the license that's legal terms of living together as husband and wife without being common law husband and wife right but when you promise this girl and this you promise that man that you'll live true to him and you take him to be your husband you're married then you remember I explained that last week right so let's go on to the next one number six all right that was paragraph 150 this is paragraph 160 and as I say you got married by magistrate you should have been married by the church by the minister that's the decent thing for a Christian but being that you've already made that promise and vow and been married 21 years ago I think it's all right you say well I the question and this I just put this in here because I want you to think on this point listen the question might be should I come and be married again yeah now listen if you wish to right now here's the reason don't have nothing in your mind that bothers your faith you see what he saying cause if anything's D you can't go no further than right there you stop right there the best thing to do just get it out of the way we've had wedding vows renewed and all kind of things you know and he goes on to explain something about U they put him out of the church and different things like that cuz he wouldn't you know but he's explaining right don't get nothing in the way right yeah and we've done it we've had marriage renewed marriage vows renewed you know and that's fine CU it be good you know to keep everything in the right order cuz we should shouldn't have it that way all right let's pick them up and get the last two and then we'll start back on it so this is parag look at number number seven paragraph 193 91 through 99 through 97 theying offer questions and answers real to 8:23 in the evening said brother Brandon what is the meaning of an are people free to marry or is it just another word for divorce I'd like some information on that on this so you'd say well an they had an an because that's what brother brandham and the girl's father done I can show you that in the message brother brandham and his and the girl's father had their wedding an olded of Billy Paul and the girl that he married to but he was married see right sure they're married as long as they take that vow they're married just like a boy if a boy promises a girl to marry her under good faith he's obligated to let girl he's just as good as married her the only thing that the law does is give you a Bill of Rights to live together to keep from being common law husband and wife but when a man tells a woman I will marry you honey I will take you for my wife will you take he's married your vow is sacred that's what marries you anyhow there's not no preacher can marry you no magistrate or nothing else it's your own vow to God and to this man when you promise you are married lookie you say brother brandom is that you say you said you'd only answer that by the Bible did you want the Bible on it raise your hands if you want it now we got six or eight minutes all right Joseph her husband being a just man her espoused husband already called her husband Joseph her husband being a just man was mindly mindly to put her away privately on this wise but before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost see and the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a dream and saying Joseph thy son of David Fe not to take unto thee marry thy wife already married he'd already promised her all right what and of and little lady if you promise to marry that boy you're obligated to do it if you marry another after that obligation you will from now on anyhow you'll be living in adultery and notice the thing same thing to a boy promising to marry a woman don't you make your vow to anybody L you mean to stick with it remember there's the Bible for it Joseph promised to marry Mary and God said that that was read the Old Testament laws on that the Old Testament law if you promised to marry a woman and you married another one you was committing adultery and it throws you out of the camp yes sir you have to keep your vows when when you promise to a woman that she's a sacred little vessel and that's to her that's to bring child life into the world again so when you promise her you must marry her that's right now we'll get to some of these quotes later on because of the divorcement situation and brother Brandon been referring back to that while ago whether you marry a woman and knowing that you know that he even said it like this one time he said if you married a woman and knowing there problem that you can't divorce her for the problem that's right amen that's right what he say right it goes on what you know goes on that point look at the last one then we'll get down to the V okay we have seen a star in the east and come to worship this is 1963 1216 now I'd like to pass this on before you go further espousing in the East was the the same as marriage is betral as soon as they as they were espoused they were married when that sacred vow between them was taken read Deuteronomy 22:23 and you'll find out that when this young woman and man agreed to be married yet they did not take the vows for months later now notice it he didn't take the vows for months later and he's talking about up before the people the V you know they done promised right if they even broke that vow they were guilty of adultery that's right when they were espoused they were just the same as marriage the law had not given them rights to live together as husband and wife yet but before God when they promised one another their words were sealed in God's Kingdom right and a break that was just committing adultery and now Joseph was a spouse to Mary if minister brothers and if you'd studied that right good it'd clear you up on this marriage and divorce case that's so so hard and different amongst the people today and notice Joseph her husband being a just man see now we find out that this could be not be broken all right now you're vows you're married by your vows amen right the word engaged espoused betr every how you pronounce those words betro comes out to be the same thing your vow right that you made your Arrangement your agreement all right you made that all right so now let's go over to something as I said a vow is so sacred until you'll find it in 1st Samuel 1:11 that Hannah vowed a vow unto the Lord and SEL when he was weaned was given unto Eli I believe the right the priest ever given to him to raise because she made a vow right you didn't just make a vow and it just you know in America words are cheap somebody make a vow I promise that don't do it in America get it wrote down in and signed by the judge and make sure the judge is a good judge if you can get the judge you get the judge to sign the judge you know yeah you know what I'm saying cuz in America people's words worth nothing right amen I told you about the time I sold my house and my brother come and offer me $5,000 profit and all I'd done is give my nephew word that I'd sell it to him he said you ain't signed nothing I said my word's worth more than $5,000 get on yeah and that was a time when $5,000 that was 1972 $55,000 meant a lot of money then right but you see if your word is not no good talk is cheap yeah but remember you're going to give the Bible says an account for every Idol word amen that's right that's why it doesn't make no difference I have to have here rules regulations said I'm pastor and I must go by those things right even though I might not agree with them as far as wanting it to be done but it's according to the pastor right according what the Bible said I'm supposed to do right as Reon I do the way I do but you see then a vow now as I said while ago a vow is not to wait until you come down and make your vows right you know where you you standing before the preacher or the or the magistrate or whatever and you take this woman me that that's part that's a vow that's a word vow now when we read this here in the scriptures we're going to read something that people want to use for their own benefit you know in making a vow but just remember as I said in judges 11: 31-34 right in there verse chapter in judges 11 you'll find a man vowed to give whatever come out first and his daughter come out and he killed her right that's what a v meant to people right that's why I read there in the scripture when we started that if you vow a vow to God yep and you break the vow that's sin it's sin that's scripture that's plain language it ain't nice things a lot of times to talk about but who wants nice things I'm going to tell you this because I've told you many times this way I have never dechristianize anybody for double marriages Etc any kind of thing but but I'll tell you up front in plain language there ain't going to be no change of the body now I'm talking about change the moment the twink of an eye I'm not talking about going by the grave get that out of your mind going by the grave and come up y that's one thing there's not going to be a bride standing here changing a moment and twinkling an eye that's got a marital problem of any kind right amen believe whether it be natural or spiritual right so don't tell me that all these two Soul seven thund virtue peruses River Jordan etc etc that all that's going in Rapture no how you going inter Rapture with false Doctrine right that's why it's been put off so long waiting on somebody to get stapled on the word right amen 40 something years we've had to get settled in the word right we ought to be able to say something about marriage and divorce after that but you know that 9 % of the preachers that's message won't even touch marriage and divorce right the ones that does 90% of that 90% he got it all garbage Canned Up amen till the man can go out and just have all the wi he wants but the woman she's she's still you know all right but a v let's go in the scriptures now just take something that people want to use go to numbers 30 now before I start on this all right it says if a woman off so vow a vow unto the Lord and bind herself by a bond being in her father's house in her youth that's right remember youth that's right yes doesn't say she's 90 years old this is the headship of do it but look what the word v mean to vow make a vow to vow a vow all right now this is not just talking about marriage and divorce no that's right it's talking about all forms of vow right but it is also talking about marriage and divorce and the basis that she's making her vow right all right whether you believe what I'm saying or not do you understand what I'm saying right when we read this it's it doesn't say any here that she she vowed to marry a husband it just says she made a vow right all right and it it it it'll lean on over to where we can understand all right let's start with let's start with verse one all right you got it from numbers the V let's go to to numbers 30th chapter go ahead brother pull it up we'll start with verse one I may not have marked that for them to use really it'll be up there but you go ahead and turn to it in your Bible and we'll get we'll get started on it okay and watch Moses SP un the heads of the tribes concerning the children of Israel saying this is the thing that the Lord hath commanded all right now we got and if a man vow vow unto the Lord or swear an oath to bind his soul with a bond he shall not break his word he shall do according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth and if a woman also vow vow unto the Lord and bind herself by Bond being in her father's house in her Youth and what that's right now watch's the headship that W was preaching about the the man being the head right here we go and the husband being the head and watch it when we get on down here that a widow and and a divorce woman don't even have a head no there's nobody to disallow their vows right but they don't have a head all right yeah if I have time to get there but what and if a woman also a vow vow to the Lord being in her father's house and her Youth and her father hear her vow and her bond where with she hath bound her soul and her father shall hold his peace at her then all her vows shall stand and every Bond wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand all right now as I said it doesn't say that she married to marry does it right but see the same people that would rebuke try to rebuke me of saying it don't say nothing about married you let one of their kids get in trouble and down hear about four verses they run back real quick and say this is talking about fou of a wedding yeah come on we'll get down to that you trying to say well that's not it it's not it's don't matter all V that's right that's right amen of of a father has a right to break a vow of a daughter sure right now would it be something Danny let's give it a couple illustrations natural so showing the vows of a vow you know just a vow what did Hope come along and said Daddy I vowed to give all the money that Mama and you and Dad you and Mama's Got I done sign the paperwork uhuh now daughter you ain't capable of doing that now you might be able to fagle a little out of the checking account yeah but we're going to solve this problem right now right right all G's not here but still he'll hear this later what if Little B there said Daddy I made a vow I I'm going to become a nun what she might have V cuz people talk her into making a v right but the daddy can say hold it just a minute now you don't understand what you're saying daughter do you know what it means to be a nun do you know or you taking no I didn't consider all that Daddy I didn't know that all went with it he's childish right but he's capable of breaking that vow that's right any any kind of vow you vow you know get on down to the little bitty kids and yeah that's right little Olivia she comes in and said daddy said I made a vow said I'm going to clean the teacher's room every day after school I'm sure that what Joe would say then wait just a minute ain't no problem about you cleaning school you know cleaning the room up but uh who's going to come and get you after school's over and bring you home you have vow to vow now you know what people do with doing those thing right you know that these preachers on their radios and TVs and things they get you to make a vow that you'll send them so much money bud you better not let down on that they're going to send you a nice little letter and about three letters they going to tell you what a filthy garbage can you are for not keeping your vow cuz you vowed to God and God can rain down HS on you and destroy you and you know what I'm talking about so it's not all marriage vows right it's all vows that's right see the father can dis all the vow that's right all right now let's bring it back up to where we're at now let's use it for what we're talking about now a boy ask a girl to marry her and I'm talking about a youth Now Youth now you going have to AR get what youth means that's all right you youth all you want to but the best definition for me is youth is a kid don't have enough sense to come in out of the rain they may be 40 years old now what's your definition of Youth 10 12 13 years old whatever sh fine right but you understand what I'm saying a youth is involved but now there's got to be certain things are that or that cannot be done so now let's get into it all right go ahead brother pull him back up right and her father hear her vow and her bond wherewith she have found her soul she comes in she says mama daddy you know so and so asked me to marry him and I accepted him so now according to y'all's teaching we're engaged so what does the father do if he hears The Vow she done and her father shall hold his peace at her y then all her vows shall stand and every Bond where where she ha bound her soul she stand right if he holds his peace right if he don't say nothing right then her vought to marry the boy is an engagement amen all right now but if her father dis allow her in the day that he heard hear it now remember that recorded the day he hear it not 6 months later and you've already made wedding engagements and got all of the paraphernalia set up and and you got all the dates set and everything else and the guy comes along said you ain't going to marry that boy now we're not dumb right the Bible says in the day that he heareth in other words he must immediately upon hearing it right right that illustrate he's going on hunting trip he's going to be gone a couple of weeks boy ask a girl girl accept the boy mama knows about it they talk about well we going to be married we'll tell Daddy when he gets here and when Daddy comes home 2 weeks later that's the day he hear it yeah and he said no you're not going to do it right see watch what happens but if her father disallow her in the day that he Hearth not any of her vows or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her soul shall stand and the Lord shall forgive her yep because her father disallowed her her that's wonderful amen yes sir to think of what the headship can do amen cuz you know that he just allowed our amen yes sir you want go spiritual amen listen and she had it all in husband when she vowed now so you're not going to totally into marual vows and different things but just a vow she vowed or uttered all out of her lips where with she bound her soul and her husband heard it and held his peace at her in it that day that he heard it then her vow shall stand and her bonds where with she bound her soul shall stand it's the headship of the man the husband all right but if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it not 6 months later now not oh honey I finally made made up my mind you told me this 6 months ago I get out here say garbage can we're talking about immediate things we're not talking about living garbage right then he shall make her vows which she then he shall make her vows which she vowed and that which she uttered with her lips where where she her soul was bound of none effect and the Lord shall forgive her that's right now look cuz headships got to go amen but every vow the Widow watch it now and her that is divorced where with they have bound their souls she'll stand against her that's what strong vows did see she don't have a headship and she vowed in her husband's house or bound her soul by a bond with an oath right and her husband heard it and held his peace in her and disallowed her not then all her vows shall stand and every BN where with she had bound her soul will stand but if her husband you know yep H him every bow all right now think about it suppose a girl does agree to marry a boy boy accepts and she and like way said it's a good point we're in the days now when the girls ask the boy to married but that don't put a headship over her no right cuz that's not scripture scripture is for the boy to ask the girl amen yeah that's the scriptural point and order to be nice point for anybody today you know I mean that's but suppose but your daughter comes in and tells you you say well a boy asked me to marry and I accept it you immediately can stop that from being a wedding right or an engagement cuz remember if you leave it alone they're married that's right you leave it alone they're marri right yep right so you you got to do something quick Y and I emphasize people you know they come along and they say well and I don't know this happened that people make wedding plans and everything in the world and the daddy come along and said I just allow The Vow y now that is play your games with your own toys yeah don't play with the word of God right the day you hear it cut it off amen immediately you say no right all right now God will honor that and there's not a wedding there right even though they have made their vows that's right because he has disallowed that yep God disallowed our vows because you were whether you want to believe it or not we vowed to serve Satan amen that's right yes sir and God dis Aline our vows CU you realize how young our minds are you understand what I'm getting at but what is a wedding an engagement an espousal a betrothal a vow that you make is what joins you together right man we read Word the prophet said it don't matter where they ever live together what Yep they're married it's serious when we read the Bible it's not a play party right it's serious let's see I was going to wait on another one but let's go let's see if I got that one yeah turn over Deuteronomy I didn't give these to them that's so but I'm going to use this this will be used mainly for divorce when we get into that which will be the next service we do the Lord willing all right turn over to Deuteronomy 22 and let's read a few things and just make sure we keep everything good and straight right CU we use these when we get down to divorce to show that a man can put his wife away right or put his girlfriend away when he finds her wrong in her but he better be right in what he does he better do it with the Bible okay Deuteronomy 22:9 we'll start um we don't need to start let's go uh 13 If any man take a wife and go in unto her and hate her and give occasions of speech against her and bring up an evil name upon her and say I took this woman and when I came to her I found her not a maid in other words you understand what he's saying I found her not to be a virgin right you understand then shall the father of the dsel and the mother take the take and bring forth the tokens of The danil's Virginity unto the Elders of the city in the gate a lot of people try to make out a lot of things it's all right it's proof anyway right sure you can do what you want to and I just wrote mine on our first night's bed sheet that'll be plain enough okay now D's father she'll say unto the elders I gave my daughter unto this man to to wife and he hated her and lo he had given occasion of speech against her saying I found not thy daughter my made and yet these are the tokens of my daughter's virginity and they shall spread the cloth before the Elders of the city and the Elders of that City shall take that man and chastise him now watch how strict your rules are they shall amense him in 100 SI make him pay 100 shickles of silver and give them unto the father of the dsel because he has brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel and she shall be his wife and he may not put her away all his days we're going to find out divorce is not because you cooked the bread wrong you know don't play with words right but watch then but if this thing be true and the tokens of virginity be not found for the dsel then they shall bring her out of the bring out the damel to the door of her father's house and the men of her City shall Stone her with stones that she die because she has brought Folly in Israel to play the in her father's house so shalt thou put evil away from among you right pretty strong is it y now watch if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband then they shall both they shall both of them die both the man that lay with a woman and a woman so shalt thou put away evil from Israel watch if a damel that is a virgin be betro right unto a husband and a man find her in the city and lie with her and you shall bring them both out un to the gate of the city now notice where it's at now read your scripture where's it at and it answer that is a virgin be betrothed to a husband and a man find her in the city and lie with her then you shall bring them both out unto the Gate of that City and you shall stone with them them with stones that they die the damel because she cried not see she's in the city somebody could have heard her right right being in the city and the man because he had humbled his neighbor's wife so Thou shalt put away evil from among you now let me stop right here and say something plain that's telling you that she's in the city and if she cried she'd be hurt right but now God is always straight and honest what if the guy knocked her out where's he going to fly I'm the pastor I have to answer these questions CU somebody would come up with a question and say well what is so and so so and so all right I'll just discover the so and so you know it's still exactly right in the scripture but as quick as she wakes up she's going to cry and somebody in the city is going to hear her right right does that take care of that problem you say well well why did something happen do something happened if he bound her gaged her as quick as she got loose she cried not 3 days later now you know after she's done quick as she got able to she cried she's in the city somebody could hear her so the main thing is what she's in the city and somebody would hear her cry right and go to her eight now go to the next thing but if a man find a betro damel in the field now remember both of these died if they if they don't cry out but if a man find a betro damel in the field and the Man force her and lie with her then the man only that lay with her shall die now the reason is saying that is because she's outside the city she's out in the country right right he's out in the country nobody already here that's simple terminology is what the Bible speaking of right but put it down more into simpler terms of us if he raped her my know surpris we brought in this message one time we were going down the road and he said you mean you don't believe that a rape would cause a person to be married I said no a woman gets raped that doesn't mean she's married to the guy he raped her it puts in the tempate category that's what this scripture saying she's out where she can't cry but as quick as she can cry why because it tells you what happened but under the dsel Thou shalt do nothing there is in the dsel no sin worthy of death whereas when a man rises against his neighbor and SLE him even so is this all right he found her in the field and Danel cried and D was none to save her so what do you do you kill him right right right simple may not say the words right there what you do to you kill it you not solve a lot of problems but then we have to turn around and say we don't believe in capital punishment I got no idea about that it's cating that takes care of the whole problem well people don't talk to me about my terminology the gu's guilty cating me he don't no problem nobody ever ever after then if he's wounded in Stones he can't even come back to congregation so you really put the guy out but what are you going to say see she this this one here the one in the city somebody could hear her this one out nobody can't hear her she cries but what happens as quick as she sees somebody she cries let just go kill the guy you remember what the brothers done when that fell there took one of the daughters of who was it David's daughter and was it David he took him and you know he wanted to marry he raped her in other words and he want to marry her boy the law just took care of that problem you know the story what you done oh yeah we won't be one of you we we won't come in okay you got to be circumcised so they just circumcised all the guys and while they was in their circumcision and couldn't fight too good the brothers just got together and wiped all the men out and killed the old boy right David didn't like it but he couldn't argue with him about it because it was the law they raped a girl or he raped a girl you see what it's talking about now what the other if a man find a damel that is a virgin which is not betro and lay hold on her and lie with her and they be found okay no where somebody knows about it when the man that lay now this is one that's not a man find a dam that is a virgin which is not betr not engaged all right and lay hold on her and lie with her they be found then the man that lay with her shall give unto the dam of his father 50 s of silver silver and she shall be his wife because he had humbled her he may not put her away all his days now brother R said it don't matter what she does that's the scripture he's using he said it doesn't matter what she does went home couldn't do it yep why because he caused the prop and a man shall not take his father's wife nor discover his father's skirt do you understand vows are serious acts are serious right why don't we want to be right amen that's right but why are we not willing enough to stand up to the fact of admitting we're wrong and saying God have mercy oh I'm born again it don't matter what I done back there that's the biggest lie I've ever heard well you don't believe the new birth takes care of everything why would brother R say that if a woman comes to you tells you 10 years after you married you got a right to that she was untrue to you you got a right to put her away and marry again he said we don't BR those clothes you see church it's not playtime right that's it it's not just playtime we'll come back to this and doing it but if you want to go on over one more scripture right and talk about when a man had taken a wife and find some uncleanness in her right now I've proved it to you right here before and we'll get back into it later and prove it we don't have time that doesn't mean they had to have intercourse the very word that the definition comes from tells you that you find some uncleanness in her and sure ain't she didn't take a bath little girls young girls don't let these men touch you right if you volunteer to let them touch you you're unclean give them a good wrap across the face amen well he might hurt me will he's hurting you anyway right they don't have nothing to do with him no more amen a boy won't respect a girl's privacy of her life you don't need to be going with him I don't care what his brother ROM said about that girl said he smells so good and got pretty feet that's right a lot of things could have been solved if we have just tried to been right amen right that's right and if you really correct a boy and him a decent boy he's going to line up that's right if he's a good decent boy especially if his mom and dadd has taught him right see we've taught our kids from the time this church started right here cuz I didn't know it before then don't you ask a girl to marry you till you get ready to marry cuz if she accepts you're married right and you don't come back later and say well Daddy I didn't want to marry that one daddy stand here and says you're married right you're going to live with it right what you see it's just marriage and divorce it's just just divorce for anything you just we just we just don't want to live together we just get a divorce there is no word divorce in true Christianity no sir amen there is no word divorce for a woman that's exactly right that's pure B right now you show it to me in the Bible if you can we live in a day when modern terminologies is so messed up everything until maybe sometimes you may have to get a separation from your husband to get you to P child support or something like that you you may even be forced to go down and apply for a formal separation but there's no word divorce that's right you said but that just makes it so hard my mom had a good way of saying you said it to yours I'm sure she said you make your bed hard you'll sleep in it that's right amen right that was good terminology we ain't got nobody to blame but ourselves with the situation we're in but thank God there is a Grace of marriage and divorce right thank God there is a Grace of marriage and divorce right that can set us free because it's what I said in a while ago I don't see how that see a man and two or three wives is not a type of Christian church right if a man's got two or three wives he he can't be typing Christ in the church if if the woman got to her three husband she can't be typing Christ in the church and I thought it was Christ in the church it was going in the Rapture right and I told you you can go by the grave why do you think marriage and divorce had to be preached right sure absolutely if we didn't need it as a brother here one time trying to preach you he said when you got born again he said that took care of all your amical problems I got to run up here and sit that ain't right well if it is why the prophet preach married and divorce he just preached a new birth nobody looks down on nobody else that's right because after we finished all of the Natural Life then we're just capable of stepping up to the point of understanding what Paul said it he espoused us Y and how that he could say that some of you were this and that the other but he said now you're clean am speaking of a time that they would come that we could be totally clean Body Spirit Soul amen that's right there could have never been a change of the body this is what I believe what do you believe it or not I don't believe it ever could been a change of the body without the grace of marriage and divorce that's right right but then see we were all married to Satan he was our nearest of kin in the Book of Ruth sir amen right he said well brother D you just don't believe what the new birth can do I'm sorry I'm just playing if the new birth could take away of all our marital problems all why did the prophet have to preach it why did Paul have to preach it right why did Moses have to preach it right I was thinking the other day you know that Moses when we get around to it Jesus said because of the hardness of your heart in other words you wanted it Moses didn't tell you you could do it for everything he said you wanted it but see brother brandham didn't come along to tell us everything was okay he come along to tell us what wasn't okay right that's it and what we needed to get right amen and if we don't get it right we're going by the grave I'm not de christianizing anybody to say they're not Christians never have but why wouldn't a true Christian want their life straight right right but see are we like the lady that said if I tell my husband he'll divorce me he said Jo done last year y so which one do you want the husband or God come on church this thing goes into a spiritual condition that's right that you and I were married to organize religion right by our vows amen we made Y and if he don't disallow those vows we're going to face them we can holler New Birth all we want to we better be concerned with marriage and divorce right but do you understand what I'm saying now to get this part out of the way an engagement a spouse betro vows makes a wedding and the other things take place because of the wedding right and consummates or what you call completes the wedding brings it more into greater things that's right but you married by your word amen that's it so kids just don't go playing with the word amen that's right and For Heaven's Sake you better tell that boy or that girl that you going to married one day you better tell them the truth about your life yes sir amen amen most people only preach to the woman all preaches to the man and the woman both of them are virgins right read to Corinthians he speaks of the man's virginity as well as the woman's virginity right amen m let's Stand Together come on just don't make your committ but if you make them just be honest enough to stand up say done am brother randoms even told us how to solve marital problems there something that you doubt have a problem he said and you know what the rough part about it is if my wife was to run around on me she's got to go get the man she run around with and bring him to come back to me according to brother Brown straighten it up you say no that's too embarrassing what is your soul wor that's amen do we not want to be right amen sir why wouldn't we want to be right amen and why wouldn't we even in the spiritual say that we were married to organiz I've had people right here tell me said I I wouldn't really in them churches cuz I didn't know what to talking about yeah you w't quote brother Bram brother Bram said I was in the Baptist Church I carried a Baptist Bible and converted them to a Baptist faith you want that quote our Prophet was willing to admit where he stood but how about us what we got goad 152 in the red book living by faith anybody have need I care
