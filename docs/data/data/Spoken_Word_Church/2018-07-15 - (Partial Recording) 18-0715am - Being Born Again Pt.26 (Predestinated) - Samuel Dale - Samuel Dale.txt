right the fellowship meeting at brother pageants so it's 3:30 anybody wanting to go let us all know already got some planning so just make sure you you let us know and we'll try to ride together do whatever we can do not that far this time cuz it's just a little over the past Gainesville you know to get to that but just remember that all right now the Lord willing this coming Sunday brother royal Soriano will be with us for the weekend remember that then the next weekend which will be the 29th brother Keith Reed will be with us for that weekend alright then on the Wednesday of which would be 8 1 of August my brother Danny del mundo is gonna be with us on the Wednesday remember that and then on the Sunday which is 8:12 brother Quinn will be with us to minister for the weekend alright then brother land land will be the next weekend so we've got pretty well the weekends covered we've got one gap in between there and so we'll do that and remember those those announcements aren't because we are we try to to do what we can at this time of the year that'll Fellowship who enjoy the minister brother had come in and and minister and forest and everything we really appreciated behind all right we got to I guess we got all the announcements huh Heavenly Father we thank you for this day and your grace thank you for loving us thank you for caring for us and we just ask you now to bless and guide each one as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts and deliver us from ourselves and plantiffs Lord into your word because that's our desire more than anything forgive us of our many failures because we know we fail you and just cover us by the blood Lord we need you so much just have your way save the lost lord heal the sick and deliver those that are downhearted because you promised it you said you'd send your word and heal us and deliver us from destruction so we can depend on it have your way now as we talk about you in your word Lord in Jesus name and the weight will be ministering this afternoon so getting him back in through the rains and probably if he wants to we can take winds to you that'll pull him over and give him an extra time in before the rush time starts okay does it feel quite a while that won't be nobody ministering but business persons like that we appreciate it all right tisha I mean excuse me Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever alright now let's go to Ephesians 4 verse start with verse 7 but unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ now that's written down there's we're not all the same it's according to the measure of the gift of Christ alright now what's that you read the scriptures we read them for so long trying to make sure that we read things you know and didn't leave loophole because we were studying the Godhead and we were trying to get it all in order and getting everything lined up and we're going to say everything right you know but we found out the word of gods right anyway but then just listen to the thought now to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave now what what did he give back here he gave gifts what did he give and he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists some pastors and teachers so he gave that to the bride now what for for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till our until we come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to deceive but speaking the truth in love may grow up once now being born again may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making a nurse in crease of the body unto the edifying of itself in love now they don't have this for put up on the screen but I want us to read verses 8 and 9 back over again then pick up another scripture wherefore he saith when he ascended up on up on high he now who's just talking about who send it up the cross the Lord Jesus Christ right that's what I said we we shouldn't have to say now wait a minute I'm not a Trinitarian you know we ought to understand that enough to listen to what's said without saying well what he says that can sound like a Trinity see he more for he says when he let when he ascended up on a high he who the Lord Jesus Christ the one is recent read down here that descended and everything else all right and he led captivity captive and gave gifts unto men now this one that ascended gave gifts unto men now where did he get to give them now they don't have it but if they can snatch real quick and maybe they can pull it up we're going to Psalms 68 in verse 18 look what it says thou has descended on high thou has led captivity captive thou has received gifts for men now listen yay for the rebellious also that the Lord God might dwell among them now we know the gifts and callings of God her out without repentance but think about what it's saying thou has ascended up on high thou has led captivity captive thou has received gifts for men all right now here he says he gives gifts so if he gave gifts he had to receive them so how did he get those gifts where do they come from and what is it so we'll think on these things father we just commit it to you now that your loving grace be with us in Jesus name Amen you may be seated now I've tried to explain without you know trying to stir controversy old situations or thoughts or ideas but I've tried to express something to you in the life's three services and I want to make sure you follow that today and then when we get back into ministering then we'll pick up on the virtues and start going what is this and what is that and studying the things like that to go along but see I want you to think about it he had to get those gifts and then he could give them who is it a he see the Lord Jesus Christ Himself ascended on high and he gave gifts word two gifts don't get the gifts come from Almighty God now that was what I was trying to get across Wednesday night it and I would ask you if you wasn't here to listen to that message because I tried my best to pour out my heart to you to let you understand a little bit of what we're saying coach now we're going to read some today I've skipped over it hadn't been reading but we'll read something but I wish you would just sometimes run in you know predestinated gifts run that in your computer run in ordained gifts or gifts that are ordained just put them together put ordaining gifts and get the gifts and callings are the route repentance but then just look at how many times brother Branham talks about the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of the Saints this see how many times he says it what he's talking about so we're gonna read a little bit of it but I want you to understand what I'm getting at you know to the point see I believe that when the Lord Jesus Christ ascended on high then he sent back the baptism of the Holy Ghost to give us a new birth and then he said you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be my witnesses etc and everything he gave gifts he never just come back now he came back onto their Pentecost and gave the Holy Ghost as the gift of God which is eternal life through through Jesus Christ right that's the gift of God that's eternal life through Jesus Christ he gave that to 120 in the upper owned and he gave it to 3000 outside or not he gave eternal life the gift of eternal life all right now I see then that wouldn't all that he gave he gave gifts unto men all right you've got nine spiritual gifts in the the body of Christ and those nine spiritual gifts they can operate that's within the church they can right in brother on city got one of them speaking tongues or somebody interpreted whatever and never use it again it's just one time all right and he's explaining those gifts like that to her that the nine spiritual gifts is what it says when it says seek you the best gift because you can seek that you know you can seek that in the body you as laity can seek God for him to give you gifts and you've got wisdom knowledge all kind of things we'll get into the statue of perfect man and you'll see that this will be very valuable to that point to her then when we start talking about what these things are we need to seek God for the virtues brother Dale I read where is the automatic you know automatic is not an automatic like you think because it ain't automatic to give it to everybody in the world it's only for the bride the virtues in the thing all right we'll get to that point but that's what I want you to think about it and keep in your mind that there's nine spiritual gifts in the operation of the church you got tongues interpretation you got all kind of thing knowledge wisdom you've got the nine spiritual guilt and that can move from one person to another one and God usually and never use you again but it's gifts all right that's what he gives so gifts and callings are without repentance so you can have those gifts without repenting but when you repent and you come to Christ I wish you'd think on this let's see when you a preacher as a preacher I mean you know if you was preacher if you ever be a preacher get ordained before the foundation in the world all right but yet when you come into the world you don't have another thing in order and what it takes it takes the new birth to even put us in line you may have had discernment I remember one brother telling it that he was a bouncer in a bar in a sinful life you know that he would detect things that were fixed in a start plate taking place you know fights and different things problem and he'd go break it up because that was part of his gift so gifts and callings are without repentance you have a gift you had that gift all alone you're born with that gift but that's just in the point of not giving you eternal life well you say can you have the gifts and not have you turn yes you can have the gifts and not have eternal life but if you have the giver why not want the giver I want the giver the gifts go with the giver whether it be design spiritual gifts or whether it be five offices of God in the fivefold ministry I want the giver then I don't have to worry about the gifts but just trying to define what the Prophet said in the nine spiritual gifts you can seek gifts but you don't seek to be a preacher the you're either called before the foundation of the world you're not called alright and see you don't go around trying to seek a gift or pray for it like I've always tried to explain to you you see a lot of young ministers come up they don't have anything they're there they're in their church and they're working the best they can do and and they begin to get this called seem like on their life well to me it was just God calling them to move up in him because he he or to call all of us statue of a perfect man he ought to call the minister first that's his honest name say it we need to call them first because you can't teach others how to be if you ain't got it yourself alright what you see well I've seen a lot of ministers and I've seen it in this message especially young ones move out and you know and then the ministry alright then after a while they just fall away well to me I don't believe God was calling them for a ministry I believe he was calling them to a closer walk with him but they don't understand because they've not been taught they don't know what a calling is the a calling is not a rooster crowing up in a tree yeah you say yeah but I heard voices that's fine I heard this I heard that that's fine but you don't hear Paul saying now Paul said his called to the ministry he said was the word he was to bring the engrafting of the gentiles the mysteries going on from dark into the opening of the word and he said that was his call he said where of I'm called so I believe if ministers a minister they have a part I've tried to explain this to the ministry I believe you have a certain scriptures that are relate to you that will be as part of your life and ministry I believe that because I know what's happened in my own life and what is done and what takes place on earth but see try to get other people to see what you're talking about in the gifts with them not having the gifts that you know well I believe that brother so-and-so don't you think you'll just put him in let him preach he's he's got to call to this now don't run him off you gonna do anything run him off if you want to be a blessing to him and God run him off oh you're you know I don't understand you you know you don't understand me at all because you don't understand God calling somebody don't you worry about it if your call just called before the foundation in the world yeah but brother Dale that's just prophets well I'm glad brother Branham that's why I want you to read the things he said because I know what he's talking about at a profit and how profit is called and and everything but he puts the fivefold ministry right into that same order of calling as he does the profit to be brought well see we understand why brother Branham come to brain the word that was his call to preach but see then we go out and you see them you see ministers go out and they got just and they're really going and everything's working pretty good all right Wanda and all it wants to start falling away I mean are you loose and you know there's God start out on something yeah no you find scrap heaps along the way because they thank their called to preach when maybe they're called to move up in God maybe call to do some work brother enema I've read these over and over and studying them for weeks now and he talks about that you just have gifts and the non spiritual gifts you can do you get a burden on your heart right how many times have you heard me to tell you you get a burden on your heart for somebody pray for them because God is using you to pray and intercede well right that's gives that's not called to preach as gifts but something God put on you to give you and you had it before the world that's where we we need to get that understanding of the scriptures to line it up and see as I said now you got 9 spiritual gifts operating in the body of Christ but you've got a five fold ministry that's predestinated offices now we're quick to use in our explanation that it's not God in three person it's God in three offices right hey power comes off answer it'll come back on so when it does we're gonna be in a bar back there with the computers all right but we'll go ahead we just have to forget that part alright but now listen you understand what I'm getting at see the fivefold ministry is not this the gifts of the non spiritual gift that's for the local assembly that's for the body of Christ in that short working in that church with the five fold ministry God has called them for a special two to make me say in time that'll be between you and God do you realize that our whole dependence has got to be number one on this message being the truth no it ain't of choice for this another the other it's a fact if that's not true then you and I on bad shape but if it is true and that God has moved into stage two of his journey and let the fivefold ministry preach to the people but for the people to believe who they are is that the words of the Prophet when the bride come on musician we do have a little bit now in do you realize that you and I are sitting on the greatest opportunity the world has ever seen for a group of people to actually hear from God and as I stay in there then to what is it when the bride realized at who she is and what she's here for she'll be gone but see we said but we've got to do this we got to do that it's alright but we need to check some of our goddess to do the cold I've seen a lot of people run after these young ministers especially and they're moving Xand the gifts they have and their signs and wonders and they've run out of them like crazy and it run out there for a little while and then they come floating back I'm not throwing off on nobody for doing that I mean saying no problem I'm just saying thank God if they kind of caught on to the truth but it's not the signs and the wonders is supposed to be I thought it was the word I thought you was to check anybody by the word that they was bringing alright see there next to five for ministry what do you realize church where a minister stands that's why you think that brother tells us that no no you realize where the ministry stands will be unto me if I don't preach the truth you realize you could make it not miss it because of some preconceived thought or idea that I had but you could have your heart right in God and things could work but I'm telling you straight as I can tell you brother branham brought the message but now we got to depend on the fivefold ministry to break that down he said some of it you know like big nuggets and then you're breaking it on down into smaller alright that's not a direct quote that's a problem that's a paraphrase quote from a lot of us ministers cuz if I can't find it tour but I know what he's talking about he's talking about the word has to be brought to us and if that man would stand and listen to ministers minister and say thank God for that ministry right but do we do that do you pray for the pastor you pray for these ministers I pray every day for these ministers do you pray for the pastor but do you pray in a line Lord help the pastor is sick and eat it or do you put it in there to finally Lord keep him straight on the word because my dependence is upon the word that he's bringing these ARS what gifts are you think about it this for a second I'm talking about a gift you know that what a gift is now God didn't that's what I was illustrating that to start with using it from Psalms - yeah Jesus is the working in the middle he got to give from God and he priced it to mankind that's not trinitarianism that's just terminologies words using to express the thought because he brought the ministry he chose them you never thought about was listening to the Bible being read and all you never thought about you got to put all the Gospels together you ever thought about what really happened give me a second here's Jesus walking down through there and there's Peter James and John they ain't never seen you they don't know who he is what's going on he watched he said come on follow me you know what Peter didn't get up and say let me go tell my mother I think my mother-in-law sick I better do that first let me go tell my wife but her her mother is sick and me and then I'll come follow you no he just got it walked but you see that's what one author wrote take the same situation over into one of the other writers you know Matthew Mark Luke and John they each one tell things it's a little bit different and then you'll see that Jesus comes along he has a great meeting Peter James and John is in the meeting they've heard they've listened they've seen the signs and wonders and when he said come follow me they knew where he was going what he's gonna do right what do you say it I'm saying it takes two five whole ministry it's not one Minister for the perfecting of the Saints there's no such thing brother Brown doesn't say your pastor he's does say we read them your pastor is ordained to lead you through if he's ordained I don't mind saying all that he says all right but you see there's got to be a fire phone can't do it for one you gotta have a fivefold ministry so he said Peter James John really checking you're doing Messiah I'm Matthew is the only one he director he spoke to to come follow me and there's no other explanation and the other three Gospel as to amount of time it's just like he said but you don't understand you don't read your Bible in the correct way I mean what if a man come walking right through here right now he's gonna said all right no Louise come on follow me well where are you going and what are we supposed to be doing and who's gonna feed us why are we doing all of this you know I mean they'd be a lot involved but it looks like Peter them just laid everything down walked off no go back to the other gospel I'm trying to illustrate a fivefold ministry where one of those would tell only parts read Matthew Mark Luke and John and just compare one to the other I like Luke reading I like him you know what he was not one of the original boy hell I said he wasn't around didn't hear things he wouldn't want a regional 12 I love him more he first starts off he says having perfect understanding he wasn't even one of the originally walked with the Lord Jesus but he had the Holy Ghost lady you see what I'm saying you got four Gospels telling the same account and each one is a little bit different now don't make them one contrary to the other one that ain't the point the point is you got one preacher comes in preaches one way one comes in preaches another way these three ministers here don't preach you're like the each one how their ministry and they're encouraged to do that not encouraged to follow me but to follow Jesus Christ in their own lives if they ain't man enough to get up one day and say brother Dale you're wrong then they're not a part of the five film industry if it's true that I'm home you get what I'm saying don't at least have enough trust in their own ministry to get up and say you're wrong okay because it's a fivefold ministry it ain't a one folk going one we got anybody have a need God let's just start out in the dark now in the light and sing about the original life those men are you God's attributes 376 G God's attributes were manifest to his bride in this last stage we have caught the revelation by the last prop myself but then we know and wanna raise the poor praise the Lord for the original line the original ID the original seed the original world is what I believe the Son of Man is revealed the 7c is unveiled original original the original sangala light we are the Word made flesh today this is what the scriptures say thank God all things are seen within writing them perfect without sin yes we are annoyed a inspired by our see nanananana the original of the original see don't mainly interpret the original word the Holy Ghost betrays what I believe only go this man is reveal the Seventh Seal is under the original light the original seed the ERISA understanding he has opened up at last and sweet victory is ours who were chained down in the bus true to the clay has sounded we have responded to our God was the original line shinola the original seed the but many have published in the Bible sir right many have publishers we're the day
