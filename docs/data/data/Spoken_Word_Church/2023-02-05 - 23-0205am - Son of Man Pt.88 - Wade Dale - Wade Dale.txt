see each and every one of you good to be in the house with the Lord good to see our vesters with us and Susan she's been here before no you haven't either what's your name good to have both of you here both of our visitors we're here with us uh Kathy I see that now thank you sister Janet sorry sorry about that sorry and um good to have them with us and uh you live in Oklahoma I know all about you guys you live in Oklahoma you live in you used to live in the Philippines we have some brothers that uh and sister that's from the Philippines too so good to have them with us today good to make stuff at home and we we love everybody with the love of the Lord and we'll start making announcements um here in just a second but if you want to have your seats brother Ryan come up here he wore red come stand right here several months ago it's been a while you know come over here and get closer to me on camera several months we um we were don't fall several months ago we approached brother Ryan about being a deacon and uh he thought about it and then as brother Terence announced Sunday he said yes and um so according to brother Branham you know we were supposed to announce it and then then you vet him let him see if and you got to see if you want to be of that or not because the Deacon's office is an office that's very it's important it's it's it's solemn we last night if you weren't into Bible study we read the offices of the of the people in the church the pastor assist the pastor deacons and all that and this scriptures we're going to read the trustees and all the different ones we talked about last night so brother Ryan has said yes that he would like to be considered to be a deacon so I'm going to read the offices of the deacon and what they are required to do as we were talking last night the Deacon has a little more requirement than a than a pastor does because the pastor or preacher can can be not married um and be a pastor because hey Apostle Paul was never married right so but now a deacon uh brother random we read last night's they brought somebody's name for it to be a deacon he said he'd make a real good one said but he's not married so that disqualifies him from being a deacon so we've all known brother Ryan as we said before uh he used to ride with us to Fellowship meetings be sick as a dog in the back in the back of that van because we were going around you know mountain roads and and he had to ride up front with us sometimes but you know what he was faithful and then then he disappeared for a little while and he brought Gabby back with him so uh now there have four children girls only girls okay so and there and to me they're just a wonderful household they're a representation of a true family um and and a representation of a father figure in that family and then we now as the Church of of uh Spoken Word Church in Lula Georgia we're going to ordain our brother according to what brother Brown said let me read first Timothy Timothy 3 verse 8. it says likewise must a deacon be grave not double tongue not given to much wine not greedy of filthy looker holding the mystery of the faith and the pure conscience and let these also first be proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless even so must their wives be grave not slander or sober faithful in all things let the Deacon be the husband one wife ruin their children in their house well for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themself a good degree wow and great boldness in the faith which is in Jesus Christ and I'm going to read the office that we have if you ever want to know anything about the officers there's a it's on the wall right there in the in the pastor study that you can read the different qualifications all right the Deacon in this church they must meet the spiritual qualifications according to First Timothy 3 verse 8 and he does meet those qualities their duties should be to assist the pastor in all the ways in which he shall direct such as acting as ushers receiving offering assisting with water baptism communion and praying for the sick and brother Ryan once goes on further and tells us that they are the what the policeman of the church the deacons are the policemen they they are here to number one uphold the ministry of this church right and then police that and make sure that that's carried out in the church in a Godly manner in a Godly manner and and then if there's any problems or issues you're going to have to work out a little bit because you got to get bigger if a big old guy comes through that door right there you got to run up and jump on him you making you hit him with a drum hit him with a drumstick yeah brother round we talked about last night that was a a man came in and shot some shot a minister I shot the preacher and he said if the deacons would have been there and done their job they would have rattled him down before he got the gun out so but that's what you're to do you're to do that you're to go by the book there in Timothy and then uphold the doctrine of this church brother Brown uh they asked him one time said should a deacon uh be in other words one with the doctrine of the church he said if he's not he needs to be voted out because you're the one that you're not you know policemen they don't make the laws they enforce the loss all right so you're you're to enforce the laws of this church and then now is uh if you'll turn around this way there everybody bow your head do not look up does everybody find brother Ryan Bonnet to be worthy and able to do his job as a deacon by the raising of your hand okay all right thank you very much all right you can turn around brother Terence uh brother Bob dad would you come up here we're gonna pray over brother Ryan and welcome him into the into the Deacon ship of the of the church stand right there and you all pray also because it is a job it is a job all right uh also brother Louise why would brother Louise and brother Aaron come on up here too we'll get the ministers involved this is the ministry and the deacons of the church if those of you that didn't know that that was a question yesterday some of y'all are new and you haven't been here um in a while so we have um established this is our this is our pastor I'm the assistant to assist him these are the deacons and these are the three Ministers of the church and uh now we have a new Deacon and we're here to ordain him by laying on his hands the vote's been 100 percent so we now ask the Lord to help brother Ryan amen help him because it's a job it's a step up okay so let's let's come together and everyone pray together dear heavenly father Lord you told us that there would be places in a church father that that you need these offices Lord of deacon at the time and trustee and secretary and and a pastor an assistant pastor and uh Lord the ones that are Ministries in the church Lord to run to church by the Holy Ghost so father in the name of the Lord Jesus May the Holy Ghost rest on our brother Lord we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is Lord a born-again Christian because of his life Lord sometimes makes a lot of us a shame Lord but Lord I pray this should be with him father and that you'll bless him Lord ordain him into the family Lord to where he can be Lord a deacon for you father that he'll uphold the doctrine of this church Lord and then assist in all the different things as the prophet that God gave us Church order thank God you've sent us a prophet Lord to put these things in order and I pray Lord that you'll just anoint our brother with this position father in that he'll use the office of a deacon well and then he'll get a reward father we ask just bless each one standing here bless the congregation as we pray for our brother Lord there will not be any malice or Strife or grief Lord that everything will be done Lord as the deacons are supposed to be the policemen and and if they tap you on the shoulder or someone and and have to get on to you and your children Lord Lord let it be a softness in our heart Lord and that we can do it Lord with Christian Fellowship father I pray that you should just bless him now and take care of his family be with his children be with his wife Lord and they grow in the admonition of the Lord in this Church Father we ask these things in Jesus name amen let's give our brother a big hand how were you when you first started come here 18. 17. how old are you now how old are you now 38. goodness I

out we'll be fine and just remember that thank you all for your support of this church we sure appreciate everything that you that you uh that you believe in I believe we believe that this is a message of the hour and I believe we believe that this is a good place to go to church so I do I believe that let's remember real special just for a moment um uh sister Gwen has a burden on her heart her son Kip you know he's come out of that and he's doing better but they're wanting to send him to a facility in Midtown Atlanta now y'all know as well as I do I wouldn't want to go to Midtown Atlanta much less just to go in but that's the facility they have available for him but let's pray that God will change that you say well I know we're going to pray that God will change it bring him back up here closer and continue his healing and he he was he was in a bad way just several weeks ago and now he's at least he's able to be alert all right so let's just keep that ancestor Gwen in our prayer so let's go to the Lord the heavenly father Lord today truly is the song says Lord we got so much to thank you for thank you for salvation thank you for healing thank you for giving us just air to breathe thank you for giving us good jobs Lord good spouses good boyfriends girlfriends children Lord thank you for all the good things you've given us Lord now as we sit and listen to you father just for a few minutes Lord I pray that you'd be with us take care of us Lord in a mighty way heal the sick be with the family there with sister Gwen that you'll change that situation Lord and that we'll see you working in that part Lord I pray you'll be with sister free to all the different ones Lord has asked for request of prayer sister Johnny Lord and all the ones that are not here that are watching in I pray that you'd give them Supernatural strength also Lord just give us today our daily bread and forgive us of our sins Lord and the many mistakes that we make against you Lord may we today Lord just just bathe us with the Holy Ghost just give us Lord something that we can carry on in life with Lord just be with us in the furtherness service in Jesus name we pray amen the Bible says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us now as we've been speaking and for some of the ones that have been here that was Jesus Christ the first time he did it now it's the word made flesh in me and you all right so and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you may be seated the Lord has blessing to the reading of the word someone asked last night about what is a seed well that's the seed is not just a little seed like this the seed is the word of God so in the beginning was the seed and that seed was made flesh and dwelt among us and what were you you were an old Sinner and God raised you up out of that gave you the seed word of God and now we what we live by that we love it we love Revelation as we're going to talk about here in just a little bit brother Robin talks about Revelation being what there's no greater power there's no prevailing power as a revelation all right so what we thrive on that see yesterday altar in the Bible study I we thrive on Revelation everybody's like oh man this you know we're all back and forth and and we were there was something going on about what was it Aaron so brother Aaron's in the back room and he's nobody knows he's back there and I we said something about angels and we'll read it today talk about judging angels and he be brought the scripture out in Jude about that because somebody had a question is how do we judge Angels if they're perfect well the angels are not perfect the ones that fail anyway because they what they fail all right so they're gonna have to be judged according to Jude so there's an answer for everything there is a Bible question brother Ryan said there's a Bible answer so we have and and brother Brian tells us he says we have Satan's answer because we don't want to go around being confused we don't go around having a bunch of questions in our mind what about this what about that what about this number one you got to establish is is this is right the Bible's right that's the absolute we can read other books self-help and all these other things that's okay but the Bible is our absolute that's what brother Ram said he says faith final resting places where in the word of God all right in the word of God is where we got to go back to John 8 verse 31 says slow down Jesus said to those Jews that believed on him if you continue my word then you are my disciples indeed and what and you shall know the truth not know of it you shall know the truth and that truth will do something in your life it will set you free if you know about the truth that will not set you free but if you know the truth because who is the truth Jesus said I am the what the way the truth and the life all right so we got to put it back into that perspective that Jesus Christ is the one we're looking at because he's the perfect one and then now that perfect one lives in me and you and he gives us officers as we were talking about last night in about just a few minutes ago with other Ryan different ones he gives us officers that he works through he works do a fine fold Ministry not one this is not a one-fold it's not a one-man job amen it was at a time brother Branham was he was the one that would come with a gift with a prophetic gift to bring us prophecy to bring us more clarity to the word of God and now he went off the scene and he gave it to what Ephesians 4 12 Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for what your perfection in mind for all of our Perfection for the perfecting of the Saints so we believe in that we believe that you can't get perfected you can't go up this stack to a perfect man without somebody teaching you Paul says we need a teacher according to the book of Galatians we need a school Master to bring us to Christ we need somebody to be able to explain the things that's why we Bible study we had seven or eight different questions and they were kind of scattered around in different places and we tried our best to answer all those questions but they were questions someone had a question in their heart that's why I believe that we are stronger by questions as people asking questions II Peter 1 verse 5 says beside this giving all diligence that's where we've been now on the Statue of perfect man act to your faith virtue virtue knowledge your knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and patience godliness now we're at knowledge we're going to try to get to Temperance but if you would pull that chart up just for a moment well we can see this is you this is the person this is you that your your daily life what your life is as a Christian what is going to and to me having the knowledge of God tells us how to work these things out like last night if that was a question there's not 17 different answers to a true Bible question there's only one answer and if you have a question on the Bible question go back to the prophet's message and let him clarify what what the the message said in the Bible all right so because remember he said it was the Love Letter it was the in between is what we have to read to get a revelation so uh that's okay if I can't find the chart that's fine but I want to go back just a step the Bible says add to your faith now what is your faith your faith is the new birth add to your new birth virtue now you say well I don't need it why'd the bible say that if you didn't need it if you got everything you needed and you do get everything you need you got every brain cell you need some of us lacking some of us has more that's okay but you have brain cells the same brain cells you have when you're a a kindergartner is the same brain cells you got when you're a 12th grade and you go up into college same brain it's just what develop more you've not added parts to your body to make you stronger or different if you were a baby you had all your parts same way with being born again when you were born again you had all your parts to be able to become an adult they're by with me we can look at nature and see exactly the way Christianity that's why it's so it's so easy for us to see how that God deals with people and as we were talking about last night listen God wrote this Bible so that we can understand it he didn't write this Bible so he could confuse us now he confused them but he wrote this Bible so that you and I could not be confused well I don't know if he he should have wrote it a different well you're not God he's God and he knows everything he knows exactly that 66 books of the Bible and ever how many chapters ever how many verses that's exactly how much men you need to get out of here with then he sent us the message of the hour to fill in all the gaps to answer all the questions so that we can go further so we can what add to your now look add to your new birth add to your faith in other words you have the faith is yours now once you're born again that faith is yours and then you've got to add to that and that word add remember we looked at it several months ago we've been on this for you know eight months but add to your faith that word add in the Greek Lexicon is Minister so minister to your new birth well I got it brother I understand at home yeah you didn't get it can be quiet if you want to you didn't get it add to your new birth as we were talking last night listen you're born again experience somebody asked about you know the characteristics of them you're born again experience is not going to make your life just be some bubble dance no Satan's gonna turn every gun on you and you're going to have troubles and trials but you're gonna know how to do that you're going to know how to get through that it is a testimony what's the first four letters of that t-e-s-t you got to go through a test before you get a testimony all right so your test is if Satan says oh you didn't get it you didn't get it because you're you're thinking wrong well no that ain't got anything to do with it oh I'm sorry y'all don't think wrong am I in the right crowd well I told him pray for me then because I have them if you don't then pray for me so now who else had bad thoughts thank you all right some of you are still thinking about those bad thoughts but that word add means to minister so we get we get born again the word of God is alive in our heart and as mom was saying last night when we say heart you know you've been taught long enough when we say heart that means soul that doesn't mean that thing okay the heart of a man we read that the the definition of that a long long time ago but this is your soul this is your spirit and this is your body so in your soul is what either Faith or doubt you either got the devil inside of you today or you got God inside of you today there is no gray area there is no in between yeah about with me and you know what you're going to express that out because the soul is the nature of the spirit the soul is going to emanate out into your memory reason conscious affection imagination and you are going to do the things that that inside God tells you to do I don't know about you but when I was a Devil's Child I did what the devil did now that I'm a Child of God it's still hard to do what God tells you to do but at least you've got something inside you've got an anchor you got a Rudder you got something to they'll tell you no you don't need to do that anymore or turn your head don't it wasn't it wasn't hard for me to go into a beer store when I was BC before Christ right because that was what was inside of me that's what emanated out it didn't bother me don't go now I don't want to the want to got pulled out of me same thing with all when we look in the Book of Luke the unclean Spirit goes out of a man out there he is out some of them kicking and screaming well what do they do though they go out and then they come back and if you haven't got that thing sealed with the holy ghost seven more demons worse than the one that left you is gonna come back and make you very religious and you're going to sit in a messy church and die brother Brown said that's where the quote comes from Brother Adam said you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day of your life on your spirit and die and go to hell because your Soul's not redeemed your soul is still the devil until it's redeemed that's why it's called Redemption he purchased that he purchased that whole guy but he had to start on the inside guy because there's the faith or doubt then you go out in the spirit realm the spirit realm has what memory reason conscious infection imagination now if God's inside there he's working his way out if Satan's in there he's working his way out but what Satan is doing though Satan is now bombarding this way to a Christian that's why we still have problems we still have issues that's why the Bible says add our minister to your new birth listen prophet of God tells us you can't wait for these doors to be opened to come to church I don't know why you don't understand that because it's a desire it's something that pulls me here it's not something if it's drudgery you need to head out that door or come to the altar one of the two right because you're going to either come in better or worse now that's what and I can understand that more I used to think about that quote and I thought man I don't know how that is I know what it is now if I come in that door with something and I don't get rid of it and I go out back out that door it makes me worse but if I get rid of it while I'm in here I'm a lot better when I go out that door so are you so add to your new birth virtue add to your new birth knowledge as I said before last Wednesday night that knowledge is not the knowledge of Acts 2 38. it's not the knowledge that the message is right that's down there where it says add to your faith because your new birth is going to take you to the message of the hour eventually you may not you may have got born again out in the world or you may I mean I don't know the world without another denomination but where are you sitting today who are you saying today you're sitting here you're believing no a message of the hour so add or Minister look Minister what nourishment Minister nourishment to supply furnish that's what these virtues are for it's to furnish you it's wonderful to have a house a couple of you have got new houses she never had Furniture in them what kind of house is it well this is my beautiful home Where'd I say it I'll just sit on the floor no you furnish that house you bring in a stove and a refrigerator and a and a uh a chair and a recliner and a real good recliner too well then you mash the button and goes [Music] heater turns on well I'd always be the same way with the word of God you want the best today ask for a real good recliner to furnish your house to be supplied Minister unto or assisted you and I have come to this church to what to be assisted in our new birth to give assistance to what you need because you're not going to get it out there you're going to get it in here this is this is the place where you fill up yes yes this is where you get your fuel for tomorrow or the next day or the next day but the supply so add to your new birth so from now we're going to say add to your new birth instead of adding to your faith add to your new birth or minister to your new birth because today either you got faith or doubt now I am ministering to your faith or I'm ministering to your doubt you're saying I don't have to do that I don't understand this I don't understand that that's okay if you do that don't stay that way though add the new birth then add to that new birth minister to it I love to hear ministers preach come on that's where I get my number not when I'm told to why do we get in this shape because there was a a bug that eat everything down even in the Statue of perfect man they had these virtues in the first church right background a little bit just bear with me they had these virtues in the first church age they were working in their life Silver and Gold Have I None but what I have combined to thee rise up and walk uh by their Shadow Paul had had pieces of his garments laid on people that's why we have prayer cloths that's where we get that from we take prayer cloths we anoint them will you play it on a set we've seen cancer healed we've seen diabetes we've seen all kind of healings just by taking these and giving them to people brother Danny on the back road back there he keeps going around with him all the time and don't worry if he gets frayed don't worry if you wash it you're not gonna wash the anointing off of it I keep them in my Bible I keep them in my billfold we got them over the door you can see there's one right there over that door there's one back there over that door what that's protection that's for us to look at as Paul was We Believe Paul was a messenger remember we believe Paul had the Holy Ghost all right so then the anointing according to the Bible was that they took cloth off of Paul and give them to the to the people all right and then Jesus was touched on the Hem of His Garment all right so that's what we guess not Hocus Pocus and it's not something like Catholicism where you got to light a candle and you got to do it no now it's the word of God and I believe those I believed when those things are placed on you and I don't have to explain to a lot of you what it's for but it is for us to believe what's already been preached to us all right so Joel says I will restore so we're going to have a restoration of as I was reading last night brother Brown talks about the restoration of gifts when the restoration of gifts comes there's a restoration of power that was speaking in tongues it was all these gifts but brother Brown said the problem with them was Pentecost they stayed there they honed in on the gifts and said you got to be speaking in tongues to get the Holy Ghost the prophet of God said no God what God added God added to some people's New Birth and they moved on right that's the same way with me and you we can't stand still we got to either move forward or backwards one of the two but I will restore to you the years that the locusts eat the canker worm caterpillar Palmer worm my great Army which I sent among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed now on the restoration of bribetary I kind of picked this up I wanted to read this brother that was kind of covering a little bit last night and um and if you'll understand that that this whole thing's in a loop everybody with me this whole thing's in a loop and if you'll read um an Intervale brother Brown goes to outer Court intercourt holy of holies and then all of a sudden you're back out here under justification again so we believe in this church and preach it that brother REM did too that there's three stages of justification three stages of sanctification and three stages of the new birth all right Now by with me on that all right but what it's the progression of the same justification yes you know you did it and God forgave you of it put it in the sea of God forgetfulness never to be remembered again and we go fishing we go digging them back out leave him alone but there's going to be a time when them do they start to a perfect man to where brother Brown says the real you didn't do it that's powerful the real you in other words that new birth that you have that you have nurtured that you have added to that never did it to begin with if you're born again today inside of your soul is eternal life something that never ever lied cheated come on people that's what you got inside you got the new birth you've got Perfection inside of you you're just gonna have to what let it out and you got to know how to let it out so let brother around me explain this thing got eat by four bucks right we just read them now and if four messages of death killed the tree this is restoration of the broad tree if you need to know four messages of Life restore the tree justification sanitation baptism the Holy Ghost the word justification sanctification baptism logos the word more of more of more of adding what does that do gives you a bigger number add so we're adding something to our faith adding something to our new birth says do you get it amen for God said I will restore because see a lot of people you know brother Brown talks about three being Perfection and four is not a good number if you use it wrong but four is an Earthly number of man you can use it right because there are four death Messengers eat it down there had to be four life Messengers bring it back all right so by four death Messengers he killed it then for Life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of gifts the Holy Ghost stop right there no add what was the fourth the word and the Word was made flesh in me and you the word what the word there were four great prophets one of them Martin Luther he began to shine a light there was a little light just a very small strength of justification Along Came Wesley stronger sanctification after Wesley comes to stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great prophet we know it was the Holy Ghost right but in the last day look Malachi 4. Elijah's to come with the very word the word of the Lord come to the prophets in the evening light it is to come forth to restore and bring back what turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of God what was the faith of God those virtues the faith that was once delivered to the Saints here is now there is now here all right four Killers took it four Messengers destroyed it four messages of death took it away in Dogma four messengers of righteousness restore her back again prophesy son of man can these bones live remember the bone thing when you start talking about the bones the bones are fine putting the senior back on putting this up but without the Breath of Life breathe whole Breath of God now breathe whole Breath of God why that's the fourth stage that's bringing the life back right here wish we had time I got to write it down but I have to miss it prophesy can these bones live what's the four stages of that coming forth of that church what's the four stages of Ezekiel Dry Bones coming forth but the life only comes not when the sin your skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that fourth message of life I will restore saith the Lord hallelujah Glory praise be to God the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same signs watch justification brought back to Paul sanctification brought back the bar doctrine of Holiness while brought back the leaves Pentecostal leaves amen waving of hands Hallelujah fellowship and that's where the leaves are they're like this right here the leaves in a tree but you know what it takes wind to blow those leaves it takes the Holy Ghost to do that what brought back the leaves Pentecost what is it Pentecostal leaves clap their hands Joy rejoicing Pentecostal what the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ has again centered himself like that cap of the pyramid you look behind my head first line justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost then the coming of the cap what is it the Holy Ghost Bunch being honed out that's us hi there I contend it's us the Holy Ghost Bunch being what hold that why do we need to be honed out if we had Holy Ghost add so that what so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had now that's the issue we got down through the church ages it was in the first three Church ages but after that one happened dogmas and Creeds father son Holy Ghost denominations up until this time they have eaten that tree down to nothing but they can't kill it he has to restore according to the Book of Joel it will catch the whole thing when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture whether Justified Sanctified the baptism in the Lord goes that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the tree of life is growing again that's us no no Jesus is a tree of life we are a tree of life we're part of that tree Now read you in just a few minutes I I made a quote the other day about the The Vines being intertwined I'll read you a quote where brother Adam says that but we're talking about adoption we're talking about coming to a stage to add where you're not just a Christian that just gets beat all the pieces and Satan just absolutely just Rings your neck every service and every day of the week now there's got to come a place that you have Victory and it's not victory in the world or victory in Satan it's victory in Jesus all right I heard an old old story that's not old anymore it's brand new shall we come to adoption where God can use us where he can place us and use us for what he wants what he wants not what you want I was going to um insert here because it talks about adoption so Brother Richard had a question last night that we didn't get to Brother Richard Negron from Ohio so let's let's read the quote and the adoption series says tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside look outside of this time right now right now this time when there was ever a time in history that manifested the time of deliver all nature nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of manifestation of what trees rocks churches pews some books tapes oh excuse me people yes the word made flesh in you groaning waiting for the time of manifestation why before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out all the Old Testament on down there couldn't have been manifestation it had to wait till this time now all things has been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of God coming back now watch and the spirit of God coming into these men that was his question these men I'm talking about Bob black I'm done by Samuel Dale I'm talking about the Luis Durango talking about Aaron Roberts yes come on fill in the blank put your favorite preacher in there if he's a real true preacher so the spirit coming into these men because there's only going to be a certain group and I listen for our visitors and anybody else we're not exclusive God makes us that way though if we if you'll put yourself because remember what happened to the disciples they were so different remember they were called Christians because they acted like Christ in other words they were so different they noticed it now what happened though that's what killed a lot of them that's what killed Jesus because he was different and listen they may not kill you naturally but they'll kill you spiritually so the spirit's going to come back in a group of men I believe I believe that so perfectly until their Ministry their ministry will be so close like Christ till it'll join him and his church together there's been a great division that's been over the word of God why do we do this why don't we do that why you do this why do that why do this why is that what's my old saying lead follow or get out of the way that's what my old football coach said and it stuck with me forever listen lead follow get out of the way find out your position if you're a follower that's fine but the follower has to have a leader and I don't ever want to be in the way and neither do you want to be in the way of somebody to get their new birth to get their attitude we want you to be able to add to in this church we want you to be able to not say I go to Lulu and I've got a college degree in the message of the hour let God do that let the Headmaster do that let the Headmaster give you that degree if the Headmaster gives you that degree then you know who you are you know who you are you know where you came from not just here geographically you know you came from God and you're going back to God I'd rather um want brother Wayne I think was preaching under the grave clothes we get we got a resurrection folks when you got born again it was a resurrection now we got to get a resurrection Brother Robinson out of dead denominationalism all that dead stuff we had inside of us has got to go it's stinking they know what they said about Lazarus but Lord he's thinking that didn't bother Jesus not one bit he didn't have that little cortisol we were talking about he didn't have a release of of fear that didn't bother him he said I am the resurrection and the life and it's where we're going to come to ourselves my friends we've got to come to the knowledge that knowledge not the knowledge you got born again you need to have that knowledge at the bottom all right you need to have that knowledge that you're born again that you're a child of God then you need Holy Ghost knowledge to add to yes your new birth that's what we've been talking about besides this giving all Dylan just add to your faith version to Virtual knowledge that word knowledge means no sense now watch in the Greek Lexicon look knowledge signifies in general intelligence understanding the general knowledge of Christian religion the deeper more perfect and in large knowledge of this religion such as belongs to the more advanced so what is knowledge it's knowing more about whatever you're studying man that's why Jesus said You shall know the truth not that it's just going to be dumped on you but you got to get what you got to get somebody to teach you such as belongs to the more advanced especially of things lawful and unlawful for Christians moral wisdom such as seen and right living in other words you're going to show you say no bro wait knowledge is to be able to do calculus and trigonometry and and you know Power Square and all this stuff not that kind of knowledge that's Holy Ghost knowledge foreign but there were two trees in the garden and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that's Pleasant to the site and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so you've got two trees you've got two branches of knowledge because Jesus said I am the way the truth and the life so there's true the true over here then you've got the knowledge of Good and Evil the false over here on this side all right and the Lord God commanded man saying all right you eat all the trees you can eat over here under this tree of life but if you go over here and eat over this one you're gonna die for in the day that you eat that day you shall die now here we go this is the quote I was looking for the other day in Ephesian Church age brother Adam said now to get the real meaning of what we're about to go into I must caution you to ever keep in mind that religion listen folks religion will kill you I'm religious so is the Devil he's actually more religious than you are he comes to church more than most of y'all spiritual matters if you like is composed of two parts that what intertwine now what is intertwined you think no this tree over here it's all niled up in this ugly tree of life I mean tree of knowledge of Good and Evil it's just all nasty and look so bad and uh do you think the devil looks like the people portray him he's not some guy with a red suit on with a long tail Fork your tongue and all that stuff no he's a brother Brown called him a Slicker he was actually the most beautiful angel in heaven so don't think he's changed he has not changed his tactics one bit right so that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil look if Eve was standing here as an allegory if he was standing in the garden and she looks at the tree of life and then she looked over at the tree of knowledge and good and evil which one did she pick Ed she picked that one because it was beautiful I read it last Sunday beautiful to the eye and a tree to be desired to make one wife desire to make one why so she goes over here and takes this beautiful tree this tree of life over here you know is probably all bloody come on somebody probably got Stripes all over it probably got a few you know looks like this or looks like this so she chose that one because of beauty and what does she choose death now we've got to be able to turn the table and choose life and be the tree of life not just eat off of it but be it now watch this right here the two parts that intertwine border are as opposite as black and white religion and the spiritual world are made of these two trees which had their roots in Eden in other words they had their Roots they started in Eden both the tree of life and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil stood in the midst of the garden and no doubt their very branches intertwined each other have you ever tried everybody we're from the south we know what Kudzu is our sisters from the Philippines may not know but in Oklahoma I think the guy in Oklahoma too but they brought this weed this weed that's supposed to take care of erosion they brought it into Georgia and South Carolina different places from China China it was made in China control erosion after The Boll Weevil came through and people quit putting cotton out and and the brains would come and it'd be ditches will they give us Kudzu have you ever there there is somewhere in that Kudzu pile that you look out on the side of the road and there's like Acres of it there's somewhere there it came from one route one route but it so intertwines you can't find it unless God tells you where it's at same way in your life you're hey your life is all tangled up but some were in there if you're a child of God something is growing as we were talking about last night it's not a seed it's the word of God that you're listening to and you're eating it and you're becoming it and then you know where to cut it down you know where that very root of evil is because that root of evil was inside of you to begin with so you know where it originated from so now that's what that's what just tear that thing apart now listen that's the Ephesians church is that same Paradox the church is made up of good and bad now the Ephesians Church age was the what First Church age the alpha Church age remember Alpha now Omega has got to be a shadow of that church age or a duplication of that church age Alpha and Omega Church all right so that's just if it's talking about them it's talking about us because we left our first love right not we maybe but we the world the religious World Indian time has lost their first love they are like the wheat a look two Vines make the church two Vines no brother brown two my two Vines makes the world we're gonna read Matthew 24 24 there share arrives false Christ false prophets false anointed people they're like the wheat and tears growing up side by side but true the and he will talk about each one he will call them the church and only the elect the new birth will change your thought it will tell you where the root is right he will call them the church that's why brother Brown said church church Pride churches he said but there's going to come one he stood up one day and he said I don't call you church anymore I call you bride because there's scripture is talking about the bride this scriptures talking about the church he pulled out what he pulled that thing apart by The Roots now what are we doing with it are we trying to put it all back together again no we're supposed to what shun the very he told us what evil was get away from it he will call them the church and only the elect will really know which is the true Spirit only the elect will not be deceived Matthew 24 24 for that shall rise false Christ and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders and so much that if it was possible they shall deceive the very light so way back there in the early church a very short period after Pentecost he's talking about 80 30. the false Vine got so intertwined itself around the True Vine and we find these D's in the Nicolaitans and that spirit is going to be found fighting the True Vine what until God destroys it how's it going to destroy it by you and me knowing which one is the true and which one is the false and like brother Brown said no where the two Spirits are are the two Spirits working in the framework of this church and be able to discern which one's which and be able to what be able to withstand the devil in his actions by what by having Holy Ghost knowledge more than just knowledge of Acts 2 38. knowing you got to be adopted knowing you've got to be part of the seals they were saying your name's in the book it's part of us man I'm telling you if you realize your names in that book Hallelujah Satan can't stop it false Christ can't stop it false teachers can't stop it the Devil Himself could walk right in here and he cannot do anything to your soul if you're a Christian today that thing is like a 10 billion vote if he tries to touch it he is going to get burnt because you know what that's God's going to put him in the Lake of Fire the Lake of Fire is the Holy Ghost Fire right it's not fire that it's not fire that burns Holy Ghost knowledge the factor condition of knowing something with what familiarity you're familiar with it it's not strange to hear what we teach here it may be to some that just started but it's not strange for all of us that we talked about last night as brother Wayne Lawson different ones that tell you and and you know to give to give a rose I'm going to give it now the preachers that come to preach in this church tell me that this is the one of the freest churches that they can preach in brother Wayne said hey I didn't have to explain a bunch of stuff he said your people already knew it but there's a lot of people scared of it there's a lot of people scared of it I heard one preacher who's not in the message anymore he said I don't like to preach in Louisville Georgia they know too much praise God if I got later sorry brother Dale's got laity that can now preach the preachers praise God my brother Tim cross he don't mind me saying it he's coming to preach for us the end of this month because I got to do a wedding in Ohio so he's going to be here the weekend I said he said well he he was we were kind of just discussing that and giggling a little bit but he said well he said I'll try my best to stay you know on the line I said well don't worry I said if you don't a couple of my sisters will meet you in the back door before you get up I ain't worried about nobody else saying about it anything about it so I'll promise you I'll see Trudy McMillan on them what do you mean by and we and we laugh but you know what I don't mind that doesn't make me uncomfortable does that make you uncomfortable doesn't make me uncomfortable it's a shame that if our sisters in this church cannot preach the preachers the message but why because we've been taught we've stayed here we've listened we've learned we know what the message of the hour the essence of the message we can't quote every quote but we know the answers why did we need the right interpretation of of the statute perfect man brother they was talking about last night there's nobody sits here and preaches 80-something sermons and he preaches like 40 several years ago on one subject the statue perfect man oh yeah they may hit it here back and forth and that's fine we all got our different calling but listen there's going to be one group of people that's going to take a body change and it's because they know who they are they're not going to be foolish versions then Jesus said if you continue my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth that word no means what perceive or understand get a knowledge of perceive and then we talked about it a little bit last Wednesday it's a Jewish idiom for sexual intercourse between a man and a woman Adam knew his wife hey God knew I he said well that sounds bad no read the Bible the Bible says I I've cast out Devils Lord I've done Mighty well he was in Your Name Lord he said depart from me I I never knew you and if you look that word knew up it says the same thing you've never had an intimate relationship with me so I don't know you thank God for an intimate relationship that we know who our husband is and we know what he expects because it's the same character he was literally pulled out of Adam they were one so Adam could understand Eve that might help in our relationship if we were kind of like that wouldn't it X and Y Mars and Venus you know and the sister said amen and the Lord God called unto Adam where are you he said I was afraid now Adam never said that before you and I got to get out of that fear and what'll take you out of that fear good teaching not listen shout speaking that's fine paralyzed there's a time for all that like brother Donnie said he said look there's a time for special meetings he said but where the rubber meets the road is every Sunday and every Wednesday and every Sunday and every Wednesday you go to church you listen to your pastor you listen to your preachers it's not all bubble dancing all the time you have to listen and learn and every once in a while somebody might say Amen be afraid little bride somebody's gonna make it I'm just dumb enough to what believe it's me and you Proverbs 3 verse 13 says happy as a man that findeth wisdom and the man that gives us understanding so wisdom and understanding all comes down to knowledge for the merchandise is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain therefore than gold now watch it has transformed now into a she she is him it's us the bride she is more precious than rubies she is what in this in this allegory she is wisdom but remember brother Ryan said she and the woman is in the Bible is what the Bride of the church and all things thou cast desire are not to be compared into her Length of days is her right inner right hand her left hand riches in honor her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy as everyone that retaineth her Philippians 1 9 says in this prayer this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in what all judgment as we were talking last night the Bible here tells us is do you know the Saints shall judge the world why take why take a brother to court settle it right here because you should have enough wisdom of the Holy Ghost to tell you what to do now somebody out there and that's different okay the people out there they're just they're they're heathens they don't accept the word of God so they can't use the word of God to uh as I was telling you before the little girl that's having some trouble in our in our post office uh she's having trouble but she's not she's never been in church in her life her husband's ever been churching a lot I can't counsel people like that give them some good suggestions but when you start talking about getting them together the first thing the only thing I told her even yesterday I said Kelly you've got to get in church just go somewhere sit down and listen take your husband and your two kids if not I there's nothing I can do for you because see I could tell her to pray more read the Bible come together counsel how can you counsel somebody that don't know a thing about about God no you're not that we shall judge Angels now that was a question last night about judging angels and here in in Jude one of the body Aaron Brother Aaron Minister put the peace together for us and the angel which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation he hath reserved an everlasting change under Darkness unto the judgment of the great day now who's going to stand and be the judge on a great day we are the Saints so judge the world also the Saints are going to judge all those angels that turn God down right this is it right here thank God we got a Bible answer now knowledge just for a second we'll close right here didn't even get into temperance y'all just gonna have to be hold your temper till next week two weeks for some of you you'll explode then thirdly you add knowledge I didn't brother what I did not look at you I did not I looked way over here back to Amy back that way knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to what judge you're judging today whether what I'm telling you is right or wrong you say no I'm just saying you are you're not you're judging yes you laughing now yeah that was judgmental yes well judgment comes in the house from the house of God we won't keep quoting scripture back and forth you all know Amy's a sweetheart they'd have made a bad spot in her whole psyche she's a wonderful girl now Jeffrey and we'll talk about him a little bit because that's foolish where's he at he left he left he left oh no I'm just kidding he had to take care of one of the kids but but look knowledge the judge judge right from wrong how do you judge it if you've got Christian knowledge all right with your virtue and New Birth you judge whether the word is right or wrong but when you can see that the scripture is not contradictory when you see all these what look you can see by Revelation the whole word is wrote In what Mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it then when you get and say punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your faith 70 weeks to Daniel brother around to the spirit of wisdom and I believe now that Spirit of wisdom is come back into the church to make known to the church by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bring the church in or revealing what day you're living in it's all we're living in the end time but what day are you really living in we know they've said end time for years you got to know what day and hour you're living in you're in the bright age you're looking for a resurrection you're looking for a body change and then you're looking for a rapture all right same as Gabriel came to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the church in the last day to reveal these great deep secret things do you understand now Ephesians 1 says give you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and knowledge of him the Bible says and that you may know keep going I need to get to a spot and we'll finish this is one right this is one we're talking about the other day there's Jeffrey there's nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of the word prevailing power in other words overcoming power power that you can take and say hey devil I know what God's talking about I don't know what you're talking about but I know what God's talking about then we keep going on towards his but the prevailing overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us listen I was reading last night brother Ralph said as we get closer to the headstone it becomes more narrow why it's honing off sadly some people are going to be left right here because there's a big wide bottom to it some people are going to go to Virtue some knowledge temperate patience godliness but it's going to get less and less as you come to the headstone see because look right here brother I'm saying however you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism it's staring you right in the face so you don't need that kind of knowledge for water baptism you need it down here we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world we have accepted the Bible I'll finish right here come on musician come on now we have accepted the Bible amen we have accepted the great truths of it but it still is not real to most people wow because the Revelation by the spirit is not there the word has not been quickened the Bible says in second Corinthians 5 21 that we have become the righteousness of God by what by knowing what is a union Adam knew his wife Christ's knew his bride knows his bride by our Union with Jesus Christ did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but became sin for us that we by our Union with him we might become what the righteousness of God the word made flesh if we accept the fact and we must we must have knowledge on this fact that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we are by Union with him have become the very righteousness of God Amen to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing my brother William said pray for Revelation more than anything pray for revelation it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority now look it's not real to the majority of Satan's kids that's not what that said it said it is not real to the majority of God's children wow it is just a good verse in the Bible but we need to have it made alive to us that will take Revelation let's stand to our feet that will take revelation and talks about being our senses being exercised to discern both Good and Evil the word discern is to separate make a distinction discriminator to prefer if you have inside you the Holy Ghost today it will discern whether what I told you is right or not whether whether your body and and part you know the spirit part of you denies it inside your soul you gotta punctuate it with an amen if you're born again and you can say I don't understand that listen because everything's not going to be just dropped into your lap you got to listen you got to study kindergarten versus 12th grade you got to start kindergarten to get to 12th grade all right that's the same way in God that's the way I can understand God it's just by the natural life that we live and that's what the Bible tells us so let's sing a song God bless you [Music] me more like thee Jesus Jesus make me more [Music] and give me a heart that will with love and make me more sing it to him if you ever need oh man me my life oh Jesus I've made me more like these oh and give me a heart how many [Music] [Applause] ways [Music] put it back together more and then you'll go Lord and help him Lord to process what happened to the other person Lord I pray Ed and comfort them on in their time of need just be with each one Lord to teach prayer cloths go to the Lord we know our brothers stands today and what these things will do to our prayer in the name of the Lord Jesus that you'll go to people and help him in his body and also help him in his Spirit Lord save his soul given salvation father give him a chance we pray in Jesus name amen tell them I said hey [Music] and me let's sing that one again that's your prayer today let's lift our hands [Music] Through Me Jesus now that's a commitment if you don't want it he won't come but if you want him he'll drop right down and he'll live his life through you are [Music] [Applause] arrived through me make me more like Jane oh man [Music] let that be your commitment today the world wants you to be like them we don't want to be like the world we want to be like the Lord aha that feels [Music] [Applause] like this amen make me more like thing why do you want to be like the world everybody you know you in the world they want to be a sports star or they want to win the lottery or they want to become this or become that I want to be a better Christian and the whole world they have their ways of doing things if their special sports team doesn't win they go drink some alcohol that devil will tell them just go drink yourself to death and you'll forget about it go take some drugs don't let somebody be sorry for you that don't even sound good but that's what they do out there inside of here if we have heartaches and trials we go to God we call a brother we call our sister hey pray for me man I'm having a bad day having trouble send a WhatsApp please pray and you put everybody together and everybody starts praying I like that I told brother Ron Spencer when I saw him a couple back in uh August I said with all the prayers that are going for you God's got to do something because Satan is just so hand-tied because we're praying people across the country's praying I believe in praying in groups I believe in getting everybody involved and I said we're bombarding that thing inside of you called cancer and you say well it's not it's not been taken care of he's still got it one more testimony that he can stand and preach for an hour and not preach like me I'm talking about priests like a house on fire in a windy day get down in the floor and roll around with stage four cancer you ain't never had that kind of a life but I guarantee if you get the Holy Ghost what greater testimony is is for them to go back well it's still there well it's still there we don't know why you're still alive you know they told him three years ago he had four months to live man can't count because God said I ain't done with him yet I ain't done with him yet you're supposed to have this you're supposed to have that what that symptoms their books said he was supposed to die four months after he had the diagnosis cancer in his in his brain cancer in his lungs cancer on his liver still got it they say but it's not growing and we don't know what's going on well praise God I want the devil to be so confused till he leaves us alone amen didn't brother Brown say we that the devil we want not

go to the doctor and have an x-ray and take blood pressure medicine and all that stuff and he still doesn't wonder why do we then people still come to church why do they still worship that man up
