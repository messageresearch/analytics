chapter 112 amen as we look into the word of God and we I'm going to read from verse 12 to verse 18 and this evening I'd like to speak within the same context yeah the the word expression becomes material amen so the word express ression becomes material Amen Let Us bow our heads amen our heavenly father Lord we thank you God for this privilege you have given to us again to Lord be in your midst and Lord God to hear your word Heavenly Father we realize that the Eternal Word of God being made manifest to us in this hour that we're living in and how grateful we are god father we pray that you feed not just our body nor our spirit but Lord God we pray that our soul would hear from our the aphony when the perfect word oh God is delivered to us oh God which is you amen have your way now as we look to you and believe you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen and amen in Colossians 1 and verse 12 giving thanks unto the Father which has made us me need to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light amen who has delivered us from the power of darkness and has translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature for by him were all things created ated that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions or principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church which is a beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have preeminence may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you may be seated in works is fate expressed 1965 paragraph 106 BR said a Baptist Minister told me not long ago he said I just can't accept Revelation I said then you cannot accept accept the Bible you cannot accept Christ because he is a revelation of God he's God's reveal in flesh simply therefore the whole church is built upon divine revelation amen praise God you know we we look at ourselves as a trium being we are Body Spirit and soul right and let us look at it like this this evening you know we say this morning well this flesh man is an unbeliever he an unbeliever your spirit is a make believer and your soul is a real believer cuz when you receive the new birth it is your soul that is transformed am and the reason why we still here is because this man this house needs Redemption amen so when you receive the new birth your soul is redeemed yes sir amen but this needs Redemption and the problem you have is in this flesh man and in your spirit you know so in church there's malice there's Pride there's Envy there's all these things really that is the nature of your spirit that one morning you wake up and you you love one another and you feel loved and the next day the devil tell you nobody loves you so your spirit is a make believer sometimes he believes and and so there is a suppression because of where you live amen the holy spirit is working on you to bring you into the image of Christ amen but the the attitude or the pressure of this man the alter man the out you live in is causing you Amen to take the influences of the world so you you you you look at the neighbor's car and not only that you like it you wish it was yours that's Envy amen does that make you a Believer but but let us look at them of all Peter the man with the key that unlocked the door Paul the Apostle said that Peter when the Jews was around he separated himself self from the Gentiles but then when there was no Gentiles looking he eat and and all of that with the with the Gentiles and Paul said to him he rebuked him he said Peter you are to be blamed so though even with the new birth Peter had trouble in his emotions really amen because of that Spirit but so so your body is an unbeliever amen but listen when you receive the new birth that body is Justified amen hallelujah and what he wants for his confidence is the first pull he feels he see that's where he lives but your spirit is a make believer and if that Spirit of yours be Sanctified by the word amen you see when Jesus meet the woman of Samaria he did not operate with her flesh she was not sick amen but she needed sanctification the second pull amen believe if she could believe but the soul is a Believer is received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the third pull is operating in him so he knows amen hallelujah so we now look at take that now to the eternal one now Jesus when he was here on Earth you know he comes from the Eternal Word and he comes into theophany in the theophany you know all things and from theophany he comes to the Virgin born body amen now in his debt what happened amen Jesus in his debt he was going back from where he come from I come from God and I'm going back to God is that right that's right amen so in Deb Hallelujah you know while the body was in the grave where was his Spirit he went and preached to the spirits that were in prison is that right amen so when you die I want to say this to you that for your confidence and when somebody dies they don't go in a space of absence this body goes to corruption amen but there's a part of you that's alive in another dimension and that is why if you have ever he the testimony of somebody that has died and was raised from the dead they go into a sphere yeah right where it is Sublime it's perfect amen and right there they realize that this that we are in now is worse than where we're going to amen yes that's why our brother Dixon tell me he said brother Keith I never want to come back amen but I hear your voice when you call me and I come back into that body wow amen but he ask the question how could I live in that for so long for all these years in this corruptible world Amen so as a Believer even de take us back into the presence of God Amen Hallelujah but we come from God Amen we come from the word we bypass our theophany and come into flesh to be tested amen but if you die you step into that theophany house amen Paul said in 2 uh Corinthians 5:21 if my Earthly house in this Tabernacle is dissolved we have a theophany that is waiting high up in the heavens and it's not made with an so in this we are groaning we're under pressure the pressures of this world is upon us waiting to be clothed upon with our house that is in heaven amen praise God now in the first seal paragraph 12 brother B said he said now Christ is the revelation of God in other words he brings God in plain view he came to reveal God because he and God were the same God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself in otherwise you never know just what God was until he revealed himself through Christ then you can see you know I remember in the days when I used to get a publication from Brother Dale catch of uh there were reports from Israel on a daily basis and when the Israelis write about God god Jehovah when they write the word god they write gcore D because they realize that what we say God we we don't even understand what we're saying but when they speak of God they speak of the Eternal one the eternal spirit and because there's no concept not even to write the word they don't write it like that because it would not be the expression of who he is that is why Jesus the Lord Jesus is our only concept of God when the Jehovah's Witness go around and oh Jehovah Jehovah they don't even know what they're talking about amen praise God so here know the prophet was coming up to bring to you the seventh seal amen and in Christ The Mystery of God revealed 101 he says now for a text I want to take out of there for this for for uh this for a text basing it upon the entire Bible he said but I want us to title this Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said Christ be Christ being the mystery of God revealed so the God we speak of it is the Lord Jesus Christ amen and our concept can't go further than that because he is the one Christ Min of God revealed paragraph 141 he said now the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people he couldn't do it as a great Jehovah God who cover all space Time and Eternity he could not he too great to ever be revealed to people because uh it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin he said that after you you went beyond the cycle of hundreds of billions and trillions and trillions of here of Lights here space and on out into an infinite he said into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is but what he wanted to do he loved father wood for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now we get it am now we get it the son of man they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now we get it he says he wanted to express himself that was his one of the greatest treeful purpose was to express himself identify himself with human being to be re to reveal himself in Christ amen and so that's the greatest you will get of the Eternal God he said secondly to have the preeminence in his body of Believers amen that is his bride yeah that he might live in his people amen he could do that he couldn't do that he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them from that and so in the beginning that's exactly what God want you to achieve what God is bringing you into now is what he wanted to achieve in Genesis but sin Mar that picture but God is going to achieve what he set out to do how is he doing it here you are amen amen amen praise God right now sometimes people miss the picture sometimes by a quote or something that was said you know so really now let let us always remember that brother brandham was a son of man he was a prophet right but it was a prophet revealing the son of man Jesus Christ Jesus was the prophet of all prophets amen that's right now they they also use a an expression they said well the the the the message and the messenger becomes one that that's fine if you've got a clear understanding but the message is Jesus Christ and you cannot make a son of man Jesus Christ Moses brother Ben said when you had the word of God to declare to the people it was more than Moses but when the word was declared it was Moses again amen hallelujah so don't take the prophetic for Runner more than a prophet he was not Dy and if there's ever going to be any daty the closest you'll ever get to dat is the bride of Christ being revealed by the word of God don't put it on him put it on her are you with me Hallelujah because the bride is not married to a son of man she's married to the son of man and the two has become one amen hallelujah praise God so in my mind for clarity amen I always remind myself but he is my eleazer amen amen and what was the ministry of Eleazar is to find a bride for Isaac amen it was to find a bride for himself amen so we've got to be careful of the idol of our relics and all that we keep because the reflection is Jesus Christ amen the word expression becoming material if the expression is Christ then the material is Christ amen so if there's any de we're talking about it's not in Jeffersonville it's in you amen Christ the fullness of the goded bodily but you are coming into that fullness amen and Brethren let's hold this really that God is bringing you to a position for a body change and all that fulfill God's purpose is going to have that change brother brother Dale teaches years back he said and if you ain't got the the Fate to make the change then you've got to go by the grave is that right but like when they left Egypt remember they said we will not leave a hoof back in Egypt amen everything that belongs to us is coming out and in this Exodus everything that has the Seal of God is going to come out there is nothing the devil can do to stop you from making it the church might not want you they might not accept you but God will accept you last week I I was preaching I I said you you know the the woman with the alabaster box appointment I said many of us wouldn't want her in in our church because they said she was a woman of the city and she was a sinner and we wouldn't want that woman in our church but Jesus Jesus said wherever the gospel is preach there's going to be mention of this woman if there's not a sinner there's no need for a savior and I don't care where the devil can push you he can't push you where God can't reach [Applause] you amen yeah the Bible says he had need to go through Samaria not because the priest was in Samaria but because a woman was in Samaria hello yes sir they said H Pastor how do you deal with this situation this woman is married five times but not only that worse than that but now she's living with a man that is not her husband how do you deal with that that Grace the grace of God the grace of God that grace of God go further than anything that you can commit on this side of Glory for he stayed there on the cross he stayed there until every sin that was possible that you could have commited was paid for amen she said Messiah come he's going to tell us what we are to he's going to tell us what to do about our martal problems and all these things said I that speak unto thee I am he amen praise God hallelujah amen I had to say that and so you know they said well you know it depends on who your mother and your father is because they said you know the prophet says well I can't see adultery mhm being predestinated yeah so what your mother and father did he said that's not predestinated and I can't see that in the Rapture he said he can't see that in the Rapture but I appli the blood of Jesus Christ because we were all born wrong to begin with amen we were all born wrong so whether you are married or you're not you all born wrong for to begin with is it right it's not the act of your mother and father that is predestinated it's the germ of life and the thoughts of God so that's why when God had to go beyond who your mama is he has to go beyond what your father is are you there with me he had to go back to himself hello so God not looking at all you came here here is looking at what's in him so when he said let us you are part of that amen and there's no mortal and hurt that can change that purpose you said then brother ke how do I know that it's in me it's revealed to you amen hallelujah it's not what you do it's what God did so you know I was on drugs I was doing all these things and then I found God you never find God no no God was always calling back all his attributes amen and in the time appointed Hallelujah you step into your position are you with me Hallelujah and if you don't believe that that you're bound in the blood of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but it reaches to the highest mountain and it flow to the lowest Valley the blood that give me strength from day today it shall never never am lose its power amen the prophet says now paragraph 144 continue he said this is Rich to me just even to think of it see what God's purpose was and why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that then he would never been able to express his fullness is full attribute because he could have been a father there that's true but also he's a savior how do you know he was he is cause I've had the experience he's a savior and he had to express that and how could he do do it only through Christ amen how could he be a son only through Christ how could he be a Healer only through Christ all things are wound up into that one person Jesus Christ it's not wound in your mother and father it's not wound in the denomination you come from it not wound in the country you live in it's wound up in Jesus Christ amen amen so get past your yes today get past what you did in this worlden come up to the point of what he did for you it's not what I did it is what he did Hallelujah 2 Corinthians 5:21 he said that he becom sin for me Amen in other words all the sin that you had commit and could commit he become that and for that he he went to the cross and he paid the price of that sin then he said that you might become the righteousness of God in him if you can believe that he become sin for you why can't you believe that you become righteousness if you are convicted of all the sins you have committed and he comes and pay the price oh Hallelujah then you can go free hallelujah amen what kind of man is that but he set me free he said and then to bring that fullness of the goded bodily Hallelujah into a people that he could have the preeminence the oversight the leading so what he did he bring the fullness of the godhead in you amen hallelujah sir amen praise God God 1963 the super sign he said oh God if the world could only see that that God and man are one so not God and Christ now but God and man Christ Jesus bridged the G to bring man back into the position of God because the sunship is only for a time until the Plan of Redemption is over and all that was in the mind of God go back to God then what need there for a son no no because Redemption plan is over I'll not leave one none that they father give me shall be lost save the son of predition amen hallelujah praise God he said that super sign was that first man that God could come into all that God was he poured into Christ amen and that's why we go through that this morning and all that Christ was so if listen if you can believe that all that God was poured into Christ can you believe that all that Christ was he poured into the church am if all that God was he poured into Christ what a revelation what a revelation then can you step down now and believe that on all that Christ was he poured into the church Hallelujah that set my heart rejoicing amen a super sign amen hallelujah God and man together that was to be the Super sign of the last day when the entire Bible was to be fulfilled in the last day a super sign a virgin shall conceive Hallelujah and this conception when it's brought forth will be God manifested in flesh amen hallelujah amen am a super sign they still don't believe it but it was anyhow it's still a super sign notice Hallelujah they've got Superman today they've got fictions of Superman and all these other kind of super things but the church has got a superide God back in the church manifesting in human flesh is that right and Bren when the supernatural is returned to you then we will say the word is made flesh again amen it's not just on the pages of the Bible but it has stepped from the page into a body somebody that will manifest that word the Bible said that they did not believe him yep but when he went into Nazareth where he was brought up Y and as a custom was on the Sabbath day he went into the synagogue they hand to him the scroll and he found the place where it was written of him the spirit of the Lord is upon me for he has anointed me to preach Deliverance to the captive they were Sinners they were Bound in sin but he come preaching Deliverance to the captive the opening of the eyes of the blind to set at Liberty them that are bound and he Clos the book he did not read the scripture for yesterday for for the future he read the scripture for that day and he hand it back to the scroll to to the priest and he take his seat and look at what they said they said is not this Joseph's son we know his mother and father you see they try though the Mighty God had unveiled before them they try that if in their minds they could bring him down to themselves then they could disbelieve Hallelujah but in all they're saying he said and this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen God and Christ has become one this day is this scripture fulfilled in your very ear amen all that Christ was uh he poured into the church and this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears and you hear it Hallelujah and said John 14:20 says I'm evening the day I'm sorry he said Hallelujah me say John 14:20 in that day you will know that I am in the Father the father in me and he didn't stop there and I in you may God help us to recognize our privilege that we have from God Hey listen with this Revelation you ought to walk not like other Gentiles walk amen you you ought to stick your head up and let the world know that there's something about you amen God step down in this hour God and man has become one hallelujah amen he said oh if that was a super sign of that day when that same spirit that was on Jesus Christ comes into his church to manifest the written word for today amen hallelujah that is still the super sign amen he Amen in said John 14:23 the Bible says and Jesus answered and said unto him if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will we will come onto him and make our aboard with him in other words we're going to live with him in him amen and you know I want you to bear this in mind when we say the son and the father when the logos comes from the eternal spirit to the logos that eternal spirit is father Yes amen amen and the logos was a veil and when the teapon man stepped there right amen when he become MDC that Veil that he come from he says father amen amen hallelujah amen and when from that logos he become the Virgin born son he look back at that theophany and he says father because it gave birth to himself hallelujah amen God gave birth to God amen amen so so he said the eternal spirit give birth to the logos the logos give birth to the theophany amen and that theophany Hallelujah he could not eat nor drink with man but brother brand said he put on 16 elements he put on dust and Abraham had communion with him Genesis 14 but then in Genesis 18 He visit Abraham to confirm the promise which is your promise hallelujah amen and he throw 16 elements he he thr us up

sing about it amen they talk about it but they never know what it is because it was a mystery it was hidden but now it's made manifest to the Saints Hallelujah the unveiling of God 1964 he said no when it said there that he emptied himself or poured out now we could think like this that he vomit up the English word of empty or poured out from him see something went out of him that was different from him like I have a glass of water or and I pour the contents out he said it's not like that don't don't get it mixed up no no no uhuh he said but the word kenos in Greek does not mean that he vomit up his arms went off or is I went off another person no he said that is he changed himself Hallelujah he poured himself into amen into another mask Hallelujah like when the eternal spirit comes into Hallelujah the pillar of fire the shakina of Glory he change himself Hallelujah he said that is he changed himself he poured himself into amen into another mask into another form not another person went out of him called the Holy Spirit but it was he himself hall hallelujah he himself poured himself into the people it's Christ inside this life of mine and you know sometimes sir because

nobody can stop you now amen Satan has no more hold than you you're going to go through this it's just like a drama that is set amen that he already knows that you're going to have pitfalls you're going to have an accident you're going to have an operation he knows all of that but he's looking at the end of the display of that righteousness amen tomorrow you might have a bad day at work and the next day you might have a good day the next day you might have a great day and the next day an excellent day and the next day nothing happened God knows all of that but that's not what he's dealing

as an habitation of God Amen through the spirit amen amen amen hallelujah amen thank oh Jesus Christ life in you make him the center of the Revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ and Christ in you make you the complete revelation of the whole thing hallelujah amen what God is trying to do yes this is it amen this is it you said brother ke I've got pain in my body I'm getting whole this one's got to die amen you you won't have the it like this and the change as a matter of fact you notice the Bible brother wait I want you to go and look at that that when he speaks of the body after the resurrection it never says flesh and blood on CU there's no more blood in your bloodstream after that you see the blood is not the life but the life is in the blood but when the Redemption comes in and the change of the body it's the holy ghost that will be in you amen that moves you therefore you'll never go hold you know if you know I was talking to a friend that works with me and you know is Uncle you know owns the funeral home in linstead and so he used to go on part-time and help him to embal the bodies and he was telling me how he does it he said first you've got to get out all the blood he said there's some arteries that you got to get into and you pump all the blood out of the body you know why because if the blood is there that body is going to decay so they take out all that blood and they put in the embalming fluid and when the eming fluid is in that body you can set it aside in the corner for as long as you want to it will never Decay amen you see that's what God is going to do in your change he will remove the blood out of your body and the Holy Ghost will be what's the life inside of you you'll never grow old but he's going to restore your youth like he done the heagle it's not as though you've been 50 years and a few days I'm going to be 58 man I've had some rough days but he's going to restore that to my youth but he's going to remove all the trials and the tests and right amen I can just imagine some of you take your pictures when you were young and put it there you're going to look better than that I tell you cuz some of you when you were eating you really wasn't goodlook if you be honest with you know you weren't good-look but in that renewed body Richard you'll be goodlooking I'm not saying you're not amen Hallelujah so I ain't going to take no picture back then no last week there uh sister Rex had gave me a picture of me when I was about 18 years old in a three-piece suit and M said I know why she

that you can make it through the Holocaust or whatever it you know make it through the the nuclear war that's coming or or or whatever more and something they're building this and building that and building this and building that and the rich folks thinks they're all going to be the same only ones that stay around because they build the biggest shelters we build ours with feathers yes we build ours with feathers greatest shelter there ever was was under the wings of Mama Eagle thank God for a prophet that was standing out there one day and he saw that great big eagle yes then he saw the one he said oh it' been beat down because of the storm you know it had it had to land but they sometimes you might get a storm it may beat you down and it may knock you to the ground it may put you in a tree but I'll promise you that eagle never was not an eagle right doesn't matter how low he was sitting on the ground or he was sitting in a tree or he was soaring in the height he was still an eagle and when that storm went away brother rown said what'd he do he he said he knew what he [Music] had he said he pitched off that limb and said he never flapped his wings and went down and hit the current well let's hit the current but you got to spread them first you got to know that you're an eagle number one you got to have confidence that you're an eagle you got to have confidence that those two Wings will take you wherever you need to go man can't ever build an airplane like God can build a a bird you take a little old bird they'll just do this right here and they'll go right

created that they created them for to be that way he created us to do what get out of here our purpose on this Earth is to leave this earth that's what our purpose is it's not stay here it's to leave so let's give brother Keith another big hand God bless you good to have each and every one of you here we're going to take communion now if you want to go ahead and and um musicians can can exit off the stage and we'll turn to First Corinthians um 11 verse 23 like I said Thank you thank you brother James good for good to see you man seen you in a little bit good to have you with us he's been here many times before so he's not a visitor he's with family now he's he's he's comfortable he's good but good to have him with us and and the sister with us too God bless you but we're going to take communion Apostle Paul tells us for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and what's Paul doing Paul wasn't in the upper room right Paul wasn't there he by revelation God showing him a vision of what's going on so there had to be the right interpretation he had to give it to a prophet to give us the correct interpretation of what went on in that Upper Room and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this doe in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup and he when he had St saying this cup is the New Testament he knew he had to die remember we've been talking about a testament is not enforced without the death of a testator so he knew he was going to die so this new testament can come about this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily okay shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself but as our brother said but God but God has allowed us to be able to take communion and not be not be condemned if you'll do it right ask forgiveness amen for as often you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him meat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation what to himself not Discerning the Lord's body now who's the Lord's body we are all right we're the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world separation all right wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you may that you come not together under condemnation and the rest will I set in order when I come let's just take a moment of silence brother R said pray for your pastor pray for your brothers ask God to forgive your sins so that we can take this communion without having any condemnation father just be with us as a body of Believers forgive us of our mistakes and faults and our sins Lord we stand here Lord complete in you father not looking at any of our inadequacies or or the things that we uh complexes and different things Lord we look to you the author and finisher of our faith father just be with us now in the furtherment of this service in Jesus name amen the Bible said he took bread and he blessed it Heavenly Father this bread Lord was not made in some Factory or come down some line and then was Frozen and and put in a box Lord it was made with holy hands it was prepared Lord in a way that when we take it Lord whatever is left over Lord we'll burn it because we don't want to hold it over till tomorrow father I pray now though today right now this this bread Lord that as we partake it Lord that it'll become Lord something new to us let us walk Lord in newness of life when we take this and realize that you you hung on Calvary for our sins father all of our sin and Lord that your blood was shed Lord that as our brother said is the life that's in that blood is what gives us strength father just bless it now in Jesus name amen I I know I've said this before about some new ones here we mom dad was a deacon in the Baptist Church so he was um in charge of the communion and U brother John I remember them getting the little wafer box out of the freezer and open it up you know like a I'm sorry but like a chicken pot pie you know you open the thing up and there's all this doughy squares not knowing where it come from or who made it or or what was going on but that's that was their revelation of the bread and then what we didn't use we sure didn't have a revelation of cuz we just stuck it back in freezer and used it the next month at the Baptist church and then mama would pour the Welch's grape juice into the cups halfway up because you had to cut it so them so them Baptist didn't get choked so but they didn't know we're going to take real wine CU real wine never gets old because that Welch's grape juice it has an expiration date on it this does not have an expiration though but it's Revelation is thank God for a prophet he sent us a prophet to tell us these things and show us that it always was in the types in the Bible of the Mana and all the things there not not drinking um grape juice but drinking wine cuz it gets better then we then he preached on stimulation of Revelation and all that going together there we we we see that the Lord absolutely give us the real meaning of this right here not just to take it because we have to need to but we want to right come boldly to the throne of grace that's right dear heavenly father thank you for this wine Lord it was prepared Lord maybe even several months ago but lord it's got better and better with age just as Revelation Lord it just gets better and better Lord it gets good and good father I pray that youd sanctify it to our bodies Lord and be with this group of people Lord may we may we come under that sanctification that we were talking about Lord that clean us out Lord and set us aside for service more than we ever have before father I pray in Jesus name amen come morning I'll walk by the river how rest boy what a day the Ever Green Tree I'll carry through the midnight come morning there's glory for me [Music] sometimes I'm despised and rejected and I question oh Father how long get weary sometimes don't we take one more look at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning thank God we had a prophet tell us rapture's going to take place in the morning sometime between 600 and 9:00 and we're just going to step over into another dimension I was somewhere the other day and someone in U Baptist or Methodist he was talking about the wedding supper want to know what we was going to eat and how we was going to serve it thank God for a prophet he said we're taking communion so I'm not worried about the rest of it miles long table miles long a table spread where the saints of God are fed he invit his chosen people come and dying Bread and Wine boy talking about turning the water into wine for a for a a a wedding supper this would be millions of people for Miles that we'll have wine and it'll never be it'll never be exhaustible it will be inexhaustable and we'll be able to just Hey listen he was down here one day and we needed bread and he just kept breaking it off and handing it to the people then he got 5,000 people he he he took that bread and like brother Brown said he said whatever molecule that was it burst in his hand it cooked it while he had it in his hand man it just didn't give you something doughy it gave you the bread that was already cooked and the fish it was already fried our bro for those of you that are trying to lose weight but that's all just a little microcosm of what we're going to see on the other side yes we can't fathom it much but we're trying us as ministers we're trying to get you to see right that you are the Bride of Jesus Christ you are why this whole thing you're why the Bible was written right you're literally literally the Bible we won't be carrying Bibles around in in heaven I don't believe we become the Bible and as we become the Bible we are the pages and we're all those we're written Epistles right and we're going to be able to tell our story John's going to be able to tell his Paul Peter all the different ones be able to tell their story and that will be things that are not written in this in this book right here but it's like Keith and I were talking you you only you need the blood you need Sal Sal ation here you won't need salvation there you'll be done I've told you many times before you didn't need Faith you needed Faith this morning to get your clothes on get in your car start the car and get to church right you have your faith amen all right now when you got here you can't say well I got to have faith to get to church no we're here that's right all right now we may have to have faith to get back home but you don't have to have faith when you're standing in it and that's why that that that brother Keith and we all we're all in one mind and one Accord we're trying to get this thing back together where man's trying to say no we're going to get it over there everybody with me we're going to get it over there it's for them I like where brother R said this day amen amen the Bible says at that day well at that day is today this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears yes the scripture of the bridegroom and bride coming together has been fulfilled today will you grab a hold of it or will you let your day of visitation pass you by it's left up to you we're going to take communion and then we'll sisters will go downstairs with foot washing and they'll get ready for the uh for the um anniversary um get together downstairs for for Mom and Dad after we're finished God bless you thank you for all all of you for coming thank you for the uh uh message that brother Keith gave us two two messages poured his heart out and uh what' you do get it word perfect that's all we God knows God knows that was all we had and it was the last one Ryan got it we hey we serve a good God we serve a God that while he was sitting while he was sitting somewhere in his Earthly Journey he looked out and said they're only going to need 44 cups to that that day so that's exactly what we needed was 44 cups so let's take communion thank you Lord how while they're taking up the the U yeah the Bible tells us in in John Chapter 13 said Thank you and suffer being ended the devil and having now put in the heart of Judas his care Simon son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hand look and that he was come from God somebody said that today didn't Heen okay that he was come from God and went to God now whatever the whatever speaks at the brid Grom now he's the bridegroom we're the bride a prophet of God told us those two comes together together same scripture speaks of him speaks of us so guess what realize today that you come from God and you're going back to God he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and girded himself and after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to W them with the towel where withth he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord DST thou wash my feet Peter's fixing to he's fixing to get a lesson cuz he's fixing to write this a few years later so he's getting a lesson that's on that statue of perfect man humility brotherly kindness Temperance patience all in this one little group right here then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord do you wash my feet Jesus said unto him what I do thou knowest not now he knew that but Thou shalt know Hereafter second Peter 1 Peter said unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet don't ever tell tell Jesus never cuz he's fixing to tell you something don't ever say never all right you shall never wash my feet Jesus said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part he made it pretty plain pretty straightforward and and and no beating around the bush as we say in the sou he said if I don't wash your feet you'll have no part with me in other words your part with me will be cut off that's why it's so important um Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head in other just poured all over me now Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not saved to wash his feet but is clean every with and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore he said ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and taken His Garment was sat down he said unto them know you what I've done to you he's asking him a question you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am he's coming down to the end of his journey sometimes he wouldn't he'd tell him not to call me this and don't call me that he said you call me master and Lord he said so I am I'm I'm he I'm him all right if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verily verily I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither is he that sent greater than he that sent him I like this scripture here if up on the screen I want you
