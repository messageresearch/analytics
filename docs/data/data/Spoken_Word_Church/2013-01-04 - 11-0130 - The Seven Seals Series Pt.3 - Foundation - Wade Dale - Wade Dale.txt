========================================

yeah know where I'm going You Can Make U-turn on that road okay thank you you cannot make a u-turn on the Golden Road okay once you're on it you're on it that's great is it I'll have satisfaction in itself all right one more time anybody know Regina's here now yep here are you okay did you break any make sure is she in the way in the camera excuse me oh it's high enough all right let's turn to the Book of Revelation thank you all for coming rations now what we're going to do and I wish and listen I don't want to be mean but if you're going to come you need to come all the time you don't need to miss Sunday school class cuz I'm not going to I can't background every Sunday so if you're not going to come in here all the time I'd rather you go upstairs and Go sing it I'm sorry just Hest I'd rather you go sing and worship and it's not going and that doesn't mean you're go to hell either but we need to be this is this is important cuz without what we're talking about without at least a general idea God can't deal with you anything urer right I believe we come to places to where we're we're at a leveling plane in our life and that leveling plane in our life is not that we're non-christians and not that we're not going to heaven but we may not make a body change we may have to die but and no disgrace to that but but my the what we've been given will change our body there's no limit to it says we which are alive and remain Paul said so we need to accept that we're the we and strive for it why not um Martin Luther John Wesley even the Apostle Paul the Apostle Paul was frustrated I think cuz he said I see all I don't see all things but I see Jesus I see through a glass dark that him being a prophet he could raise up just high enough to where he could see that something was coming that was even greater than what he was involved in Martin Luther come to a place he couldn't get any higher than than the just y' live by faith and and he was a very short plant and that plant couldn't look very far josu lived by faith but that put him in the body Luther grew up a little higher so he could see a little more then the then the baptism of the Holy Ghost came and restored the gifts and it came up here a little bit higher but they only saw to the gift right then when the prophet the real Prophet came you know brother randam came and Jesus Christ came and and and you know and to show brother random what was going on he went up to a certain place in 1962 spoken words original C he said Lord I got him out of limb I don't know what to do he was just like Paul I see through a glass garly this message of Malachi 4 was supposed to take us all the way to the Rapture but I see there's a great you know maybe a falling away of people and then the Holy Spirit told him to pick up the pen and write which showed him that Malachi 4 had not even been brought into manifestation yet sure the first part happened and that's what we were talking about the first part of Malachi 4 is to to restore not what John the Baptist did but to restore the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers all right so brother randam in his sermons from 47 to 63 that's what he was doing he was restoring and tying up all the little sins and bringing everything together to where we can finally get to a plateau that we can understand just like Paul and some of the rest of them did but then this scripture in Revelations 10 comes to him he sees another Mighty Angel that's why I want you to read the breach because he starts talking about the mighty angel coming down which is Christ now that had to be a revelation because this a in this let's go to Revelations 10 to read that today and kind of follow through we're going to break that down today and then next week we will start in Revelations 5 so next Sunday read Revelations 5 and read the breach again if you read it one time read it again listen when I say read I mean read or listen it's better for me to read maybe better for you to listen that still doesn't matter that's just personal PR that's why read sir that's why said read are you that's right you bless right exactly yep and I saw another Mighty angel look that's a a small a people have probed at that through the centuries and thought well that's just une Earthly Angel just like the ones The Messengers in the seven Church ages they're all little A's but now you would think Christ would be this big a right but see God hid that God hid that in this writing but see it proves when you read down further brother randam in the breach he explains and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven here is the key if it would have just said another Mighty angel came down from heaven and he had a he had a in his hand a little book open but see John writes the same description that he wrote of Jesus back in Revelation CH 1 that's what brother R takes you back it goes back to Revelation 1 it says Christ this must be because why clothed with a cloud rainbow upon his head faces it were the Sun and his feet Pillar of Fire now go back to Revelations 1 and that's the same person standing in the midst of the Candlestick in Bride form bride form he was showing that he was this Mighty Angel was coming down to a bride in Bride form everybody understand that he wasn't just coming to a group of people he was coming in a group of people cuz he said he standing in the midst of the golden Candlestick like un the son of man I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet pillared of fire and he had in his hand a little book open now brother ROM goes back to Revelations 5 and there the book is closed so somewhere between between Revelations 5 and Revelations 10 somewhere in there the book was open that's why brother brought him on the breach on Revelations 5 he said this is the opening of the seal so from Revelations 5 what happens it goes right to Revelation 6 which is what John saw in symbol form right right then you had Revelation chap 7 bringing in the Jews and in Revelation 8 the 7th seal always remember keep this in the back of your mind because we'll cover it as we go always in the Bible and always the things that we see we see God do things 1 2 3 4 5 6 and then there's an interval there's a stop there's a rest um to put the seventh seal into eternity he put it in Revelation chapter 8 Revelation 6 tells of the first six seal read Revelation 7 starts talking about the Jews coming in then he reverts back chapter eight and brings in the seventh seal M all right right that's a breach or an interval all right go to the trumpets the Bible will go 1 2 3 4 5 six trumpets and stop and interject something in and then bring in the seventh trumpet right all right so watch Through the Bible you'll see 1 2 3 4 5 6 pause or an interval brother Brown calls it a time to rest and then God breaks the seal open there in Revelation chapter 8 all things are done for a purpose right but see right here after you see the seals in chapter 8 that's the seventh seal being open now he doesn't go he goes to the first trumpet Revelation 8 verse 7 is the first trumpet if you got scoffield Bible it's easy to keep up with that's why I like scoffield Bible he does have good commentary brother Brown said all things were not right but he still liked his writing first trumpets verse 7 second trumpets verse 8 n third trumpet is verse 10 and 11 fourth trumpet is 12 and 13 comes into chapter 9 to the fifth trumpet goes over to chap I mean verse 13 is the sixth trumpet and guess what then chapter 10 happens what is that that's not the seventh trumpet that's an interval that's a stopping point that's a place of rest brother Bown said this is that Mighty angel coming to the Jews so you and I must get this spiritual part there's people in the message that believe brother br has a literally come back this is where the return Ministry people get their point from that brother brandham States several times and it does in the breach that the bride is raptured in Revelation 4 and is not seen until Revelation 19 so everything in between is to the Jews that is correct naturally in the natural aspect of things Revelations 5 through 18 you'll see that the two prophets come in that the trumpets come in see the trumpets not even to us right but watch what God did in chapter 7 he interjected this point showing how that we're going to get to that cuz a gentile church has to be raptured first so what are you and I we Are Spiritual Jews and we're on the earth at the time see brother Ry makes a statement and they they bear on that real heavy when this Mighty Angel comes down brother bam said the seventh angel messenger is on the earth at the time of this coming well see they're saying he had the mighty Angel hadn't come yet and then over here brother R's got to come back and be standing on the earth and then this Mighty Angel come down they missed that point cuz that Mighty angel came down in 1963 to open the seals spiritually folks the seals have not open naturally on the Earth right you better not be here and see them people go hay why when because we're going to bring all this in if it takes all year we're going to cover each point then they say well brother rown said the brides raptured on the fourth seal that's the truth spiritually speaking in the fourth seal those lion Hawks man and Eagle are taken up off the Earth you don't see them in the fifth seal so and I'm saying that to everybody so so no big deal that's what's inside of us and when we're gone they're gone right the lxs man and Eagle today if you're born again that liox man an eagle spirit is controlling you if you'll let them right that angel in Ezekiel just like Brother D has been preaching those angels and I hope that people are not getting the point that we're praying to Angels or that's Catholicism right but just be aware that we entertain Angels under aware the things that we do what about that angel that comes down brother brandom says and and checks you out and goes back and tells the father hey this guy's acting just like you or this guy's not act what is that that's an angel ascending right going up and taking what you got to God you say well God knows everything sure I know he knows everything but he is the greatest Economist in the world he's got an economy that's perfect right and in that economy he's got God he's got archangels he's got cherubim seraphim he's got an order just like you and I have an order I wish people would understand one thing man did not come on this Earth and and just think up all these things about governments and how they're placed and and and deacons and police departments and all it's in the Bible right amen the old founding fathers of the United States of America and even over in Britain knew that they had why do you think over in Britain they wear those white wigs somebody read this Bible right that God had on a white wig and he was a what judge why do you think they wear those white wigs they got another the Bible most of our laws in the United States truthfully are based on the Bible right based on the Ten Commandments based on what the Bible says to do now it's not an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth anymore but we still do that if you kill somebody guess what you get the death penalty it's still a n for a nine and a to for a tooth okay and things like that that go on if people would just take this Bible and think it and not think it's so Heavenly that it doesn't do any Earthly good but this Bible was written for the economy of God those seraphim what do they do they keep the burner they keep the worshipper clean by burning your burning the sin what is that that's the blood of Jesus Christ there's only one way to be sanctified that's the blood of Jesus Christ sanctifies you so there's Angels around you that are keeping you clean and where's it all coming from they got a headquarters called the word of God right so this Mighty Angel was one angel that was special because of what happened there and clothed with the cloud rainbow upon his head see God was revealing who he was but no man had ever read that and thought that was Christ coming down all right now let's get back to our subject just a minute but I want you to keep these points in mind because there's a lot of people think brother Brown has to come back and fulfill all this but see they miss they miss that part of him coming right just like they missed the first one when John came Jesus was already on earth when John began to preach his message Jesus Christ was already on the earth they just come to a day that they met and what happened Jesus went on and took his ministry same thing with brother brand Christ was always here folks it wasn't that Christ was gone and then see that's where the people in the message say well those other ages weren't born again because Christ wasn't here no Christ was here when John preached for you know ever how many years or months but growing up they were all here at the same time but Jesus was not manifested until the father comes and does what makes that person and says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm please to dwell all right then he grows in Grace and knowledge and then he says here ye h brother Ram went through the same thing here's a brother random preaching 1947 1963 Christ is on the scene doing the healing doing the Miracles opening the word of God like it never been open before in the other ages the reason I say that is because Paul preached the same thing brother Brown preached so it wasn't anything new word was the it was the effects of the word this word was not done away with it's but it but you know you and I both can grieve the Holy Spirit even being born again so there's some part of us that can grieve God away from us right and still be Christian right well Luther could sit in a pub and drink a beer smoke a pip be justified and God saying I'm happy with at least what he's got he's got the just shall live by faith right but now if Luther had have been in this age where there would more light on the word mhm he would have not have done that that's right see it's just what how much you it's how much that the Bible says faith come by so if you never then you don't know if you don't hear you don't know that's right all right but the more you hear the more you ought to know but the more you hear the more you either turn it down or take it so we know that as they missed the first coming of Christ they missed this coming of Christ which is brother Brown said the bride coming of Christ coming out of the church because he's going to Rapture us and carry us away really that's not the coming that's in this Bible whenever I Shall Behold In This Cloud Eastern Sky you know I've told you before a man told me one time he said I'll be glad when one day we look up and that Eastern Sky splits and Jesus just walks right down on the earth and takes the people away and I thought in my mind I said if you see that buddy you're in trouble cuz the Bible says he'll come as a thief in a night the bridegroom cometh that's right and he in the night there in John or somewhere in there can't think I'm way behind myself or ahead one and takes us away that's going to be the secret carrying away of the Bride nobody will ever know brother Brown said that the brats will take place he said there people still think they're getting saved he said that people will go well I thought so and so that's message people I thought so and so was supposed to happen right before this happened to us and then that little small voice of saying it did and he missed it right so the Eastern Sky splitting is when God coming back in judgment all right now Israel is going to see him fight for them over there but the Gentiles are going to be done away with all right so let's get the point the whole basis for this today is that God is going to have a bride a gentile bride he calls that bride out in Revelations 1 1 2 and three everybody understand that that's the Gentile church that's his bride all right in Revelations 4:1 John sees a door open in heaven and the voice says come up hither brother BR said that's the Rapture of the Gentile Church all right right and now what happens to her naturally is not going to happen again until Revelations 19 because you and I and I are in a honeymoon for three and 1/2 years with Jesus Christ in another dimension while all this hell's going on down here does everybody understand that yes if you're born again you'll be there in that Dimension right if you're not born again you're going to stay alive until somebody kills you or whatever you may be for this virgin who knows don't know but the foolish virgin is going to live and die and give their life during that 3 and 1/2 Years everybody understand that say amen amen okay bride does not that's why brother R says the bride goes up he's he's telling us the truth he's not lying he the bride goes up in Revelations 4 she's not seen again see that seen again until Revelations 19 what seen in the book as the natural bride coming back down for the Thousand Years of the Millennium all right while that's going on you still got time right here 3 and 1/2 years of tribulation time you got God going to the Jews you've got 144,000 being brought out and they're going to come across and then they're all going to be killed battle of Armageddon that's when the world ends as we know it now all right so now but now let's click the natural part let's go spiritual for a moment God still calls out a church in Revelations 1 2 and three Revelation 4 shows the rapture that's not taken place yet we're still here right so now let's be natural let's just talk natural cuz brother Ram was talking about a natural happening now if we're gone sure whatever happens past that is going to be to a group of people that's different from you and I but in the spiritual aspect we've got to be caught up out of what we were before when you were born again first day first second you were born again you be the Rapture in your life the catching away right cuz Rapture really is ecstasy Rapture is being in a state of of of just Heavenly bless sitting together in Heavenly places right right while you're still here while the boss is still on your back while you're having problems in your body while all these things are going on your soul is sitting in Heavenly places but you still have a natural part to contend with right but in the spiritual part Revelations 5 that Redeemer that Bloody lamb had to come to you at your new birth say Amen right so that wasn't in heaven we didn't get born again in heaven right no that's right we got born again on earth right so the spiritual part of me in Revelations 5 that Bloody lamb took the book now what is the book the book is mine and yours name that are born again right right that's the book this this is the book that man took in Revelation 5 that Bloody lamb took this book which has got my name and your name in it in what symbol form or in uh character if my character matches this and my name's written all in this book that's right so in Revelations 5 you've got a Redemption going on right well we're redeemed here people that's right we're not redeemed in heaven right we're not redeemed over at the white Throne judgment that's right we bride now I'm saying bride now listen bride is redeemed right there in Revelations 5 so when you're born again then right there's where you are spiritually right all right now in Revelation 6 the seals begin to open in Revelation 6 that's the seals are for the Redemption of your body cuz your Soul's already redeemed it didn't need Redemption it was redeemed in Revelation 5 everybody understand say amen amen all right Revelation 6 is showing you how to get somewhere all right then Revelation 7 shows us how the Jews come in cuz without us leaving the Jews can't get what they're going to get right that's right and then what this Revelations 8 still goes into the trumpets you and I must spiritually hear what the Lord himself shall descend with from heaven with a shout the voice and a what trumpet trumpet trumpet so a trumpet's got to come to me and you spiritually the Jews believe in the Feast of the trumpets where you got one Feast here you got one here you got one well that's what's happening in our lives what is a feast a feast is where you go eat what do we eating eating this literally spiritually mm okay so this is all spiritual what brother R's talking about now he's going through this and shows us then in Revelations 9 you continue and then re here we are at Revelations 10 and God's going to do something he's going to send somebody to get us out cuz brother Ram did not come to bring us a new birth he did not people were born again from Paul's age people knew how to get born again but they didn't know how to handle the word like Paul did Brother Ram had to preach that word that's why the angel had to come to him and show him about serpent seed show him about these things to start getting everything lined back up because it had had become so out of cater the Catholic church was looking in here and seeing angels and then they took it out and said well we need to pray to this saint and pray to that Saint pray because they're what they're Angels so the Catholic Church took all their Dogma out of the Bible but it was the devil right but I heard brother R say the other day he said some of you Roman Catholics will be there now whether they be giving eternal life or whatever called bride I don't I don't know but it's what they've heard those old Baptist and Methodist that was sitting in brother Brown's meetings they never accepted the message brother Tim hes told us and brother Kenny caps you remember brother Brown talking about brother caps well that's brother Kenny's father brother Kenny actually dated sister Sharon I mean yeah no not Sharon no the other one sarahah he actually dated Sarah brother bram's daughter and brother Tim Humes was dedicated by Brother Bram because he remember he talks about old brother and sister Humes well they're still alive and nothing church but they told last time we were at a minister meeting they told us out of their mouth they said listen we were talking about television they said we all had television said brother Brown preached against it for as long as we knew it and said it was after the 60s it was in the 70s when the ministers really got the preaching about not having a television is when we got rid of he said everyone he said everybody in that Tabernacle tell see so those people but brother random didn't call them non-Christian they were living under the age that they were born in and the amount of word that they could gather because see even see when we get to the seals brother R goes over in the questions and answers and he said it's not for you this is not even for you just live a good simple Christian Life what was he telling them this was for something else coming this was another group of people coming Paul the same way Paul is preaching and talking about the resurrection well they philas and hus what do they do they sit under Paul's Ministry for about a year or two and they're listening to Paul talking about Resurrection Resurrection Resurrection Paul's talking about resurrection of this old man you know Resurrection from the dead dead works well Philly Phil whoever it is they go over and they start preaching that the resurrection already happened they said where did you get that from and we got it from Paul see so even out of the pure word of God same way with brother brandom out of the pure word of God they were teaching false teaching cuz then Paul had to come back and say no I wanted us to get out to the out Resurrection in other words out from among the dead right which was denominational Creed right so that's what brother Brandon was trying to do and then he comes in Revelations 10 and he says well we need to pick this up because what happens in verse 7 cuz that's when it happens but in the days of the voice of the seven Angel when he begins to sound the mystery one there's only one mystery left when we get right here to this book and that's how to beat Death not beat Death destroy death the bride will destroy death but see now the bride will not destroy death totally only in herself right only in herself will she destroy that right soon as we get out of here you talking about death death is going to rain for three and A2 years and it's going to be nothing but a bloody death so we have not destroyed death for this world we've only destroyed death for ourselves individual affair with God right no shame for the ones to die cuz guess what they're going to come up first they're going to be changed first all right then then we which are alive and remain let's finish this we're not even going to get we might have to do this again 30 minutes is not long enough and cried with a loud voice verse three is when a lion roar and when he had cried seven Thunders out their voices I'm sorry let's go back up verse two let's just read it over let's get the whole context read it over again and I saw another Mighty Angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillar of fire bride form what he's coming to a bride to then become bride form because that Mighty Angel watch in just a little one I'll show you excuse me and he had in his hand a little book open brother BR said if Christ doesn't come he said we're only presuming read your read that book the breach how many times he says presuming presuming he said if Christ don't come on the scene we're only presuming right and that's what they did down through the seven Church ages is presumed we think this was right we think that white horse rider was the Holy Ghost see I read the mighty conqueror just the other day in 1959 brother bandam reads that scripture and teaches it as the holy ghost riding through the ages all right and cried with a loud voices when a Lon Roar well and he set his foot upon sea and his left foot upon the Earth and what he see what does se mean in the Bible what does water mean in the bible people what is Earth flesh he's coming down to do something in the people in flesh he's coming down to take over when a mighty Angel comes down and he puts we plants one on the sea and one on earth he's fixing to do something he didn't just come to just stand there and look pretty all right he's fixing to come down to take a group of people to a body chain all right and he cried with a loud voices when a line worth and when he had cried seven Thunders uttered their voices and when the seven Thunders had other their voices I was about to write remember John was commissioned to write everything he saw right and I Heard a Voice from Heaven saying unto me seal up those things which the seventh Thunders uttered and write them not right that's why brother Brown calls it an Unwritten part not that it's got to be written cuz you can't add to or take from but it's got to be revealed what's already written in here all right there won't be another word of Bible written for all eternity can't be it'll just be lived out what's in this Bible right here right and the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth forever and ever now God doesn't swear by anybody but who himself cuz there's no other to swear by all right who cre created heaven and the things that there in he's talking about who Christ the Creator Christ was the Creator God he's showing you all through here who this Mighty Angel is you just didn't nobody pick it up until brother brand brought these little points out created heaven and the things that they in and the earth and the things that there in and the Sea and the things which is therein that there should be time no longer that's why everybody thinks brother R's got to come back an issue in the Millennium or issue in the Rapture um because it says here the time shall be no longer now we're going to read next week in Daniel 12 and we'll see that this same situation happened but in a different way all right now but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as Heath declared to his servants the prophets now John interject that in because look at verse eight he speaks no more want you to listen he speaks no more of that person cuz it's in the days of the voice right seventh angel John interjects that and says the seventh angel has to come introduce this man then he's got to go off the scene because remember John types who the whole bride the whole bride John one person types the whole bride and the voice which I heard from Heaven spake unto me again now now the angel speaking directly to who the bride John everybody understand what I'm saying go and take the little book which is open he didn't tell the Sabbath Angel to do it the seventh angel is gone take the little book which is open in the hand of the Angel he didn't take it out of the hand of the messenger he took it out of the hand of the mighty angel Christ which standeth upon the sea and upon the Earth and I went unto the angel and said unto him give me the little book and he said unto me take it and eat it up and it shall be like Thy belly bitter but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as honey and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand brother brandom had to go off the scene we have to get it straight from Christ now it has to come through what brother V said right cuz that's the only way you going to get it that's why John wrote Revelations 10:7 but in the days of that man's voice the mystery is going to be finished then he's going to have to go off the scene just like John did John the Baptist cuz see John the Baptist said I must decrease that he might increase brother Brown said he said if I'm the one to introduce I must go away and he might he that he'll be here well that's what's happening right here right and I went into the angel I'm sorry and I took the little book out of the Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in my mouth sweet as honey oh it's nice to sit here and talk about it or it just makes you feel good but to live it and come back next Sunday right tough job and as soon as I had eaten it my belly was B but remember the Bible says he ate it up and I underline that he did not leave one page out he didn't tear the part he didn't like out and leave it he ate the whole book and he said unto me thou must prophesy again before many people and Nations and tongues and kings and that's exactly what what we're doing right now so read Revelations 5 and read or listen to the brid for next
