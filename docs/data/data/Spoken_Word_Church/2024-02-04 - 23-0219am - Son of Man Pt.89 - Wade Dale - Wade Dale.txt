they're having to move by the 15th of March they have not found a place yet to have church service and um and with brother JT you know his hands messed up and then he's got a couple other issues that he's working with so we just need to really pray that they find a find a place to uh to worship over there in Jasper it's really hard to find I know some of you know this it's really hard real estate wise that they found a place to to a little a small place to worship as a um a church got wanted $55,000 a month to rent it so they couldn't even afford that you know to to rent that so let's just pray that hey we've seen Miracles we've seen things that look totally impossible and all of a sudden somebody walks up and say hey you want to rent this building it's it's it's vacant you can have it for $300 a month or something so let's just pray that they uh they find a place to worship amen remember brother Bob will be speaking for us this coming Wednesday night brother Tim cross will be here next weekend I'll be in Ohio doing a wedding for the whole weekend there so brother Tim will be here on Sunday regular normal Services also remember when is the shower what time middle or afternoon afternoon all right the afternoon will be a shower for Esther and Micah amen so let's just keep that in our thoughts March the 4th we won't have Bible study this month but March the 4th we've been in kind of a tradition now but we're going to have a prayer service that Saturday night from 7 to 8:00 or whenever you get finished praying because the week after that brother Jack D going to be here for the weekend uh for the Youth service so just remember that March the 4th instead of Bible study we're having Bible study every other month now and uh the the one this and the odd months we're having a youth service so it would be something to pray about March the 4th we've we've saw that prayer has really helped these services that we've we've uh for those of you that's been here even though if you pray at home and pray in your own closet we pray for the services that's coming up we don't want to just make this where you just come to church and just like a you know a little Geral on a wheel this not right this is eternal life this is your soul this is your life and your soul all right also remember one other thing just keep this in your prayer April Easter weekend we will be having like we did last year we will be having a good Friday Saturday and a Sunday service brother Dutch Scott's going to do Friday uh Saturday will'll be like a fellowship meeting at 3:30 brother Chris long will be

for a minute dear Lord thank you for this day that you give us father we're just we need Revelation more than anything Lord because Revelation gives us power with you Lord I pray that you'd be with the ones Lord that are that are caught in the middle Lord they that are don't know whether to stay in the world or whether to move on with you father I pray that you would prick their heart today that you go way down deep where man can't even go to that soul and you know where it's at man can't find the soul they might find a place that it's that but you know exactly where that soul is and Lord I pray that you'd minister to that Soul even the ones that are born again today I pray that you would Quicken what's in our heart already by the new birth Earth father we pray that you would just be with the ones that are sick sister freeden the different ones Lord that are not with us that are streaming in Lord we pray that you'd be with them be with a little group there in Ohio Lord and coming up next weekend for the wedding and I pray that you would keep them Lord not be so nervous that everything will work out just fine for your honor and glory Lord I pray that you be with this service be with brother Aaron be with brother Louise give them fruit for their labor Lord I Thank you so much that we have soldiers that can work out of this business building Lord that can go to other places and and help out the other bride Lord the maybe the the part of the Bride that needs help Lord I pray that you would send each one of us if we need to Lord to help them Father because we're one unit we're one body when they hurt we hurt when we hurt they hurt I pray that you'd be with us now further one of this service Jesus name we pray amen also remember to uh keep brother um Samuel Rees in prayer I it's okay brother Joe he talks to brother Samuel and I called him the other day and uh he's been put out of his church up there in Gainesville the Hispanic Church somebody's come in and and took over and we know who it is but I'm not it's just the devil so brother Samuel's looking for a place to have church service he's looking for a building in Gainsville around here somewhere so um keep him in prayer more than anything and uh and um thank God thank god brother Dell owned this building for a long time and give it to the church and we ain't got to worry about none of that outside stuff okay that's a lot of wisdom and I appreciate that amen and sister Rebecca gave me this to to preach over today and we pray that whatever that needs to go to that the need will be met all right so here we go Son of Man part 89 and we're going to I told Brother Bob I said he's not he's not doing Sunday school no more cuz we're going to talk on Redemption today as a little side note all right in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and God knew we needed both of us to say something about it today and the Word was made flesh Bob primed you so now you really ought to be able to listen and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth John 8:31 then Jesus said to the Jews who believed on him look believed on him if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth that's a promise if you're my disciple you shall know the truth and that truth will not bind you it will make you free you may be seated the Lord as his Blessing and we're going to try today to get to Temperance second Peter 1 says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge and the knowledge Temperance the temperance patience and the patience godl when we get into patience we're going to be there for a little while so have patience everybody have some patience okay tribulation worketh what patience so if you'll pull the chart up we're going to this morning I was thinking about something last night and this morning that we've covered pretty much all we need to cover but there's some side notes that we'd like to look at as brother Bible was talking about Revelation I want to talk a little bit about Redemption before we start a the statue of perfect man just one more time everybody with me all right one more time I want to talk about it in the form of the pawn shop because if we don't get if we don't get this out of the pawn shop then you're not born again you cannot have any of these virtues Holy Ghost virtues without having Holy Ghost inside your soul right all right and then we want to also look that if you get out of the pawn shop now you can get yourself back in over here but you can't get yourself back in here I'll read you the quotes in just a minute I know I know it's foreign to some but we're going to talk about the soul today because that is where I said last Sunday add to your new birth you can only add to your new birth if you got it if if you don't have it you can't add to it all right so you got to get to it first but there was a problem and it's called it's not a problem but it's the Plan of Redemption and I was thinking yesterday you know you look at a plan we all make plans we have plans to do this and plans to do that and they change when God makes a plan cannot change that's why I said the other day if God ever loved you in the beginning he can't not love you through your journey you may fall out of love with him but he's never going to fall out of love for you all right cuz he can't change his mind and say oh no I made a mistake mistake I brother George BL lot bless his heart I just made a mistake no God don't make a mistake he brings you right here and he gets you and he puts it right in your face and said Hey listen I've been with you on this whole journey I'm going to show you by Revelation where you're at in the body of Christ is that what we're all looking for we're looking for adoption we're looking for what we can do to help somebody else we're not here to bash people brother said what is it's Spirits we fight Paul said it's Spirits we fight that's right amen not principalities and Powers it's Spirit where in that soul and in that Spirit realm is where we have our problem I don't my problem is not the White House your problem's not the White House your problem's in your house me too my problems in my house your problems in your house what brother brother Brown tell us he said you can't blame the pastor if you don't make it why that takes a lot off of me but you know what without a plan without a plan brother Brown said God had a plan and a purpose now what's a plan you sit down and you draw out a plan God sit down and Drew out a plan but he drew out a plan that didn't need an eraser right when he drew it down he went this is the way it is and this is the best way you'll ever get here and it's the best way every trial every tribulation that you go through God knew that it's the best way to get you where you're supposed to be everybody with me so we're going to get into that with a little bit of patience cuz what's the first thing brother BR said have patience with not your neighbor not your pastor not your brother he said have patience with God that he'll do what he said he would do now that we don't cuz what the problem is is right here we're going to talk about it brother Rond 1953 we're going to take a little side trip for just a minute but I think it's important that we see why we're struggling in and why do we need to struggle and fight what are we going to need miracles in the Millennium when we're supernatural beings how are we going to need these now the Bible says now are we the sons of God not now is now is a present tense now are we the sons not we will be we are now we are this morning we are this very hour now are we the sons of God what seated together as I said before when when when Paul writes that sitting together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus he says resurrected sitting in Heavenly places that's where the people got that the resurrection was over with this is a spiritual Resurrection not a natural Resurrection all right this is a spiritual resurrection that what happens is now watch right this very minute we're seated together in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus do you know every person sitting in here today if you're born again your soul is eternal your soul is God your soul only thinks God your soul Only Knows God your soul is God what our problem is it's so Bound by that second man not your flesh your flesh just holds all your guts and everything together but that second man in the spirit realm is our problem and we're going to get to that because remember brother M in two places he said Satan put you in the pawn shop but then he also said Adam went and put you in the pawn shop cuz remember folks we we bash Eve pretty bad but listen he didn't put us in the pawn shop Adam put us in the pawn shop Adam's the one that took on as the second Adam would take on our sin he took on Eve sin everybody with me say Amen every man by one spirit will all baptized into one body become the members of this body by the Holy bapt Holy Ghost baptism that's right here not here here now we're seated together in Heavenly places free from judgment we can never go to the Judgment we were yesterday U and and I'm not Bastion brother he only knew what he knew at at Jonas and uh Sophia's um archery shoot they had a little brother stand up and he was making his point his whole point was we all got to go to judgment we all got to go to judgment we all got to go to judgment we got to do good down here but we all got to go to judgment no we don't no we don't that's what I mean one of the greatest doctrines I know of is that I ain't got to go to judgment no time do I have to go to judgment I don't want to be Catholic where I get halfway in Hell purgatory and I got to be prayed out well I'm sorry it's called paid out amen pay no venance the more you got the more you get out no I want it to be on this right here that a man came and had the goods as brother Tom fush used to say had the goods to get me out of the pawn shop now watch's our problem is we can accept whether to go out or we can turn around and walk right back in the pawn shop I'll read it right here in just a second you can never go to judgment how can you be judged twice God judged Jesus Christ and he put our judgment upon Christ I want somebody to be a little happy today if you don't mind I'm going not a little teaching I'm going to do a little preaching but Christ paid our Judgment at Calvary if we're in Christ we're secured in Christ listen that that Soul if you're born again it does not have bad days and good days it has all good days that Spirit realm though is like a roller coaster like the Scream Machine at Six Flags you scream on the way down you scream on the way up and you scream when you're done if you've never been on the scam screen machine you ought to try it one time and realize that's your life in the spirit realm all right how do we get into Christ by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body is what we've been talking about the New Birth we're into the body of Jesus Christ and while we're in there look we've accepted his punishment in our stad we've accepted his punishment in our stead he knowing no sin yet was made sin for us and then he bore our sickness he bore our sin and we came into him and we are free from these judgments come on somebody that's what that's for you that's and listen that's for Monday too every day that is in why somebody asked me one time a long time ago said how many days did your brother play golf I said every day that end then why except on Sunday so every day God look God cannot justly judge me or you the second time God cannot justly judge me or you the second time if he's already accepted us in Christ Jesus and punished his own son for us how can he punish us then when he's already had Christ paid the price if I go down to the pawn shop I've got something I'm in some trouble so I got I I I what I'm me to go do I'm going put that in the pawn shop right and they're going to let me borrow some money off of that but they're going to give me a receipt they're going to give me a receipt you keep one the person gets a receipt everybody with me if youve never been to a pwn shop you'll learn something today I was in one one time don't want to go back even brother Brown said he said I don't like pawn shops that's another quote for another day if I go down to the pawn shop and I've got something that's just like the human life the devil put us in the pawn shop so that's you that's your soul right that's right devil put us in the pawn shop because of transgression which basically we did ourself but if you've got something pawned and you go down and get that out you hand that receipt and you get that out I'm not in the pawn shop anymore right I have been redeemed or the ransom has been paid for my soul now the problem is is we've got a spirit realm and we go and we throw it right back in Pawn jop Spirit realm now Spirit realm Soul can't be judged anymore but we can be judged in our spirit realm that's why there is a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad that's why the denominational world says we all got to go to judgment cu the Bible says we all got to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ amen but that's not the major judgment that's not white Throne judgment we're going to be judged by what we're going to be judged by how much we use or not use these virtues that's why these virtues are very important you say brother way why do I have to struggle because I'm if you say I'm born again do you want to have a miserable life if you don't want to have a miserable life then you start doing these things right here but now listen that's not going to make everything go away Jesus was every one of these and they hated him they hung him on a cross because he was God remember they said we don't hate you because of the Miracles we don't hate you because of the signs and wonders we hate you because you're telling us you're God in human flesh that's right they will hate you because you tell them you are God in human flesh as we read the first scripture we read but if you got something ponded and you go down and get that out of the pond you get a receipt for it you have a right to take it out so there's no need of trying to go down look if I had my watching Pond and you went down and took it out for me there's no need of me for going down there paying it again I can't pay it again because it's already been paid oh when I think of that something on the inside of me under this fifth rib on the left side he's talking about his heart leaps higher than the skies cuz I know the devil had me in the pawn shop one time because of sin and transgression but Jesus Christ took me out of the pawn shop and redeemed me back to God listen God could not go into that pawn shop and get you out oh be quiet Jesus Christ had to go in the pawn shop and get you you out you it's the same person yes it is the same person but it's another form it's another form because remember the right of redemption is is that you got to be a Kinsman so the Kinsman became that God became human flesh to be our Kinfolk then he walked in the pawn shop he said I got to right now because that's flesh in that pawn shop I am flesh but I paid the price for that go Jes come on I paid the price for that it's mine and here we go I don't know if I want to accept that or not all you got to do is accept he did it just accept he did it cuz I know the devil had me in the pawn shop one time because of sin and transgression but Jesus Christ took me out of the pawn shop and redeemed me back to God he didn't just redeem you back to being a human you're a human already he redeemed you back to God Almighty he redeemed you back to Elohim somebody one of these days y'all might get excited about some of this but I'm getting more excited excited excited about just the Plan of Redemption Just A Simple Plan of Redemption cuz if you don't get it you forget about going up through there but Jesus took me out of the pawn shop and redeemed me back to God that makes me his son this morning and it has not yet appear what I shall be in the final end but I know I'll have a body like his own glorious body for I shall be for I shall see him as he is free from sickness free from sin so your soul is out of the pawn shop your soul has been redeemed there's no way it can go back in and pay that debt a second time already why would I want to go back and pay three or four times for something that I had to put in the pawn jop let God do it for you some of y'all that are struggling let God do it for you let God say God I'm in a pawn jop right even say God I know I'm redeemed but God I'm still in the pawn shop cuz I can't get over this virtue and get this knowledge CU you know what there's a flip side to all this to have patience you got to be angry first to have virtue you got to be powerless first then God gives you virtue you got to be have the knowledge of the world remember tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is your first knowledge then you start eating off the tree of life when you get born again so the Redemptive Act is not so hard to do just accept that he took you out of that pawn shop and put you in his shop just accept that and then we can go on my soul praise God my soul and intellect but the Bible's talking about Revelation we're going to see in just a few minutes minutes we'll get to it that Revelation is something that's previously not seen it's there though like brother Bob said about the statue statue is underneath that that that wrap or that tarp but you really can't tell what it is it could be a monkey could be an animal could be a bird it could be something sitting on a log you know kind of tall like this something sitting on the top but when it's pulled off you see it's a human you see what's been built God saw praise God he saw you built he saw you already made he's just now he's begin to pull the wraps off so that you and I can see the pull is what's going to take us out of here we're going to be shown to God one more time God's going to pull the veil off of the world's eyes and let them see me and you the real God the real place where God dwells not in a house not in a church in you God chose by the right of redemption to dwell in you cuz he became you that you might what become like him no become him the puzzle is pieces are fit back together you're out of the pawn shop praise God when you get out of that pawn shop there's no way there's anything being held against you no way nothing is held against you we got to start realizing that that it's oh it's it's coming no it's not coming it's already here and when you get a true [Music] Revelation the things that you think I have to do will become things I want to do things I used to do I do them no more things I used to why the old me is gone the real me me has been redeemed let me I don't have this I just pull this up real quick let me read this and then we'll continue on questions and answers 1964 brother B said now could a righteous judge judge a man twice remember that's even in the law of the land you can't it's called double jeopardy for those of you that know anything about the law you can't be tried for a murder and be acquitted or be found not guilty and then they call you back in two weeks later say we're going to try you for that again no it's called double jeopardy you can't do that even the law of the land proves that God done it one time and that's it how could a righteous judge judge a man twice for anything if the penalty's already been paid if I was in the pawn shop and you came by and said I'm going to redeem him and you went in and paid the price for my Redemption that's my penalty of being in the pawn shop you pay my Redemption then how can the pawn broker the devil claim you again that's what we got to realize when he comes to this guy unless I sold out again there you are when I reject listen when I rejected the fullness of the word I go right back in the pawn shop fullness of the work I go right back in the pawn shop again then fight my way out if I can he said but he redeemed me I hope that I just got so many here I want to get in other words he's trying to get to the people that the right of redemption has been paid so let's add to that let's add to your new birth let's add to what I just let's add to that you're you're out you're free you're out of the pawn shop you never have to go back in unless you want to go back in now you can't lose your salvation but you can go back in and not go up this statue of perfect man can't lose your salvation can't lose your soul but now we're talking about a spirit realm we're talking about the the middle guy the spirit realm and we'll look at that this afternoon I think I got a couple of quotes on that if I get to them that Spirit realm is the is like the soul but it's not exactly because remember anointed ones at the end time can be black in their soul but their Spirit be anointed by this Holy Ghost I'm talking about but what they did was they didn't come out of the pawn shop they just got washed up a little bit and said I'm just fine right here I'm good they didn't accept what you and I have accepted if you're born again they didn't accept that so they stayed in there but remember they stayed bound you and I when we come out we're free praise the Lord add to your new birth our Minister that word add means Minister Minister nourishment what do we getting today we're getting nurman somebody's telling you you're free somebody's telling you you don't have to go back in the pawn shop you don't have to accept that box of snake but what do we do we do anyway we're trying our best though to shave all that off to where we can have power our virtue with God we can have the know listen if you don't have the knowledge of God the knowledge of this world is foolishness to the knowledge of God foolishness that's why the when the very knowledge of God stood on the Earth Jesus stood on Earth and he told them exactly how he was going to come he told them exactly as brother B was talking about the Torah and all the different tal mud and all that they studied that and studied it they loved Hosea Jeremiah they all spoke Jesus looked at him he said they ever want to speak of me why are you killing me they said well you didn't come the way we thought you ought to come am right he came exactly he fulfilled the Old Testament so in the day the son of man will be revealed you and I are going to fulfill the word so much they going to hate us our own ranks are going to hate us I hate to say that but that's exactly where's the most persecution come from inside Judas was sitting right beside Jesus on the night he was betrayed nobody knew it but one guy and that was the son of man he had enough discernment to know what Judas was to supply fir fish to be supplied in other words add to assisted and why does this got to happen why is there a restoration got to come cuz we're in the pawn shop right that's not where we were supposed to be we were supposed to be free Adam and Eve were supposed to have children by the spoken word of God we were to multiply and replenish this Earth not by sex we were supposed to not ever have a headache not ever have a disease not ever have a bad day it's laying right inside you today though what do you mean some kind of story or history brother B said you know it's something I think brother Donnie was talking about this morning it's something way out under what have I told y'all we're a bunch of tunist Jesus is Way Out under and we're over here just struggling no he's right here he's the same person I had a brother asked a question online I'm going to cover it real quick but he said sorry I meant to say John 17:25 he said are you saying this is not another being cuz I said that when Genesis 126 he was talking he couldn't be talking to another person I know brother Brown verbatim quoted that he was talking to another being now look if you look the word being up that means person so he's not talking to another person if he is he's talking to the devil that's the only two people that was there when he was talking but you and I were inside of him and by him knowing that he could talk directly to me and you but he's not talking to another person he's talking to another form of himself that's what you and I another form of himself not another person another form so you can't be a being and when I don't I'm not trying to correct brother brown but that word being means person he wasn't saying that he was talking he's saying he was talking to an in morphe he's talking to a god that moved over in another form so that we could understand that the Son of God had unlimited power and now he's coming down and he's going to be in the beginning was the word and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh Elohim became flesh not another person that's denominationalism that's where they get three Gods that's where they get the trinitarian idea there is three persons in the godhead can't be can't be a separate being unless he's talking to the devil everybody with me on that so when you say being you have to be careful but when a being is another person but it was not another person God was talking to person is a personality unless it's the devil and he's not telling the devil let us make man in our own image the devil didn't have a part of that actually you know what he hated that day that happened and he's been hating it for thousands and millions of years that's right he hated the day God said something and some form came out of him that was him and Satan couldn't understand Satan's like where do he come from hold on a minute I'm not done yet let there be I got to start make devil you go under I got to start making stuff cuz that was the creator the Creator God but all that got lost by what Adam put us in the pawn shop I will restore to you though to you whatever Adam lost in the garden I'm going to restore it back and it's got to be in an entire people because only this time it's the true revelation of the son of man if you want we'll get into that though some maybe I understand that but but the son of man was a word made flesh son of man's got to be the word made flesh in me and you you and I have to become the son of man where what we speak is what God Said Amen can't do that well you know go somewhere else you become an unbeliever that's right I believe what God Said and I'm waiting on a manifestation of it you say well you're waiting um see it's right here patience to wait on who did I say God that he'll do what he said he would do that's the problem with Eve she couldn't wait on God to get his plan fulfilled she had to help him amen that's the way listen that same spirit is in the church today remember brother brandham he was Discerning that brother walking through the house he went to the brother and said brother said you commit an adultery on your wife he said no brother Bram I and then the angel remember brother BR said the angel took him over to the side and said no he's messing with organized religion that denominational idea is a system to God just like Eve was it's a horr system to God and it can't be brought back this is restoring me and you because we're able to be restored we're able for somebody to get us out of the pawn shop that's right and we accept that and we got to start believing that cuz he said I will restore to you the years the Locust eat all the way down you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord that ha them de what wondrously with you and my people shall never listen if you're ashamed of this message if you're ashamed of this gospel you need a new birth you need new birth I kind of was thinking about this the other day and uh I believe what Lord wanted me to put this in here do you remember the dream or the vision brother B had about the bride coming in preview if not I'm going to read it to you everybody all right with this but this is part of you this is this is listen this is the vision that reveals to me where I am I'm the bride I'm not a church I'm the bride and the bride has to come into preview twice the church only comes into preview one time and remember she was naked she was twisting she was rocking roll that was the churches out there I'm telling you what brother Brown said I'm not making it up then I have to watch her watch he she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch remember the second bride the second preview the women in the back got out of Step he said get back in line now look it didn't make her church she was still bright she just got out of Step she'll get out of step with that word if I don't watch and when she's passing by when she's passing by if she gets by maybe it'll be my time when I'm over see when I'm finished or whatever is what they were getting back trying their best and was getting back getting line cuz what happened now the first the first preview of the bride was beautiful everything was in order first church ages there was no denominational idea there was no eternal hell there was no father son Holy Ghost baptism it was a pure bride right but couldn't be complete without the Omega bride that's the two previews what happened in between that a church was born prostitutes came out of the mother sorry strong words but that's what the prophet said so what they were getting back trying their best so which one was getting out of line the second group first group was not they went on off brother M said went on off into heaven he said now the church come into view the naked girls and all that they fell off and was wailing and screaming and all that he said that he said he was like oh well Lord I that that's that's my American church and remember the angel said the bride will come at the preview one more time praise God that's me and you I don't care if he said he got out of line because he told us to get back in line and they was looking out somewhere else look watching about that church that just went into chaos so what were they doing they were marching and they were looking at the church remember John admired the church it was beautiful but when she fell off into you read the whole thing chaos but the the front ones never the back ones just two or three of them was kind of stepping out a little bit to the right hand side not staying balance stepping off to the right hand side and looked like was trying to get back in life as they went by they was just past me and oh far as here to the wall past me and I was standing there now I just seen it all move out and leave but you notice the church only comes into view one time each Nation the church but the bride comes into view twice see what it is or what it was now not knowing it but look at it with my message this morning not knowing that see the seed fell in the ground at nah so the first bride was what first three Church ages then what came along n the church be with me the church happened denomination happened man's ideas happened and then God sent a prophet to say now I don't call you church I call you bride I brought you out of that group that was naked blind wretched miserable and don't know it Go praise God what a plan and that you're a part of it yes sir the seed fell on the ground at nah that was the original seed that wasn't false seed that was the original seed and she's come to the process of these denominations which only comes in existence once but the bride returns back again in the last day I will restore see the Masterpiece is brought up that's the reason she was in view reviewed the second time watch she she was reviewed the first time then she was reviewed the second time and she was perfectly the second time like she was the first time oh God have mercy hurry hurry life get in the grain right quick now watch so you you if you look at the pyramid youve got a preview of The Bride these three ages right here you've got a preview of The Bride walking just perfect everything right then you've got nice happens right here the Dark Ages not that they're not bright it's just they were not complete they had their ideas and God winked at some of their ignorance amen everybody with me but to get right here that outpouring of the holy spirit that we're looking at there had to come a second preview there had to come a second part and then we kind of got out of line a little bit cuz you know what just like some of us we don't do everything God tells us to do I'm sorry I don't do everything God tells you to do if y'all do that's okay pray for me well some of you when you say that they look at you like well that happen to you yeah it happens to me I'm a human being watch this ow I have two kids I'm human Josh is in the back all look all others never appeared no more look they never appeared so when God was done with them he was done with them they went out never to come back again but the bride came back cuz she was Alpha and Omega God the great sculptor has made him a masterpiece for it is a piece of his first Masterpiece in other words he got us out of the pawn shot because we were a part of him before the foundation of the world we just got caught remember between Satan and Eve that's right Adam took on her sin so we got put in a pawn shop we didn't come the way God wanted us to come but thank God restoration of the Bride tree real quick may not get too far but that's okay I wanted us to make sure we see this you got to know not think and not hope hope is good but faith is the substance of things hope for so you hope for it right then there's a journey that's called Faith then there's a reality amen I do not need faith brother George to get to church today I'm standing here now I had to have faith to get in the car some of y'all that drive Forge you had to have more faith pickup trucks basically board going but you had to have faith that your wife was going to get up early that that you know you your kids was going to all get together at the same time you get to do you get do you get dress and all ready before your mama does nope didn't think so hey look when a kid looks at you and goes I didn't pick on your sister okay I'm picking on you I bet you she gets ready for you do come on now you're left-handed you got to be able to do something more better than she can but you know what God looks at us the same way he says look come on get ready we got to go quit missing around cuz here we are here that God is here to do exceeding and abundantly whatever we ask him for we need to ask him for what Revelation brother rown said not not we sure we're sick sure we need financial sure we need a new job brother R said pray for Revelation more than anything why because what will Revelation do it'll show you who you are it'll show you where you're at it'll show you your issues it'll show you your problems and it'll do one thing for sure if it's a true Revelation it'll show you how to get rid of them it won't be a thought it won't be a hope anymore it won't even be Faith anymore it'll be a reality that's right I'm going to have faith in my body is going to be changed but one day praise God it will be changed and I'll not need Faith anymore we not need faith in a millennium what do you need faith for when you're perfect but we had four Messengers killed that tree in between those that Dark Age time so if four death Messengers come and they suck the life out of that tree all the way down to the roots for God said I will restore he's going to restore it by four death Messengers killed it four life Messengers were restor it not three four is the four is the number of man we know sometimes it's a bad number but four is a number of restoration that's what it is right here by four death Messengers killed it then four life Messengers will restore it what was the first Martin Luther justification what was the second John Wesley by sanctification what was the third Pentecost with the restoration of the gifts the Holy Ghost baptism of the Holy Ghost what was the fourth the word that was the prophet's message right brought them out of Pentecost not Pentecost stayed where they were at they stayed in their own little pawn shop Christ came through a little man to say I can get you out not brother brandom I Jesus Christ can show you the word so that you can get out of that pawn shop speaking in tongues is not the total evidence it's good restoration the gifts are good but getting out of that pwn shup way better than having gifts cuz gifts and callings are without repentance you can have all the gifts in the world still be in the pawn shop right but once you come out of that pawn shop if Jesus Christ brings you out you're born again right there your soul is redeemed that's what I want you to see but as your soul is redeemed through justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost you got to put the word in it you can't just well I'm born again I don't have to go to church anymore where'd you get that at I'm like a preacher said one time what most of y'all ought to do is is you ought to look on your calendar and think today's Monday cuz most people get healed on Monday I can't come to church I got a headache I can't come to church I got a toe aee I can't come to church I got too much to do and then Monday you spend all day at Walmart healed completely completely healed no you're completely lost if that's what you do you're completely lost you need to realize that's the devil doing that to you that's not God God will never keep you out of church ever you got to fight this thing fight your way in here fight your way in here and I'll promise you it'll be better as you go out that door amen what was the fourth the word and I believe that's what we're under now with the preaching of brother brandham and then the preaching of what brother Dale has been preaching all that it's a progressive word it's being progress we're being Progressive some I'm sorry I think about the other day all the people that had left the church and and I pray for them I don't I don't I don't not like them I mean my I wish we were the church was packed and we had to find another building with all the people that's left and they're wandering out in the world they will amen if you believe you become that word and didn't a word tell you you ask what you will and it'll be done to you you ask you say to this mountain be moved all right the word there was four great prophets we'll I'll go a little bit further is that okay it's just 11:30 one of them Martin Luther he began to shine a little light there was a little light just a very small strength of justification Along Came Wesley strong sanctification after Wesley come the stronger than him Pentecostal the baptism of the Holy Ghost in another great prophet we've been taught that remember the prophet of Pentecost was not brother brandham right amen it was the Holy Ghost himself that's what brother Bram said cuz if not you'd May brother r a messenger to the Pentecostal people not the Holy Ghost come on the day of Pentecost 1906 to restore the gifts then they cabbage down and said no this is it we're done latter rain former rain we're gone we're out of here this is the great Revival do you hear about that Revival that's going on in ashbery Kentucky ashbery College it's been going for days we can't get y'all to come one day it's been going days weeks I'm talking 24 hours there's somebody in that service praying worshiping God that's been going on for 5 six seven days solid but you know what without the true word of God sure God can save them but they ain't a bride one if they ain't got the Holy Ghost it's just emotion it's just sensation it's just we're having a Revival that's why I want us to have a word Revival the word Revival will start in the soul teach us what to do and it'll work its way out then if we want to shout that's great if we want to run that's great if you want to speak in tongues that's great I pray that we speak in Tong I pray that something comes into this church of Prophecy y to stand up and say hey you're not living right or hey you need to go do this or hey you need to go do that it scare us to death we'd all be halfway out the building for they jumped up said stuff cuz all this junk in our life I'm me included well get quiet that's okay you better pay attention one day God's going to bring something I promise you we going to get cleaned up we're going to get cleaned up because even the Bible says the congregation of the righteous there will be no one no sinner sitting in this congregation but in the last days of Malachi 4 Elijah to come with the very word the word of the Lord came to the prophet and the evening light is to come forth to restore and bring back turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of God fourth light four Killers took it four Messengers destroyed it four messengers of of death took it away what in Dogma Creed non word then brother I'm saying and non-word there's nothing to Quicken if you're standing here today with non-word nothing is quickening today it's just going right over your head unless you pull it down and say hey that's for me hey that's for me for messengers of righteousness restored her back again prophesy son of man ain't what we're coming to son of man can these bones live wish we had time I got it wrote down here but I have to miss it prophecy can these bones live what's the four stage that's coming forth of that church that's the four stages of ezekiel's dry bones remember the dry bones came together but they just stood there without number four what was number four breathe oh Breath of God now breathe oh Breath of God now breathe what about the Holy Ghost you're dead without the Holy Ghost you are bu of dry bone standing up you're dead without it but the life only comes not when the senu skin was on them but when the wind blowed upon them that's when come back that fourth message of life I will restore say the Lord hallelujah Glory praise be to God the fourth light is to come that will bring forth the same sign listen we are living in that light now it's not coming it's here justification brought back the pp sanctification brought back the bark doctrine of Holiness what brought back the leaves what Pentecost what does the leaves do when the wind blows but you know what if it's dead you ever seen the dead tree below no it just does this then it breaks off but when you got life y'all ought to try that sometime maybe it give you a little bit of Life rejoicing I don't want us to be a bunch of Pentecostal people but I want you to be a little more joyful than you are now you've got eternal life in your soul and I hope you're listening to the word of God now and it don't make you happy I put them two Vats together two two plugins right what the fourth was the word itself the word made flesh fruits of the proof of the Resurrection sign that Christ has finally finally after justification been planted sanctification been planted baptism of the Holy Ghost organizations died out and Christ has again centered himself look like the cap of the pyramid first line justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then the coming of the cap what is it that Holy Ghost Bunch being honed what are we doing today we're being honed all the stuff we don't need should be shaved off so that it can fit with the same kind of ministry he had when he went away who went away the Son of God didn't go away the son of man went away right God in human flesh went away so that he can send back the Son of God in the Holy Ghost to be with the people number three justification sanctification Son of God fourth is the son of man the word made flesh is the son of man I just read that to you in John 1:1 same kind of ministry he had when he went away when he went away was there a doctrine of of three Gods when he went away was there a father son Holy Ghost baptism when he went away was there a Baptist idea no it was a pure word but it was the infancy of it it was the beginning of it you had to have a Alpha and Omega according to the Bible the beginning and the end watch this same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture where the Justified Sanctified and the baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again whether you go or not whether I go or not this is going to be made manifest the tree of life is growing again where out in the field no and you remember I read you the scripture she is a tree of life she is the bride is the tree of life that's the only Tree of Life this man I know y'all walk out in the world and rub shoulders with them so do I I feel sorry for them they have they have no idea what's coming they look toward government they look toward a denomination the Methodist Church is getting ready to split there may be some Churches empty we could buy real cheap but no the Methodist Church is fixing to split wide open they won't allow Prost they won't allow um prostitutes they won't allow gays some won't some will so they're going to split neighbor I was talking to a neighbor the other day and I said what are you going to do Jerry he said he said I might just start my own church I thought you might could try coming to your neighbor's church and see what's going on over here but you know what we got the same thing in the message folks I mean we can say well we're up here and we got all this clean no we got all kind of denominations in this in the in the church to in the bride well not the bride but in the so-call the uh what you call them the uh mixed multitude but listen brother B said this Brides brides churches Brides churches he makes a big long he said but there's going to come one there's going to come one one people one group that's going to but take this message and live it not talk it live it and going to manifest watch this right here then we'll close I didn't even get to knowledge tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside of this time this time right now where were there ever a time in history that manifest the time to deliver all nature nature nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation while before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out all the Old Testament on down here there couldn't have been manifestation see and what what brother I'm saying is let me interpolate they were in the pawn shop and they couldn't get out because the blood of bulls and goats just covered them while they were in there didn't save a person Holy Ghost filled person in the Old Testament it just cap oer covered it so that God couldn't see it but you and I come to a place where you were taking out of the PCH J and listen God's able to use this thing now it's not inside locked up behind the devil's door you get out here where God can use this thing y'all be like an old chainsaw you look in the pawn shop and you see chainsaws I don't know why people they must not like to work that they put their chainsaws up for H I hope the devil watches that and the Lord goes and gets that chainsaw and that's you and I hope he comes out and he uses it as brother Ernie vill W said not just we're not just going to peack on this devil he said hack him went through all that uhuh I want to take chainsaw with double double chainsa on it and cut that sucker to pieces you say oh you just aren't you tired of the devil beating on you aren't you just really tired of the devil just beating on you living in your house well guess what there's a provision if you'll do what God said the problem is we don't look it had to wait till this time now all things have been brought coming shape into a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men what these five-fold Ministry not one tap church right the spirit of God coming into these men so perfectly until their Ministry their ministry will be so close like Christ to join him and the church together I got to cover this cuz Bob covered it while it's fresh in your's mind I'm going to scroll through here close your eyes if this makes you sick see how far down it was right here Revelation cuz brother rown said look there is nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word of God nothing nothing of such prevailing power not just up power one day and down the next prevailing power means all the time that means working all the time in your life there's nothing such prevailing power as the revelation of the word and what does that word revelation mean the act or process of disclosing something previously secret or obscure especially look something true so we know God's true we know he's the truth we know he's the word so if there's anything covered by him when we uncovered it's got to be truth it can't be a copy amen we see a lot of copies of Moses sitting on that throne with a little piece off of his knee but there's one original over there somewhere in the Lou or wherever it is over in France somebody's got it over there there's an original there's a bunch of little bitt ones you see them all over the place we're not that we're off the original that's why he had to Smart that they smoke us a piece of himself is a piece of you the act of process of disclosing something previously secret or obscure especially something true a fact disclosed or revealed especially in a dramatic I like that or a surprising way wo never seen that before listen to this right here musicians come on let's stay God's disclosure of his own what nature listen when you get a revelation is not some man's idea it's a revelation of God's nature God's wanting you to see him that's why the statute perfect man is so important it is him being made manifest or made known in a bride that's never been before since the beginning of time God's disclosure of his own nature and his purpose for man kind the plan especially through the words of human Not Angels did it say Angels no it says human intermediaries Apostles prophets pastors teachers evangelists Sunday school teachers something in which such a Divine disclosure is contained such as in the Bible amen so there's no prevailing F power the the prevailing overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us however you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism is right there staring you in the face wow I bet you them people sitting in that Auditorium that day that were trinitarians thought man this guy's crazy that's why they hated him that's why he kept hating him because why they kept hating Jesus he was wonderful oh Jesus had 50,000 people 25,000 people right when he died there was one him was the only person left brother brandham when he started preaching I I was um scrolling through YouTube the other day and it's some I can't remember The Minister's name um Roth David Roth anyway he's a he's a a commentator you know he brings people in well he brought this guy in young kid want to smack him in the face brought this young whipper snapper in and he talked aled about William brandham no greater gift the whole healing movement was by this William Marian brandom and I mean I thought man this guy's got to be a message preacher he got right to the end you know what he said he said but he was probably about the worst Bible teacher I've ever heard I thought dude you're totally deceived why would God that's why I want to ask these people that that that's run away from the message brother Brian didn't preach he wasn't a flash in the pan he wasn't a 30 minute John the Baptist 6 months and he's gone he preached 30 years God Vindicated him for all 30 of them how could God a man can't keep it together but through that prophet he kept everything together sure they hated him they hated Jesus that's right Jesus preached three and half years in the whole world was against him brother Brown preach 30 years 30 years and you know what he tell the same story now it might be it might be a little different but every bit of it was he'd tell that same story he'd stand up there and he'd say if I've told you the truth tonight he said let God come and back it up let God now listen if he was a false prophet God didn't have to God didn't have to back him up he could have said no you're not preaching my word you're a false prophet and he could have been like baale and been a flash in a pan and had a little bit of a gift and calling whatever but 30 Years brother Jo think of 30 years this man went on the field and preached to 20 30 40,000 miracles documented not just Word of Mouth documented Miracles and he just kept going until he had to come to preach what the Revelation that he come to preach and that was the seals and that's when they hated him that's when that little whipper sniper kid on the on the on the U can't remember his name it doesn't matter on YouTube says oh he's he wasn't a very good Bible teacher why would God use somebody for 30 years and him not be a good Bible teacher it's because you know what what brother Brandon preached same way with Jesus Jesus stood there he said if you don't believe I am he you're ding your sin they're like what I was not born to fornication like you was I I I know the Torah I know the Moses quotebook I got Abraham I got all Abraham's tapes well here we go I got all Abraham's books he said if you to believe Abraham you believe me he connected it where they couldn't unconnect it he had so much influence though with the people when he would say that that's what made them mad cuz it turned the people against the the denomination of the day listen he didn't have a problem with Sinners and prostitutes right right always there'd be one Pharisee walk in and he just tore the whole thing apart now that was the religious people of the day right that was supposedly the ones that had the truth right supposedly had the truth right and he said you're of your father the devil you're a snake you're a liar you know what he was doing he's trying to save their soul but he knew there was so much in them of hatred he couldn't save them he couldn't save them sure he died for everybody but he knew who he was going to get out of that pawn shop he knew who would come out he knew who wouldn't but he didn't get up there and say well bless God I'm not dying for them Pharisees no he said Lord father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing right do we no father burn their house down destroy them they're against me make their car engine blow up it's kind of the way we are if they don't believe what I preach let them be cast out well guess what Jesus never was that way so I don't think we should be that way he died on that cross for everybody but he knew being God he knew who would and who wouldn't who wouldn't accept it so he died for me and you he died to get us out of that pawn shop praise God and then out of that pawn shop we still got work to do why would you take a chainsaw out of the pawn shop to use it put gas in it put oil in it then go cut trees down go cut the devil down so he wants to take you out of the pawn shop to use you not to take you out and go oh that's a pretty that's pretty chainsaw no he had a purpose when he got you out every one of you purpose when he got you out of that pawn shop we got to now what step into that Revelation or that Vision that God had of us let's sing a song God bless [Music] you coming
