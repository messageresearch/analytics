an ear let him hear what the spirit says Lord we know it takes the Holy Ghost Lord Lord we can physically hear the words Lord through our five senses Lord but that it doesn't do us anything any good Lord unless it's the holy ghost that comes and quickens the word and father we can we can speak but we don't know what is needed which direction to go but Lord we just yield ourselves to you that that you help us this evening Lord bless each one that has a need Lord we've heard all the requests this mention all the hands that's been raised Lord you know each need each heart each desire and we just

Eternal lord to bless one just to get one into the end of the Kingdom Lord Brother R said be attached to that Soul For Eternity what a great thing and father we just let want to be faithful in all that you've called us to do Lord just bless us tonight we commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Ephesians chapter 4 I'm sorry for and verse 11 it says and he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ to we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God un a perfect man under the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we hence we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the slight of man and cunny craftiness whereby they lie and wait to deceive but walking the truth but speaking the truth in love may grow up in Him in all things which is the head even Christ he says for for from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part make it increase of the body unto the edifying of itself in love amen God bless you tonight and my you saw my title the effectual working of the body of Christ and you know there's many things that we can look at tonight but you know there's in Ephesians chapter 3 brother uh the prophet the Apostle Paul was speaking here in Ephesians chapter 3 and I just want to read this he says for this cause I Paul the prisoner of Jesus Christ for you Gentiles if you have heard of the dispensation of the the grace of God which is given to me to you how that by Revelation he made known unto me the mystery as a write a for in few words whereby when you read you may understand my knowledge in the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the spirit that the Gentiles should be El fellow aers of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel whereof I was made a minister according to the gift of the grace of God given unto me by the effectual working of his power un unto me who am less than the least of all the saints is the grace given that I should preach among the Gentiles The unsearchable Riches of Christ and to make known and to make all men see what is the Fellowship of the mystery which from the beginning of the world hath been hid in God who created All Things by Jesus Christ to the intent that now upon now to the principalities and powers and Heavenly places might be known by the church the manifold wisdom of God according to the Eternal purpose which he purposed in Christ Jesus our Lord in whom we have boldness and access with confidence By The Grace by the faith of him wherefore I desire that you Fain not at my tribulation for you which is for your glory amen So speaking of here uh Paul speaking talking about the effectual working of his power and it's interesting you know Paul's speaking to the Ephesians and he's and he begins to talk about the mystery and and understanding what his mission was was to preach the mystery of Jesus Christ to the Gentiles and and and it's so amazing that to read what he was talking about how all Through the Ages nobody saw these things but it come to this time and God began to make himself known and explain to the Gentiles that they should be fellows of the of the promise of God and know who we are and know what God has called us to and began to break these things down and the apost Paul stand there and you can imagine seeing these things and understanding all of the prophets and all the ones down through down through history all the ones that God spoke to him began to reveal himself to but he never revealed himself the way he did to Paul begin to speak into the Gentiles for us to understand who we are and what God the pro the plan of God the promise of God all the way down through time what God brought to us all the things that took place came down to our day this is for us and Paul begins to speak of that and when he began to understand that he stood there and said I'm the least of All Saints to understand the position that he was in and know where he came from and know what kind of life that he live now you could you as as far as a man he could stand there you couldn't put a finger on his life because he lived such a holy righteous life according to the law but knowing what he done to the Christians because when God had when he had an experience with God and began to understand all those people that he prosecuted and persecuted and he allowed to be put to death all of that was Jesus Christ in flesh in front of him and he didn't realize what he was doing and you know as he stood there and and he said he was a blasphemer but but he did he done all those things without you know in ignorance and and all these things that he begins to talk about what a what amazing thing that Paul a great man that Paul was and but he began to understand how you know because brother BR said you know you don't Revelation doesn't puff you up it doesn't raise you up but it makes you humble the more that God begins to reveal to you you become humble and here he is he was the least of all of them the grace that God because when he looked at the life he was that he lived and What kind of person he was the amount of fold Grace that was presented to Paul in his life that God gave him the Revelation to bring to the Gentiles to make known all these scriptures and all these things that was made known in our day and he began to speak of this and what a great man but he understood wow what a what a great thing but what a what a humbling experience it was what an awesome awesome responsibility that he was given but he said I I was given this to preach the The unsearchable Riches of Christ to the Gentiles and what a great man and to we are the beneficiaries of the great work that the Apostle Paul done and and laying out the scripture and all these things that's been and each one of them had to do their own part but you know it took it was the power of God in his life that that he began to do these things and you know we we look many times and we think about the the the power that God has the power of God and brother B said you know there's only two powers that we that are out in the world there's only two powers and he said one of them is the Holy Ghost and he said the other one is intellectual powers and you know that's the one that the devil wants to work through he wants to work through intellect he wants to work through your mind he wants to pervert what God has said because that's the only that's the only Avenue that he has and the the only Avenue that Satan ever has is what you allow him to have he's he's Bound by your by your confession by your profession by by your testimony your you bound him he he's only allowed because he's because see brother R said that's exactly what took place in the Garden of Eden he had intellectual powers and he came to even the Garden of Eden and began to speak to her on the word and when he got her off of the off of the behind from behind the word he got her off the foundation that she was planted on when she got off of the foundation of the word then he could talk to her and could convince her of what was what was not right but she began to believe in that and not only did she believe that but she began to walk in that and then all of a sudden you know because when it became into the womb of her mind that that was true what Satan had told her what the serpent told her was true that you're going to bring children this way and how all these all this is going to be so great I'm going to I'm coming to this great thing I'm look what I'm going to do for God and not realizing God had already told her listen you stay in there you wait on God there's a place for you to come to and you wait on God and he's going to bring you to that place well because you know when God began to speak to Adam and Eve in the garden you know what the serpent wasn't there Satan wasn't there he didn't you know what because when he began to speak to him that wasn't that wasn't had nothing to do with any of that but then all of a sudden Satan hey I got I got I got I got something to tell you well you know what God was the one that was doing the speaking and it was just Adam and Eve and God that was that was the Oneness and that and then all of a sudden I I got well you know well you know you know that the devil is is telling you the truth when he's talking because he's got you know you know just just like when when brother BR talking about when Satan come to him when he when Sharon Rose and and sister uh hope passed you know when he began to speak to him about what was taking place you know he had that was that was his inroad just like he told just like he told Eve well well we know we know the Lord said that you shouldn't touch this over here this this is not this not something you should touch but let me tell you I got I got an inside track I got a tip for you y and as soon and and so just like brother brand out there you know you said he was a Healer you said he was a good God but you know what your baby's dying your wife's dying and you pray and you pray and you know what he's turns his back on you and he was standing there saying you know I was about ready to agree with him but you know what he said the he said the Spirit come to him and he tell remembered the word the Lord gives and the Lord takes away hey you know what it wasn't it wasn't mine to begin with it wasn't it because it God give it to me and God has the ability to take it away and who am I to question his wisdom and how he handles it and so that was the thing that Eve had a problem with was she wanted to use her intellectual ability instead of standing on god-given wisdom right what was it it was the word that was preached to her to stand on the word and listen you stand there but when she got it in her mind that there was a better way that Satan had a better way that the serpent had a had this new idea this new revelation that that he was going to share with her that she was going to take a part of something when she got a hold of that and it's like you know what this this is so great this is so great because I got something to do and it looks so good and it looks so great and it's just so exciting and it's contrary to the word and when she when she done that then all of a sudden you then when she received that in her mind then she was able to commit an act that was immoral that's right it was contrary to the word amen but you know she didn't see that and when Adam when Adam came to the scene you know when he seen what took place and then he all you know took took a part of that when he partook and realizing what was taking place he should have not had anything to do with that but because of his love you know they both went away from God they broke the Commandments of God but here it was that when they done all these things God made a way for them amen God made a way for him come back but you know the wonderful thing is is when God knows exactly what you're going to do when you're going to do it how you're going to do it he knew what was going to take play what was going to take place and he already had a because the lamb stood from the found slain from the foundation of the world he already had a way made he knew what was going to take place what a wonderful thing that even though you because many times we'll get in our in our in our human existence in our life we get so Bound by things that have taken place and we allow the devil to get in into situations and things happen and you know what we get so Bound by the things that have taken place but you know what thank God God already knew about that God knew where you was going to be at God knew all your faults and failures and all your problems and all your disappointments and your heartaches and everything and you know what God still loved you God still made a way for you because you always a part of him if you were chosen in him before the foundation of the world praise God I always was a part of him and it doesn't really matter what takes place I can't be lost because if God thought of me in the eternals then you what I always be there and that's what I'm going back to I've come from God I'm going back to God that can't get away from that I may stumble I may fall I may fail but praise God there's a way that I've that's been made for me and all I got to do is walk in that even even when brother Bram was stand there talking about brother Ramsay in the Hebrew series even when when a child of God Falls and won't go back when you made it when you're still a child of God no matter where you go or what you do you you're still not lost but there's a punishment that comes you're still corrected there's still chastisement but praise God he doesn't do away with you the love of God is greater am than all of our sins all of our problems all our heartaches whatever comes our way the love of God is greater than that and the pro the power of God is because through the through the new birth we have received this power that that has come inside of us Jesus says in acts in Acts 1: 18 we know the scripture he said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and he said he said then you you begin to be Witnesses unto me and all through throughout Judea and all Samaria and all the different places the uttermost parts of the world so he said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you and we know that the Holy Ghost was given for a re you know because when the Holy Ghost has come he he is our he is our advocate he is our guide he is our propitiation all these things that that that the he's our seal all these things that have been given to us by the Holy Ghost and we also receive power and he said he said you will be L led into all truth he's here to lead and guide you into all truth and as as we because if you know where you're standing then you have power you have authority to when you know where you stand because many times if you don't know where you're standing if you don't understand then you know what you don't have a way you don't know what to do because you know one of the one of the worst problems that people have is in action you know you listen to brother brandham talk about you know he would standing there you know and and the Lord got on to brother brandham many times because you know all he wanted to do was just stand there and say well Lord what am I supposed to do and he said what are you going to say about it what are you going to say about it you know there was a time brother brand had to had the the uh Vision or the the the Angel of the Lord spoke to him the Lord spoke to him and told him said listen he said you're getting ready to be tried there's a trial coming and he began to speak you know began to think about it and he you know had people praying he was trying to figure out what was going to take place and you know when he went through all that he didn't know what was going to take place but he was but he was thinking on that and he kept meditating on that said Lord what you know what am I what do you want me to do what am I supposed to do and you know he was in that meeting that night and he was up there and he seen that young man and young woman up there in the balcony acting immorally and he kept telling them to stop and you know what that man just looked at him and just kept on and he said you know this is a this is a house of God this is a meeting and said you shouldn't act like that you know if you're not if you're going to act like that you need to leave but you know what that man was arrogant in his his approach and kept doing that and it didn't change anything but you know what then the Lord spoke to brother brandham and said whatever you say whatever you say will happen that's right he said now lays in your La what will you you say when that person comes up before you their souls are in your hands what will you do and you know brother brandom said he could have spoke and both of they' have carried both of them out they'd have both dropped dead in the floor and they' have carried them out but you know brother brandham said you think the love of God and he said 'I forgive you because that was that was the love of God that was the spirit of God being made known my and they said you know they got up and left but he realized that was the test what would what would we do in that situation because sometimes you know it's like hey you know what I'm going Flex my muscle but you know we don't approach it with humility sometimes we don't put ourselves in the other person's shoes if we were in that if we were in that position what would you want somebody to do for you amen that's that's that's Grace that's Mercy when when when you don't deserve it but you show it to somebody see when when the Holy Ghost comes and we have we receive that power see then it gives us the other thing it gives us boldness you know brother R speaking there he said you know he said there were a bunch of there were a bunch of cowards up in the upper room wondering if what was going to take place what was what was going to happen next what you know they were all all scared you know looking out the windows and peeking around the doors and you know so scared of what was going to take place because you know what we don't know what's going on right but praise God when the Holy Ghost came and you know they had they had to wait he said Terry to you being du with power from on high well you know when the when the when the Holy Ghost came he didn't tell them what was going to take place he told he didn't he never told Peter and them he said listen y'all go wait in the upper room you need to wait 10 days and what's going to be what's going to be the sign is this rushing Mighty wind's going to blow in and tongues of fire is going to split and lay upon all of you then you'll know you got the Holy Ghost now he told him he said he said y'all go tell in Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high and when when and so they didn't know what they were waiting on that's right they sat there waiting well what is it well well I think we might just take it by faith he's said well you know I I think I think we might have we've been here we've been here nine days I think we pretty much got it how much you know how much longer do you think we need to wait but you know what it never it never changed who they were they never had a change why because nine days in you know what I'm sure they probably they probably had a little bit of relief because you know what so far we've been here nine days and we Ain nothing happened to us we were probably a little more scared the first two days wondering what was going on but you know what the Romans ain't showed up now it's been nine days we might have flown under the radar a little bit but you know what they still was wondering what was going to take place but you know what they still was waiting and tearing for the answer from Heaven what what the answer was that they were waiting for whatever Jesus told them they were still waiting on [Music] that but praise God when the answer came when the when the spirit came you know what they didn't have to worry about whether they had it or not they didn't have to worry about it why because they were so afraid and so scared and so and so nervous and and so upset by things but you know when they got full of the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost fell upon them that day you know what they got so happy they got so drunk in the spirit that they staggered out the door like drunk people and you know they did not care what anybody thought of them they didn't care what anybody said to them why because they had something they had the Assurance of the word had come in because all of a sudden what they had heard for three and a half years became a living reality to them and then when they walked out the door Peter could stand up there with the 11 and began to speak to him and said listen we're not drunk like you think they are we're not this but this is that that was spoken by the prophet Joel and now this is the manifestation of what you've read all those years that you've been sitting in the temple reading the books and every all the all the priests and everybody been standing around all the rabbis and the Sadducees everybody have stood around looked at this all this but let me tell you now's the manifestation of that you're standing in the front of the manifestation of that and he said it is preached unto you because this is for you and your children and to them that's a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call so the holy ghost that began to make a boldness and begin to preach and began to identify the word to them and when they begin to hear the word then they begin to hear the word in their own tongues they begin to understand what God had said to them and they begin to understand then when they began to catch on to them then they were quickened by that they were pricked by the word and they come forth to brother to the the apostles and ask you know how do we get saved and they received and were baptized and received the Holy Ghost and it was three added at one time as a brother was talking about he said he said the amazing thing about that you imagine there's 3,000 people come in and they all of a sudden they all want to get baptized well how many people were there well there was 120 in the upper room well if half of them were men you got 60 people if you take half of them you got 3,000 people trying to get baptized each person so you got you got 50 people out there or 60 people out there in the water baptizing 50 people a a Pur prise the Lord so you know what it wasn't just them coming and preaching the word well you know what they spent a long time CU brother brother Wade and brother D they can tell you you you start getting out there baptizing about five or six people after that you know what you start getting tired it starts wearing on you next thing you know you got a whole bunch you know and that probably took a little while you get everybody in the water and all of a sudden it's baptizing one and baptizing another baptizing another but you know that's that's the work of the lord it's not just well the praise the Lord you know what the Holy Ghost fell and they just but you think they had to labor there was a lot of work that took place that time behind the scene there was a lot of work that took place there a lot you know because they had to labor with that you try to baptize 3,000 people there's a whole bunch of people out there looking saying what are they doing no doubt there was probably a little crowd that gathered up around the water you got 3,000 people getting baptized it's like how many people do you know that got baptized well you know John baptized people you remember that crazy fell come out of the woods he was dunking people in the water too and Jesus you know that other fellow he was out there dunking people in the water too you know and all of a sudden you start seeing all these crazy people you know they all gather around trying to figure out what's going on he's like I don't know about y'all but we got to keep an eye on that group right there but all of a sudden you know they had a testimony all of a sudden you know they began they begin to preach the word and began to live a life before the people that you know it wasn't it wasn't just hey we're just trying to teach you something no they began to manifest the word they began to tell about the word they begin to manifest something to front of the people because all of a sudden there's people like well I don't agree with that but let me tell you something there's something different about them people there's something different about them you may not agree with it but you know what they're they're not like everybody else there's power there amen and you there's lots of people that you know they they want to get away from that Peter and John as they as they were walking in the in the word and begin to preach and prophesy and begin to speak to the people and do Miracles you know hey you can't do that here you know what you might you might do that some other place but you know what we're we're respectable people around here and we're not going to have any Riff Raff around here and we're going to put you in jail lock you up beat you up whatever you're not going to do that around here you know what and they got and and the scripture tells us that Peter and John and them when those things happen to them you know what all it done was it made them more bold praise the Lord that I can I can suffer for the name of Jesus Christ for the word and you know what you're not going to stop it I get I get more more excited I get more energized because a watch taking place can you imagine can you imagine people today and I don't want to say because you know I have to raise both of mine but you know when things happen things come our ways bad things happen and you know instead of raising our hands and thanking the lord hey you know what praise the Lord that these things hum our way you know many times we get a well I don't why did that happen to me why did why did that happen to me you know I you know here I am trying to do the work of the Lord and all they're trying to do is hinder me but you know what that's what Satan is supposed to do that's Satan's job he's supposed to hinder the work of the Lord however he can but you know what it it made them more bold and like you know what you can do whatever you want to to me but you know what when when they when you let us out of here we're going to go out and we're going to be more bold and because we're going to preach more why because it's the leading of the just just like those people the the saints that were in in China years ago when they when they first received the the message and you know brother bisco and the different ones were over there ministering to them and you know all of a sudden they were so afraid of what the what the government was going to do to them and all the you know they were so afraid well you know what after they got locked up and put in jail when they got out you know what there was a boldness That Came Upon them people you know what they praise God you know what because we can suffer for the name of Christ but you know what it makes a it makes us more bold amen why because you know that's what God has called us to be bold before the people we've got a testimony I'm not ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ so I'm not backing up from it I'm standing firm I'm going to let everybody know when those when those people went and you know the Saints in China when they were under persecution and all those and there was a church over there that you know they they had gathered they kept having being harassed by the by the government you know they kept having issues for every place that they were meeting and all that and the pastor stood up one day and he told him he said listen he said I want everybody to go home and pray he said I'm not going to tell you where we're going to have church he said let the Lord speak to you and wherever the Lord tells you what we're going to have church next Sunday next time said you'll show up he said we didn't we didn't make any plans but they began to pray each one of them began to pray because there was some reason that somehow that the government kept finding out what was going on and where they were meeting and all those things but when they began to pray then the Lord began to speak to each one of those people and guess what at the appointed time they all showed up for service except for one person why because it was the one that was against them the one that was in there but God LED them and all of a sudden when when they realize you know what we've G through all of this and all of a sudden you talk about you talk about a boldness that come upon those people why because God because all of a sudden they realized that God was in their midst God was leading them even though they had suffered for all this time and all these problems but yet you know what there was come a time that God began to speak to them and led them to a place that they come out from underneath that and all of a sudden they realize you know what it's not it's not just some just some problem or or whatever but God made a way for them and God LED them through that and all of a sudden they realiz there's a boldness that come why because we've seen God work in our midst we've seen God work miracles in our midst and when you when you began to see that how God began to work in their midst all of a sudden it became a boldness upon those people and they began to express these things to the to the people and began to let let the people know God's real what God has done for me when when we come through these things we know that that that when you we receive the the Holy Ghost the new birth is has come upon us then we realize that there's a a child training and that you know we have to grow up there's a training that goes through and you know brother Ram talked about in the restoration of the brid tree he was talking about the the the young man that was going through his training and he said the newsman was following him he was out there and he's talking about the machine gun fire going over his head and he was talking about the sand in his pocket and all that kind of stuff he said he was going through all that rigid training he said that's what we're doing here we're going through rigid training why because he said there's a battlefield out there but we got to go through training now to get ready for that battle because we don't know what's going to come our way but God is training us to be weapons of of the Warfare of the spirit spiritual warfare of Jesus Christ that we are we are to be soldiers of the army of God you know we have we have to go through these things and you know we don't understand why we have to go through these things but praise God brother BR said that God knows how to train a man he go he knows exactly what you need to go through to make you into the person that you ought to be you know we go through these things and you know uh I was talking about you know brother Andre was in the was in the Marines and you know one of the things I we was talking about when I was up there you know you talk about you know brother Donnie said one time and I've told many people this brother Donnie said one time he said you know you go through the Marine Corps you become a Marine he said whatever they teach you to do he said if you just follow what they tell you to do all you got to do is follow exactly what and you can do whatever they tell you to do it may look it may look so impossible to you but all you got to do is come to the place that because you if you get in the into the Marines and you go through the training they make it in your mind that you follow exactly what they tell you to do and you get to the place that you could believe what they tell you that that you can do and all you got to do is follow what they tell you and how to do it and guess what you'll you'll overcome you'll do whatever they tell you that you can do you know it's it says you know to adapt and improvise and overcome whatever you come against whatever you do if you follow the plan you'll overcome and it's the same way brothers and sisters with the plan of Jesus Christ with the word of God you can overcome and there's a way made but you come through that training if you just follow that plan you will overcome come but there's a way made already made the way is already made but you all you got to do is believe it and walk in it if you would just walk in that way if you will follow the plan you'll overcome why because that's what he wants us to do to have confidence in go in the word he wants us to have confidence in these things that we can believe what God Said is true and all we got to do is believe it and then we can walk in it amen amen here he is this is from the message why Christ speak brother R speaking of of Moses and he's talking about going through all this training and he said you know he at one time he said standing in the presence of the anointing in the presence of a burning bush he said he know more about God than he learned in books in the 80 years of his life God trains man and then anoints him gives him experience takes him through the rigored training right down through the Sands of a burning punishment trying and testing not only does he do that to His prophets he does that to his children every son that cometh to God must be chastised and tried tested by the by his word see then the pinch comes the strong time when it comes when he faces death you are able to stand there on the word of God see God said so that settles it so when you go through these things it look so hard and they're so tough and whatever it may be but y if you follow the plan that God has laid out then you're o able to overcome whatever whatever you know many times we go through lots of training but you know it may be only for one time but you know what I would rather just like the the man that you know the lady that that brother R talks about you know she just ran at that barn and she got everything ready to have one church service because it was so burning upon our heart to have one church service to to to evangelize the city you know she cleaned everything up got everything ready and hired a preacher to have one service why because that was her goal to reach out to the lost because it was burning on her heart to do that why because they were lost and dying everywhere and she went in there to have a church service and only one person showed up right well you know what everybody else would have looked at that and said well you know what that was an utter failure that was a waste of time why would you do that but you know what they didn't realize that the young man that walked into that night and received the Holy Ghost received the Lord tonight got saved to come into the kingdom of God that night was Dwight Moody Heroes DL Moody and what did Brother BR said hundreds and thousands were saved under his his ministry he read thousands to the Lord under his ministry but what was it they didn't see that they didn't see the ey they didn't see a long range Vision they didn't see the Through The Eyes of Faith they didn't see what was going to take place all they could see was just some little old woman that just maybe she didn't have two nickel to rub together but she spent all she had and whatever she could to rent that little barn and have a service and only one person showed up and said I wouldn't have wasted my time to do that well you know what if we could see through the eyes of faith if we could see in that other dimension to see what was taking place then you know what how many people would have stood up and said I want to be there I just swap places with her why because she had to do nothing and it was just that one little thing that took place and in the midst of all that when that took place then what happened look many times we fail to see that what God has call us to do just small things just the minor things yeah we don't realize how much of an impact it will take place what what kind of Eternal impact these things are going to have you know just it's just you you think about the there when U when the widow woman there and Elijah when he had was sitting down there by the Brook Cher and you know and the and the Ravens were feeding him and he was sitting there and every everything was drying up in in Egypt and Israel and everything was you know drying hang up and there was nothing there and all all the uh cursed upon everybody when Elijah told him he said listen he said he said it won't rain until I call for it because the sin that y'all have committed here this that God has brought this upon y'all and they're standing there and under the midst all those people are dying trying to make a living trying to scrape by trying to do what they can to survive and yet the prophet is said down by the Brook Cher and you know what he's drinking out of the brook and the Ravens are feeding him let me tell you something brother sister when you're in Christ there's a place that God will bring you to and sometimes like I've said it before sometimes we go through things in our life we don't know why things happen the way they do sometimes we're sitting at the brook cherith and we don't even realize it God's brought us to a place he's feeding you he's taking care of you he want you to be in this place as a place of refreshment a place of the Rejuvenation that you come into sometimes God don't want us always up and going and doing things sometimes it's just a so quiet and then when the brook dried up he went down there to the widow woman he's down there having a great time Supernatural meetings going on and she was drying up trying to make a living dying and here she is down there and and trying to make by and and when when the prophet comes down there and speaks to her he says hi can I get a drink of water you know what she didn't have a problem with that but when it come to giving that morsel of bread can you bring me a morsel of bread in your hand she had a problem with that listen I ain't got nothing I got just a I just got some leftovers over here ain't much of nothing left so we going we going I got two sticks we're going to build a fire we're going to make up the rest of this we're gonna eat it and die you see everybody all around us everything dried up you know how many people we know that already died can you see can you see all the devastation going on well I've seen all that and you know what he didn't run up there and tell her listen I want to tell you something I've seen the supernatural I had the Ravens come feed me he didn't tell her anything of that that's right but he told but he told her he said listen if you will give me that little cake first just that little bit first if you're if you're willing to part with a little bit he said I'm going to tell you something you're going to see the miracle of God you're going to see the working of God if you just do this one little piece right here he said the Barrel's never going to run out the cruise will never run dry am everybody else is going to be missing but you know what you going to have enough to sustain you all these years if you can just take this one little part if you're if you're willing to do you're a little part and you know what she's like I can do that because you know what she's like I got nothing to lose that's right I could stand here and hold on to what I got but you know what she's like you know what I'm gonna die anyway but you know what there is a way made amen and I can take it by faith and believe if I believe this you know what there there's a way that I could live he's like well I'm going to take I'm going to take you at your word and made that one little cake for him and brought that water and he was able to eat that by what she gave by her faith in that little portion then you know we think well that's that's very insignificant but it meant a lot to her and through that one little bit that was given then through that she was able to be sustained amen just imagine every day she just giving that one little morsel of bread but every day she would go in there more Devastation More Death more heartache all the problems that was there in Egypt I mean Israel when she was going through all of that and but you know what she would go back in the kitchen and open that Mar that Barrel the meal barrel and you know what it was still in there scoop it out turn up that cruise of oil start making her bread there nothing in there now go back in there the next morning take that lid off sitting there scoop it up if you have faith to believe God what could we do what could we do if we just had if we just believe took God at his word you know what you're not going you're not going to convince people that's just like sister Dale was talking about when when brother Dale was sick and she come up here and was giving that testimony you know the Lord come in that room he was in the floor somebody put him on that bed somebody come in that room but you know what she stood there and those paramedics was there told told Lisa it's like who you know what happened well I don't know which of course she did but she wasn't going to tell them cuz they wasn't going to believe her we just we were just in the presence of the almighty and you know what the supernatural took place in this room right now then they would to start looking for you know it's like we need to refer the psychiatrist why because they're not going to believe that why because they don't but you know what if you believe in the Supernatural if you know the same God that I know if you know what's taking place in your life then you know what Supernatural is and you know what he's here every single day of your life he'll wake up in the morning with you he'll go through with you all night long he'll go through the day with you and he's always there to work a miracle there always there to do whatever it needs to be done you know I I was telling them up there that brother Andre you know I was telling about you know the things that that's taken place in our in our lives we've seen these Supernatural things that's taken place and if you could just see the supernatural believe the supernatural what God has done you'll you'll be amazed you know I I I I was telling about when I was working years ago at this company we doing robotic arc welding and I was looking for we was trying to find a jig that you know holds all the parts together and the robot does all the welding so jig fits all the pieces together we was trying to find one so we could finish the job that's all we had to do for the day and we went looking everywhere trying to find that one jig well there was several racks that had all these jigs because some of them was nearly as big as this you know the top of this pull pit here you know some of them were smaller but some of them were big according to what size the parts were and you know we had all these racks everybody was sitting on where everybody it had a had a plate on the bottom it had the number written on it and everybody was going by was trying to find this one had a certain look to it everybody was going through all those racks standing there looking up and down trying like where is that rack we that jig we cannot find it but you know standing I mean standing there that day I prayed the Lord I said Lord you know we need this jig I need to know where it's at I don't know where it's at but you do and and and God is my witness I stood there and I prayed and the Lord led me he just pointed me in that direction I just had the unction to go that direction I climbed on top of that rack and there it was and everybody's like where was that people climbed all over that thing trying to find that looking everywhere for it and yeah but you know everybody had overlooked that thing and for some reason they couldn't find it but you know what God knew it and he gave me the eyesight and he gave me the understanding that if I trusted him and I asked him for then he would show me where it was at and say well you know just as simple things like that why because God wants us to be just to understand that he's mindful of the little things in our lives why was why was when brother Brandon was standing there on the lake and he was when he was with uh like brother woods and then when he was up there and and you know and and the Lord began to deal with him and in the in the third pole and and he was standing there talking and he seen that fish die and he pulled all his guts out and he was laying there why did God heal a little fish when he said had all of those young all those little kids all those kids all those kids that were so sick why why was all those kids that had all those afflictions upon them and you know what God didn't touch any of them but he touched the little fish on the lake why because he said he wanted he was God was showing that he was mindful even of the little things not just the big things but the little things in your life if you if you can just imagine the little things in your life just just like when we lost those when we lost those truck keys the van keys at time on the job and we we looked at we're trying to find those set of keys and you know I I I tell it many times that you know but I I still than the Lord why because it it you know because it it like like Moses like God told Moses he said write a book of remembrance and he said and rehearse these things in the ears of Joshua why because it was something why because Joshua was going to take the people into the land why they because they were going to overcome and I want to say I thought thought about Sister Barbara wanting everybody to send their testimonies in why because there's a book of remembrance to be written and you can those testimony those things to know about these things that you if you know about what what was taking place what God has done what God has done in people's Liv then you know what you stand up and just like brother Ryan talking about the the different testimonies that that he's written over the years about what's taking place why to know about those things what has God done in your life what God because you know what there's one thing that I that I was want to share why why did God do these things you know because if God has has called us to this place why did why why did God call us to this you know it's it's not just just just for me because you know what it is it is for us as as a individual to bring us to a place but let me tell you something it's for us as a body amen for as we read tonight every portion of the body has a portion to do each one of us have something to do and we all have to work together brother BR speaking in the in the message and and see he was speaking in in the message of total Deliverance here and and he says he said I wonder this morning as Christians if we have yielded our own will and wielded ourselves so completely to God till God can trust us the place that he has put us I wonder this morning of myself if I could be so yielded to God till God can trust me could trust brother Neville could trust or truste Bor or board our members of our church he said we all have a place and we got a duty and he's talking about what what a Minister's places and he talking about just continue on down to 53 just keep on scrolling up there and he's talking about the church and he says God gives complete deliverance and he says he will he said he will do it if we'll if we'll completely surrender ourselves to him if we will completely deliver our ourselves into his hand then God can live us Christ the hope of glory he can reflect himself from us as we get ourselves out of the way then our thoughts are his thoughts he said could you imagine Christ smoking a cigar could you imagine Christ drinking or playing cards then if your spirit is part of his Spirit then he wants you he wants it to be upon your confession but you you but you permit the devil to come in and take over and all the time in your heart way down deep you know you're wrong when you do those things he said when one member would talk against the other member you know that's wrong you're commanded to pray for one another not to talk against one another but to love one another and if someone is down let's pick him up help him now that makes us a unified group of Believers now when we don't obey that when we don't obey God we displease God and therefore our church our people cannot Prosper the church cannot go on because we're disunified together as Jesus said A little leaven leaveneth the lump and so we we all have these portions to do but we all got to do what God wants us to do you know because we can we can allow these things to come in and you know just as many times we go through the scripture and all the the different ones aching and different ones come to mind you you look at the scripture when when you don't follow the plan of God if you don't follow the leading of the Lord you know what then everybody fails there's a there's a total failure in the but you know but if we all work together if we all are unified because we don't have any big eyes and little you but we all have the same common goal you know I was thinking about when when um NASA decid you know when they first started the The Space Program under Kennedy you know they were going to put a man on the moon that was the that was their goal you know when those when those scientists and those Engineers come together and they were going to they were going to beat the Russians because you know the Russians were had already got ahead of us and they you know they were already in in space and and all those things but you know they were young young men that had raised up and you know they were some of them come out of the military and everything like that but you know they all worked together some of them some of them had Specialties and and certain things and certain things but you know what they worked in the specialty that God had called that they they had they like listen I went to school for this I'm good at this I'm good at this I'm good at this then everybody had to do their own part because what they were and you know what they they did work together and you know what there wasn't no EG filling up the room why because they had one common goal and that was to put a man on the moon that was that was their goal and you know what they they didn't care what it took they were going to work their way through it and you know they all got together like you know what then because the problems that they come up against you know what they weren't problems they were opportunities to to to advance they they had opportunities to overcome I I got to listen to a man by the name of Dr William Lenor and he worked for NASA and uh he's actually actually flew on on the space shuttle and and he was he was talking about that because he was there one of the first that when when Kennedy give the you know the commission when he laid it out there that what we were going to do and he said you know all these all these men had been to school been become had Doctorate Degrees and and all kinds of things physics and engineering and all this but you know what those men they come together you know what they had they were just so they were just so energized that they were going to do this they never nobody had ever done this thing before for but you know what they conceived it in their mind that they could do it and know what they done it that's all they had to do they had to believe that they could do it and you know what it didn't matter like well you've got this issue you got this issue that didn't stop them like wait we're going we're going to do it and they done it and it's the same thing with you and I brothers and sisters when when things come our way we don't understand why things have to be brother brand was speaking here in in in the in the message I'm going to read this one this is from the message total deliverance and brother Brown speaking this is he was speaking of the U the church and he was talking about Jeffersonville and talking about them wanting to build a church and and go through different things and you know he he said well I don't I you know to me I don't see why we need to build a church now I'm not I'm not preaching this because this is this is trying to you you know let somebody know something I don't got any axes to grind or points to make or anything like that I'm just telling you what brother brandom's talking about but I want but I want to make this one point by what brother brand is saying but you know he said he said I didn't he said I didn't know why we'd need a church but he said I come down and he said I saw the the spirit of the people their desire and he said when I got in there and he said he said then I come down and I felt the feeling of of the church that the church and the minority seem to want it then he said what did I do he said I sacrific my own thoughts and thrown in with the church sure let's do it that's the way we cast lots that's the way it is in the Bible time the way the church voted the sovereignty the groups of the people they come together in unity their strength so I said certainly if that's the way the church wants if that's what God is wanting he's got more of authority to vote amongst a group of people than he has to me because I've no vision to say that it shouldn't be so we throw in with the church and move with the church and I'm behind it to do all that I can see to help out the church you know I I was I was reading that and that just that just jumped off the page at me because you know here's here's brother brand talking about you know I I you know I just don't see why we need to do this but he said the churches the church is W he said if that's what God is wanting he said certainly he said he's got more authority to vote amongst the people than he has with me and you know that that what the reason that stood out to me was coach you know you think you think so many years that when when when brother brandham was here it's like you know brother brandham should I buy a car brother brandham should I do this should I do that you know should I eat cereal in the morning you know I mean so many people was you know they they want to hold on to brother Brandon for every single thing no matter how not how small or insignificant it was it meant something El because they want to get brother brandom's idea for everything we're not going to do nothing you know if brother brand said we all should hop in the church on one foot you know that's what they' do but I mean it was they were so but here's brother brandom said you know what here's I if I don't see that and the Lord and that's what the people are wanting and that's what the Lord is working then you know the Lord has the ability God has the ability to work through the people to speak to the people to work as a unified group that they would vote in the way that needs to be voted and the Lord don't have to tell me what needs to be done that's right brother Brown how you going to vote on this well brother Brown said he's not going to vote for church I'm not going to vote for a church instead of praying and seeking the mind of God and getting your answer and you know we've got we've got people you know and and you you know them and I you know around the around the MS in the ranks of the message you know even even people want to hang on to brother Dale brother Dale what what should I do what should I do and there so many times I appreciate a I should I appreciate a pastor that stands up and so many times he stand up and say you need to get an answer from God for yourself he's not your Holy Ghost now he can always Point things out and sometimes you know he he'll never tell you yes or no but sometimes he just come up and he'll make one statement to you and he'll make you think and then you'll go away thinking about that and you'll contemplate what he said but it's not an answer but it's an Avenue for you to think why because you need to pray and you need to get an answer from God it's not whether his answer is right it's what your answer is and I thought that was so amazing if we work as a unified body then you know what I need to pray amen because my portion is in this body then if we're going if we're going to have an effectual working Body of Christ then I've got to do my part amen Then I then I need to seek God for myself I need to take care of myself you know why because when I do what I'm supposed to do it's a benefit to everybody then it benefits the body it benefits the church then we all need to instead of instead of you know you know like like I've told like I've told the brothers before you know whatever go I'm behind you hey we if if brother Dell stays as a pastor in another 5 years praise God I'm behind him if we wait brother wait in or somebody else in praise God I'm going be behind them why because you know like I told you before it's it's not it's not a person it's not a personality that's right it's the leading of the lord it's the Holy Ghost and guess what if the holy ghost that you have is the same holy ghost that I have then guess what he should put we should be going in the same direction that's right that's it yes sir and if you don't get and if you don't get an answer but you know what if if like through the like brother Ram said through the body if if it's if a vote comes a certain way then you know what we shouldn't well you know I didn't agree with that I don't like that well then you know what we need to put our feelings behind us we don't we don't need to we don't need any of that because you know that's not going to benefit the body that's right see we need to see what our we need to find out what our part is we need to find out what our position is what God is wanting us to do and if we'll do our part then we can be a benefit to everybody you know I was thinking about so many times brother Brandon standing up and you know he would go to have a prayer line and you know here he is standing in the prayer line and he's standing behind the pull pit and he and he's he said well you know who I'm waiting on and he begins to speak so many times he began to speak of the of the Supernatural and he's beg to speak about things taking place but he always tells them listen you don't have to come across this platform you don't need me to lay hands on you he said you don't have to come to a to a a Revival you don't have to go to brother Roberts's meetings or AA Allen or somebody else you don't have to go and have have lay them lay hands on you how many times did he say he said your pastor if he's ordained of God to preach the gospel he can lay hands on you he said you don't need somebody else he said if you're a child of God you can lay hands on people you don't have to wait on somebody else why because you've been given that commission that's your part how many you know when brother Brown was speaking of that of that young lady that was the the the mother that was there and you know she was holding that baby and she had a prayer car but that God La it upon that woman's heart to pray for that baby and sit there and and you know she couldn't get away from that why because God had given her a commission had given her something to do now she had every reason in the world why why she shouldn't do that and she battled that in her mind so well I you know brother B's going to pray for I don't know why but you know what God wouldn't let her away from that let her free of that why because he wanted her to do something and he began to speak to you do this and said well can I hold the baby and know she was holding sister do you mind if I pray for it said the Lord's not just going to let he's not going to let me free of this thing until I do this and so well sure sister go ahead and you know you know she she gave up her seat she prayed for the baby she went and go sit in the balcony and here's brother random standing there and the angel of the Lord standing there and you know all the all the the supernatural's working you the the spirit of the Lord's moving there in the in the platform here she comes with the baby and and brother bom sees discerns the situation he's like you know what this Baby's already healed and said listen that sister up there in the balcony she was down here and she was she was over there and she prayed for the baby and said the Lord healed it when she prayed right she didn't have to wait on me to pray cuz she took care of because God gave her the unction to do that and said listen said she done that why because she was a mother and she could enter in she could enter in for that child he said maybe I could wouldn't have able been able to but that woman could cuz she's a mother and what was it it was showing it was showing how significant that God is and how significant it is so important for us to be led by the spirit and listen to what God has called us to do and do that it doesn't make us big but it it it makes us so so important in the in the body to do what God has called us to do you know you think you think of the you think of the the the woman in Memphis the sister in Memphis here she is standing there with a dying son in this little room you know this little Shack down in the back skirts of of Memphis and you know she may not have anything but you know what she knew who God was she know she knew who to get in touch with and here you know it's so amazing when you begin to to read the the the story of that as as she you know brother bram's there and all of a sudden brother bram's flying by in a plane all of a sudden God grounds that plane in Memphis you know he spends the night he gets up mails his letterss and the Lord begins to speak to him and tell him you need to leave you need to go begins to lead him and he's like you know he go stands in the window you know looking at the cop and he's looking in the window and he's praying Lord is that you is that's what you want me to do and all of a sudden the Lord's telling him keep walking you keep walking so he starts walking down to there I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them here he is he keeps walking and he keeps walking he keeps walking brother Andre said he walked about four or five miles I don't know I know there's I know it was quite A Wass but he just kept walking here he was just walking along walking along he didn't know where he was going but he seen that black sister sing down there by the fence rag tied around her head standing there wet from the Dew she was standing there you know what here here come her answer brother didn't know what he was doing but she did when he walked by good morning Parson right let me tell you what I bet I bet she felt like she wasn't even touching the ground that's right she go to tell brother brandom you know what's so amazing about that story I'm sure I'm sure y'all y'all heard this before but what's so amazing about that story Elisha was standing there one day and he was out there and he said y's that schite woman and she's coming and the Lord has kept it from me what her need is but here she comes but he knew she was troubled but he didn't know what her problem was and here comes brother Brandon the same way she said I'm just like that schite woman said where is Elijah she was looking for him here he come going walking down through there she knew what was going to take place when she began to speak say when Gesa goes down there and says is all well is the family all right is your son all is well all is well everything's okay but you know what she went grabbed a hold of the feet of the Prophet she got a hold of him brother B didn't know where he was going Elijah didn't know where he was going he didn't know what was going to take place but all of a sudden it was made known and he and he says said Auntie do you know my name I'm I'm I'm Reverend bradam I'm I'm a I I pray for the sick now Barson I don't I've never heard of you I'm just seeking the salvation of my son he's dying and he needs salvation I that's what I he's out he's he thinks he's lost on the sea and he needs he needs salvation and in the midst of all that as he was down there and he didn't know where he was at didn't know what was going to take place but he stood there that night and he that day and he was standing there and he walked in that little house and he Saidi went into King's palaces and all those you know the the great rich man's places he said but not a house like that and he said he said he said he said Auntie pray you pray first and he said man let me tell you what if there anybody ever talked to the Lord that woman knew who God was to know that brother brandham was coming what he looked like he had a satchel all the things brother B didn't know where he was going but he was following the leading of the Lord come in that house and man it was prayer went down that night that day amen and then all of a sudden he just put his hands on that boy's feet and he said Lord I don't even know why I'm here don't even know where I'm supposed to be said the plane's probably already gone by now but he laid hands on that that man that boy's feet and he began to pray Lord I don't know but this boy needs needs a touch from you you've seen this woman's desire brought me all this way I don't know if this is it Lord but I'm praying for this young man because he definitely needs a touch as he began to pray not knowing everything but just following the leading of the spirit that all of a sudden that voice starts yelling oh Mama it's getting light in here it's getting light in here it's getting light in here he said by the time he got ready to walk out that young man was sitting on the side of the bed and he took off running trying to get to the airport and you know what he was so worried you know well I'm have to figure out how I'm going to get home now that plane is probably already gone you know what that playe stayed grounded that whole time amen off of one woman's Faith some insignificant woman but you know what God was mindful of her and it went all that way yes amen and brothers and sisters it's the same thing with you and I yes when when brother Randon was standing there in the prayer lines and he began to speak what was what was he trying to do he was trying to build people's Faith trying to get people to understand Jesus Christ is here he is here right now to meet your needs but you know what he's the same one that promised it back there the same one that walked on the sea of galile the shores of Galilee all those things are written in the Bible he's the same one tonight he's standing here tonight to meet your needs to leave whatever you have need of he's here and you know all those all of those stories that he told to build to build the people's Faith wanting you to realize who you are and what you can do greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world and you know your testimony is a is a build is a faith Builder to everyone else we hear that you know when you know and I like I told my brother Andre you know sometimes we have testimonies and you know sometimes the the Lord you know sometimes we we just feel an unction to to we need to get up and testify but you know sometime well I I don't know you know and some sometimes sometimes we need to get up and give God praise that's we need to thank God for what he's done to know what God has done in our lives when we when we've seen Miracles just like you know I think about sister Freda and different ones you know when the Lord Has Come and touched you and done miracles in your life then you know what you need to get up and tell everybody that why because it why because the same one that that that was here that touched sister Freeda that touched brother Dale is the same one here today and he's here to meet your needs wherever you are you say Lord I I need I need to be you know we we we think about as brother Dale's brother Wade's been preaching on the Statue of a perfect man and you start to come up and say you know I'm I'm lacking on these things I come to the place you know why because God that's that's the grace of God in our lives to speak to us to realize you know what you're not where you need to be on when you when you come to the realization you know what I need more virtue I need more knowledge I need more Temperance I need more patience I need more godliness amen well then you know what when he starts to call out to you and and identify listen you're short there you're short there then you know what then he's all because he's doing that for you to realize it's time for you to come and there's more for you to receive because you're coming through these things because he's trying to build these things these these Char this character these virtues in you right and sometimes sometimes we wonder why things come our way why because we don't see the end result the trying of our faith is more precious than gold how wonderful what a loving God what a
