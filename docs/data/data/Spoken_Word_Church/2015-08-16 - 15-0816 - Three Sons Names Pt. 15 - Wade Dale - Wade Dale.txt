========================================

alright alright for those of you they have not been here we are doing a lesson on when the prophet of God talked about three sons name so we eat the Sun God son of man son David so we are now on the son of man we went through the Son of God we know the Son of God was what that's the spirit a spirit god that's the dodge the Creator that's the one that has no sin he has no he never failed he didn't need salvation he didn't mean Redemption right that's the all mighty that's God himself all right no but as we fell from that because remember Adam was the son of God right all right because he had what god in his soul the man blessed be his name brother Branson's basically they have God breathed the breath of eternal life and he became a living soul but he became the Bible said in Luke I believe it was when you go through the chronology the flu but Luke says I which was the son of God and the only Son of God in the Old Testament as we seen many times before and you know I don't know having disrepair I don't know how you believe this but this is why we believe in Turkey this jerk that no one was a son of God in the Old Testament Abraham was never called something God Abraham was called a friend of God because they did not have after Adam fell there was no way that God could enter the soul of man but if I understand that that to me that's the most simple thing you can realize he couldn't enter into Abraham soul and may god make Abraham soul eternal while he was on earth no we know Abraham like brother dale has been preaching he's but he was saved he's he's part of the plan of God but he's not the brightest Jesus Christ and in front he servants Abraham Isaac Jacob and Joseph or one there though they're the corner nation that the christian church is built upon but they are not the bride of Jesus Christ the man Isaiah's not part of the bride of Jesus Christ now he prophesied and spoke in the first person God would come down and anoint him then he would anoint him and then an anointing would leave that's the same way with David the anointing would come on David and he'd speak in the first person and then but now when that left David now David he had the new birth that we have today he'd never went to bed with Bathsheba he never had his best friend kill because the characteristic these characteristics of God were not in his soul it was a murderer he had blood on his hand that's what God told him you can't build a temple because you got blood on your hand and remember in the old testament what blood covered their sin the blood of bulls and goats covered it didn't eradicate it did not do away with David's in it only covered David's in until Calvary when Calvary come the blood of Jesus Christ cleansed all the way from Adam all the way to the end of time America but in the Old Testament they only had the bulls and goats because this son of God could not come down in a formal son of man until the word said he was a virgin shall conceive Isaiah I was asking a virgin shall conceive go Jesus has talked over many times in the scripture we went through the book of his ego I'm trying to hurry through to get us up to speed but Ezekiel son of man prophesied Son of Man prophesize son of man prophesied and if you'll watch let's go back to Ezekiel and let's look just for see how perfect the Bible is we've already been through this book a long time that's all right y'all see that pretty little Vera if you don't feel pretty that's my grandbaby she's beautiful she's mine I forgot what it's doing now is go to ya thank ya we're gonna going to leave you now yeah let's go to buca Deanna back in five Ezekiel on here I'll mash it all right what when we own is Eve your one let's look at the DQ 1 and then door to now who is Ezekiel Ezekiel was one of those men that God used in the Old Testament that was under the blood of bulls and goats a sacrifice but he was a prophet and a prophet is a conduit for God you know what conduit is kind of do it is around tube that things flow through you can put electricity electric lines you put water line you can put whatever but in a conduit as a way to get from here to here so what happened was the son of God in back in the Garden of Eden before the fall the conduit without him right the conduit was Adam Adam was going to produce all this Genesis 1 26 min right but now what happened probably God says flues got stopped out why what happened that conduit got closed off but in Genesis 3 15 oh I said I'll put enmity I'm going to come and do it like other deals talking about stairs in the unconditional covenant God said I'm going to do it I'm going to do it I'm not gonna send a single person I'm not going to send a third person I'm coming myself and I'm going to come down in the form of man because this didn't fall right hey man when gon put this man into Adam and that man into flesh that's what felt the flesh of Adam failed the spiritual part of Adam as far as the spirit in his body that's what felt Adam sold in fall he knew what he was doing the property God said bro yeah man so he knew what he was doing and he was the Son of God all right okay but he took what if he fell in flesh he didn't fall into the pit in palo de sol he fell in flesh so God had to come down into human flesh to clean that conduit out but he had many conduits Isaiah Jeremiah Ezekiel he had a conduit that he could just blow through speak what he needed to speak and then back away from them yeah right because they had many falls in the Old Testament Samson not look at me they all have many flaws but you know when God gets over there the Hebrews 11 and then he goes over to Romans now look I Abraham gave his wife away twice yes that's 42 times try that one time Adam gave his wife will hate twice he didn't just sniggering God the Bible said he got down on his face and laugh that's right but now go to Romans Paul looks back through the blood of Jesus Christ and he says Abraham was strong in faith what read the commentary you don't look like that but when you put it through the filter you gotta run it back through the blood of jesus christ when you run into the blood of jesus christ see that eradicate said it doesn't discovery it on the blood of all the ghost was covering it but when Jesus come he didn't come to just be what he come just to be an animal he was a human had a human soul baby with God remember God doing human there ever was a man this man is a body you can say oh no he's a spirit that's not the problem we have is we stayed spirit and we think of like Casper the Friendly Ghost ER or something that has not if we were made in his image and his likeness he must have been pretty real before even Adam was put in flesh he must have been pretty real because brother and said that I am controlled the whole earth while he was in that Genesis 126 Tate and then when he put it into 27 it was so he could walk the earth and he could touch things and he can be a few that's why God will got all the one being human yes the man so there's your human that's for real when you say no this is this is what this is real this is more real than this man what's more real me that I can't walk through this wall RF or if I were to pass away this moment you wouldn't have thought the door for my soul to get out always wouldn't more real the soul the man's more real than anything that you can comprehend or our think up because remember in this form God talking to Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden in this form this man right here killed two lambs gave one Adam pull the skins off of it get one out of the one to eat now you can't do that as a spirit that has no form artha has no substance okay so we see that God has always been a man God has never been anything but a man right he's never been a woman but remember he had that spirit just like Adam I mean I don't can't be no different than god so like I said many times before God come tearing the garden he looks at him and he said man I got looks like me come he was before he came from he came from Almighty God alright so then this man goes through the Old Testament as what Jehovah God God of others he could not come down and talk to the people in his human flesh you understand that because remember he spoke he spoke a piece of flesh and existence in Melchizedek and spoke to Abraham but that man Melchizedek he doesn't matter people's God Almighty and human flesh he could not save your soul he couldn't save items I mean huh hey Prem salt cuz that's not kinsman that's spoken into existence poking out of existence that's not kinsman this is not the way we come so many ancestors may wish that's the way we come but no we came by birth by birth through the womb that's where everything kind of got started within the womb of the mind and then manifested in the womb of the flesh all right so that's one of this son of man had to come God in human flesh a baby a man baby we believe in his church and without baby was born that was God that was a sec a person that wasn't that wasn't a human man and then God entered him later up that was oh my god man because the Bible says when he was born he was born Emmanuel which means God with us ok so there's a scripture for that what was God with us he was God in human flesh calling himself the Son of Man because remember they didn't understand that then understand who that was but we'll talk about that a second but look what it says here Ezekiel says he said unto me son of man capital S or what's he fixing to do he's fixing to prophesied what did the Old Testament Saints do they prophesied of everything that was coming too fast Ezekiel would have loved to sit here today and listen because you know what he would understand his own writing sometimes they didn't understand their own writing can you imagine that my brother Brown said Isaiah would go home and go honey I said versions you're conceived today but I just really you know he didn't help he said ain't ever out before you know so why I say that but you know what he was the conduit whenever God said come down through the tube and come out they didn't interpret remember they had no interpreter we have an interpreter the Holy Ghost they can interpret the word they had no interpreter in their soul to go through that filter for them to be able to say I know what this is no even Paul says I see google glass a glass darkly is Jeremiah Ezekiel all the was pointing toward Israel being saved a Gentile Church going in but they really I don't think I really don't think that they understood everything that was going on okay I just don't and they did because you watch some of them that we call in there pull away and go o Israel why did we say this you know where what's going on you but remember Paul didn't have a question about that because Paul was a born again God in his soul profit the man so God could interpret coming down through the conduit he can interpret what he was saying and he can speak it out because remember Jesus was not a conduit of God he was gone okay so when he spoke that's why we were we're we're getting a little help myself but see that capital s cap the last Son of Man so he fits into top capital s that's what God heaven that's that the Lord then you'll see down to here he'll be talking to Ezekiel and thou son of man they talking to the man is equal be not afraid of them now this right here ain't afraid he was afraid of nothing right but as they kill a thief young son of man little ass he's talking straight to Ezekiel these other ones are talking from Ezekiel to you and me if I understand that engine that's the big ass that's the capital S you look at the Bible's perfect the Bible perfect winning even the uppercase and lowercase uppercase to lowercase then you'll see where that's capital capital comp accountable there's a different meaning of that word in the Bible a man brother they all men do that many times and it's a wonderful revelation because you read the Bible better that way because you can you get confused I wish you can watch it right here I send thee to the children visual now he didn't sure he said the person is equal but who did he send to Israel Jesus himself I come to my own he said so he's saying son of man I send thee to the children Israel this one but his ego was the conduit in that day to what to get the people ready brother branham said they the prophets built the body for Jesus to come in ok they didn't build the 16 l of months of calcium no they built the word so that when Jesus walked out he fulfilled all the Old Testament scripture to you oh yeah look so that's that's getting us to the point to where then we see Jesus everybody stand that Ezekiel you even look in the Old Testament there's only a few times that the Son of Man is used in the Old Testament but watch here in Matthew you know I try to remember which one is here is gonna bring my note for that and it knows going backwards is far where's one where he says who does that let's see 1660 hang on man I'll find it right there I think you more verse 13 when Jesus came to the coast accessory Philip I he asked his disciples saying whom do men whom do men say I the sun capital of man am well that revelation it without the Holy go they're guessing they're going by what the Old Testament is saying by the letter all right and they said some say that thou art John the Baptist goes member jointed already been killed some say Elijah and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets why because these people spoke of what he was going to do and he was standing there doing it all right if I understand that now the watch but whom say ye that I am a man now watch this this is a good revelation 22 to see that that we've come up in Revelation since even since uh since this was spoken he said him but whom say ye that I am in Simon Peter answered and said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living didn't say he told him some melon he told him those from God look because the Sun God revelation is that what God is going to come and the Messiah in human flesh but they didn't know that's who he was right remember Thomas doubting Thomas Jesus appeared to him in a glorified state and Peter went fishing tell me you had a revelation who that was he did not have a revelation through that 1p I always knew that was it's like I'm saying yeah if I saw somebody died and I helped put him in the grave and then I went back in the grave was empty and that same man appeared to me three days later you couldn't get me out of his sight the Peter went fishing Jesus appeared to players it and I like I want to go fishing on nobody will say well I loaned the money here I gotta waste money the revelation that I love is to make the difference between the open today and when they came to Israel and when they came to Israel nervous and that's right we can I see what and that's a good point thank you because you can go back to zekiel Ezekiel every time you see some ancestor set forth when I jesus never send us that board he was sold all right he watch the Lord so there's your difference in the son of man that he's talking to an Ezekiel in the Sun man that's on the earth but now we got to get this son of man back on earth again right right cuz we go read in just a minute watch this watch how this all involves from from 16 to 17 because the man this is matthew 16 17 they went on a mountain right to watch this thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God you didn't tell him that you were guarding him in class he said I know there's one thing for sure they something different about you all right there's something different you must be somebody difficult look they were going yeah they were going Elias and this one and badge on the badness and other one the Prophet but Peter got close enough jesus answered and said on him blessed or cursed island park going for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven who is that right flesh and blood I did reveal that turn so he didn't know that flesh and blood one yes and I say I believe that thou art Peter and upon this rock now we know brother I'm said it was a revelation what of the Sun God not the son of man because remember what he given the keys to the kingdom what and upon this rock I will build my church he didn't build the church on the Son of Man revelation until the end time property guy said he died Son of Man hero son died and he was son God's Spirit God through seven churchy sure it was God in human flesh but there was no revelation the you're literally God made manifest in another form a man because look I'll build my church in other words on this revelation the Sun God because we're going to read in a minute my Jesus in Matthew 17 to tell this vision of nobody until it suddenly be risen again alright because when the son of man rose the first time when he ascended he came back as the Son of God alright he came back as a son of God through seven Church agents right that's what enough so watch local seven churches his church his church was the seven churches on this rock or this revelation of the Son of God I'll build my church and the gates now shall not prevail against it but remember the Son of Man revelations got to come to change your body and I will give them the leader keys to the kingdom once you over that vinyl earth I'll binding heaven push over the lutheran air pollution heaven for left him alone for just a little while then he charges the samples they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ but what's this Matthew 17 we can do that yeah Matthew 17 after six church ages after not dirty after six church ages and settle the church age Jesus takes these three up on the mountain you understand more when you own the mountain alright mountain okay and was transfigured before them what body chain potential now remember he went change right then he was changed later but that's Road rancid potentially he was showing the adoption showing what who was winning a lot of them now who was that that's the sunday be coming in because there's two okay they're from they're going to go where to the Jews that's what somebody said those that believe it was brobama City wish I preach on that because that that gets some of God's Son of Man son David all in about ten scriptures yeah so I did I think I'll do that maybe next time off and hall just creatures message on it couple hours to three hours ceremony way space shine his son is Raven white is alive and behold there appeared to him Mose no idea what talking to him brother Brown said they were telling him what he was going to have to do further in the kingdom then was things Jesus didn't know in his human brain okay he was Almighty God but they will finish when guy came into this human body he had a physical human brain like me and you and he had problems he had you know Satan same bout I don't it on him just like you pelled on us hey man we're not immune if they get saying can speak to him I've always said it's saying can talk straight to God yeah how many times in the Bible you said saying comes up to God or the devil comes up hey let me go to bed we can't get an audience with him most of the time with the devil can talk them all the time okay okay but there appears a moes their lives are talking with them because those are the two prophets not the two people now the spirit the spirit of Moses and Elijah are going to two prophets to do what uh sure he had the Millennium which is the son of David which is what heir to the throne man because remembering will reading coach will not do that yet but we'll go back in David where he promised David that his son nah Solomon but his son spiritually would sit on the throne and rule the twelve tribes of Israel now that's a son David but this is heading toward it he had to go die for us first all right then answered Peter you're Peter again Lord is good for us to be here if thou wilt let's make your free time and I was going to leave one for Moses one for lighting while he is paid the bright cloud blown Leibrandt cloud in here hello a bright cloud overshadowed them they weren't excluded it was everybody and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased here eating him so he come to the stage of adoption in other words where if you're going to get it you're going to get it from this man this is the man of the hour this is who well I believe brother Brown had to be overshadowed by cloud out in Arizona and he received his sonship i believe they hear ye him to preach the seals because that was going around messy what's the seals right the other part was restoration but you got to have that before you can have the ministry of what subtle man what we're talking about here what that everybody ok bye going to pass sorry and when the disciples hurting they fell on their face and was so afraid what they didn't understand then us then what's happened they having your birthday no one's going on all right gee just came in touch them hallelujah instead arise and be not afraid then they lift it up your eyes and they saw no man save Jesus home one God one God revelation Peter said three he said one a man and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged him saying tell the vision to knowing until the Sun because a man be risen but again now again means you did it one time you're going to do it again right son of man be risen again from the dead now what's the next thing yeah you gotta keep going and his disciples asked him saying why then say this crimes have you lied you must first come the Jews know this remember I did that study we needed upstairs I did that several years ago about the five cups of Elijah the Jews know every year when they have there when they have their Jubilee or when they have this their feast of tabernacle they set a cut down for e object when you're sitting on the table show the picture of it there's a cup sitting there it's called a cup of Elijah they go outside and they opened the door and they look down the street and if allies if they ever seen him coming we'll stay well but they that's good let's see it look out and they go we don't see Elijah and then they say in the Jewish tongue until next year and they put the cup up they know Elijah has to come on the scene before Jesus class come but they missed when John the John coming of Elijah when Jesus came they miss that then they missed the part of brother Brown coming they miss that oh brother Brown would have went to Israel it have been over people yeah it'll been over it been finished they would have seen that side of the Messiah and they when I took correct member God told you don't go there nowhere in other words the Gentiles are not finished yet but look television told us total something that be risen again from the dead now to me i'm i'm gonna i'm going to interpolate they're asking him how is it going to happen because they're asking why then say scribes they were hearing the preacher say that elijah must first got jesus said he lies truly shall first come and restore all things John the Baptist did not restore that all veins now he restored the faith of the old testament to the New Testament right he was the hinge or the dole you know the hinge of the daughters from the old testament to the new he said he last true this your first come and restore all paints brother brown this is what brother Brown said tyla all loose ends the man that's what he said he said this Elijah will come to what Todd all loose ends well we can interpolate I believe right there and put a brother branham in that Park showing that that's what he's talking about but look watch now God hides it in the scripture because most of your denominational people say well that was alive dealt with join of evidence period but he said something else he's not continuing this fall he's still on the same talk but he's not continuing it but i say to you that allies has come already not bad Eli's the one they figure out he's what jhanda baby Eli's has come already and then you and not but have done it in watch wherever they're listing no words echoes hello yeah he said I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness he fulfilled all those scriptures John the Baptist if but this is not gone about it this is that forthcoming of Elijah right here today because what the son of man had to die brother Brown said they buried him in two nationalism and Baron a miniature changes in denominationalism but he used to rise again in the end time that why do you need to rise again to change our money nobody's ever took a body champagne in the Sabbath church ages where the body chains come after six days did happen six church a happened after six churches in this church a writer this one office hey both this is your hands point though if this man don't come back this man don't show up all right this minute don't come back this man don't show up so this is your this is this to me what sure we have the Holy Spirit but we also have flesh now look we're one we era where arrow Jesus Christ right Romans 8 where heirs and joint heirs with Christ whatever Christ has we get a man hundreds Olaf's on a man has to rise again in the end time and that's what we're going to talk about next Sunday is the prophets message because truly both listen Peter preached this thank you a perfect man in about 80 60 Peter Praet step brother branham this was not a new doctrine Peter preached this right Paul preached one dawn first Peter priests one God first so truly what the Allies had to come again and restore all things because what happened in these other church ages what during six Church ages what happened they brought in father son Holy Ghost baptism they brought in eternal hell they brought in all those doctrines that I listened I knew that was gonna happen he waited the eight minutes of man a man because remember John Wesley John Wesley Martin Luther were born again prophets of god church aids messengers and talk trinity now somehow their conduit and that part got stopped up but God was still able to use them because he wanted Luther the brain to just shall live by faith that's all sanctification through what John Wesley and the gifts coming back for the Pentecostal but he had to come back again the son of man had to come again in flesh not just one man William Brown remember he said I'm a son of man revealing these intimate all right because the son of man to me is the bride of Jesus Christ the bride of Jesus Christ that stands on the earth when they take the body change is the real son of man revelation all right the rest are going to have to die and go by the grade the rest are going up to maybe later on you know even you can't have both any bride no bride can be here after the after the resurrection and the Ascension right so no right so that that stops all that whatever is left is foolish virgin and cup of water my name and all those things it's got to go through the tribulation I just noticed what why sure thirsty Bevin you guys traditional home first and restore all things right period that's why I said there is a period easily finish that thought that's know that it goes on it she oh it should be in our thinking it should be no no I never thought that that's a period that stops that fall now he's speaking directly to the people but I say unto you wait what's he doing he's picking up the thoughts of the people that are there because they're going talking about but I said you knew the life has come already all right so he's settling the people that are talking to him they're settling at this we you know and I know that John come but he didn't restore all things no he was just the voice of one crying in the wilderness he was introduced on my side because remember remember what the angel said the angel told brother branham on the river he didn't say you would for run and he said your message always if you read the quote brother Graham never said that the angel said you will for around a second he said your message will for run to second because it's in the days of the boys remember and in Revelations 10 we take the book not from the seven church age messenger we take the book from the mighty angel compose a mighty angel sure no it's not but it is is this man revealing himself through human flesh so you and I today with a revelation den of the seven seals are the son of man made manifest because what programs did Jesus were that was the seals that's the part they did not understand they didn't understand that that was the man god himself standing there cuz some say or what your likeness I'm tell you you're my something I met you they was people with all through them the land mass back as he comes back no God's back all right God with us now God above us God with us and diana's hey hey man oh we gotta thank you for your time thank you very thank you
