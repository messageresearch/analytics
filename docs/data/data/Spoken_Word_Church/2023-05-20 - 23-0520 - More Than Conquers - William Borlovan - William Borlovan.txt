because I'm gonna be at brother Martin's Lord willing speaking for him so uh just keep us in prayer there so everybody stand to our feet we appreciate every one of you coming like I said before um we appreciate the time you come on a Saturday to come and spend here uh we could be doing a thousand different things but but we want to come here and have something for the Youth something a little bit catered to them and uh and then tomorrow now tomorrow will be a regular service it'll be one service at starting at 9 45 and have regular Sunday school class and then brother William will bring the message and then we'll be finished whenever he's finished and we won't have a second service but today after we get finished we're going to worship for a little bit and then we're going to have a food downstairs with our taco bar for you to go down and enjoy yourself Fellowship there'll be um something to do for the Youth the smaller ones you'll need to get with sister Gabby and brother Louise different ones and tell you where to go and get directions of where to go if the older ones do some Bible trivia and we've got some prizes that we give out so we'll have something after the service but the words most important amen the word of God's most important so we appreciate brother William and bringing his whole family with him and when the burlapon brings a whole family that's a lot you know that's a bus or two so good to have brothers Sam and sister Sharon and their group with us today and brother Robbie's brought his group I tell you this man is smart let me tell you something but I never met sister broke but we saw some pictures of her but he his daughter is she rides a horse and it's you'll be okay if she falls over she'll be fine she rides a horse and shoots a gun in competition so she's riding like 20 miles an hour she pulls the gun out she shoots the balloons I said dude you got no problem with that girl ever dating anybody she'll either run over him with a horse or shoot them before they get there so praise the Lord some of y'all ought to start taking that up or maybe bowing Arrow we got several here today that shot bow and arrow at competition today and got here so they do very well and brother Joe's family and brother my brother-in-law back here they have their family so get the kids involved what are you saying well you know kids are kids let's get them involved in something let's get them involved in something that they can do I thank God that that our sisters and and young men especially our sisters do things with their with their dresses on and they're not ashamed of it and we see them playing basketball I got no problem with that at all you know go do what you need to do if you can do it in a dress um you're fine just just do it for the glory of the Lord and and um I believe God will honor you because uh his brother William and I were talking just a few minutes ago you know there's a lot of things about church and all but but you know if we don't have another generation if if the Lord does tarry another 10 years we got another generation that's going to have to take over from the older generation if not brother Ravi there's going to be a big gap there God's never going to have a gap he's going to have a group of people that's going to continue and you see it as as 50 Years brother Dale's been here we see how that would come in and become you know deacons we got brother Michael he'll be here tomorrow but you know come in grow up in the church and become leading singing and then become teaching the young adults in Sunday school class so I like to see each one developed like that good to see brother Levi you know graduating high school there was a time when I was growing up in the message in the 70s that it was taboo to graduate high school because they said brother Brown said get them out of you know educations of the devil so they start pulling them out at 16 years old and putting them to work well guess what that don't work I believe in education I believe you ought to get an education you ought to get a good education because without it you're not going to be able to survive in this world you're going to need a good education and then you need somebody like brother John Durant to teach you how to use your money and then but good to see brother John back he got in last night good to see you back buddy where'd you come back from Poland that's a long drive yeah he had to go to Poland for his job and he got back and it was surprised to see him today but always good to have them with us so let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart Is brother William borlavon comes I know most of you know him if you don't you'll get to know him pretty quick because he's a real nice personable guy and he goes to brother Ron Spencer's Church in grottos Virginia he decided to move up there and and be a part of their assembly and we sure appreciate him and we've loved him for since since they were Gabby was a baby so he married a baby you know so she's not a baby anymore but let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart and and let's bring our brother and pull on the gift gives everybody young adults pull on the gift you'll get something if you want something you'll get something if you want something if you don't want anything you'll go out here just as dry as you walked in here but if you want somebody to fill your cup up God will fill your cup up but you know what you got to do you got to put it out there right you got to put it under the spout make it available all right so let's sing Open the Eyes of My Heart brother William borleman comes to speak for us and then afterwards when we get finished like I said we'll go downstairs and eat and then we'll have activities for the young adults it's good to see each and every one of you again uh be with us um just too good to see you and all the ones that have not been here before just make yourself at home you this is just a family reunion you're just meeting more family just go to reunion just so be comfortable because this is just family amen Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord [Music] and Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord [Music] I want to see you High there [Music] the light of your glory [Music] all right to power and love cause we sing Holy Holy Holy it up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power in love As we sing Holy Holy Holy holy holy holy [Music] holy holy holy holy holy holy I want to see you praise amen amen thank you Jesus we preach in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is certainly an honor of privilege to be with with each and every one of you amen as brother Wade mentioned we're happy to be here with my family uh the last time I was up I was flying solo with sister Rebecca but uh little Enoch joined us there so now we're a family of seven I can't believe it but here we are God's grace is sufficient we certainly appreciate each and every one of you we're happy to to be with you again we'd like to thank brother Wade for having us brother Sammy Adele and all the ministry team here we certainly love and appreciate each and every one of you I'd like to thank brother Bob and sister Monica for putting up with us this weekend and then My Brother Sam sister Sharon driving up from Kentucky and uh you know as I was going to mention the same thing as brother way to mentioned you know we kind of had a little mini family reunion there and then we come here and the family reunion continues the family of God that's the greatest family that is the real family brother Ben so good to see you my dear brother that is a real family is a family of God Amen so we're so thankful for each and every one of you in the stand that you take here and you know this is the only message church I think by the way that has banjos that I know of but I love it I love it I love the banjo so we're thankful for that and we just bring you greetings from the home church amen brother Ron bro they injuring all this in their love and appreciation to you all and brother Ron we thank he thanks you for all the prayers he's just fighting the good fight you know Satan attacks us all in different ways and um you know and he's just standing standing strong God is great sufficient giving him strength he preaches every Sunday and so we're thankful for that and uh Satan sometimes thinks he just kind of attack us and what it does is it actually just squeezes the character of God right out of our Lives there's things in you brother Aaron that you may not realize is there and God will allow that trial come by allow Satan to maybe touch your life a little bit make you cry out to God and it just gets more character right out of you the character that is laying there and because that's the only way it comes out is through trials and sufferings none of us look for it none of us ask for it none of us jump up and down that a trial has come our way but God has a purpose and a plan for each and every one the Bible tells us that it's more than pure gold you think about that pure gold because the gold will perish but the the character that you have my brother will you will have throughout all eternity you can't Reign without suffering amen so we'll just not keep you standing here if you'll just turn with me with Romans 8 31 . amen praise the Lord with the help of as your turn with the help of the Lord I'd like to speak to you on more than the conquerors amen a few Brothers in the back could turn it up just a little bit or do I have the microphone high enough is this good brother wait okay all right so Romans chapter 8 verse 30 31 will begin reading what shall we save into these things if God before us who can be against us he that spare not his own son but delivered him up for us all how shall he not with him also freely give us all things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justifieth who is he that condemneth it is God it is Christ that died yea rather that is risen again who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sword as it is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter nay in all of these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us for I am persuaded at neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord amen let's bow our heads the gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for this assembly we thank you Lord Jesus for each and every one that's made their way to the house of the Lord and father we've gathered here Lord not to hear from man but to hear from you we just pray Lord now as we look to you father both speaker and here alike we ask that you just move us out of the way Lord not only I as a speaker but the hearer themselves father may they hear from you and we'll all in turn give you all the praise honor and Glory meet each and every need father touch the sick and needy father and have your way in this service in Jesus Christ's name we pray and ask all these things amen amen God bless you may be seated as you're seated I'll also read Ephesians 6 verse 10 very familiar text finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and in the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that ye may be able to stand against The Wiles of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that ye may be able to withstand in the evil day we're living in that evil day so the scripture tells us if you want to be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all you can to stand stand therefore having your loins gird about with the truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness in your your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith he shall be able to quench some of the fiery darts of the wicked does that sound right no all of the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Amen you know the word of God is eternal and it doesn't matter what how the world changes the word of God never changes so to you young people it doesn't matter in what stage and age and season of life that you're in the word is still the same the generation your parents are of another Generation Well when your parents were your age they were reading the same scriptures and drawing strength from the same Promises of God and help them overcome the enemy in their age and now the same word gives you the strength to overcome the enemy in this age because remember just because we're we may be older doesn't mean that we quit fighting the devil the battles may change but the enemy is still the same and we depend on the same word of God now there was a man Alexander Hamilton he's actually on the ten dollar bill and he was one of the founding fathers and he's uh he's quoted as saying if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything and that's that's Humanity in a nutshell when they don't know where to stand they don't have a truth they don't even know what's truth many of them don't even have the desire for truth the enemy blows Every Which Way the influences of the world come the pulls of the world come and drags them in every different direction it's where they don't even know what gender they belong to anymore because they don't stand on anything to be able to say this is the truth if you know what truth is then you can discern what's not truth but if you don't even understand what the truth is then the enemy can battle you and get you to reason against the word of God in first John 4 4 ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world now the importance is very important this is for both young people and old and older people like old people doesn't matter your age is that you see that we see ourselves through the eyes of the word now this is important in two ways that I'm going to dwell a little bit here because you can be a holy ghost Christian elect of God on your way to heaven but because you're not looking because you may have a little spiritual Amnesia and you're not looking at yourself through the word of God you think that you're a sinner you don't feel safe you feel so terrible because you're not looking at yourself through the word of God and on the flip side of that someone like the Pharisee can have or a spirit of a Pharisee and feel that they're so religious and they're so self-righteous but they don't search the scriptures to see that they even need God and that is where the danger can even come in when we're raising the message is that no matter that you've never done drugs it doesn't matter that you've never been hooked on pornography it nothing matters the fact that you're born you need Lord Jesus Christ it doesn't matter that you've never done that that you can't come up with a list of sins you need to be saved you need to be filled with the Holy Ghost so it's important that we see ourselves through what God says about us if God says we're forgiven then we're forgiven if God says that we're Justified we're Justified and no devil in hell can change that now I was listening to a tape in the sermon here on what is the Holy Ghost the prophet of God I love his honesty whenever we we you know he's just so honest he tells his he he talks about his life and his life as an open book and it begins to tell a story here and it says there is nothing that will ever defeat Satan there has never been nothing on the earth yet that would ever defeat Satan like the word of God Jesus used it in his great battle he said it is written he said in this morning while I've been listening a few days ago to a broadcast that seemed to want to tell that creation just come from some ashes blowing together and some phosphate and a few chemicals of the earth and the warm sunshine created The Germ of life and brought out life how ridiculous when the sunshine will kill any germ of Life lay a germ out there in the sunshine it'll kill it immediately and there was no such a thing but Satan trying to punch at me the seventh Church age messenger and Satan is trying to punch at him and after I had taken my little Rebecca to school this morning he just still had his Monday morning chores okay and on the road back I started to turn the radio on again and I thought I would not get into that stuff so I'll just turn it back off and I was going up the street Satan said to me he said do you know that this man that you called Jesus was just a man like one in his day like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts here you have the prophet of God and you have Satan cometh to him and he's trying of all the Miracles that he's seen brother Bob see the angel of the Lord meeting an angel in a cave and Satan still comes to him and said you know this Jesus that you preach about he was just a man he started to form a little click and then all of a sudden it spun and it spun and it grew and he was just a man and you're worshiping a man Satan was punching that at him he was just a man and they began to have a few people to gather around him and say he's a great man and after a while become greater and then I become a God to them and now it's scattered all over the world since he's dead and that's all Satan fighting him brother Brown was having a mind battle I thought how a liar that you are he said I said Satan you that's talking to my conscience I'd like to ask you a few things now notice the prophet of God took the same example that Jesus gave when Satan tempted him the prophet did not say Satan remember that person that was healed remember the angel met me in the cave remember when I was baptizing on the Ohio River he didn't refer to a single miracle that he experienced Satan took Satan brother Bram took Satan right back to the word of God so how should that encourage you how should that encourage me we can't take we can't say Satan I met the angel of the Lord while in a cave I baptized I've seen the Miracles but yet you can take listen now you can take the Satan right back to the same experience that brother Branham had amen not the experience of meeting an angel in a cave but meeting the same Lord Jesus Christ so you have the same born-again experience that the prophet had and you're able to then take the enemy back to your own Burning Sands back to your burning bush so here you have the prophet that begins to bring up out of his entire Ministry he brings up the word to Satan he said I said Satan you that's talking to my conscience I'd like to ask you a few things who was it that the Hebrew Prophet spoke that would come who was the anointed Messiah what was that what was upon those men that foresaw him and told his life thousands of years and he goes on through and then he promised the Holy Ghost and I've got it so you just might as well get away from it because it's written in the word and every word is true then he left just give him the word that does it he can't stand the word for it's inspired out of everything he gave him the word test he has the same word he had the same word to fight the enemy with that you do brother Zach now now listen Satan try that to him about the Bible Satan will try that with you about the Bible but he'll also try that with you about the message remember because if he can get you away from the message well you get you to doubt that but then take this and he's getting you in your mind to separate the two he's got you off your ground he's got you wobbling right and while you're wobbling like they do in boxing that's the time when the boxer goes in and finishes him off when he's wobbling so Satan will come to you and he'll try and cast out maybe it won't begin with the prophet maybe it'll begin with your pastor maybe it'll begin with your parents and he begins to try and get you off of your ground and once you're off the ground and you begin to doubt the prophet then you begin then you begin to doubt the word and there's no bottom to it because if you remember if the message was wrong it would not only it it would not only not produce what it's saying but Satan wouldn't attack it Satan don't attack the other religions because there's no truth to it remember in in Genesis 28 Jacob only knew God as the god of Abraham and Isaac he did not know God as his God until later until after he wrestled with an Angel and when he wrestled with an angel even the scripture at first whenever he's talking when he when they record the story of Jacob it's always the god of Abraham and Isaac the god of Abraham and Isaac made this Covenant but after Jacob had an experience with the angel he then became the god of Abraham of Isaac and of Jacob after he wrestled with the angel and you have to wrestle with the mighty angel not with the prophet messenger you have to wrestle it out with the angel the mighty Angel Revelations 10 1 and then it won't just be the message of your parents it won't just be the message of your pastor it won't just be the prophet's message it'll be your message it'll be the message it'll be Jesus Christ your Jesus Christ your message it won't just be do's and don'ts it won't be just things I've got to do it will be your message and then Satan can never take that away from you the Lord Jesus Christ will make this message yours then it's not just Doctrine it is the literal life of Jesus Christ there's natural elements that we're all a part of there's natural jobs that we have and natural livings in schools and in events but we cannot lose the focus that the real thing is what's behind the veil the message people see people see a lot of impersonation and people see hypocrisy and they try and throw the whole thing away but there is reality and remember the true message the true message believer had to be there first before a scandal in a message Church made you down there's lots of counterfeit money out there but it doesn't stop any of us from making transactions does it just because there's counterfeit well I'm not I've got a thousand dollars in my pocket to buy to buy this I need it a hundred dollars or whatever but I'm not gonna buy it because there's so much counterfeit and this may be counterfeit this message is reality and it is the only reality that produces a real husband it is the only reality that produces a real life it is the only reality that that produces a true friend there's good people out there you've got good neighbors you've got good people in your community and they're wonderful but this message produces exactly what it's spoken the world has no Godly control tower but the Holy Ghost in US is what is the control tower because you see Satan is a devil and Satan don't care about you God cares he's proved that right Satan don't care Satan will pretend that he cares until he draws you away right from those that you love from those that really care he'll make you think they don't care and make you think he's the one that's caring and when he's got you surrounded then he'll leave you right you won't feel so care then you'll feel used and abused now Satan will never come around to tell you that you need Jesus but he will say you don't need him you know years ago there's people you know you can go on the internet and look this up and and just take it for whatever it is but people can have near-death experiences and they've got experiences of Heaven and Hell and they've got their different their stories behind it there was this one man on the internet and he was talking about having an experience of hell and he might have even been an Atheist I don't remember the story but the point I'm trying to make is he's he went there and he's seen that there were and when he came back he became a Christian but when he went there he's seen that demons were tormenting people souls in hell and as these demons were tormenting them the demons what he kept hearing because he kept hearing the demons say you stupid stupid humans you stupid stupid we tricked you you see that's what Satan does he is a Deceiver and he'll make you he'll give you a mirage and make you think that that you just have the World by the tail and in reality you want to be led by god of what kind of life you should live you want to be led by a god what person that you should marry you God cares about the little things because you see Satan will focus his attacks on the young people and specifically because they're pure they're innocent and as they begin to mature into teenagers and as they begin to ensure and mature they have a lot of energy they get Ambitions they get plans and they get choices and Satan will get into them details and he'll get the energy and the passion that a teenager or young person may have and instead of using it for God's glory in the Zeal and Lord what do you want me to do where do you want me to go lead me he'll then misuse that and send them out in the world and spend their energies on the world because Satan tries to infiltrate the desires and choices that you have to make to bring you down a bad path all the decisions our lives are full of decisions he'd like to take your passion and energy and re redirect it to sinful things and a lot of times that can begin with a disrespect of parents in first Samuel 15 23 the Bible says for Rebellion is as the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness as iniquity in idolatry that's why it's so important to lean if you have holy ghost-filled parents to lean on them because they've been through it despite of what Satan will tell you that your parents don't understand or that you don't understand what I'm going through they have they have in fact but maybe they've got some scars in their life they're trying to protect you from right so if Satan can get in the details of your life and get you to rebel and not listen to your parents then that's only setting yourself up for failure it's important to surround yourself with holy ghost film mentors with people in the church and in your community that are filled with the Holy Ghost that you can lean on for wisdom remember Satan is one of his biggest tactics is that they don't understand but greater is he that is in you if you have the Holy Ghost then he that is in the world we just have to make sure that he's in US because he does the overcoming no matter who you are and what you are you will never be able within yourself to outsmart the enemy he's slick he's been at it for six thousand years he in fact has been watching your DNA your ancestry coming all the way down he no in other words he knows you better than you know yourself you may not even know your family history past your grandparents and there's a lot you may not even know there but he knows for six thousand years he's known the weakness of your natural abilities what gets you is it temper is temper so ran in your family he knows and he'll know just went to strike Satan is very smart but he's he can never outsmart the Lord Jesus he can never win he can never outdo the Holy Ghost so no matter where you are in life and how much money you want to make and what wonderful career you're pursuing and all the plans you have for the future get the Holy Ghost first because I promise you all that success without the Holy Ghost is misery getting married without the Holy Ghost leads to misery leads to disappointment leads to pain seek ye first the kingdom of God because we all have a purpose in life God has called it doesn't matter you don't have to be a song leader you don't have to sing specialist you don't have to play instruments if you do that's God's extra blessings on you but don't feel like just because you don't can can't ever maybe you know put a finger on something that you do God has called you for a purpose in life and there's also you know he's called us all and there's an importance of stepping into that purpose God has a realm of influence for each and every one of us and it's just as important to step into that position and it's just as important to step into it as not stepping out of it I want to do everything God wants me to do but not a single bit more do you understand you want to step into what God has for you but not out and be so zealous that you're trying to do someone else's job because that's not good either you've got to stay into that because we're all given a realm a world or a realm of influence that God has given you God has given you an influence if you're assuming you go to school you're on the job and you're the only believer there God has given you an influence to shine the light right there right that all the preachers in your church can't do you go to school all the every person you know the only believer in that school you're the only one in your grade or whatever the situation everyone else in your church can I spread the influence The Godly influence that you have been given the opportunity to do as you can it may be even the influence of spreading reflecting Jesus Christ to your younger siblings your friends at church because even your friends in church need you to be a light just because you're at church don't mean to turn the light off that's the time you keep it on a Christian never turns their light off well bless God I'm at the church house so I'm gonna just turn my light off you keep that light shining because there's people there's somebody who's always watching so when they look at whenever one young person looks at another maybe they're struggling and because you're a young person sister Zoe and someone else could be struggling saying okay Satan makes me think that my parents don't understand but here's someone my age that's on fire for God you see so they know okay there's a teenager I know that they feel the same pressures as social media is it okay if I put this down they they feel the same pressures of social media they may feel the same pressures of school and Temptation and peer pressure and because you're letting your life shine you're then giving them strength in a realm of influence and as you grow in life in spiritual maturity your influence can then change God can lead you on from the influence of your school you graduate and then you begin to influence people in the workplace maybe you begin to influence people in college maybe then you get married and you can then influence husband and wife can can can give each other um can give each other strength they're going through a hard time the husband helps the wife the husband goes through a hard time the wife helps the husband and then you begin to have children and then the children are looking for reality so then it's then all of a sudden your influence has now spread to children that are going to look to you for reality and look for the right influence in your home because if if a couple is always bickering and fighting and that's just their lifestyle then their children are subjected to that then they will be in that wrong atmosphere in First Corinthians 7 24 the Bible says Brethren let every man wearing his call therein abide with God it's in this realm that God has called you that you must keep the enemy out because he will constantly you have to guard your testimony we have to keep ourselves covered by the blood constantly first John chapter 2 for all that are all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the luster of the he that doeth the will of God abideth forever we live in a really dark town darkness that can be felt it's getting so evil there's even you know there's nowhere else to go but you don't even feel like staying here anymore what it is is God has taken out all them rabbit skins in the far right out of the nest because it's time to take a flight it's getting uncomfortable it's getting sticky we try and move over here and it's nasty and then we go over here and it's just so dark because it's time to go home people don't know which way to turn every Church age has had its own Temptations every Church age you think of the Temptation Of the Dark Ages to just you know to unimaginable tortures in just one recampment can make your flesh so comfortable that is a serious temptation that's a whole lot harder than turning your head can't be but God anointed them for that and the Holy Ghost anoints you and strengthens you to shun sin to not be able to stomach it and remember it's not a sin to be tempted it's a sin to be heed to temptation but God will always equip his elect to overcome every obstacle if this is the most evil age that's ever been then he's equipped us with the most powerful message that's ever been given the most powerful message because remember the scripture says that when the enemy comes in like a flood the spirit of God raises that standard against it raises that standard remember you can't do it by yourself you can't just March out and say I'm gonna overcome this devil I no it's God you have to do it but there comes a time where you have to be tired of living with the thing there's a point where brother Graham said that Legion had to fight himself to get to Jesus he had to fight past them evil spirits to get to Jesus and he delivered them he got Deliverance Philippians 4 13 I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me now see that's the key is that you can do all things but it's only through Christ that strengthens you and see you have to watch the enemy because he's so slick we live in an age where they you know they'll say you can do anything you can do anything be who you want be identify with whoever you want to be whatever just do it that's Satan's perversion when I was in school we were taught you know shoot for the stars be if you want to be an astronaut you just be an astronaut and you know do what you want to do but there's a little parentheses to that because through Christ you can but without Christ you'll fail and even if somebody just always remember this young people too just because you look out and you may see something oh if I can get that I know I'll be happy if I can only be like that person I know I'll be happy when you get there without God my own it'll actually be further this is not quite like I thought so actually no no it's when I get this and then you get this and then you're still not happy and when you get this then I'll be happy and then you realize that you've done spent your life away but see if you had him the entire time then it don't matter what state you're in if if you have a plan and you're planner for your future but you've got him you're happy here but you're just if the Lord tarries I'm looking to that but you're happy and then God blesses you here you're still happy maybe you want to go there and he closes that door you're like hmm still happy then he actually leads you this way you're still happy he leads you this way you're still so happy then about the time you get over here you're gonna look and say oh man I'm so glad that door was closed but you are happy from there to there to there to there you have the joy of the Lord because he's the real happiness he is Ultimate success when you receive the Lord Jesus Christ when you get the Holy Ghost then you have a ride then you begin to grow in him but when you're testifying that you're in Christ the enemy will come in and say you can't do it but that's the time to say Satan Kitty behind me because the Bible says I can do all things through him in Philippians 4 8 finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things in other words don't think the enemy's thoughts you can live a Victorious overcoming life you can through him you can you can remain pure for a future spouse through him you can't you can shun Satan's offers now as you see through him because he'll make it look so good maybe he'll make it look so good but it'll get you out of church but it gives you everything you ever wanted it'll give you maybe if I can just get this uh he'll make you an offer and it'll look so good damn right but watch it pray about it and that goes back to having Godly mentors and Godly Parents you can go to and say brother sister pray with me about this I've got this kind of offer and I'm not really sure what to do pray with me and God will lead you you can be the only one living for God in your school in your home in your family it doesn't matter you can through Christ you can do all things in John 15 abide in me and I in you as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except that abide in the vine no more can ye accept that ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me ye can do nothing see he's the Energizer all of that your brother and your sister sees are the actual fruit of your lives because by your fruits you are known but what's behind pushing is that life of the vine that's causing you to live a Victorious Life do you realize brother and sister what a miracle that you are to be standing and living and standing for the truth in this age in the most darkest ungodly age here you are you're holding up a standard come what may you're holding up a standard you're you're believing the truth that is you are the Fulfillment of God's word you are the standard Hey Brother Wade said there's not going to be a gap God is going to have a church without bribe without spot or wrinkle he's going to have that bride she's going to be there she's here she's all across the world and you can only imagine how that infuriates the enemy that no matter what he throws at you no matter how much it just it just disappoints you and how the disappointments of Life take you this way or that way you refuse to back upon the word but that vine is what feeds the soul in Saint John 16 33 these things I have spoken unto you but that ye in me ye might have peace in the world ye shall have tribulation but be a good cheer I have overcome the world now the world would always produce their own fruit it'll always be mixed maybe there'll be some goodness in there but it'll always be mixed and it will always bring death in Revelations 5 9 and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for that was slain and has redeemed us to our God by thy blood out of every Kindred and tongue and people and nation and has made us unto our God Kings and Priests and we shall reign on the earth so before we can come back and Reign on the Earth you we have to Reign this Earth you've got to rule over your own Earth not someone else's Earth not your neighbor's Earth you have to rule over your Earth I have to rule over my own Earth because remember God is an expert at being outnumbered but coming out with the victory you the gene seed of God are fighting ten your senses Against One think about that you have all these senses of the spirit you have all the senses of your body that are that many times tell you things that are contrary to the word and you have to stand there Toe to Toe with the Devil and stand on the word you can't see the Promise come to pass God could speak to your heart and he tells you something is coming but you can't see it you can't reason it out you have no idea how it's going to happen you think of Abraham prime example but yet he stood there he had in his soul he believed God and his faith was counted him for righteousness and despite what not only his own ten senses he had a fight but he had to fight all the naysayers all the mockers all the people that made fun of him and yet he had to stand firm we have to stand firm in an age of more unbelief than ever Joshua was fighting enemies in the Promised Land and the land belonged to them it was promised to them God told them it's yours but they had to fight for every inch every foot foreign you think about that God gave us a promise he gives the word full of promises but you have to fight for it if if sickness has struck your body we can't just sit back and say well God promised me healing I'm just gonna wait on it to come you know maybe it will maybe it won't I don't know you've got to fight every morning when you wake up and you feel sick every every time you look in the mirror and you may still see the Affliction you have to fight past what you see you have to fight past what you feel the only way to possess it was to fight they could have never settled in the land had they not fought for it right they could have sat there right on the edge of Jordan and said that is the most beautiful land I've ever seen I bet I could grow some beautiful grapes I can just imagine my children for Generations running out there that land will always belong to us my goodness it is exactly what God Said well let's go over no no I can't my friend won't so my friend ain't gonna do it so I can't do it get out and fight and there's a military strategy not just fighting but as you're fighting you possess you keep pushing back the enemy off of your land remember it's your land the enemy is squatting it's not his land that you're taking over the land belonged to them and all them civilizations God allowed to raise up to just keep it nice and trim for them to plant a lot of the crops for them so it's not it wasn't their land it was God's land that he promised to Abraham and this was his seed coming back to take possession of what was theirs your health is not the Devils it belongs to you your sound mind does not belong your mind don't belong to the devil it belongs to you so if Satan keeps coming to you you we have to fight it out the sound mind belongs to you a Godly marriage belongs to you a Godly home Godly families Belong To You amen and they don't always look like you know there's that song way maker even when I don't see it he is still working when I don't even feel like he's working he's working just because then the children of Israel were circling circling and walls of Jericho just because on every day the wall they didn't go back to the camp and see the walls falling down did not mean God wasn't working but there finally came a day when the walls Came Crashing Down every promise in the word of ours is but we must fight to obtain it everything is a fight life is a fight in first Timothy chapter 6 verse 12 fight the good fight lay hold unto on lay hold on eternal life where and to thou are also called and has professed a good profession before many witnesses in Joshua 10 24 and it came to pass when they brought out those kings because Joshua was fighting he was in he was in the promised land he was fighting and Ten Kings went and hid themselves in a cave to get away and Joshua said seal up them caves I'm gonna deal with them in the right time so when he was done killing all the enemy he comes back and he said now take the stone away and you bring them Ten Kings right out and in Joshua chapter 10 verse 24 and it came to pass that when they brought out those kings and to Joshua that Joshua called for all the men of Israel and said unto the captains of the men of war that went with him now notice this Joshua was not the one that was going to do this he when he said to all the Warriors that fought with him Joshua is the type of Jesus Christ and we're all Warriors we're all Gentile Warriors we're captains we're fighting killing devils killing the influence of the enemy whenever the enemy tries to come in and and you know and and strike your home attack your loved ones you you stand Toe to Toe with that devil and you apply the token you're fighting your men and women of War that went with him and Joshua said come near put your feet upon the necks of these Kings put your foot I'm not gonna do it you do it amen the devil that's attacking your home put your foot on his neck depression put your foot on his neck whirly friends they're trying to take you away from God not literally but the spirit that's trying to do it put your feet on their neck because it's not them it's the spirit it's Satan because remember he'll try and attack you through other people and other avenues too so you put your foot on that King and they came near and put their feet upon the necks of them remember that's what David did when he killed Goliath and Joshua said unto them fear not nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus saith the Lord for the and be a good courage for thus shall the Lord do to all your enemies against whom you fight we are to put our feet on their necks because remember if it's only in the mind if it's only intellectual Faith Satan will overtake you Satan is a whole lot better at the intellectual game than anyone could ever be but when it's in the heart then you're like Samson then though you'd be surrounded by a thousand devils if he did it with a Jawbone of a mule how much more can you do it with an open book but see it a lot of times because it's spiritual and you can't see it it comes back to challenge you but because you maybe take authority over the devil in your home it don't it can be a church it can be at home you say look and you declare war on the devil literally declare war you find the promise of God that he's attacked he's attacking you he's attacking your home find the promise of God that'll fix it he's attacking your mind he's attacking your body whatever you find the promise of God and you take your family you open the word and you say now Satan here's a word you read it and you declare war and say you are not welcome in our marriage you're not welcome in our home you're not welcome in my situation you're not welcome in my mind you're not welcome in my body and you then be you let that faith that God put in you that Revelation that drops you let that be the strong man that holds the door now see the challenge is brothers and sisters that after you say that you close the Bible and you may not you won't you may not most of the time see some mighty Angelic Warfare going on but something happened when Jesus went to the Fig Tree it was a fig tree something he created and he spoke and said let no fear come forth he didn't sit there and yell at it and do everything else he spoke the word he knew who he was he knew it had to come to pass and it was settled in his mind but see that is where the struggle is because we claim the promise of God upon a situation and then we go out and in two hours it looks like the whole thing blows right up You Prayed For A sound mind you prayed that God will deliver you from depression but in an hour from then you feel more depressed than you've ever felt that's the time to be a Samsung that's the time because you know Satan calls out for help he likes to you know sometimes he likes to think that he's he's the big bad devil but when the spirit of God comes in to deliver he's not so big and bad anymore when the prophet of God will begin to discern an epilepsy and different things well he could see in the spirit the streaks evil spirits calling out for reinforcements calling out for help when they came in the presence of Jesus what do they say have you come to cast us out before our time what have we to do with you thou Son of God all these different examples in the scripture they knew when they were in that presence so don't be discouraged by the by by what looks like a natural blow up from what you just claimed your back hurts and you're sitting in church and these brothers are preaching the word and they're they're preaching Faith and Healing and you take out and you receive it and you walk back and come Monday morning you can't even get out of bed that's a challenge to you and that is the moment where you say oh man I guess I didn't right there you just come right back to you but when you stand there like Samson you stand there like shamgar when darkness tries to creep into your atmosphere when darkness tries to creep into your realm that God has given you your realm of influence that you catch you discern that as a high priest of your home us fathers and you catch that Spirit trying to slip in through that book through that friend through that movie and you catch it it's our job when the enemy tries to raise his head you have to take control Leviticus 26 and he shall Chase your enemies and they shall fall Before You by the sword and five of you shall chasing hundred and a hundred of you shall put ten thousand to flight and your enemy shall fall Before You by the sword when Joshua routed the enemy whenever he stopped the sun he needed more light that was his purpose of stopping the song we're all very familiar with that story we'll understand that as sister Sharon sang that song arise and shine that light has come the light has been has been shown in every devil has been exposed we don't have to shout Sun stand still the s-o-n has stood still and his light has shined in this day and has exposed every work of the enemy every trick of the devil now what was the purpose of the of the sun standing still so Joshua could kill his enemies the scripture says that he that can can't control his spirit is like a city with no walls in Proverbs 25 28 he that hath no rule over his own Spirit there it is it's like a city that is broken down and Without Walls so in the old days you know they built walls around the city so if the city did not have walls it was easy for the enemy to come do hit and run tactics pillage and run pillage and run so if we can't control our own spirit and we're tempted to maybe flare up about this or maybe we're tempted to be discouraged or whatever attacks our human Spirit if we're not fortified by the word then Satan will come hit you and run then you'll maybe go down to the next and then you'll get hit and run again and Satan will have you in an awful fix because the enemy will gonna come and he's going to test you the word that you've received that you receive every service the word that you're receiving now you're going to go out the doors and the enemy is going to test you on it that's what he does now here's the quote I was looking for a few minutes ago talking about Legion he had to fight past the Devils brother random said and he cares do you care he cared when the neurotic called Legion cared enough under opposition to wiggle out from under those tombstones of devils to go out to meet Jesus and throw himself prostrate he had to fight past the Devils that were trying to keep him from Jesus the Devils knew Jesus was so the Devils were trying to keep Legion back from Jesus so Legion had to exercise enough faith in who Jesus was himself even though he himself couldn't deliver himself of it he knew if he could at least get to Jesus Jesus could deliver him of the Legion of devils he was fighting he says when Legion them Devils would have never come if Legion hadn't have pushed his way out there to meet him and if Satan fights you young people middle-aged people it doesn't matter what your age old people if he fights you the wrong approach is to stay at a church because Satan has attacked me or Satan has done this to me because that's what he's trying to do is he's trying to isolate you here's where you can get help the brothers preaching don't know what you're going through but yet the spirit knows so as he's preaching the the word just comes forth and it begins to discern what you're going through but Satan can sit in your ear and say somebody told them that so see how he then robs you of a blessing instead of saying Lord that man didn't know why I'm going through that he'll then say that somebody told them and that's why they're saying it see how sneaky he is because it's in the when the changes of Life brother talks about like every seven years from teenage and then you grow you know as you grow older and then you hit menopause and for the sisters and midlife and the elderly there's different seasons of life and with each season there comes weakness a certain weakness the teenagers may have a weakness that maybe those going through midlife do not or elderly or whatever season of life we're all in seasons of life so Satan will sit there and it's an in crucial seasons of life that we must stand strong that is when we should draw nearer to God because remember he promised that he would never always rest on this he promised he would never put more on you than what you could handle sometimes we go through things and like lord it's getting real close I'm getting real I I don't I don't I can't really well maybe even say this in prayer God I can't handle this no more but you see as I said when I started you have to look at things the way God sees it God's looking at you and saying you've got a whole lot left in you you've got this but yet you're looking in a natural and we get caught up and beat up in the natural because we're all natural and so we we get caught up in the natural light lord I can't take this no more I'm at my end I I don't I don't see no change coming I don't I don't see no change but he's looking at you through a different set of eyes now see Satan God has his desire for you and Satan has his desire Satan has a desire for you and your life he'd like to get that talent you have and you have you sell it to him he'd maybe like to get the looks that you have and sell it to him he liked to maybe get the money that you have and sell out to him because remember as I said we can never outsmart him now in Luke chapter 22 if the brothers can pull this up and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath to desire to have you that's Satan's desire he desired to have you that he may sift to you as wheat he can take you just do what he wants to do turn your life upside down any direction that was Satan's desire for Peter and Peter had no idea Peter was living his life and even even being a disciple of the Lord Jesus but even before that fishing had his business going had his family all these things and had no idea that Satan desire to get them and remember young people it's not necessarily what it's not just what God has saved you from or delivered you from it's what he saved you from doing right you see that is very powerful even if we all made mistakes but it doesn't matter what you did that doesn't matter anymore it matters what you're doing now and where you're going that's what you need to concentrate on don't look in the back That's what Satan wants you to do he wants you to be so confused and so tore up about your mistakes that you never turn around and forget those things that are behind forget them Satan brings them back yeah that's that's just Cannon father that's just that don't matter just because he brings them back and tries to fight you with a memory does not mean that they're still attached to you it doesn't matter so we have to we have to realize that even it doesn't matter what you did God forgave you and at the moment that you turned your life around God saved you from so much heartache he saved you from Hell most importantly but even between the journey from Earth to what would have been hell God saved you from so much trouble so sometimes because the God's not going to override your free moral agent God presents you eternal life God is presenting this to you and you choose to go the other way well he's not going to lose you because you're his number one but what you're doing is you're creating more scars you're still because the Bible said all that the father is giving me shall come to me no man can pluck him out of my hand but you're creating more scars but Satan would have deserved would have desired rather to have you he desired to have me that he may sift us as we but listen to these beautiful words he said but ah have prayed for you that thy faith fell not the hardest trial of your life but he's prayed for you that your faith won't fail Peter wasn't aware of Satan's desire for him but Jesus knew it and even prayed for him ahead of time already done and young people Satan hath greatly desired to have you he loved to mistress you he loved to misuse you to pervert you and to make you a trophy of hell that's Satan's desire for you he wants to buy your soul that's his desire he loved to put a bid on your soul and that and that could be in the form of of the lust of the eyes the lust of the Flesh and the pride of life but you've already been bought and paid for you've already the I am has already prayed for you when you get home you should read John 17. he said I have prayed for either thy Faith Hill not he knows your struggles he knows your complexes he knows your fears but you've already been bought you've been bought with the precious blood of Jesus Christ and once you're sealed in the Kingdom Satan can't touch you he's defeated he can snarl he can snap he can bark but he's got nothing on you but see yet he is an expert at making him at making you think he's got something on you and if it's not under the blood he does but as soon as it's under the blood Satan loses his hold it doesn't matter what you've done it's under the blood we have we are through him more than a conqueror he is the mighty conqueror but we through him conquer the enemy you conquer your Temptations you conquer the trials of life because nothing can separate you think what a beautiful scripture that is nothing can ever separate you sister Lilia from the love of God that's enjoy that's in Jesus Christ Our Lord aren't you thankful for the blood aren't you thankful because see brother Bob the blood is like the great equalizer if I can say that and not it sounds sacrilegious it doesn't matter how what a what a scoundrel somebody was on Earth or in what a sanctimonious home they were born in one needed the blood just as much as the other you did Jesus doesn't have a very concentrated amount of blood for this person and he just needs a deluded amount for this one without him we'd all be going to hell and so the blood of Jesus is more than enough it ain't just barely enough it's more than enough so so young people it doesn't matter what plans you have for your future and what what different stages you're in life whether you're still in school whether you've graduated and you've got so many decisions ahead of you whether you're seeking a spouse or whatever put God first and remember don't use when the enemy comes in use the word to defeat him if you literally have to open the word and show the devil he knows it's there but show him that you know it's there and do you declare war on the devil and you hold the faith despite of what the circumstances look like circumstances are a big enemy to us the ah what we see and how we feel and and what we think is a big enemy and a big hindrance to us but take what you know to be the truth and hold it is that easier said than done yes honestly it is but the bride God has equipped you to do that when the world can't do it God has equipped something in you to do it amen listening to our feet aren't you thankful don't you love the Lord Jesus he's so worthy to be praised let's go to the Lord in prayer the gracious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus for this opportunity Lord to speak your word father Lord to your children we thank you Lord for the

your life oh yeah there was a line put that in your life he said God help me do that and he said now listen that guy's made a challenge against the people of God all right and Satan's made a challenge to some of you you're the children of God Amen all right pick up your sling pick up those five Stones exactly and don't wait for the preacher to do it for you he didn't wait till Samuel got there he didn't wait till he didn't wait on Saul he ain't went on the army yeah he went out there by himself and he slew a man nine feet tall with a spear that was like 14 feet tall and as my brother said unsurmountable odds to me that's when I looked for God because Satan's just going to keep piling out on you but God's gonna say that's okay I can take one I don't need but one and that brother around
