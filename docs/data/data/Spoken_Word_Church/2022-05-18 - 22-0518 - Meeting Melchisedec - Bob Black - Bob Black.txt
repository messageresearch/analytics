preaching up in ohio so we'll just remember them in prayer um i'm gonna uh speak on a little uh during sunday school we're making our way over to melchizedek and in the book of hebrews and uh just want to just speak on that topic tonight and read from hebrews chapter seven and uh let's also when we go to the lord in prayer remember terrance has lost some keys so we're going to pray about that lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word once more lord jesus and we pray lord that you'll just bless them up in ohio lord as brother wade ministers to them lord and we we know that you're here with us now lord we we you're a prison help in time of trouble in time of need and we know you're with us lord jesus because you said you never forsake us you never leave us lord thank god we've got those promises lord jesus and tonight we've got many needs here and they've got many needs up there in ohio and the bride has many needs all around the world and we know you're still present help that can address you can meet every need that we have lord and so we just ask lord that your lord be at liberty to move among us tonight lord jesus and open up this word lord lord maybe tonight lord many things will be said that are that are maybe difficult to understand and difficult to to think about with our intellectual mind lord but lord surely lord you can come down and quicken the words that we read and make them leap off of the page lord and because we believe tonight that we have a we're serving a supernatural god that can do miracles lord and i i think now lord jesus of all the many times lord that you've you've reached out and saved the lost lord and you've you've reached out to the ones that went away from you lord and you've reached out and found things that have been lost lord and all all the different times that i've lost my keys and i've lost things lord jesus i've lost my umbrella and you've found it i've lost so many things lord jesus and many testimonies here to this tonight lord jesus of times that you've found things lord and lord you know where those keys are that terence lost and we're just trusting you lord jesus to put in his mind where they are or just make them appear before him or whatever you whatever you need to do lord because we're serving a miracle working god and we're serving somebody that can we're serving a god that can move up on the scene lord jesus lord we have a need he's got a need tonight lord jesus and i pray god that you'll move up on the scene and address it lord meet that need no now lord we we just ask lord as we join our faith together lord jesus that you'll meet every need here tonight lord god that we'll we'll leave this place lord feeling like you spoke to us lord that we came and we got what we needed lord we ask this blessing upon your word tonight in the name of the lord jesus amen so hebrews chapter 7 says paul talking about talking about melchizedek and he says for this melchizedek king of salem priest of the most high god who met abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him to whom also abraham gave a tenth part of all first being by interpretation king of righteousness and after that also king of salem which is king of peace without father without mother without descent having neither beginning of days nor end of life but made like unto the son of god abideth a priest continually you may be seated the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now if you if you go back and uh paul paul you know when you talk about melchizedek you're you're it's it's it's can be a little bit confusing first of all because there's two places in scripture that refer to god coming and talking to to abraham in the flesh and and and and sitting down with him and talking to him and so a lot of times you know you start talking about melchizedek and you're talking about maybe one or both of those things both of those events at the same time the first time that melchizedek came to talk to to abraham was after abraham had gone to rescue lot and you know the bible talks about so lot was lot was uh abraham's brother's son and abraham heard that that lot he got captured by all of those kings and cheddarly omer and the different ones and he went and go rescue lot and the bible says that when he went to rescue lot he says he heard his brother got captured and you know brother branham would comment about how that you know when you hear when you when you hear a guy it it just wonderful how he referred to him in the scripture as his brother my brother i heard my brother got captured he was his brother's son his nephew but in the scripture it refers to him as his brother and you know whenever you hear about somebody going astray or getting lost you something something in your heart cries out for them to to try to go out and rescue them and so that's what abraham did he got up and he he went after a lot to go to go capture him and the way that brother brown illustrates it is he he would uh he was he was tearing down all the things that would be in somebody's life you he was he went out and with his sword and he began to to to uh to to bring about a deliverance and lots of life and he would brother branham would dramatize it and say he would see he was killing all that all that lust and all the different things that are in people's lives and he he was going after a lot to rescue him and so when he after all that battle you see you go through times where you're battling things out and and like brother wade's been preaching on the life of sanctification when when the holy spirit begins to move in your life and things begin to leave you and but then after the battle is over you're battling it out you're wrestling with it but after the battle is over then then you're able to commune with god and so after the battle was over with with abraham he sat down and he said he said the bible says he sat down with all these different kings with the the king of sodom and all the all the different kings that had fought with him and and he sat down and but you know here come this one king uh the the king of salem which we know is jerusalem and the king of salem rolled up straight up uh walked up and and sat down and he brought bread and wine and sat down with abraham and they had communion and you know later on in the story you find out that after abraham had gone through some more struggles and god had brought him gave him a promise of a son that you find out that that that man walked up to abraham and he had two men with him and he was walking up those three men and abraham walks up and this time abraham looked at him and he said i know who that man is because i've had communion with him i know who he is you see when you and brother animal lay out in this sermon who is this melchizedek that every every son of god and this in this age is going to go through the same journey that abraham did it's got to play out the same thing that you've got to you got to meet melchizedek as well and how are you going to meet him you're going to meet him in the flesh and you see now brother brown said to think of this great person this great question this great question this that that arose all down through history who was this man that came to meet abraham think of this great person brother i'm said of how great this man must be and now the question is who is this man who's this man and how does he relate to jesus christ who was this man and how does he relate to god what role does he have he came he came to it is it just like he had it he was fulfilling the role of a priesthood or or is he is he a person that we need to know about and see when you when this when this story begins to unfold you begin to the picture begins to unfold of of really how god expresses himself and god's god's attributes being on display and how god moves and how what how god would manifest himself in this day brother brown would say some say it was a myth it was a priesthood and you know because they many people could not could not identify who is this milk who melchizedek is and it seems like so many times down through scripture and down through store down through the seven church ages when god moves on the scene people cannot people don't realize what's happening and they they don't realize who that is that's that's talking to who that is that's moving on the scene how they didn't realize when when the pillar of fire was taken with brother branham they didn't realize that who that was speaking through him when he's when he would say this isn't this isn't william branham this is i'm the one that raised christ from the grave and actually spoke out through hit that man's lips and they failed to recognize that this message that we're hearing is not just some kind of denominational idea but it's direct from the throne of god so brother rahm said it was a person it was a man a personality an eternal person so you know when you start thinking about a personality you the the the the world has got the godhead all mixed up because they like that jew that brother man was talking to he said you can't take god and slice him up into three pieces and and hand him to a jew that just won't work because a jew understands that there's only one god but you see you see what if you begin to understand that god god who was this who was this melchizedek answers that question how does he relate to jesus and how does he relate to you how does he relate to those those believers on the day of pentecost when god put his life in them you see it's always one personality and when you you begin to understand that god it can manifest himself in different ways and express himself in different ways express himself in a pillar of fire express himself from the man christ jesus express himself in the body of believers but it's always one personality when his life begins to express in you that one personality begin begins to take over your life and your life and your works and your actions and your doings begin to express that same personality because there's not three gods it's not three god it's not a father and a son and a holy ghost dueling one another you know when you have when you have a a a person everybody in this room tonight everybody in this building has a different personality so if we were to ask you how would you how would you run your family how would you run a job how would you run a business how would you run the church everybody's going to have their own ideas and their own opinions because we're each different personalities so you see what chaos that would be if the father son and holy ghost were all different personalities they wouldn't be able to agree with one another because they've all got different personalities that's even why brother ramsey said god sends up one prophet at the time one one messenger at a time because one might want to do things a little bit different just because of their nature their characteristic because they're a personality and so you you if you if you if you have a concept of god of three different people or three different personalities your concept of god is all skewed but what a freedom it gives tonight as we're sitting here to know that if god is one god and he has one personality that if that personality can be manifest was manifest in jesus christ and in the pillar of fire and in brother branham's life and that man that personality is manifested in your life it will act the same way and do the same thing he said that's why he said he he gave he gave power to the church to cast out devils and power to do signs and wonders and power to live a christian life because why because it's the same personality the same person living in you that lived in jesus christ the same person that lived in jesus christ lived in was in that pillar of fire because and you see that's the mystery of of of melchizedek unfolding that there was a life behind that flesh that came and talked to abraham there was a that was a person a person the same personality that's manifested all throughout the scripture was the one that came and talked to abraham now brother brahma said he was god because he's the only person that can be immortal and now god changing god changing himself into person now that's why i think i love this sermon who is this melchizedek because it's got some wonderful nuggets like this one god changing himself into person in other words god god manifesting himself changing his mask to display himself in different ways at different times to different people changing his mask so that you know maybe maybe you meet god one day veiled in a little sister failing a little brother that sits down and talks to you about the scripture maybe maybe you meet god when you turn on listen to the tape and and the and the voice of god echoes to you through the tape player or the mp3 player or whatever it is and you're listening though it's coming through the mouth of clay lips of clay but it's the voice of god that same personality and brother adam said we find that many people teach us three personalities in the godhead so you can i have a personality with without being a person it takes a person to make a personality and what is a person a personality is the combination of characteristics of qualities that form an individual's distinctive character in other words your personality is what makes you who you are your personality is the temperance that that controls when somebody smacks you in the face or spits at you your personality is the is the virtue that can flow out of you that it's not just stopped up like the water flowing into the dead sea until it becomes dead but it actually actually there's life within you that you have a past that you can pass it out to somebody else see i'm talking about the same personality that was in jesus christ can be on display today the same the same godliness that was in jesus christ the same brotherly kindness all those things make up the personality of jesus christ and so you see what the statue of a perfect man does that it's actually expressing outwardly what god did inwardly to you through the new birth the statue of perfect man is his works on display that something happened on the inside and something is being expressed the expressed image of his person we found out brother brown said that this person had no mother no no father no mother no beginning of days or ending of life it was god in morphia in morphe so now we're starting to begin to understand the traits of god and the characteristics of god that god can get god can display himself in a lot of different ways now i looked up the definition of morphe online from philippians chapter two and and somebody said i don't even remember where i got this from it was a website they it was i thought it was a pretty good definition they said english doesn't have any any any exact equivalent of morphe uh uh this is maybe one ex one area where it would be nice if you could read the original hebrew and really get to really get what what or the original greek but it says unlike unlike form in english morphe doesn't mean shape it's a philosophical term that means the outward expression of an inner essence to put on display so you can see what's what's taken what's taking place by maybe behind the veil like like for example jesus said no man can know the father except except through the son no man can know him except through me in other words he was the he was the outward display of of what all the things that make up that we'll say unknowable god the mysterious god that the things how how would you know what god's purpose was how would you know what his what his plan was what was in the back part of his mind all the things that he had thought about all the all of his great plan except god had expressed himself through the word had in morphine himself and you see when god and morphs himself he changes his mask so that what's what's behind that veil what you cannot see he puts it on this play see now when god this when god begins to immorphy when he had morphed himself in jesus christ when he had morphed himself in melchizedek we'll go back to melchizedek when he had morphed himself in melchizedek and he put himself on this place so now he could come down and fellowship with abraham and and that unknowable god the god that was past finding out now abraham's sitting there having having a talk with him and eating bread and wine and fellowshipping with him and the same thing when when the when uh all the pharisees and sadducees had no idea what god really wanted what their purpose was in life but then god and morphed himself in jesus christ and came down in a little manger and put himself on this play and now he could sit there and wash people's feet he could sit there and have communion with him he could die on a cross and now that unknowable god is on display and what he had thought before the foundation of the world begins to be displayed you see what a morphe means is that it's the expression of something something that you can't understand and when it's expressed you begin to be able to understand it that's why philippians chapter 2 where this word in morphe comes from says who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god he was in the form of god and what does that mean that means he was the very expression of god the very image of god god put on display so that you would know who god is so that you could understand god but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant so he was be he was in the form of god but he lowered himself down to be the form of a servant to come down and be made a a little baby and a manger and the bible says and made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross now brother brown said the greek word there in morphy means that one person is changing his mask to make him some other character now he's not changing his character but he's making himself some other character he's changed in his mask you ever see one one of those uh maybe a collage of an actor that's been in a movie a lot of movies and stuff and and it shows how that in one movie or whatever they were they were a pirate and another they were sophisticated businessman with a pal with a tie on and every see they're they're changing they're changing the the portrayal and and see that's exactly how god can portray him he can he can then morphe himself he can display his attributes in a business man at work and a minister behind the pulpit and a little child has just received a new birth he can put himself and put him on display just like he came down and displayed himself and morphed himself in melchizedek and morphed himself and put him on display the fullness of the godhead bodily in jesus christ and in morphing himself again in this last day in the bride who will be the fullness of god made made visible made visible among the people yet again so as a morphe means to to change his mask and brother brown said that's what god did it's the same god all the time it's the same god all the time the same personality you think about that in every home tonight in every christian home and every every church where the there's a real god called minister preaching there's real god called people preaching listening to the services it's the same personality working in them it's the same god moving in them it's the same god all the time god in the form of the father the spirit the pillar of fire the same god was made flesh and dwelt among us and morph he brought out so he could be seen brought out so he could be seen now i maybe want to bring that home tonight because when when he puts himself his life in you and you go into the into the workplace with your little lunch pail and your little your little uh you get your your your food out at lunch time and you begin to pray over it where everybody else is laughing at you and and mocking you that that is god on display made visible so that others can look at your life and look at the personality of your life and look at the characteristics of your life because and know that you're serving god and and it actually puts and the unseen god on display you think about how great that is that god allows us to play a role he allows us to preach the gospel where he maybe could just come down with a trumpet and just and everybody would believe but he allows us all to play a role in it the pillar of fire the same god was made flesh and dwelt among us and morph he brought out so he could be seen and now that same god that same god is the holy ghost that same god is the holy ghost so you see now there's there's the there's there's why that's so under important to understand melchizedek who was that melchizedek because if you can understand melchizedek you can understand how god how god uh displays himself and how his attributes are manifested and brotherhood will say now notice like the sculpture he hides with a mask over it and look see what god does he he he puts them he he fails things he fails it so you you don't quite understand it and then he removes the veil see he said it's like a sculptor keeping his piece of work all covered over until the time he takes the mask off of it and there it is and that's what the bible has been it has been a work of god that's been covered up god and morphing himself masking himself acting in different characters moving in different people down through history it's been a work of god that's been covered up and it's been hid since the foundation of the world and its sevenfold mystery and god promised in this day at the age of this laodicean church he would take the mask off the whole thing and we could see it what a glorious thing so now if he takes the mask off and takes the mask of the characters and everything and takes the mask off then what are you going to see you're going to see the one that's moving behind the mask you're going to be able to see the personality and the characteristics and the character of that one who's been behind the mask all along it it hadn't been it hadn't been brother bob or brother wade or go through all the church all the different ones sitting here but it's the one that's behind the mask doing it moving it's it's his characteristics and his personality moving in the church so that's why brother brown said that was god above us god with us now is god in us the holy spirit not the third person but the same person the same person all the time the same personality the same characteristics the same god now he said in the beginning god went along with his attributes as i spoke of this morning so that's what that's what melchizedek was doing he was expressing those attributes that god thought of an attribute think about god existing alone elohim with his attributes elohim back before time eternal sitting there with his attributes and alone and and he wanted to put those on display see that's what melchizedek was that's what jesus christ was that's what the holy ghost is for to manifest the attributes that god thought about before the foundation of the world he said in the beginning god dwelt along with his attributes as i spoke of this morning that's his thoughts there was nothing just god alone but he had thoughts he said now in the beginning god dwelt along with his attributes as i spoke with i already read that quote i duplicated that in my nose he said just like a great architect can sit down in his mind and draw out what he thinks he's going to build now you think about god the great architect sitting back and in his mind it never had a new thought never had something that just popped in his idea in his mind he thought well that would be a great idea but his eye his eye his thoughts are eternal so he's he's got all these thoughts and they need to be expressed and what are these thoughts these thoughts are i'm going to have a bride one day and part of that bride there's going to be ministers and there's going to be people sitting in the pew and they're going to go out in the workplace and they're going to manifest my life and and all of that just all that sitting in his mind waiting to be unfolded like an architect ready to build a house think about all these things that we preach we're in the mind of god that there's going to be there's going to be people that are lost and they need a redeemer i'm going to come and die for myself die for them and give my life for them and get fill them with the holy ghost and and they're going to need a way out and and i'm going to preach i'm going to i'm going to send i'm going to send the the recipe for how to get out and that's for them to receive the word for their day and they grow and grow until until finally they bust out of this of this realm like busting an eagle busting out of an eggshell and they're raptured away and so all of that is in god's mind and it needs to be expressed see that's what melchizedek is doing see why we need to understand about melchizedek now melchizedek is the expression of a we'll say a transcendent god and i transcended transcendent means beyond or above the range of normal or merely physical human experience existing apart from and not subject to the limitations of the material universe and i say that because isaiah in chapter 40 he said it is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth and the inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers that stretcheth out the heavens as a curtain and spreadeth them out as a tent to dwell in how could how could we understand a god like that how could we understand all those things that uh isaiah chapter 55 says for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are your ways my way saith the lord it's we're like little grasshoppers little ants in his sight how can we understand a god like that he's got all these thoughts and they need to be expressed in jeremiah chapter 23 it says can any hide himself in secret places that i shall not see him saith the lord did not i feel heaven and earth saith the lord how how with our little grasshopper minds can we understand a god like that but if it's expressed if god can come down and manifest himself through the man jesus christ and humble himself in a little stable and go through all the preach the word in a way that we can understand it and grasp it then we can begin to then we our mind can be shaped so that we begin to think like he thinks and we can begin to have his thoughts a thought when it's expressed because i thought when it's expressed is a word so i can have a thought i can have a thought and when i speak it it becomes it's a word now that you can understand and it because it becomes it comes something you can grab a hold to er and you think that's why that's why the bible says in the beginning was the word because the word was the actual expression of that of that thought that how could we how could we approach to that how could we understand it it was in the uh hidden in the mind of god in the back part of god's mind all these things that god wanted to accomplish but then he expressed it he expressed it when that logos came out exp the logos came out in a body that you could begin to you could begin to understand because he's descending down a thought expressed is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's god's attribute then it becomes a thought then a word and that's where that's where tonight sitting here if the personality and the characteristics of god are manifested in your life right now and god has filled you with the holy ghost then that's proof that before the foundation of the world before before everything that god thought about you that i think that's something that should make every every child of god rejoice to know that you know we sing the songs about how when he was on the cross we were on his mind but you were on his mind a whole lot before that way longer than before that you were you were always on his mind so you know his attributes are eternal so that means he always thought about you he knew that one day you were going to accept it and he always loved you he loves you because of that he always knew that one day you were going to have eternal life and so now that paints the picture now in the grand scheme of things that means you always were eternal now we know you dip down into time and you came down here and you were lost and all those things but brother ramsay said if you have eternal life you always was you always was those who have now you see we're taking a step back and looking at the 10 000 foot view you always were because god before the foundational world knew that you were going to receive it those who have denied eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there ever was an angel before there ever was a star you look up in the night sky and think before any of those stars were there before any constellation before any universe rolled off of the finger of god before anything that i can see in the night sky was there i was in his thinking that's eternal you think about the thought of god that brother around would say that there can't be a flea badass eyes but what he knowed it he knows everything and that means he knew you he knew you he knowed it before there ever was a world how many times a flea would bat its eyes and how much tallow it had in it before there ever was a world that is infinite we can't comprehend it in our minds but that's god and that god thought about you before the foundation of the world that god had a thought about you that had to be expressed he was thinking about you and that had to be expressed he said your eyes your stature you think about that i i want you to just really dwell on that that maybe tonight you don't like the way you look or the way that you act or you don't you wish you were taller or shorter or whatever but god thought about you before the foundation of the world he knew what color eyes you would have he knew how tall you would be he said your stature whatever you was you were in his thinking at the beginning and the only thing that you are is the expression word right now sitting here if you're filled with the holy ghost that you are the expression of god's attribute that attribute that he thought and he said after he saw that he spoke it this is another nugget i love out of this message think about this after he thought it he spoke it and here you are after he thought he spoke and here you are now he spoke the worlds of existence and the son of man when he was manifested on earth when he came on earth and was born in a stable grew up and he preached the gospel and he he's spoken and i see every everything that we're preaching we're preaching what he spoke so then maybe one day you were sitting in a church and you heard a minister speak the word and you accepted it and there you are because it was spoken into existence and brother adam said you were there in his attributes you don't remember it because you're just a part of his life you're a part of god when you become a son or daughter of god just as you are a part of your earthly father that's right you are the male carries the hemoglobin the blood and when that has gone in the egg then you become a part of your father and your mother is a part of your father so you're all a part of your father now you see where brother adam's going with this as he lays this out he's talking he's beginning to lay out this pattern that we're all part of one body we're all part of this one thing we're all part of the father we're part of him we're part of him and he's in us and and we all just get consumed one together in oneness and that that makes see we've got all these attributes attributes that god thought of a redeemer and savior and counselor and prince of peace and everlasting father and mighty god of deacons and ministers and prayer warriors and homemakers and lunch box carriers and song leaders and worshipers and all those things were in god's mind that he needs he wants to manifest maybe maybe this afternoon just think that god before the foundation of the world had a picture of you how you would be and how you would see it and what church you would go to and he also had a picture he had a picture in his mind that thought of you overcoming the devil you overcoming everything that the devil can throw at you you could overcome in the pride of life and the lust of the flesh and uh uh young people overcoming pornography and instagram addiction and overcoming alcoholism and cigarette smoking and then as you grow up and grow in grace and knowledge you're overcoming overcoming everything that the devil can throw at you and god thought about that before the foundation of the world because you were one of his thoughts in every age every age those thoughts are manifested which is why in first timothy it says that thou keep this commandment without spot unrebukable under the appearing of our lord jesus christ which in his times he shall show in his time he's going to make those man attributes manifested who is the blessed and only potentate and here's here's the third title of this melchizedek the king of salem the king of righteousness and it says here in 1st timothy the king of kings and lord of lords why because this time it's time for the attributes of god to be manifested the attributes of god are put are all put on display when you're filled with the holy ghost you're ma actually manifesting the life of god so brother adam said then the attribute was first god the thought the attribute itself all in one without being expressed then when he expressed secondarily he became then the word and then the word was made flesh and dwelt among us his first being was spirit god supernatural all right the great eternal second he began to form himself toward flesh in a theophany it's called the word a body and brother adam said this then is the state he was in when he met abraham was called melchizedek so that's how he came to abraham the expression of all the attributes of god come down to sit with abraham and have communion and talk to him and show him things you know the second time that that melchizedek came to abraham he sat down and lingered with him and stood over on the hill and washed and they talked about sodom and gomorrah and he and he said i believe that he was lingering with him until he really caught the revelation of what was taking place and i believe that when god comes down it came down in this age and and manifested himself that he he what he he's he's wanting to wait on you and i to catch the revelation he he he he's lingering with us he that's that's what he's doing as he moves through our midst and you think about abraham who was poor and and spiritually poor but spiritually rich and he was looking for a new jerusalem and here came the king of that new jerusalem and he met melchizedek after the slaughter of the kings and had communion with him and blessed him that had been delivered of his enemies now brother ram said a theophany is something that you cannot see now theophany is something you can't see he said it could be here right what's now what's he talking about behind your flesh behind jesus flesh behind melchizedek's flesh something something working something moving he said it could be here right now you cannot see it it's just like well like television that's in another dimension there's another dimension that can be seen by transformation by television and he said so is it that christ is here the angels of god are here and someday in the great millennium to come it'll be just more real than television or anything else because they are here that's something i think sometimes it's kind of hard for us to grasp that that there are angels here there's there's a supernatural world here that's actually moving among us right now you know in one place brother brown talked about how you never you see it and sometimes in a in like a camp meeting or something where people really become conscious of the presence of god and he said in one place you'll bump up against an angel and it'll cause a reaction in this dimension somebody will begin to rejoice and scream and shout because they bumped up against an angel you you think even right now there's angels moving among us there's something something behind beyond what we can see with our natural eyes and so brother brown said he reveals himself in his great form of what he claimed as he had morphed himself into his servants and prove himself now he appeared to abraham and morphy when abraham was returning from the slaughter of the kings here come a melchizedek talk to him now see there's when you die you you die you leave this body behind but but yet there's something behind this flesh there's power in this flesh you think what a what a miraculous thing it is to to to be able to move your hand like this and move your eyeballs and think thoughts and everything because there's more than just this flesh this body there's something behind this flesh that's moving it that's powering it so when you die you're gonna go somewhere you know brother i'm told that story in in in this in this sermon he told a ghost story believe it or not brother man told a ghost story he told a story about he said the other day in the tucson paper he was reading about this woman that was going down the highway at so many miles an hour and a man in an overcase stepped out and she had an old man with an overcoat on and she screamed and stopped her car and there wasn't nobody there and everybody come around and said well years ago there was a man that had an overcut on and he got killed he got struck by a car and he was using that as an example to prove that that there's a life behind the flesh there's a life behind there's something working behind the veil of this flesh that's why in second corinthians chapter five it says for we know that if our earthly house at this house of this tabernacle were dissolved we've got a building of god and house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven so he's talking about when you die you're you're going to go somewhere there's going to be a body that you're in and don't get nervous that makes people nervous when you start talking about body i thank god that we can i believe we can nail those things down and we have the correct interpretation you see the theophany the word the expression of god's being was masked in melchizedek it was hidden behind that man melchizedek it was hidden that word the theophany it was hidden behind the flesh of jesus christ the theophany the theophany of god the word is hidden it's veiled he said from the great beginning spirit then came down to the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself it's just spoke out it's always spoken out because that's what the word is the word is the expression of that thought so it's spoken out in morphe later he becomes flesh jesus mortal to taste death for all of us sinners and brother roman said he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final end every son of abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing do the same thing that abraham did as abraham sat there and saw god manifested in the flesh that theophany hidden behind the veil of that flesh and come and sat down with him and talked to him and had communion with him brother brown said who was it he never was born he never will die who is it it was god sure it was in the foreshadow of the lord jesus certainly was but he had to come through a woman in the order you come through a woman so how did we come we come from attribute to flesh he said he was at the beginning the word an in morphy body he came in and lived in that in the purple person of melchizedek then later we never heard no more of melchizedek because he became jesus christ melchizedek was the priest but he became jesus christ now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet wouldn't that be great to be able to know all things my so we could set one another straight no [Laughter] to know all that you think you think about when brother brown went beyond the curtain of time when he went over there and they were telling him what was going to happen and how things were because why when they went when they went beyond the curtain of time now they were in a state where they could have understanding of all things they were back to the play have been redeemed back to the place where god god wanted them to be from the foundation of the world that to be in that place where they could know and not be restricted by these time elements and by our own thoughts and by our own ideas and our opinions and things they were in that back in that condition and we bypassed that you see he said but when this life is finished here and he quotes again in second corinthians if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved we've got a building of god and house not made with hands a tabernacle we've got a tabernacle he said that's where we go so where do we go he said that's where we go that is the word where are you going to go with you when you die if you've received the word and you've heard this spoken word when you die if you're born again now you're going to go back to the word he said that's where we go that is the word then we we can look back and see what we've done boy you think about these ones that have gone on and stepped across the curtain of time and and the rejoicing that's taken place as they look back and now they have an understanding of what happened and what we're doing down here and now they can look back and and review their life and review all the things that maybe were a mystery to them then why they went to this church and why they went to that church and why they ended up here and these things and all all that and but now it begins to be clear because they can look back he said now we don't understand it we have never become the word we've just become the flesh man not the word and you'll never be the word unless he was a thought at the beginning you'll never be a word unless she was a thought at the beginning but we've got the earnest y'all doing all right tonight it's it's not gonna bother me tonight if y'all sleep i'm preaching to to just wherever i'm just gonna lay it out that is right brother ramon said when this body receives the spirit of god the immortal life inside of you it throws this body in in subjection to god when you receive the word and you're sitting in church and you hear and that word becomes quicken and it begins to move what's it taking you it's taking you back to the word you see how the rapture happens the rapture is such a mysterious thing but what happens is as soon as you're born again the rapture started and it begins transforming you and molding you and taking you back to return back to the word to that condition where you know all things where you're one with god where you're you're a supernatural something takes place he said in romans chapter 8 there is therefore now no condemnation of them which are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit see what are we motivated by that thing that's veiled behind our flesh the spirit of the living god for the law of the spirit of life in christ jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death and that's why brother roman said you don't have to say oh if i could just quit drinking oh oh if i could just quit how do you quit drinking not because you you you strain real hard or you you will very much just quit doing those things but because the word has taken over your life and it's the word that that that word behind the veil that's doing the taking over that's doing the living that's doing the motivating of your members and brother i said just get in christ and it's all gone see because your body is subject to the spirit it's no more subject to the things of the world they're dead they are dead your sins are buried in baptism and you are a new creature creation in christ and what is that spirit in you he said that spirit is nothing in this world but the seed word made manifest or quickened made alive and when the bible said don't do this that body quickly turns to it there's no question it's the earnest of our resurrection it's the earnest of it that this body is going to raise up again now you start thinking about bodies when he's preaching on the melchizedek just the same as when you're born a little baby you come into the world and you you come uh you're you while your little body is growing in the mother your your members are twitching and jerking and things but then when you're born you come out screaming and there's a life that goes into that body now now uh let's just meditate on this for a little bit i know this is wednesday night wednesday night we get a little bit sleepy sometimes and it may be a little bit deep but just think about this now that when you're when a little baby is born that there's a life there's a spiritual body that goes into that baby he said that little body now is not alive yet see the only thing it is is just flesh and muscles but when it comes forth from the womb god breathes the breath of life into it and then it screams out just as sure as there is a natural body being formed there is a spiritual body to receive it as soon as it gets here so just as sure as that little natural body is being formed there's also a spiritual body a spiritual body and brother adam said then when a man is born again from heaven he becomes a spirit babe in christ and then when this robe of flesh is dropped there is a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we go to when this flesh drops away there's something that you go to where you you still got hands you still got eyes you can still hug somebody because there's a body that you go to he said then that body returns back and picks up the glorified body when when it's time for the rapture you you think now now what you think when brother branham was laying there when he went beyond the curtain of time and he looked back and he saw his body laying there well now he's in another body a body and he's able to walk and hug those people beyond the curtain of time and talk to him what is that body the theophany body he said that's the reason jesus went to hell when he died and preached the souls that were imprisoned turn back turn back into that theophany now jesus left his body laying there in that grave and he preached to the souls in hell and he was in he was in a body with hands and and eyes and and he could talk to them and preach to him so he had a voice that he could speak through he had a body the problem said when testing of his word is over then we are taken up to this body that was prepared for us before the foundation of the world it is the word there that we skipped to come right around down here to be tempted and tested if we had to come through that there'd have been no temptation we'd have known all things that's the reason jesus knowed all things because he was word before he was flesh then we become the word we accept god by faith by the written word he said then there is something in there it's that eternal life you were predestinated to it and you know he tells that story of the little chicken in the barnyard that one day heard heard from that mother eagle cry the mother eagle typing the word crying out and he said you heard from your theophany what are you hearing from you're hearing from that word that you're going back to you're hearing from the word now now brother brown said i know i know this is deep i'm i'm i feel like i'm pressing in now maybe i'll slow down a little bit yo yo i'll be like don't slow down in hebrews chapter 2 brother adam said the difference what is that what is that theophany now let's let's see what brother brown said he said in hebrews chapter two uh part three he said the difference between an animal and a man god put a soul in a man and he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany so in other words there's something behind your flesh that's moving that's moving your being and when you're born again there's still there's now it's god that personality that same one that's been manifesting himself down through the ages and he's he's manifesting those same characteristics the same personality that was in jesus christ and now it's manifested in you and the entombment and brother brown in 1957 he said here he goes where did he leave when he left the bible said he ascended he went and preached to the souls that were in prison prison when jesus when jesus died he said that repented not in the long suffering of the days of sower of noah his soul his spirit his theophany of his own being went down and then into the entirement in 1957 brother ram began to sing a song during the service he said as job or he quote this poem it was a poem he said as job as job of old when we hear that ashes to ashes and dust to dust it reminds me of longfellow who said tell me not in mournful numbers life is just an empty dream and the soul is dead that slumbers and things are not what they seem yea life is real life is earnest and the grave is not its goal for dust thou art to dust returneth was not spoken of the soul they call it a theophany that when we leave here we go in somewhere else in other words when this when this flesh drops away you're not just some wispy thing floating around but you still got a body and you got a good body a body that knows all things that can still hug and can still can still fellowship that can sit down with somebody you've got a body and brother brown in 19 in 1957 in questions and answers he said my jehovah's witness friend i'd like to ask you about that if hell is a place whatever you wish to call it if that ceases at the grave then why did he say i'll not leave my soul in hell here his body was in the grave and his soul was in hell preaching to life he was in theophany again his soul was down there with those people that were in theophany also what the ones in hell weren't theophany also because they got a body they got a body just because they were in hell doesn't mean they're just a floaty mis wispy thing they got a supernatural body that they're still in that persists past your flesh dying and he said he was witness unto them that they repented not in the long suffering and brother remembering questions and answers in 1961 he said when a baby is being formed in a womb of a mother as soon as it's born in this world and breathes its first breath it becomes a living soul just as soon as the babies dropped into the earth and flesh there's a spiritual body waiting to receive it as soon as the spiritual body the natural body is dissolved there's a spiritual body weight in yonder a theophany we call it see a theophany because as soon as that little baby is born it's got a soul so that if it dies it's not just gonna float off somewhere but it's got a body now i'll be closing here in just a minute y'all y'all just hang on you remember when when uh when in the story of of the mount transfiguration when jesus went up on the top of the mountain there was two people with him moses and elijah and they weren't just floating around but they were there in their theophany and brother brown said 800 years later on mount transfiguration after those men had lived and died he said moses body had been rotten for hundreds of years but here he was in such a form till even peter james and john recognized him if this earthly tabernacle be dissolved if you're an attribute of god expressed here on earth you've got a body waiting after you leave this world there they was standing on mount transfiguration in their theophany for they were prophets to whom the word came to remember when when saul went and got the witch of endor and and and and she called up samuel and their their appeared samuel to her saul couldn't see it but there's there he was and he wasn't just floating around but he said about three or four years later the king got in trouble there was before the blood of jesus christ was ever shed he was in paradise and a witch of india called for somebody to come and console saul and when the witch saw him standing up she said i see god raising up out of the earth he entered into the theophany which was the word he said you get it now now he said now the true revelation of melchizedek comes into view what he was god the word before he became flesh god the word because he had to be no one else could be immortal like him behind that flesh was the soul of god working behind the flesh veil in melchizedek that same god that was veiled in melchizedek then veiled himself in the flesh of jesus christ and now again in this last day he's supposed to veil himself behind the flesh of the bride in the form of the son of man as he's manifested see he said i had father and mother you did too jesus had father and mother but this man had no father had no mother jesus had a time he started this man didn't we're talking what are we talking about the flesh on the outside the flesh or the one on the inside that's doing the moving that's doing the work and the theophany jesus had a time he started this man didn't jesus that flesh that was born jesus gave his life this man couldn't because he was life and it's the self-same man all the time he said i hope god reveals it to you the self-same person all the time who was this who is this milk as it is we see her plainly the complete secret of our lives and journey and death and where we go after we die also predestination is in plain view here all these things are made plain i mean i just maybe want to call your attention just sometimes we think what when we come to church what we're really doing is we want to have our my eyes opened up to the plate to the what the scripture is really talking about i heard somebody say one time i like to i like to go to i like to go to a church where the preacher doesn't look at his notes that he just preaches and so you can get in your mind all these things about what a good church service it really is but what really is a good church service when you can begin to understand when you can understand see sometimes like right now it doesn't matter if there's not a lot of jumping and screaming because you look out of the ocean and and there's a lot going on the water is going up and evaporating and forming clouds and it's going to make rain clouds and it's going to come down and you don't see the water going up you don't see something happening but yet there's something happening and i believe right now even in the stillness as the word is being preached something's happening why because you're understanding when you're under when you begin to gain understanding that is what will give you victory over the devil that's what brother wade's been preaching about maybe not so much jumping and hollering things those those are good that's good to do and many times when you really catch a real revelation of what the scripture is saying it'll make you jump and shout and things and we just certainly don't want to mock that but see what we're here for is to understand to understand who is this melchizedek see even in the quiet stillness says the word is being preached something's happening what's happening we're being redeemed back we're being brought back that's what redeemed men's means is to bring back to its original place and what's the original place where we going back back to the word that's why the scripture says that new jerusalem is the mother of us all because we came from the word new jerusalem type in the word that's where we come from and we're going back to our home which is the word we've come from the word and that's where we're going back to and brother said it's only that predestinated will be brought back it's only the ones who god thought of before the foundation of the world only those thoughts in his minds and his mind that there's going to be somebody that will grow in grace that will be born again that will receive the message for their age that will hear the preaching of the god of the gospel that will respond to the spoken word brother said the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was only he said he wanted me to stand in the pulpit he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose and the one that left home only come to the earth to serve his purpose then after it's finished it's brought back in a glorified state it's matured and brought back again so we know we know there's something drawing us back draw pulling us back to redemption that's why there's three pulls because god is god is pulling us back to himself brother ryan said we know when we walk into the presence of god something in us tells that tells us that we come from somewhere where'd you come from from the mind of god that he thought about you and we're going back again by that power that's pulling on us we're going back by that power that's pulling us so who is this melchizedek then who was this melchizedek that's the same yesterday today and forever you know when when jesus was walking with the with the on the road to emmaus with with cleopas and his friend he was walking with him and he was actually god that theophany veiled in flesh talking to them and they failed to recognize who he was i wonder if the king of sodom and sodom knew who that was when the king when that melchizedek came up and sat down with abraham and began to share the bread and the wine with him they surely didn't recognize jesus when he came that was god veiled in flesh i wonder will they recognize in this day i wonder do you recognize because when you recognize when the bride begins to realize who she is when you recognize what you are then you will be an invincible army you will be an army for the lord that the devil cannot do anything with and it won't be because you jumped and shouted so much even though maybe you will but it's because god has given you a supernatural understanding you see when you preach sermons like this maybe it's not just for little babies you a little baby's not gonna get maybe get much out of out of talking about attributes and talking about uh theophanies and things but god wants you to grow to a place where this means something to you where you don't just just push it aside and say that i i don't really need this but it's something that's important to you to know who was that melchizedek and what is his relation to jesus christ and what is his relation to you because brother ram said in this message he said who was it he never was born he never will die it was god sure it was and the foreshadow of the lord jesus certainly was but he had to come through a woman in the order you come through a woman and he had to come the way you come in order to bring you back to him so we know who that melchizedek was but what if that same melchizedek is manifested today who was this milk is today because the musicians come who is this melchizedek to think that god could manifest himself in the flesh and the flesh pull all that potassium and calcium around him and walk up to abraham and and and veil himself in the flesh of jesus christ and in this day veil himself in the flesh of his bride and reveal himself in the form of one word body a body of believers this acting and doing together in accord with what the word says i believe god is here let's stand to our feet [Applause] let's sing something 403 i've been changed amen hey flesh i've been to the water and i've been
