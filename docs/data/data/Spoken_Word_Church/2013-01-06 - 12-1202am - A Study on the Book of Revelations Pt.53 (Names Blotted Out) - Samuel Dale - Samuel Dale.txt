the house of the Lord youd like turn in your scriptures where we've been reading from Revelations 1 and Revelations 6 remember now the Lord willing Bible study will be this coming Saturday but we had to move it over because of the wedding had a beautiful wedding yesterday was really really nice and everything everything went real good and you know nobody didn't fall down or stumble or nothing and all went real good and everything but we had to move our Bible study over from the first Saturday to this coming Saturday and then also remember now on the ninth which is the coming Sunday we will only be having one service cuz we will be eating together and fellowshipping for a while and honoring all of the the uh officers and the things of the church and we pray that you would come and be with us and to honor these and to the church members remember we've announced it this is where we make sure because we've had to times we've had to run around and Hunt people up to give them things and we just started a new thing that we're going to do from now on that you if you're not present to get a gift from the church not the officers now right not the officers and the the coins that we give out every year but to the U people of the church that you know maybe go somewhere else or whatever then your money will be put into the fund to be given into the missionaries all right so it'll all be taken care of everything will be done correctly and we'll do that from now on was kind of lifing um the other day but somebody said well I guess I'm doing that job I said yeah when I tell you you're doing it you're doing it when I tell you we're doing this we're doing it okay everything's okay all right now remember the sick ones Among Us Anna called or Richard did did not here this morning uh Anna has a real bad migraine headache and the Labby Grace was started running the temperature about 105 or 100.5 this morning or something so just remember that Brother Richard Wilson also wants us to remember this morning his grandson who is real sick so remember these remember all that are missing the sick ones and all brother Sterling I talked to brother Boyd just a moment ago and he said that everything was coming down you know the problem was he had to have an emergency appendix operation and the white blood count what wouldn't come down it was too high for what they thought so they're running other test but everything's dropping now and they're hoping it'll all turn out to be okay cuz we believe that amen we have a visitor Among Us this morning so we're always say to you when you come one time your visitor he's got a real good name amen his name is Samuel so we can keep up with that or either Sam I guess they call him Sam but that's what they do with me too brother and they have called me a few other things you know you but we we're glad to have you with us and we just say welcome and know I think that's all the announcements h that we have together brother uh Jackson Jason Jackson Jason Jackson will be preaching the watch Night Service which you'll be preaching the Sunday morning evening service and then you know Monday night is the watch Night Service so remember that looking forward to to that amen amen anything else I'm always missing something we're glad to see everybody in the house of the Lord this morning and we pray that you would just pray for each and every one of us all right let's pray before we read our scripture Revelation 1 Revelation 6 father we thank you for this day and the hour that we're living thank you for your Lov and Grace unto us thank you for Calvary and we pray that you would just bless each and every one of us this morning with an open heart that we may receive Thy word as it would come forth and Lord the things you've laid upon our heart we pray that you would bless us and guide us and keep us in thine understanding Lord because we we appreciate you and just have your way now come Among Us and open your word and heal our afflictions as you promised you'd send your word and heal us and Deliver Us from destruction and we thank you for it in Jesus name amen Revelations 1 now a lot of them especially on the Joseph just Rachel's family this morning they're probably worn out because they were later getting in from the wedding so if we hear some snower and just reach over and punch him you know to wake up he'll be all right we be no problem all right Revelations 1 the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now what is that time the time to understand right right I believe we're down here don't you amen at the end of all things okay Revelation 6:9 excuse me verse 12 and when he had opened the sick seal and lo there was a great earthquake quake and the sun became black as sackcloth of high and the moon became as blood and the stars of Heaven fell into the Earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she's shaken of A Mighty Wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places great earthquakes and things right right right and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men and the chief captain and the Mighty Men and the every bondman and every Freeman to hid themselves in the HS and in the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sth on the throne and from the Wrath of the Lamb you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word but however brother here he's been here before with us but it happened that's number one so we got another visitor this morning we say welcome to you and just sit back and relax a little bit we've been quite a while in a study of and you forgive me for the cough drop the Cod like I always say either cough drop or shut up so I have to have a problem with my throat when I start trying to preach preach sometimes straight through it's okay next time it starts clogging up so uh just forgive me for taking a cough drop but that's part of life I guess we've been quite a while now in the study in the Book of Revelations and we've gotten over now into the six seal and we're trying to cover not just individually seals and and make an order of that we've been in the Book of Revelations for quite a while and just kind of moving along real slow and gradual trying to understand some things and coming down through and seeing as we'll get to um maybe the Lord willing this evening A Plan of Redemption all the way through the Bible and see it but we'll just see how it goes may have to cut off and take part of this this afternoon all right but now listen there is only six seals written in the Bible amen right all right the seventh seal is not written it says silence in heaven Revelations 81 all right so then there's only six seals to reveal The Plan of Redemption that's right that's what I've been trying to get us to and we're on the Sixth Seal now seeing the complete Plan of Redemption and we covered this past uh week there that all names are revealed a prophet said on the sixth sealen before the seventh opens on his coming amen all right now see then the seventh seal is not going to deal with Redemption I'll tell you that ahead of time but it will will redeem will be dealing with possession amen possession more than redeeming see uh as we'll get to it this afternoon the prophet covers that the word Redemption is in two parts out of into two right all right see and we're still here our soul is Redeemed by the new birth but our body is still in this old world and you know needing Redemption all right then it will go on all the way to the world will be redeemed one day right you know amen you also the Plan of Redemption is not over just because we think it would be it it it continues on but we'll be dealing only with six seals as to revealing us the Plan of Redemption all right that way then you can take it and do is we we've tried to do through the series that you can take uh first second third fourth seal and cover just justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the restored word to come in the end time all right then you can go back and see as the prophet said the field 6 and S seal shows how he done it right amen all right so what did we do Phil seal shows the greatest understanding of justification am could ever be our Grace right because there's a group of people that actually don't want eternal life right that fil seal Jew that was would be killed from Calvary down to the ending us going up the prophet said they actually don't care anything about salvation they're still under the Old Testament rulings that's right all right and being under that then that's the greatest understanding of justification amen because justification means what right when it comes down to finality justification means you didn't do it right sure we were guilty we done it right but then God looks down and says you never done it am and I love that now watch that through the message today that he he keeps his curses he puts a curse on something he doesn't remove that curse right amen but he keeps his promises amen right he never forgets his promises he always holds that that promise to where that you can depend upon it if you can find it written in the Bible you can call him on the scene why because he said it amen there I quoting one ago praying that it says that he sent his word and healed us right right and delivered us from destruction you know why I depend on that sir he said if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you shall be saved I believe I depend on that I I love his promises amen but I also have to admit that there's a lot of curses within the word right the word if we go After idols and other things then we're cursed all right and we should be because it should not be any uh excuse today as to understanding about the true word of God Amen all right so the fifth seal shows you justification Sixth Seal would deal with sanctification amen because it means cleansed and set aside amen all right when we get over in a minute you'll see that that we pick up in the seventh chapter of Revelations to show that who's going to be redeemed in this Great Tribulation that is coming upon the Earth this is not tribulation this is pre-tribulation right I mean this this is not a a bad thing yeah we think it is but I'd like to stay around here quite a while you know the way things are going wouldn't you I I sure I'd like to be well I'd like to be young yeah but you know we're we're all pretty well fat right we're not being persecuted we're not be in troubled for what we believe things going pretty good all right but I don't want to stay around here because I want to go and meet the Lord you that's my desire that's my point all right the much as I talk about him here I certainly want to see him when I get dark all right so then we're in studying of all names the prophet said paragraph 155 I think it is souls in prison all names being revealed on the sick seal right all right so then we're studying about these that are being revealed we went through the ages to see the bride of Christ and we've covered the foolish virgins that would come up under those ages and actually be given eternal life and then as I said we went into the fifth seal Jew to see that that's where Paul said all Israel be saved right no not ever Israelite right no no no he said not all Jews are Jews you right not all Israelite not every person is going to be saved right right all right but the predestin all right then we went into covering the from the foolish virgin and come into the bride now we're down to Revelations 7 to where that there's 144,000 of the children of Israel to be redeemed right all right and then doing that then we see as I said there's only six seals to the Bible That's why Ruth was given six measures of meal right barley right all right she was given that showing that 6,000 years of mankind would be upon the Earth right right and that she would then if she held on she would be redeemed that's what Ruth needed right she needed a redeemer she needed someone who could pay the price and Boaz could do that but he really was redeeming Naomi right y by redeeming Naomi then he automatically right received Ru so that was a wonderful thing God came to redeem Israel his chosen people right amen but when they turned him down he came for the Gentiles and that's where we are to be happy all right but that he would carry over until to Ruth take that and hold it Naomi said until he finishes The Plan of Redemption all right now so then the Plan of Redemption would come here in the end time do you and I yes cuz the full Plan of Redemption has never come until the end time no that's right down to the ages they talked about salvation they talked about a place to go they talked about a heaven they talked about a happy Hunting Ground um there's not much difference if you'll study it and you'll see them a little more this evening there's not much difference the old Indian happy Hunting Ground than there is to most people's thinking of heaven right you know but we come to find out that we've seen the Plan of Redemption all right but now church I believe and have tried my best to get to you one thing the complete Plan of Redemption was finished at Calvary amen that's right which meant all those Old Testament Saints that's why he had to go and preach to as Peter would call it the spirits in prison right once he was crucified see he left he went down in so and preached to right all right because Jesus Christ died once for all amen the Old Testament people that blood of bulls and goats was just pushing y it it wasn't eradicating sin right right because there was no life in that animal to be able to come back upon the human being right so it could only just push that sin forward and when it did Jesus Christ at Calvary strung his arms out to get the old and the new everything plan all right that's right and see then he would bring in the complete Plan of Redemption there is no Redemption outside of Jesus Christ amen so no matter what it is or what group of people we're talking about it all has depended upon whether or not Jesus was that as we called it in the in the Greek Etc Hebrew one the gold g o e l I think or a l which one it is e l I think right it means that he is 10 folks it means that he is capable of paying the price amen that's right see when when uh bo bought Ruth he had to pay the price right now what if he didn't have no money to pay the price so he's got to be able to pay the price he's got to be willing to do it righten you remember in The Book of Ruth that says that there one closer to K he had a right to redeem boy had to deal with him y so he went down to deal with him and when he did read the book of Ruth he said you redeem The Rock he said I'll redeem it y was like in bad shape but Boaz was pretty smart so what did he say he said the day you redeem Naomi y you remember y Ruth and the other one there their husbands had died and Naomi's husband had died and that was why the Boaz was next to Ken he said but the day you redeem Naomi M you got to take Ruth y you remember Ruth was a gentile right so that old stoms Jew in the natural story he says yep because the problem was he was going to have to have children by Ruth that's right to keep the lineage going because that was what was had to be done that was where Tamar and Judah got into the problem see they had to if if if a brother died is you know his wife she could go to the the next brother could take her and but he raised up the first child went to that name right it didn't go to his name so that old St Jew in the natural stories I say he said uh-uh ain't going to do it boab said okay I'll pay the price cuz you and I you know what we were whether you like it or not you may think oh goody goody how goody you are and how goody goody you been but you know what we all born kin folks to the devil amen that's right whether you like it or not right amen that's right we were born lost doomed and on the way to hell and deserving every bit of it but God came down and paid the price he didn't send the second one he didn't stay up there and send the son down as we talk and organize religion on the Trinity right you know we us teach that God stayed up here the father he sent the son down well now it's where you get into those Eternal sunship deals you get into the Catholics you'll learn a lot about eternal sunship and how can you have an eternal son that don't make sense whether you understand it or not don't make sense you say I'm an eternal son well who's your daddy right well he's dead gone yeah well I ain't too much on that on doing it right but see instead of him sending a son he came himself to pay the price amen the of God said he didn't trust the Plan of Redemption with anyone else am I love that word he said he came his all right to pay the price that you and I could be saved so then the Plan of Redemption is right through the word of God right and as I said we getting to the six seal we talking about a purging because we read of even the mountains the rocks and the different things and people cry out for them to fall on them and and many things are happening there as the world is being purged these little things we see out here amateur tribulation tribulation when it comes to the Great Tribulation is the wrath of God poured out this is not the wrath of God for that that's why I said I'll stay here with it if you want to you know I hope not too much longer cuz I'm getting old anyway but you know maybe he can slow these things down but listen Church then in doing it we look at this Redemption under the six seal to find the last of the names amen right because if you deal in the the bride of Christ you deal in the Old Testament Saints as we'll try to do this afternoon or Wednesday night when you deal with that then you can deal with names cuz that's what this Bible is right this Bible is a look a book of names now your name might not be in there my name Samuel's in there but that don't make it too good you know so you don't want to go that line especially the boys don't want to go that line right you remember Samuel's Sons is the one that messed everything up so they certainly don't want me to claim that name Samuel yeah right and them be the sons of Samuel right but what did he say he said AR Nevil is not written in the Bible he said but what is happening at the time amen that arm Neville is on Earth is written in the Bible right this Bible is full of names and it's a record of what's going on during the time that name is here right amen right right all right so then if there's anything in there that I need purging out I need to get rid of the here all right right so we went through the Redemptive plan for the bride we went through the and hit it just a little bit of the foolish vergins how that she'll come up and be given eternal life all right we went through the F seal JW to see that those names will come up there and now we're talking about the life group of names that will be on Earth but don't go to the foolish don't go to the white Throne women down too quick cuz you're passing up because those names are here now right that are going to go to the white Throne right so all names is revealed while you and I here you and I are here in the Plan of Redemption right amen all right everybody that go to the white throne their name will be made on Earth first that's right before the white Throne so don't try to run that way with it just leave it and see we see these 144,000 and as we see them we we find out some other things about him that are uh really amazing of how God makes a promise keeps a promise but how he makes a curse and keeps that too that's right he never forgets his promises but he never forgets his curses amen we're seeing a little bit that Dan and Ephraim was taken away from the children of Israel as tribes that's right y M all right but were their names deleted or what happened right we talk about Redemption as I said this that we're talking about today in the next service or so is a foundation for going on into the seventh sealen so I would listen very carefully to the way that things are stated because I say them the way I want want to say it right and I mean it the way that I say it don't sum up and say brother Dale did you mean so and so no I said what I mean right now if I goof up in language you know that's no problems you know if I say 6,000 600 or whatever something like that that's you just to worry about that part of that silliness but let's get down to think about it all names to be revealed when this sick seal comes into being right right cuz that's the finish the finality of Redemption on this Earth will be done when these people that we're going to read about come to their Redemptive I said on earth now did you follow me yes see there is a foolish virgin to go to the white Throne that's later yes but their names are here here now right it won't be any extra ones added by right all now so we're talking about Redemption whether or not we can find our name if we can't find our name in the book then maybe it might not be in the book right right that's just amen carnal thought but it's true right I want to find my name brother said talking about it there about John he said God opened one of the seals to let John see his name well he said has your name been made known through the opening of these seals have you come into a Redemptive plan by the opening of God's word all right now let's just read something and take this a little talk and try to move on a little bit and and see something from this six seal remember now we're going over to Revelations 7 because that is the listing of the 144,000 that are to be sealed in the six seal all right go ahead brothers and pull it up now as we get to this I want you to remember names names see the world thinks that or some of the denominations think that this 144,000 is the bride of Christ M do you know but it says 12,000 from each tribe and it lists the tribes of Israel right oh we're spiritual Israel well that's all right yeah but I don't have to be connected to a tribe that's right right because now we can take most of these brothers here and show you there there's some pretty bad things going on yeah right right right Y what was the first was it Judah that took his father's wife one of them did Ruben took his father's wife lot of things them Fell's done yeah we don't want to be associated with right right Dan and Ephraim went after some golden caves that's right now that's not the story where Moses and the and the you know the making that's a different story in the Bible we don't want to do that especially when they had their names deleted under heaven but that's what we want to deal with how God can be so perfect that what he says is correct amen amen but what we think it says sometimes don't work out too good so we better change our thinking and get down to thinking about things all right this is Revelations 7 you can read all the way down and heard the number of them which were sealed and there were sealed 144,000 of the rbes of the children of Israel all right remember the names because that will be very vital in just a minute of the tribe of Judah were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Ruben was sealed 12,000 of the tribe of GAD was sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Asher was sealed 12,000 of the tribe of nepalm or how you pronounce these word you pronounce them I can't were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Manasses were sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Simeon sealed 12,000 tribe of Levi sealed 12,000 Tri of isar was sealed 12,000 of the tribe of Zebulon were sealed 12,000 other tribe of Joseph were sealed 12,000 right of The Tribe of Benjamin were sealed 12,000 MH now I said remember names so with this incident in Revelations 12 I mean 7 Dan is not listed and uh according to the Bible Manasses was not a son of Joseph right or Jacob excuse me he's a son of Joseph right okay see we just take brother brandom and we'll just quote and then we don't get into the Bible to see what it's saying that's right amen true we so d EP was the two that was left out Ephraim was not a son of Jacob he's the son of Joseph well do we need to know this I don't know go to sleep we'll wake you up the service is over but God keeps his promises that's right we want to deal with that don't we but he also keeps his curses why in this reading of Revelation 7 is Dan missing and manasse put in what happened okay you said well I don't know about that well okay we'll just go back let's go to Genesis now and remember now Manasses remember Dan's missing out of this back it back down make sure you read the names correctly you don't find Ephraim listed here you only find the missing of Dan and Manasses put in well I just read what brother well why don't you read the Bible that's where you got it that's right now let's read the sons of Jacob cuz we think that's a sons of Jacob but gassis is not a son of Jacob he's a son of Joseph that was a son of Jacob amen now let's read in Genesis let's pick this up and it says and the sons of Jacob were 12 that's good Reuben Simeon Levi Judah isar zebulun Joseph and Benjamin y Dan netha Gad Asher so now when you start juggling things around you have to know where you going that's right Joseph look at the next quote so everybody will know it the sons of Joseph after their families was manasse and Ephraim right okay so remember that that's the sons of Joseph not the sons of Jacob Joseph was the son of Jacob right but why in The Book of Revelations is Dan missing when we read here that it's 12 tribes of Israel and we read in Revelations there was 12 tribes of Israel yet all at once God has taken out Dan and he's placed manasse in this place why what what's happening right so let's read something about it I want you to remember these things cuz some things are going to be said to today that are going to be driving points for ler all right go ahead to the next one this is on the seventh seal the prophet of God speaking paragraph 225 now all when he called them over there the 144,000 they were missing that's right you talking about Dan and Ephraim right they're not even numbered in there and Joseph and Levi is put in the place of Dan and Ephraim brother why are you dealing with Joseph and Levi being put in and Joseph and Levi were the children of Jacob that's right going make a beautiful story in just a minute now we can look out right there it's before you here God's promise way back there hundreds and hundreds of years before that now what happened they were purged now remember he's speaking of Joseph and Levi and Dan and Ephraim right listen to it and here God's promise way back there hundreds and hundreds of years before that now what happened they were Pur during the time of the awful tribulation perod now God's going to purge that that virgin that was a good woman foolish virgin you know but she just failed to get oil in her lamp and he's going to purge her through persecution in there he puts them tribes yep right in there for the same thing and purges them during the time of the tribulation period because it's a purging it's judgment but you see they now whether or not you've ever studied the Bible enough to know and a lot of people don't do that cuz they just say well I just read what brother Rand said but remember he got to be a word Prophet amen yes sir problem Sol amen so if you take out Dan and Ephraim and you put in Joseph and Levi and you got 12 what are you going to do with Dan and epan when we're going to reading the same Bible when we get to it that Dan and EP is put back in right right I've asked this question to many ministers and they you know they kind of shrug me as an intellectual that's all right I thought we needed intellect U I'd like to swap with some of you in brain capacity I surely would be an intellectual I've got a ninth grade education but the word of God is perfect amen amen now you got 144,000 listed in Revelation 7 and here you got 144,000 listed but you got a problem with dealing with two more tribes so you got 144,000 plus 24,000 now what are you going to do with that 24,000 did we read it right in one group you got Dan and Ephraim missing and the other group you got Dan and Ephraim which we'll read in a little bit Ephraim is not listed in Revelation 7 we know that but we'll get back to it in a minute don't worry about it what are you going to do with another 24,000 I've ask that question to people because I'm serious if it says one time Dan and Ephraim is taken out and then it says another time Dan and Ephraim is put back right say Dan and ephra taken out and Joseph and Levi put in and then Joseph and Levi taken out and Dan and ephra put back but before that gets to where they put back cuz they're not even deleted at the point you got Joseph his two sons that will come in which will be manasse and Ephraim that's not a contradiction in the Bible there perfect order amen perfect tribal order but it's dealing with what's taking place and when you're dealing with what's taking place then you can see things all right now so he said he puts those tribes them tribes in there for the purgy Now where's Dan and from going get their purging if we find them in the millennial Reign right back in with the children of Israel cuz you see you're dealing with a prophecy MH and Dan and Ephraim is left in all the records of the Old Testament you don't find a scripture that say Dan and Ephraim was deleted see we just take a story from blood randam and we just summarize a Theory Y and we think we know what we're dealing with I just asked that simple question I'm an intellectual y boy I'm smart but I mean how much education does it take to take 144,000 that's 12,000 of each tribe 144,000 and then you got two more tribes to deal with and that's 24,000 and Josiah can figure that out for us right that deals with 144,000 plus 24,000 right but we know all about Redemption do we that's one of always try to tell people see they get after me about like Daniel 70 weeks yeah of why I preached it like I did they think Daniel 70 weeks is a confusing Doctrine I just laid something out in front of you that is very confusing see ever Doctrine in the Bible is confusing until it's revealed the new birth is a confusing matter in the prophet's message I can show where you were he said did he Reed it in the Woodshed show you were he was running down a railroad track different things not contradictory no right I'm not that stupid like the people this message are doing now that's right amen he says one day I conclusively prove that you're born again and then baptized into the body yes then another time he says you're baptized into the body that's a new birth every Doctrine in the Bible is confusing until it's revealed right one God is a vastly confusing thought until the world is deceived by the doctrine of the trinit concept that's right God in three person Blessed Trinity there's no such thing in the Bible amen that's right nowhere in the Bible is there Trinity spoke of right yet millions of millions of people today believe in it that's right right then here you come in the message oh we're supposed to believe in it then you got two Souls Two Lords River Jordan that Jesus wasn't god Till The River Jordan then he finally become God then that left him and he just had to die come on everything is confusing until it's revealed amen yep probably said the only thing in the Bible that you didn't have to have a revelation of to be right he said was water baptism he said because anybody want to be able reading black and white but we didn't read black and white we took Father Son and Holy Ghost didn't because the Catholic Church taught us there right nobody in the Bible was ever baptized father son Holy Ghost show it to me right that's right am I can show you where the Catholic Church changed it yep by your own encyclopedias but yet we swear by the Bible said to be baptized into the name of Jesus Christ amen it don't say father son oh but Matthew 2 he said in the name singular of the father that's right you don't say names of father son Holy Ghost name singular right come on church amen where are we at right just all confusing until it's revealed that's right right so here we're dealing with something that's a very odd situation A puding in and a take it out a putting in the Tak it out now what are we going to do with it see we say that there's only one sin that we can sin to have our names removed and that's the blashe the Holy Ghost right poor Apostle Paul man's in bad shape he not only blasphemed y he caused others to blaspheme what he said am but God didn't destroy him no and didn't remove his name no right are we still in the Bible or are we dealing with man's ideas or intellectualism I'd like to know what intellectualism is if I'm an intellect to be able to quote brother Brom then you making brother brandom an intellect come on what's the matter listen Church let's just follow this line and I know I won't get done short let to see let's follow this line of Israel through the Bible we've established from Genesis 35 believe is what it was that Joseph had 12 sons Jacob excuse me so if I change the name y'all put it in the place I'm 72 years old I ain't forgot everything but there's a lot of things I have forgot so that's what the sons of Jacob was 12 right Reuben Simeon Levi Judah ezar jebin Joseph Benjamin Dan Ephraim G man Asher that was his offspring MH all right now let's go over to the next one and read something so I want you to watch some of these things and then it'll give you a key to be able to study the Bible yourself from it as a matter of fact I wish you'd just take the Bible and figure these names out cuz I've done hours of trying to get it all together to make sure itd match up now look what it says now Exodus 1 1-13 now these are the names of the children of Israel which came into Egypt every man in his household came with Jacob Now read the names Ruben Simeon Levi Judah ISC zein Benjamin D and NEPA Gad and Asher that's 11 see the Bible is perfect CU read the next verse and the souls that came out of the Lords of Jacob were 70 Soul for Joseph was in Egypt already the Bible answers this own question that's right there's only 11 Sons up here why Joseph was already there in Egypt you remember the story that his brother sold him into slavery right all right he goes down into Egypt now don't answer this cuz I'm going to pull a trick question okay just remain silent don't say nothing it'll be all right if I ask you how long was Israel under the bondage in Egypt Egypt 90% of you would say 400 years plus 30 for the rejecting you say that God caused the children of Israel to go down into Egypt for the trouble they were in but none of that's true that's right remember Joseph was sold and slave slavery about 36 37 of Genesis about 48 he comes back out Victorious I mean he's still in Egypt but he's Victorious that's why it only lives and then it says Joseph was in Egypt already see Joseph was sold to Egypt he becomes the number two man with the pharo right so when the Jacob goes to Egypt it is not for punishment it is because of the drought in the land that's right it was a Providence of God because Joseph had already had a dream that his family would bow before him how is God going to get that to work out he drives up the land we does what he wants to he has his ways of get things done that's right so he just drives the land up Jacob you got them boys they done told him that Joseph was killed by Lind or an animal ate him up you know they don't tell him they sold him they thought they'd never have to deal with him and they went away sneakers he said we going to vow for him we took care of him yeah yeah so Joseph goes down to Egypt as a slave right right parer's wife accuses him incorrectly they throw him in jail not only a slave right and probably would have killed him had it not been for the Providence of God because what would you do when a man's wife saying he's trying to rape me right right well that's what Fifer's wife said but because of the dreams of Joseph in prison and the other people with dreams we know the story he was taken from prison and interpreted Pharaoh's dream and told him what was going to happen to Egypt how that there'd be so many years of drought so many years of plenty and then there be so many years of drought he said what you need to do now Pharaoh you need to set somebody over that to kind of handle this situation well you know old Pharaoh was a smart man all them Pharaoh's wasn't dummies and all of them wasn't white either they've been Black Pharaohs in Egypt come on folks Egypt and Africa side by side they've been Black Pharaohs in Egypt on their records they wasn't dummies well trained listen Pharaoh said okay you the God has figured this thing out you told me what the dream was Y and you remember the story to show you how profit Works he called in all of the susers and says tell me the dream tell me what this dream is they said tell the dream tell the dream and we'll tell you what it is well that been man's idea that's right Pharaoh said how do I know you know yeah he said you tell me the dream and then I'll know whether you know the dream or not nobody couldn't do it cut her throat here goes old Joseph he goes up and he tells him the dream and he tells him the interpretation that's in God's Providence right right there going to be seven years of plenty then seven years of drown of things and said all right so Joseph is exalted to number two man over Egypt right he has the signant of the king the Pharaoh you remember right everybody had to Bow the knee to Joseph just as well as they did to Pharaoh cuz he was in charge the children of Israel if you understand what I'm getting at never went into bondage because of their corruption that's what we think sure they did a lot of times but not this time they went down there for the Providence of God to be worked out God's word going to be fulfilled yeah I want one scripture that they were sent down there because of their are the quotes from The Prophet but we going to read one in a minute it's going to show you where it's at but see they go down and Joseph he's already down there so now here goes Jacob trying to find out corn to live you know and the things I'm not going through the whole story of how they put the things in there and got them to bring finally Jacob comes down you remember the brothers come and they find out oh J starts talking to him he said oh he going to kill us now he said God done this to preserve life right read your Bible said his daddy still alive and doing well they said yeah said go get him when they came down there with Joseph come down went out to meet his family he' already had his little wife in The Palace that was the Gentiles one of these days he revealed himself to those Jews we're going to be at the marriage supper while he's taking out but now listen so he goes down and he says Joseph Pharaoh does you put him over there he gave him Goan what about a king that thought that much of a man yeah cuz he just saved his whole Kingdom he just preserved all of Egypt and said you got Yan most wonderful land it could ever be he gives it to him Israel don't go to Egypt as slaves no Joseph is down there to make sure but you see when they get set up there he gives them all of the land he gives everything y as he does then what happens the most work out to Exodus 31 I think was it wasn't that the one we was on yeah he was in Egypt already all right now I'm doing a lot of this to save time and you think I ain't because the same story is told in in uh as we'll go along it's a repeat a lot of times this same story is told in Genesis 468 through 24 you got a lot of repeats in there so I chose to pull out a few of them keep Bend this much time but now watch they don't go down there as slaves right they're the number two people in Egypt but what happens you've heard run around state so let's go on up and do it look at verse 8 now this is after quite a while Israel has enjoyed freedom in Egypt right under Pharaoh Joseph is the number two man over Egypt amen and his people is was in charge with everything just about it but here's what happens verse 8 said and There Rose a new king over Egypt which knew not Joseph right now by this time want you get some time elementes Along by this time Joseph is dead Joseph died in Egypt how long was he in Egypt 430 years every son of Joseph I mean excuse me every son of Jacob died in Egypt not under bondage you remember Joseph said we're going out of here one day take my bones with you that's right don't bury me here in Egypt he wanted to be buried in the promised land right that's right all right but every son of Jacob died in Egypt and probably even Ephraim and Manasses right I didn't have time to correctly check it but I'm 98 99% sure even ephan and Manasses died in Egypt now watch man rose up and didn't know Joseph jph mes has done g y and he said to his people this people the children of Israel are more mightier than we now they go under bondage when the king rose up that didn't know Joseph Israel went under bondage roll it on up and read come let us deal wisely with him L they multiply to come to P that they're fth out any war and they going like under the other sides and different things you know but there are rad of King that didn't know J fa verse 13 wrote it on up and the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with Vigor in other words they put them under bondage they started killing them they started making them work they started killing all the babies but remember Joseph Ephraim Manasses Dan isachar Benjamin all of them are dead they die in Egypt wait a minute now we're going yeah you going to read that here but you better remember what just said they were done there 400 years you say why we don't even study the Bible we study a quote Yeah a thought God never sent Israel to Egypt as slaves in this incident there's other incidents he did he put them at pharaoh and things but not in this case he sent them down there as his is real roll up the next one number 58 acts 7 and6 read the whole backward and forth look and God spake on this wise that the seed his seed should sojourn didn't say bondage right sojourn in a Strange Land that they should bring them into into bondage and in treat them evly for 400 years notice and that they should bring them into bondage they didn't go into bondage to start with come on they went down there they were victorious amen that's what happened with the church come on folks until she sold herself into bondage right that's what's wrong today right come on man all right now that was the people that went into Egypt I deleted one thing I can give them to you where it says you know this was the people that went down to Egypt we read that one cuz there another one God does a lot of things double when he does he means it but when they come up out of Egypt look what happens number six and when the children of Israel shall pitch their tents now they're out of Egypt they're not in Egypt they've come out who's going to come out and what are they going to do right and every man by his own Man by his own count I want you to notice something very carefully he never calls him a tribe until later come on what I said you go in here and you get to studying this thing you going to find out a lot of things you're going to find hours of searching scriptures to see why they were not called tribes they were called the children of Israel they're coming out of Egypt and they're going through the Wilderness and this is the way they're going to Camp okay y why would it start off real quick but the Levites she pitch round about the Tabernacle of testimony y now God's going to show his Providence more than just Joseph's Providence was it his children his brothers and Daddy and things technically I think his mother had already passed on I'm not certain really on that and if you think it is that's all right I'm not arguing I'm just making the point they were to Bow before him they did in Egypt but finally God sent Moses down to deliver the children of Israel right he brings them out as we read up there a while ago what going to send them down didn't the Bible said he's going to bring him out with a mighty hand Mighty hand was Moses with a stick it wouldn't no African Invasion to set them free I read that because it's right the next country right watch now when they starting to get out of Egypt and get out in the wilderness they're going to set up camp y but the Levites shall pitch around the Tabernacle of the testimony and we can draw out a big drawing and show the way they count and we will read here how they count they count three three three and three is that M multiplication and what that turn out to be three and three and three and three according to my understanding that's 12 right but automatically he's already saying the Levites is not going to be out there right the Levites going pitch next to the Tabernacle so you would have three three three and two and one second here and that that won't work right so now we're going to find a beautiful story that God meant to come into being but the Levites shall fit round about the Tabernacle of testimony for there be no wrath upon the congregation of the children that there be no wrath upon the children conation the children of Israel that's why he puts them there why they they won't be in Wrath all right why the Levites who's the Levites the preachers right come on and the Levites are priesthood and the Levites shall keep the charge of the Tabernacle of testimony and the children of Israel did according to what the Lord told him okay now we go to numbers one which is continual reading I was right numbers one this is numbers two excuse me amen right and the Lord sping MOS and Aaron saying and every man of the children of Israel shall teit by his own standard with the inside of their father's house far off about the Tabernacle far off around it the Tabernacle congregation shall they pitch now remember the story as Paul Harvey says page two page one we found all of the descendants of Jacob as Leaders Dan and all of them and even Joseph descendants passed away in Egypt so when we read Ruben down here of Judah this is not Judah this is his descendants right right right of his tribe going to pick up tribes in a minute right judah's not die he done dead this God is not there he done dead this is his descendants I thought what you thought you don't get to plan the Plan of Redemption man that's right come on and on the east side and watch these three three three three and on the east side toward rise of the sun till they of the standard of the camp of Judah right they through out their armies and then it named who his captain is okay and his host is all right numbers them all right now next is what who's going to count with Judah isachar and zebulun every ready pronounce them that's right there your three y East Side roll it on up get their numbers here comes the Southside tell me the standard of the camp of Ruben according to third armies he names her captains he name how many they are and who counts with it Simeon okay and he had pre and pre keep on what I'm doing going around building it all the way around rolling up that's done C to east and south here hold it right there because watch it's telling you what's going to take place then the Tabernacle of the congregation Shall Set forward with the camp of the Levites Levites not a tribe the priesthood that's right the Levites in the midst of the camp as they Camp so here's the Levites in the middle we done covered south and east right here's the West on the West Side Verse 18 standard to the camp of Ephraim what's he doing in there ephra is not a son of Jose of Jacob what's he doing in there and who count with him manasse m manasse is not a son of Jacob you see the word's perfect am other when he goes with him is Benjamin now I like that part if you notice Ephraim is the bad guy and he needs some good help to get clean so we get Benjamin with him that's just a little thought we make sure we give him Benjamin roll it on up that's the west side we covered east south west and here's on the North side the old guy that everybody thinks is a bad egg and the standard of the camp of dance shall be on the North Side by their armies and they go with him AER goes with him nepin goes for him keep Rolling Y but where's the Levites but the Levites were not numbered now we're reading the Bible the Levites were not numbered among the children of Israel as the Lord commanded Moses right so draw it out in front of you Levites in the middle that's where the word's at that was where the worship was at right they move all of the parts of doings the temple I mean the the Tabernacle they guard the word but around them is three three man stop missing is e missing no come on see now what are you dealing with now whether you like it or not you got 14 Nam to be dealing with right come on 12 and M ephra and Manasses put in so you take out Levi he ain't going to be numbered and you put him in the middle of the camp now you got 13 oh oh we don't like 13 13 the Levites in the middle Dan and Ephraim manasse and all of them is gathered around see Dan and ephra went after the golden C yet they were part of the original back over under yeah when they come out of Egypt remember when they come out of Egypt they come out and they make some golden CES this is a different story that's right then and Ephraim will eventually go after golden caves right but there they are 13 tribes Levites not being numbered standards of their camps and the things finally begins to call him a tribe right A Tribe cuz that's not Dan and Ephraim that's not Joseph and Leva that's not Reuben and Benjamin that is their descendants that carry their Insignia their sign of each camp and they become a tribe let me's see if I can find it well everybody should know the story but we'll get back over here Paul Harvey page 14 cuz they was originally to been we'll get this afternoon cuz I can't finish it man there was originally to have been 13 tribes that's correct God's providence am I'll read where the Prophet said if you don't believe it but we just read the Bible amen that tells you Dan and Ephraim is not missing there I want you to bring it to me where Dan and eph is missing in the Old Testament but see we think know the story Dan and E the story of what well that's just no intellectual stuff I can't understand tell me about Jesus would you mind naming them tribes off and get your 14 of them Y and would you mind taking Levi out and putting him as the priesthood but would you mind taking Joseph out and making him a type of chist right right cuz Joseph is missing out of the 13 tribes ephra manasse put in Joseph and Levi comes out there to us to have been 13 tribes where the levite was never to been a tribe right no he's the priest of he's to stay in the middle the others were to Camp around him but Joseph is missing amen Ephraim and manasse has been put in in the place of Levi and Joseph because Joseph is a type of Christ amen so we want to talk about Christ we can surely do it original plan of God to have 13 tribes you say oh that's an unlucky number that was God's plan and when they return in Ezekiel you will find them yep in perfect traval order with Dan and eph placed back in right so won be here this evening so we'll just tell you the story a little Dan and eph is finally taken out but they're not deleted because the Bible says you don't delete them under heaven their sin was to go after the golden caves that's right their name was removed under heaven but not in heaven right because in Ezekiel they'll come back in perfect order right but when they camp in perfect order in the Millennium it will be three three three three leave out in the middle and Joseph as being Christ right what a story want a story of redemption that's right so perfect you can deal with everything amen so perfect to see that God doesn't forget his Blessing right then and Ephraim is removed under heaven but the Millennium is heaven on Earth right and they're put back in that's how he deals with that other 24,000 we mentioned one ago let's year you deal with 24,000 yeah but I only know want to know about Jesus I thought I made a quote in there that there's no Redemption without Jesus right there's no salvation without Jesus no matter where it be Old Testament or new that's right he paid the price what do we need to know about Israel that's over under just remember they're going to be in the Millennium the prophecy that's right right well you know what with that attitude of not wanting to understand I better say me to make it where it would be without offending you I'm not going to be there if I don't want the Plan of Redemption because you know I plan on being in the Millennium amen and to know how they get there I find out how I get there that's right to know how they're purged I find out how I'm purged that's right why don't you just throw the Bible away in the prophet's message and going back to you junk see brother rand's message is in the Bible perfect in the Bible amen cuz that's where he got it from just because we don't understand it well brother I never heard this there suppos have been 13 tribes well in case you're not here this evening let me read it to you okay brother R says it the church AE book that in the Providence of God this is Page 269 he names them all down from Genesis he says these 12 sons descendant from the 12 tribes of Israel with the exception that Joseph did not have a tribe named after him for he in the Providence of far in the Providence of God there were to to be 13 tribes and Joseph's Sons were given the honor of bringing the 12 tribes to 13 amen come on where's perfect prophet's message is perfect am but do we understand the Plan of Redemption amen right why is Dan and EP taken out and how do they get back that'll be this evening and maybe Wednesday okay let stand come on mus I was been planning on getting this in one message but I deleted what I thought was copies a repeat to try to get a shorter version but think on these things the children look our Levites for the ministry of the day right the priesthood the 5old ministry according to Ephesians 4:11 they're regard the word of God man those Chums in the Book of Revelation is guarding that book of Acts that's right Matthew Mark luk and John guards the book of Acts right back there if you want to know in the book of Acts what it says go back and read Matthew Mark Luke and John then those guards guard that altar the fivefold ministry is guarding the altar of God right TR to tell us about Christ right what about what we got brother number number 61 in the spiral book
