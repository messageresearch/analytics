========================================

all right Victor I hope we we kind of you know did all the background in last Sunday afternoon but uh several of the ones that were not down here we really enjoyed it because they had not heard it before so we got some good comments about but this person that we're talking about this logos to me that logos is I want to say the most important there's not a most important in God but for understanding purposes to understand God the logos is the most important to me he said well it's not a man well the son of man was another manifestation it was the logos in that man so it's all and then you say well while the Son of God well that is the Son of God you know so so the logos is what carries all the way down through and when Jesus said I come from God and I go back to God I come from logos I go back to logos all right so and I was talking to uh somebody yesterday I mean bro Martin yeah brother marks this thing's not working again um hello working now I'm talking to brother Mark yesterday night when we talked when we think about logos don't think that the logos is some you know God just comes out and he's he's just you know he's just like you know you see ghosts in the in movies you know and there there's no there's no the form is just you barely see them and they don't look clear no this was a man this logos was a man this one he had substance he said was he in flesh listen that part I'm still studying because when brother Brown went across the curtain a time they were in some kind of Flesh they weren't spirits to stay like Casper the Friendly Ghost because remember brother Branham in his early Ministry and he said I'll be on a cloud floating by he said I can't shake brother Neville's hand because see he thought there was nothing there was when you think of spirit you think of something that walked through the wall now remember Jesus walked through the wall after his resurrection and he was in a flesh body glorified flesh body right right that's hard to understand but he just reached right on through the wall walked right on through and it didn't even bother him you know didn't bother anything and when brother Brandon went across the curtain a time that was probably one of the most striking things that that came to him was number one they were in all their senses and number two they were in some form you say well is it flesh no it's not the flesh they lived in down here obviously but it is something that's got some substance because when he hugged those women he said they have breasts so there was a form when they hugged him there was something hug him it wasn't that they went like this and you know right when they he said they were real to me that's the most real part of you is that part yeah that's what I've always said about Paul when when man chopped Paul's head off he didn't have to pick his theophany head up when he went across in the sixth Dimension he didn't have to go looking for his head and put it back on no he just he just disconnected from this body and stepped over into that sixth Dimension that theophany being more real or stronger than this body all right that you see here but remember there is some when we say a form of God it's not a form that you look and it's real fuzzy and that's man's idea of what a ghost is or or a spirit when we say God is a spirit we first thing we think of is we go well you can see through him and now that's not true because remember in the Garden of Eden whatever form God was in he killed two animals ripped the skins off of their body and gave them to Adam and Eve so he was in some form of a I'm not gonna say flesh but I'm gonna I have my ideal now I just hadn't found any there's no quote where brother Brown said yeah your name but he was in some form that was hard enough to where he killed that lamb she's pulled and brother Brown said pull the skins off of that lamp he didn't just go all right Liam you die and God's not no he didn't do that Bible said and brother Brown said God pulled the skins off of those animals and give them to Adam and Eve Adam and Eve didn't do it God did it so there was some form of god so let's not look at this logos and look at the logos and say well it was some you know some floating ghost or even if he was in a form of a man no I believe he was a solid human being saying whatever you want to say it okay that's what he was he was gone if if Adam was made in His image what was he he's a man right okay so in the beginning was the word see remember Heaven and Earth will pass away now remember brother Brown remember when he goes in the future home when that word passed away pass away doesn't mean God's going to annihilate it right he's going to clean it off because remember it's part of the original creation uh my idea on this is like brother Dale said last week my Revelation on this Wednesday night my Revelation is is that everything that God created is going to stay here it's Eternal you say Earth all it's going to do is be cleaned off there's some part of this Earth that's that's the heat trans and eternal form to it if not then God would annihilate it and create a new one because the Bible says I created a new Heaven in A New Earth well then we had to have a Prophet come in go into that eagle anointing go up into the mind of God to really know that God didn't say I'm going to destroy the Heaven and Earth I'm just going to wipe the sin off just like me and you when you and I were born again he wiped the sin out of our life but same body okay and then it's this same body is going to be glorified because the Bible says those who he has Justified he's already glorified all right we just are not in that condition yet right because remember Jesus was slain before the foundation world I read it Sunday afternoon Jesus was slain before the foundation of the world right but he literally had to do it down here brother Brown said in God's mind it was already over right but it had to come down here and take on this because this is what he put Adam and Eve in and they fell okay so in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God that doesn't anymore explaining in the beginning was this logo the logos was with God because it was a part of God and the Word was God so the logos was God period but in that logos like I said about the logo you can say McDonald's period well in your mind in my mind if you wrote down everything we thought about McDonald's from the beginning if you went back through history but see you got to go through every day I was thinking yesterday you know how great God is and we can't understand him I was eating cashew out of a can and I put that cashew in my hand and I said God you knew you can take me back and show me the soil that this came out of oh you think you think you can I really could if you listen to Who's That Smell Casey like brother Dale said last night we were listening to him he said God is infinite that means he has no limitation that's right if I could take that one cashew that I'm getting ready to eat and God could go all the way back to the very soil that it came out of tell you what soil came up through what plant when they picked it and harvested it where it went and then it came to me that's just a piece of cashew what about everything we do anything we do God Is So in is infinite so how are we going to understand that right how are we going to understand but now remember watch this this was my next thought if we as humans got into God's Laboratory we actually didn't break into God's Laboratory you can't break into God allowed man through his intelligence his knowledge his human knowledge he has allowed because remember even in a fallen condition where God right brother I'm saying even a sinner is a Son of God by birth by natural birth so you have in your brain we only use 10 of it some of us more some of us less some of us brother raise them up just ain't gone thank you man I'm talking about me I'm talking about me oh you talking about you but what if we could use if we only use 10 and you see this what about if we used a hundred percent of our brain capacity what we could do Manhattan some men have have photographic memories where they can look at a page and then two days later in his brain he can bring it right back up and it looks just like that page to be read somebody like Albert Einstein was just so smart but what about God though but what about this I was I was looking at that at that cashew and I said well if you took this to a laboratory man could tell you the same thing man could take that back to and and through all their process of of chemicals they could run it back and at least tell you what field it came out of so see God God is is known that's talking to Mark brother Mark yesterday God is only known by what we know here isn't that right that's why we'll have a message to cheer when all this cloud of junk and we can use a hundred percent of our brain and it's the Mind literally the mind of God you say Liberty yeah I believe it's going to be literally mind of God comes to you in no limitation then we'll have a message of cheer that's when God will completely unfold but down here we're still limited Jesus was limited by his human brain right right he had to he had to do things humanly because he was in a human body yeah he had a human brain right but the god the logos was living in that in that body telling it what to do so man has actually a Satan Satan has imitated God but he can't create well that's what I was thinking I looked at that cashier and I said well man can take it back so far but they can't take nothing that's what um my brother told me one time he said you know gone man did break into God's laboratory or God allowed him to come into God's laboratory and the guy was using an analogy and it's kind of funny where a man walks up the guy and says we can do the same thing you do and then he turns to start to do something and God says okay you go ahead and said I want you to create it first I want you to create it first in other words he said no you can't use my creation right you got to create it first and then do what you need to do with it you can't use mine if you're going to be that kind of a god you can't use my creation you got to do the own creating and then you can go down but instead that's where man has to stop the only creative powers in God Almighty himself okay and we see that it was manifested in the squirrels and the things that brother Brown spoken to listen but that's just not for him that's for all of us that's for us to have the mind of God is to have the Creator that's right the logos the Creator and you say well when's it coming well it should have came right down here but our problem is in our spirit realm we clog up the clues and don't allow the Holy Spirit to work like it should at work but in the beginning was the logos and the logos was live God and the love us was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lion man all right and then what did that logos do that logos began to what created remember the difference in Us in God we can have a thought and it not develop that's right right we have a thought in our mind and it not develop or we have a thought in our mind about how we're going to go down this road here and then things change but remember when a thought comes in God's mind it immediately has to become to pass because he can have another thought brother Graham said he can't have another thought because his thoughts are Eternal his dog come right down from thought into speech and just just like that you know all right but remember we're going to cover this a little bit later when we get down to where the new birth coming into us later down the road by that Son of God is we have to be careful about you say well I have the mind of Christ or the mind of God that's right but you still have your human brain yeah you still got your Humanity even Jesus had the part of that brain that he had that was born from Mary not my will but thou will be done let this cup pass for me in other words the form that he was in as a human he wanted to live his body wanted to live right but he knew but what happened though our problem is is we go well we uh we don't want to die so we don't we're not going to do that right but Jesus there's no way he could overcome that there's no way he could he could because remember in the Garden of Eden is I mean in The Garden of Gethsemane kind of kind of strange and then the garden it it was overthrown and in the garden it was overcome yeah right in the Garden of Eden it was overthrown by Satan and The Garden of Gethsemane it was overcome but brother Ryan said he didn't overcome on the cross he overcame In The Garden of Gethsemane right that's where the devil's fought him at once he got through that he was finished it was done but what it was not his he yielded everything he was in other words listen to this he had no nature but the nature of God we have a human nature that we have to fight right I don't mean just tempted I mean fight we have to fight that part amen Jesus didn't have to fight that part of being born in sin Shaker than iniquity a spouse from his mother's womb a liar I don't uh I don't think Jesus did not have battle but it was Battle of Satan trying to get in remember Satan's already in him that's right with us he then he got the brain God got the heart if God's down here Satan's still up here all right so and that's not really getting on the logos but it is that Logan said was standing there that said let there be remember all that was in Batman the called the logos or the or the word with everything that we need as human beings that's why I said the logos is very important because see now we can understand and as we as we look at like we're talking about McDonald's McDonald's isn't it is 75 years old it's a week to write everything about that logo if we wrote every day they sold how many billions and billions of hamburgers we'd have to write him one of them now they put the pickles in you understand what I'm saying if you wrote it down to try to understand what that logo is might be a book you know I fill up a computer a huge computer but if you see that logo you immediately know that what's behind it that's right is that that's right the hamburger the great Croc and the employees in the building and the parking lots see you see all the little intricate things that could be written down but we look at that logo same thing with the logos now to understand God like I said before if we within the ocean field and where the sky Apartments made we couldn't write the love of God we couldn't write what all this logos was in a volume of a book that's right amen amen but he condensed it into 66 chapters so that we can actually carry it with us now you know we can take Don this is the mind of God right all right and in here though remember in here though are some things that God thought of not what God is because Judas is in here Judas was never in the mind of God eternally as a thought he was thought of yeah so you got to separate those two Sinners are thought of that's why everybody can be saved because the sinner is thought of of God but the only reason I don't like going to do is just melt yesterday last night you go back and and you see where some people have that Seed doctrine and you can understand that but what you got to do is you gotta I've tried to explain it a couple of times and some preachers just look at you but remember brother Brown was picking up the mind of God and he was telling you in the mind of God you always was eternal you never sinned a day in your life in the mind of God he's come up to the mind of God he's working in that realm and God is telling you and where you come from where you are where you're going right but now as a preacher he's got to say now your eternal life begins at the altar or or I saw one the other day where you know one preacher he said I always was an eagle brother Brown said you always was an eagle but I also got two quotes from Brother Branham told that story and in the when he come up to the end of the sermon he was calling an altar call he said do some of you chickens want to become Eagles when I thought you always wasn't ill that's where you you get confused if you don't understand in the mind of God sure you always wasn't evil amen you always was a Son of God Amen and the only way you can be born again is because God knew you wanted it and he put it already up there it's already there it's like being like the brother said about Jesus he was crucified in the mind of God that covers everything but he had to come down through that though and do it down here because here's where the the sin happened to cause that remember sin started in heaven with with the devil but they came down to the Earth in this and then they committed the act so Jesus had to come down to the Earth in this to take away that but in the mind of God it was already done but remember you gotta think of this if God thought of it it had to happen that's right that's right so he didn't just think of of of the crucifixion in his mind if he thought of it it had to come to pass right when Isaiah said he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity see that was in the beginning was the word so the word come from the mind thought the speech and when Isaiah said that that meant that a literal man named Jesus had to be put on the cross and crucified you see what the word does the word brings a filter yeah brother Brown said what filter everything through the word through the filter of the word Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive well God don't you think I knew that before the foundation of the world that's the way you set it up and let me tell you something else to be and and brother Branham really did a good job of of trying to settle the fear from the people that's why he would say if you're born again you always worry Eternal or if you were in the mind of God you're going to come somewhere but remember if you and I believe that who we are that where the children have died then we have to go back and believe what God said about it amen no what man said what word says there's therefore now no condemnation where is our condemnation usually it's from one person to the next hello usually yes when you get that it's usually one person to the next what's this from thinking about me or this one said something about me or what you're doing you're condemning yourself I like that old analogy that that you you know you you think people talk about you and you spend 80 percent of your life worrying about what other people said and other people spend 80 percent of their time not even worrying about who you are and what you're doing right right you know you got your own stuff to work I don't want to worry about my 20 percent I ain't gonna worry that's why I don't I used to I used to I used to bother me a certain things did but don't bother me anymore because remember it must not bother God he don't get nervous you don't have a nervous breaking down at all you know Monica has already seen it happen so remember this logos whatever he speaks it's already been a thought and that thought's Eternal and it's getting ready to be expressed so God has to come step over into that form called below God to be for us to be able to understand like the McDonald's to come into that one logo now all the marketing that McDonald's has done as soon as we see the golden arches boom we we in our mind we go back to all these different things that we know about McDonald's right how many different stores they got you know you all that same way we got when we see the when I see now where it's talked about even when it talks about the word and the Word was made flesh that Love Gospel has made what a human Fletch and dwelt Among Us right it was made flesh anytime I see the word the word the word the word Heaven Erica pass away but the logos or the word will never pass away all right what happens is that logos what it does is it brings it right back because it's the Creator right it says right here all things were made by him who logo the logos is the creator amen amen excuse me and the life comes through the father and the father and the logos is the same person right but we can't understand father we can't understand that volume of the book of McDonald's that started 75 years ago in all the days of her life and and how that you know God could take a peanut that goes to California and trace it all the way back to Georgia and what planet came out of and what part of the soil coming together to make it you understand what I mean yes see to me we don't have to worry about that that's right God's already worried about it not me in other words what to say worry God's already he already took care of that now of course he knows what choice we make we can't ever take Choice out of this right right it's all our choice from the day we were born to the day we die Adam and Eve had choice and made choices before and after but in other words before the fall and after the fall they still brother Brown said God never took away free moral agency all right so we're still afraid but remember he knows what you choose that's why I said many times if he knows that I'm not going to ever love people like I should he's not going to give me brotherly kindness and he saw that for one of the nomination of the world because of me not because of him because of me he made the provision for us to get this right the provision is there actually the one that's inside of you is that really kindness but you as a human with a free moral agency your gods God knew that you'd never loved somebody like you really should so he's not going to give you brother counters and he definitely is not going to jump my brother around him had to preach this there's no way that you can jump around any of these you got to do it just like it says building goes all the way up and and remember all this comes out of the Soul into the spirit this is the spirit realm remember Faith or doubts the only two things in your soul Faith or doubt right yes baby that's right so what does this do this comes into the spirit Realm there's nothing to do with this with the body right nothing this has nothing to do with your physical human flesh body right it's just there it does what's inside right but these come from the new birth my brother being born again these have to be birthed into your spirit realm because your your spirit's not born again we wish if not your spirit's not born again so in your spirit around memory reason conscious affection I'm going to preach a sermon on that one day because all these come out of memory reason why are you have a temper it comes from your memory reason conscious affection affection and Imagination that old thing imagination there's that thing we talk about imagination but all this comes out of there because what does your imagination do you can't love bro a brother because you think he talked about you or you think something that's your imagination are your memory reminds you that he did something two years ago to you that you can't get on and you reason in your human brain that he's a dog so it all works when memories and conscious affection affection affection because remember this is divine love that has nothing to do with video love this is agape love okay we still have feel your love here that's right everybody shake their head right we still have feelings even when this comes I believe brother Brown has this Divine love because he was adopted he still had feel your love he didn't stop loving his wife he just stop loving the people he didn't stop loving his kids right right so you see where we're going with this the logos to me when you say now that word logos we ought to be able to understand at least what it is at least we ought to understand that it's everything that you and I need to know down here to get us over I don't want to say up there over into another dimension okay because remember everybody's all this Doctrine about perfect love and what is perfect love perfect love brother Brown says everybody in that sixth Dimension had one thing in common they were black-headed redheaded Chinese black whatever he said they had one thing in common they all had perfect love one is perfect love the new birth that's right the new birth is perfect love then you grow into the perfect part but the new birth so the only thing those people had in common in the sixth Dimension was they all were born again they were all born again on this Earth they come from all different walks of life that one lady was 90 years old now she's a young lady she was in that perfect love so that sixth Dimension is all just for the people this morning in so to me simply the perfect love is the born against Mary yeah even in this baby form you get born again today and die tomorrow you go in the sixth Dimension just like brother Brown's in the sixth Dimension right amen right Paul Irene is awesome even even Luther right but Luther didn't take his Pub drinking and smoking into that Dimension right because that little guy said was inside it never did that what happened was his human filter couldn't filter that out see God was trying to work back up through here brother Brown said what he didn't have enough word quickened to him the word was that he just didn't have enough in other words he couldn't stand and talk about the logos like me and you talked about the logos now because there's no he was under the what the man anointing which was a little bit higher but the man can't see there's a wall there man can't see over it but man an eagle can go way up and see all the way around so that's what you and I under the eagle anointing we can see things that even that even Paul couldn't see that even Paul couldn't see that's right Paul said I'll look through a glass Darkly listen we're not supposed to lift the glass Darkly in this age that's right right this is the open book The Clarity of the word Paul was looking at a closed book too many people and to his self because he was prophesying but you and I when we come up to the open book when the book's open when John eats the book he eats a whole book amen any pages and leaves up went on the floor he'll leave me a leftovers he didn't leave it he didn't get hungry and full and at least I'm on the table not eat the whole book so that but what it was was what it was was is that logos came down was was the logos came down God himself Christ had to be here when that angel was on Earth so they could connect and what crash can't be hearing human flesh so he used a human flesh called William Branham hey son of man I'll be son of man to deliver the message so that you and I can see what we're seeing now that's right and to me that's just as simple as the whole message is a man told me one time and it really I think both T3 he said this message this message now remember this message is not getting born again and even living to hear it it's the Son of God Revelation we're going to talk about that maybe next Sunday right everybody I said everybody Paul called this back to First Churchill way back right down here come all the way through here but we are up into a like I said in the eagle anointing that's true but bro T3 made it real simple he said this message was sent for preparation and that's it to prepare a people to take a body chain right because everybody every everybody that has a new birth down through here had a part of these and couldn't understand the word of God for their day the word was quickened you can't get born again without the word being quicker so they had the word quickened in their heart for their time right right so what makes this different brother Brown's message was for Preparation it was to prepare us for a body change because nobody else needs to be prepared during that ages this was the last stage this is the part of the body chain so that's what this message the message in the hour was brought for Preparation to get us ready see all these other messages got the people what brother Brown said got them born again they live a good Christian life and they die right right even brother Brown said go on with the same simple message live a good Christian Life what's he telling them live a good Christian life because that message in 1963 of the seals wasn't even for that group of people that's great do you think they understood it no no they didn't understand it he was actually giving it for me and you that's right because in the days of the boys he had to go off the scene so the voice could come who was the voice same logos that said let there be it's the same person that now speaking in the days of the voice when I hear in the days when I see that in the days of the boys I really don't think of brother round sure he's the sure he's worth but remember his one voice is 1100 sermons and they've got all kinds of doctrines of that right so it's not the literal voice of that seventh angel everything he wrote we understand no wrong answer everything he wrote we all have the same Doctrine right no but in Revelations 10 John took the book from what the angel Christ you didn't take it from the seventh angel messenger he took it from the angel Christ Christ is the only right one he's the only he's the only one that's got the full anointing of the message right it's not saying brother Brown Don't the Phil he came through I was thinking about last night I thought brother round if you'd have just said a few more words it would have done away with this doctor and if you'd have said a few more words but you know what Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood yep walked off the stage right he said unless you believe I am he you'll die in your sins and he walked off the stage he didn't go back and explain it why because the voice The Voice had to come back and explain it to me the logos is the voice because that's the true voice that's the one that is true when you hear Brother Branham you need to hear that logos that's behind that yeah right and he said it the way he was going to say it to confuse people he said it the way he was going to say it because if you you're looking at who's this melchized that you think man brother Brown Peter said about two more sentences you had to cleared up all this two Soul Doctrine or or I always was eternal Doctrine and not but see you got to remember it's all in the message it's all inside what he said it's all in there we just got to put it together yeah right but how do you put it together by the one that wrote it the one that wrote the Bible if he's in your brain and your soul and you let him get in your brain by the new birth then what will happen he'll speak to you he'll speak to you today he'll speak to you in the quietness of your room he'll speak to you even through the prophet when brother Brown says when I read it the other day the third person of the Trinity was the Holy Ghost now did that I mean did that just really make you nervous say oh brother no you run it through the filter and the filter says I know what he was talking about he said that for that that's what I'm saying he spoke the mind of God yet he spoke to humans you got to come to the Altar and be saved but you always was eternal that's just really confusing if you don't understand that God's telling us if we're born again that's where we came from but as human beings in the fall we got to come somewhere don't have to come to alter but we gotta come somewhere and accept what he's already done all right okay so let's go everything
