and all it's just we just keep praying and keep on keep on going going you know because that's what we need our wife you know Terrance announced it that she is going to have to go through two more tests or one test in two parts on this coming Monday and Tuesday and this past Friday she went through one test and they declared it said her major part of her problem was reflux and that's bad enough you know but you know they didn't find anything else or anything for him to talk about to be any worse and we appreciate that and praise the Lord would bless and they're supposed to put her through tomorrow a part of a test and the next day part of the test and tomorrow be a nuclear test to check in her heart out and the things because they they run those true and Tuesday they're gonna put her in a cubicle and send her to the moon and the reason they're doing that they won't know how she put up with me for 60 years and they figure if they can get that straightened out and find out how she done that they can save a lot of money by just putting people in the cubicles and send them to the moon you know they can do it from the easy way because to find out how she put up with me but I can say one thing with all of my heart I love her and I've had a good 60 years it's been a wonderful 60 years you say well have you got along all together we're still together well you know have you done this we're still together that's wonderful because that way you know if you're still together you know love has to be the binding factor to cover all the things I want to appreciate I'm doing it all and the lower gear yeah yeah we put him in put him in the middle between us both and it takes care of a lot of things okay amen that's you young people that are coming along starting in your married life in times just remember my brother he was going to do a or was getting married and he asked this old country preacher to do the wedding and then he thought well now that old guy he is he's just ain't nothing he's just old country preacher you know once it ain't got no sense at all and so they went over to talk about getting married and the preacher said well son said I want to explain something too he said marriage is like this and when you and your wife said you you have problems sometimes so the best thing to do is just throw a rope across the house and said then if you get older one inch you gets hold on the other one said it won't do nothing but this is exact he said just lay down you're in walk around the house get her by the hand and walk off of the rope and everything will be all right he said I left thinking that guy was a smart in the world so that's the way we change things by what we do they meant just keep those things in mind keep her in mind tomorrow and Tuesday all right father we thank you for your grace and thank you for your loving Time Lord that we've had the grace that has been extended upon to each and every one of us that Lord you would bring us into your word you would open our understanding to the things of the message of the hour that you'd reveal yourself to us and that you've got us through all of these things we love you and we thank you and we commit everything to you now just come and speak to us from thy word because we believe your word and we thank you in Jesus name first Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever on it now we go over to 2nd Peter to pick up our thought verse 1 Simon Peter servant and apostle of Jesus Christ to them who have obtained him that have attained like precious faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ grace and peace be unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord according and is a divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through 1 now we're gonna be talking about it through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this given all diligence add to your faith virtue and to virtue knowledge and the knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and to patience godliness and to godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word and we tried to cover a point this morning anyway just was doing basically preaching you know my style because of what we were trying to bring but I hope it opened up some to your understanding of what we're trying to do in studying the Word of God and letting us know more about what the faith of the fathers is and what to expect in this day because this is the day when all things are to be made manifest all right so this is the time there was not an age until now to word that it would be that God could come on the scene and bring his word sure he was there through the ages he was there in every age he was there to bring the word of that age and all that but he could not bring the fullness of the word until this life age all right because that was the scriptures to promise that he would do it he said I will restore so he was you know bound to do that then you have he had to wait until the end time to bring everything into the right position place or whatever to where it could be brought forth because you couldn't bring it forth back in other ages you would have to have the opening of the word all right and that's what I hope you're listening to because as I said this morning now we talked about the faith of the fathers we talked about the statue of a perfect man the things like that and those disciples were writing what God was present in their time and they were writing the Word of God all right see it's not to just talk about a good thing or to it is to actually see that the word was unveiling itself they're to her that it would would be the very top post that would anchor everything all the way down through and would wind up all the ages in the things and see if Peter dam was writing the word we're in the time of the revealing of the word alright they were writing the word the the understanding of the scriptures the thing they were writing that down as God led them alright see now we are the people that can read that knotted it changed in between it was down to the ages you had the same writings but you did not have the Holy Spirit to you had to hold the spirit for each age don't misunderstand but it was not able to express through those ages through what it's been able to do in this life days because the promise of the coming of the prophet is for this age at this time so you had to wait God waited we'll get to it in patience you know that God had patience he waited patiently on a time to where he could bring his word and declare it and bring it forth and now we're into the position of the opening of the word the revealing of the word the making alive of the word that get to Poland coma when Peter when when those when the apostles when the prophet sometimes wrote the Word of God alright now it was alive to them what they wrote about was alive it wasn't just a even though Paul would say you'd be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye to him that was alive but he could not attain unto it because of having to wait until the end time but still he could see it and understand it to be off in the future and he did because he said they must need to be this and things all these things must happen before the Lord can come alright and he knew that but it was alive to him right those Old Testament prophets when they spoke they spoke in the very first person right you know David Solomon etc first person now getting a point listen if they could speak in the first person without the baptism of the Holy Ghost right now they didn't have the baptism will hold us they had an anointing of those who go to come upon them they didn't have the new birth and the Old Testament well see if they could do that what about you and I or what about an end times surely you could see that the disciples that when they had that faith of the fathers placed in their heart Paul and all of them the thing that they could speak the things of God with a whole lot more clarity than the Old Testament prophets because Old Testament prophets was always leave kind of a you know what I'm talking about it would never finish it would speak off but never finish the total product well yet when the disciples came forth and they began to bring the word see then the word comes forth in its purity all right I hope you understand my point see if the prophets could speak it in the first person who was that speaking through the disciples you understand who was i speaking through Paul and Peter now surely he was speaking in the first person to them all right who was it speaking in this last days when the mysteries of God would be revealed to the endtime people who was that speaking unto us right we don't make the man nothing we make the vessel to be what it is but we make the God to use that vessel to give understanding all right then how much more is it now that we should realize what has taken place that these things has been unfolded to you and I that we can see the things the prophets the Bible said spoke of and was not able to see we should see it come forth in our day and understand see that's the that's the part of the writing of the word now to the making alive of the word because now come on I can quote the Prophet with it because he said when my brother when my sister was the time that there was to come or the manifestation of the sons and daughters of God outside of this age was you're not saying down to time that they they didn't have it no we're not talking about they didn't have they had it from their time but they could not make manifest this is the day of manifestation right this is the day of bringing things out in the open right you get a guy's name come up for president I ain't even never heard his name didn't know he existed don't know who he isn't or nothing right two days later they done got all about his life and how many times he's been in adultery and then many times and all of the things that's happened in his life and what he's done and although son 1 because it's the manifesting time it's the revealing it's the opening so you can't hide anything so there's no need of trying to hide it stuff is to walk in what are we're doing see and and to bring you know to that place all right now then to see that we've come into as we were trying to just speak about this morning of knowledge because knowledge is a wonderful thing but it can be damaging to if it's Holy Ghost knowledge everything is wonderful but if it's human intelligence knowledge they are as the Prophet would call it you know he said we have two different face two different virtues two different knowledge one of them is Holy Ghost knowledge that's God speaking but the other one is the nature given which is life and knowledge run through the scriptures and find out what knowledge that you could say you know that it is and and this is one I like that I just picked up about knowledge in Hosea six and six God says for I desired mercy and not sacrifice and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings his own knowledge because he was God whatever his own knowledge he desired that more than anything any offerings or anything you said well then we need to know we need to know the word yes we need to study the word yes we need to read and and constantly study but to realize then that to do that is just head knowledge alright I'm saying God don't quicken it sometimes right when you're first reading it nuts that's true we can do that but you know yourself it doesn't happen most of the time most of the time you read the word at least I do I read the Word of God I get something and it looks good and I so okay that's good I'll write that down and I I'll jot down a little notes or something you know and then I'll go on and I'll wait all right then one day I'll look back and say well what did that note mean Peggy she's always been good about that my wife she's see I have little pieces of paper when I'm sitting here on a listening to ministers and things or brought around them or whatever I have little pieces of paper and I mean no there's been a little bitty pieces like that well she knows better than throw it in those pieces away because there's something I wrote on our and it might just be two or three letters across a page you know but it's something that will bring back to my memory later on what it is and what God was dealing with me about because that's the point all right but getting now to our point that we've dealt with that we must have these virtues to be a virtuous Christian requires to have the virtues of God the virtues of God is the nature of God right this convert the word to nature's God is dealing with us trying to reveal his nature to us or get his nature to come in us alright see then it's heaven born faith is heaven-born virtue is heaven-born knowledge alright and see those things are God opening up to you and I and given us understanding what about it see I know the scripture talks that knowledge puffeth up yeah that's true it does if we just go with head knowledge and stay with that but if we get to a Holy Ghost knowledge they ain't gonna puff up it's gonna take us down right I've never got a revelation from God that ever exalted me you know people said well the Lord gave me this and I just got no when the Lord gives me something I go this way I do it is I just go down because I realize that if I do have what he just gave me it was not something I deserved it was not something that I tried to figure out for myself if something he wanted me to know see you know I prayed this way to him you know my dad died when I was about four years old so I never knew him the you that parents and new children especially now that you have a father and a mother or something you honor that and you love them and you talk to them it don't matter what you know and let everything work right because when you don't have it it leaves a vacuum it leaves a holder that I can't talk about what you can talk about that my mom and my dad took me to here taught me that I had done this I don't have any remembrance of that but I do have a Heavenly Father I do got now how the Heavenly Father you know what he he's good he talks to us sometimes and I love it that way but it never makes me to be say well I the Lord spoke to me this week coming no I don't preach like that I don't preach to try to get you to under staying what God and I listen that God has spoken to me I don't do that I want you I want him to speak to you I want him to manifest itself through you and then I'll achieve the goal that I'm after is get you to see God to get you to see the God that I see in this word is the greatest goal that I could have of anything okay now but we went through faith the new birth our faith in to be born again you know and then add virtue alright you can't know as I covered this morning on if it is a second see it's not that you say well okay I've got faith so what I'll do is I'll just work on knowledge that that don't work it's got to be honest together one piece at a time [Music] you say well what would you suggest that I work on if we have faith then the next thing to do work on virtue if we have virtue of faith in virtue then the next thing to do is to work on knowledge and to realize that these things are Holy Ghost given it's not your faith it's God's faith given unto you that gives you the new birth and makes it your faith it's like my other prophet said God gave it to me he gave me the new birth but it's his Holy Ghost is him doing well yet he gave it to me alright now I can add virtue 1 by letting him do the same way that he done by giving me the new birth letting him unfold his word how did we find that we are to receive these virtues the prophet of Malachi 4 was to bring the message that was to be worth it could be to deliver the opportunity to would be there as we were covering this morning for us to understand the things of God that the ages did not receive and see then from that God can move into our hearts and lives and can bring things into manifestation whoo vocalizes it together read the statue of a perfect man and blasphemous names and notice that brother branham spends a lot of time talking about vulcanization or vulcanizing and he says you can't eyes a piece of metal to a piece of rubber etc or something like that it won't work it's got to be the same material C then virtue cannot be a different material from faith virtue is an outworking of faith I wish I could get that back I was going over to brother bin Howard's years ago and I was by myself and just riding through that one not going to church and for some reason picking them couldn't go and I just went by myself and I was riding through there and and I begin to think about the virtues and the things of God and it began to unfold and I wish I could get that back I do I wish I'd have had a tape recorder you know to push the button to talk into it because I could see how the knowledge the knowledge without first having the new birth it won't doing it sure it's good it's wonderful but it will not do what God wants it to do so you go by the new bar first see that brings Christ to you that puts within you the interpreter are the one that the knowledge can be done all right see then it's not to try to jump up from know you take faith and you let God add virtue and he adds virtue to you and it's not just as I said it it shows you by what the Prophet he said that's not to just live a virgin life he said that's not so in this case see there's a different meaning you can look up the word looking up and you're strong and you'll get the definition of maybe the Virgin in the parts you know you'll get that but that's not what it is in this case now listen to what I'm trying to say this morning then for that see it if you looked up virtue and it led you backwards to natural things it is not the correct definition scripturally speaking of the word virtue to be used in Peter does that mean anything to you it does to me it means a lot to me because I look up words look up temperance it doesn't mean this because I don't drink alcohol well yet if I looked it up in a dictionary that would be what it would mean but that's not the definition those things see come forth because see Peter was writing God's word was he listening this morning Peter was writing the word so the word virtue in Peters writing doesn't mean just a virgin life but we thought it did and that's the meanings of our and can be used but it's not in that case who would have known that outside of the Prophet the intellectual man with intellectual knowledge would have only led to the natural wording but to the Prophet he would look at things and he'd say no that's not true you know works you know yourself that this is stated him over that he looked up the word godliness then he said he looked forever we're trying to find what the word godliness now he knew what the word godliness man knew what it meant but he was hunting something that would mean what was being said right dark now any of you never used Thrones in courts you know what I'm saying it's true you've taken the word knowledge over here in the scripture and it it'll have this meaning you're going over through the scriptures when you take the word knowledge it has a different meaning it's according to what is being said will determine how that is used uh-huh and see that's what the profit then he looks at it he says that don't mean just being a virgin he's because that's one of the things of life and they don't mean uh temperance is stop drinking alcohol he said not in this case me all right see then getting the word get it away and that's why I love it the word that we can go with the Prophet and when he says something that sounds a little contrary you know I everybody ever looks at my Bible I want it and I'm not against people some people say oh I would never write a word in the Bible that's alright I'm not saying nothing I do in a lot of definitions a lot of words that I don't know what they mean I look them up right and a lot of times I don't get too good of an answer out of Webster's dictionary right because I'll get a different one I may get the word virtue to mean a virgin and that wouldn't work for what I'm trying to get so I I've taken listen to the Prophet and when he said something see I'm trying to think of the one that he said you know oh he said even that the ends and the bus is in the right place but then he'd turn around and say this should be the worst talking about the the coming of the Antichrist and I thought and said this thee should be changed art to the one and only what see father my point I'm trying to get a adult to you that we look at words when they don't always have that meaning when you're using them in the realm of Christianity you can take a word and use it over here and it works but you put it over here it won't work all right see that's the way God is speaking to you and I to try to get us to see what he wants us to know okay so that is not knowledge as we would look up the word knowledge and we say well the word knowledge means an amount of training or this or understanding order and see in this knowledge it doesn't mean that we had to spell the way the Sun everything's are saying we get you got to get it to her that you see what if Toma so its Holy Ghost faith his Holy Ghost virtue its Holy Ghost knowledge are can I change it to use it the way the Prophet did in the statue of her its heaven-born heaven-born faith heaven-born virtue heaven-born knowledge it's got something to do with it that's greater than the spelling of the word and that's what we should follow it look up what the Prophet is saying when he's given you a definition of something look that up and find out if it's true then you check it with those things okay now getting home so it's heavenly born knowledge it is not how much you know we need knowledge is knowledge that's just know is heaven more knowledge knowledge puffeth up natural knowledge will get you in trouble natural knowledge has brought us to a world of look at it all around you know look at the world all around that's heaven that's natural knowledge but now holy ghost' knowledge is to bring us to God in his word I want his understanding are you with me I want his understanding to me not something that I can study out and say well this means so-and-so code I looked at well that's well and good I do that too I'm constantly looking at words I'm constantly writing down definitions and things because that's the human thing but I'm also constantly trying to study to see what the Prophet said in that case we're talking about it the other day or woods yesterday something you know what I do when I'm talking to somebody nobody we're talking about you know the Bible or something you know what I'm doing a lot of time I'm not sitting there waiting on you to quit talking because I know the Prophet said that's wrong to do that he said we're not listening I listen to what you say but at the same time I'm listening what did the Prophet say do you do that I I think to my mind what did brother Branham say about this how did he approach this situation what did he say when this person asked this question I'm trying to think about what his answer is to that question and you know what I couldn't find out I couldn't find out it's the best answer all right I come to find out it saved me a lot of trouble if I just listen to what he said and let it be have you ever noticed him in explaining how was it so simple to us you know we tried to figure out the Trinity we couldn't figure it out we couldn't understand what it was and and we get all confused and everything because we swore by the Trinity and and tried to make our mark as to what we were as Trinitarian and all I got within when the Prophet comes through was simple illustrator he said I'm a father almost alone he said I'm a human you remember when that was first brought and how it just opened up the understanding of God well that's what I'm trying to do see I'm trying to think what does the scripture say see when I'm reading these things add to your faith virtue knowledge temperance pacing it does not tell me that how to do that I've been through that with you overall it doesn't tell you that and Peter how to get these virtues within by listening and waiting on God then he comes to the place of coming to you and explaining to you that the prophets message is how these virtues are to be brought into being what changes the hold up from a natural point of hid knowledge you can get head knowledge and you can say well I'll tell you what uh I've studied the Word of God and blessed art out I can know it and I know every word that's fine wonderful be great if we all done that but now where is the Christ that comes off the page the question was that life not how do you know how do you know whether you're born again or not you want a 9 euro question how do you know whether you're born again or not do you wait explain oh we believe this we believe the Prophet we answer a 9 year old the give an answer to a 9 year old I can understand well the best out I could give was is an example of life that you're having problems you're in life and you're you're going along you having problems and all it wants something this happens the you you reason what we call the age of accountability or whatever and when you do see then you begin to be concerned about yourself well right now you know for sure if you begin to be concerned about yourself that it's not the devil because he's one trying to provide it so you know something else is dealing with you so how do you know you know something dealt with you all right then you wait on that one that's dealing with you until you can get a satisfied inward answer as to not being in your body and what you can tell it see taste feel smell in here it's not in your memory reason consciousness is insane all those are wonderful but that inside part of you is what's calling out the inside of you is calling out for an answer huh then as you do you start looking at that and seeing God is dealing with me and then God can speak to you he can speak to a child he can speak to to anybody they through that little illustration do you learn what a soul is then you learn what a how God is dealing with you and you know how that you are see we say the question is you know we say how do you know where you born again I believe every word the Prophet says well I'll we'll go pick up the internet and turn on to that deal that they got on there you know we're all these brothers now are spending all their time tearing down the message well you know what there was a time they would have swore that they had the Holy Ghost because they believed the prophets message what do they do now I got the Holy Ghost now called I don't believe it is that what it is no what would it matter in anything how can you do that how can you turn against the word but I found out he was wrong over here well when you found out he is wrong you were to automatically know that the others you're trying to read about was a whole lot more wrong than he was you don't ever look at sensible thing I mean you got somebody over here you know I'm not calling though nice but you got all these over here that's all kind of garbage cans living in adultery living in in all kind of forms and yet you're gonna take their word over the Prophet that brought the word even without dealing with him as a prophet without even thinking about him as a prophet you know his life was right they couldn't say nothing against it you know that the way he was they could not bring up those things or they'd have been sure to have done it and see there you got such a way to your matter over here to see that what I'd rather trust this man than to trust these that are off over here this changed their doctrines every time the wind blows you say well what are you trying to I'm trying to get you to find out a difference between heaven born knowledge and head knowledge right trying to talk about a difference between heaven born knowledge then those there's no contradictions in the word whatsoever between that and head knowledge which will accept the fact that there's contradictions all over the place you know that's because that's what your might alright heaven more knowledge doesn't do that heaven born knowledge captured you know puts a name into everything that's whether you having more knowledge or not is whether it agrees with the word and like I say it you got these people that for 40 years some of these preachers 40 years they preach this message getting converts to this message and now they're gone they're gone because there's so little something that amounts to nothing of a hill of am it is nothing in comparison and who are they following what are they following who are they turning to and then are you gonna turn around and and you're gonna turn against this message and then understanding the one gotten in you're gonna go to trinitarianism who are they going to they're going to their own understanding head knowledge they're staying with their own thoughts head knowledge and all that'll do is take you to the grave but holy ghost knowledge will lead you to Jesus Christ see that's all I'm trying to do this to try to get us to a point to see knowledge you've read what the Prophet had to say about it that's watch over it's not into you if you're not interested in reading the statue of perfect men on what he said on knowledge you're not interested in any what so it wouldn't do me no good to read it to you I just took that point this morning and to trying to preach on that's what I'm doing now to try to get you to see knowledge that one born knowledge will agree with every word being right even though I don't understand it I still say it's right don't you even though I can't figure it out even though I tried for 40 years and can't understand it I know there's something wrong with me it's not something wrong with the message there's something wrong with me because I'm the one that's cutting off guard from revealing it but when it's revealed it's no longer heaven I mean no longer human knowledge revelation covers all things Holy Ghost knowledge right you know yourself the Prophet and the things that he spoke up about knowledge abraham believed god then was contrary to everything in the world Noah believed God was contrary to everything in the world Moses believed God contrary to everything in the world did he have head knowledge no he had Holy Ghost knowledge now here's the point that she got her seat between this message and another message or two you've got to remember one thing brother Branham covered in the statue of a perfect man that Moses had patience the children of Israel had patience that Moses had patience and they would have knowledge and things like that well you got to remember one thing now watch were you defined whether you're believing it or not Moses never had the new birth so he had never had heaven born knowledge in the form of the new birth are you following me well the Prophet said he had knowledge prophet said he had temperance prophet said he had patience I'm gonna believe the Prophet instead of you amen go ahead I'm not trying to get you to believe me I'm trying to get you to be sensible with that head knowledge that you've got they never had the new birth back there it's all they could have was an anointing of the Holy Ghost to come upon them to lead them and guide them and look what they were able to do with that what would have happened had they had the new birth Samson could kill a thousand Philistine what if he had a new work he wouldn't have cared if they would a hundred thousand of them see they had God given giving to them knowledge of the Word of God amen but they never had the new birth they never had to Holy Ghost knowledge of eternal life in their soul that's why they could go out and do what they done right why David would go out and have his best buddy killed to take his wife if he'd had the Holy Ghost he would have done that but he had to anointing you gotta admit that you got to admit what he had on him and where he was and what he could do but surely if you can see that he can do that without the new birth why would it be with us when the new birth I said we have problems thinking what would be even in anyway what would be in any way to think about this message be wrong why entertain even any thought that this message is wrong I like what one man said one time when he was talking to somebody about it and the guy said well you know they said something about profits and the guy said well well he's probably a false prophet he said well we got that soft the gusset what do you mean he said we got it solved his profit come on are you listening that was solved he was a prophet you call him a false prophet well he's our prophet we got that song now let's go for something man but you see God's could reveal to those people what was needed for the time what was needed for their time and their their place or where there's that he could speak to those prophets and do those great things but yet they never had heaven born knowledge now you say well whoever tell you I won't take what the Prophet said cuz I read here where he said they had it there go ahead cuz you're never gonna get any answer either if you got that far into your mentality of of mind to think that because brother Branham said that Moses had patience that gave him the patience for the statue of a perfect man then I'm gonna ask you do you have it well I don't know within Moses was greater than you into that birth and then won't work you see they didn't have a Holy Ghost knowledge like it's supposed to be they had one knowledge for the time of what was needed or whatever was to take place cuz he didn't have the new birth to bring it to him but I remember in the first years of studying the message when I studied that statue of a perfect man I'd run across those things and in my human mind I would say hey Moses had patience brother Brennan said I don't even have him yet but yet I got the Newburgh he said more that put Moses hey you ain't honest you even honest to admit what you've done yeah you know am I the only one that come into this thing blinded and all out of shape I had to come to the basis of realizing they had to be a prophet then when I realized that had come to that place I don't know more trouble with in the other because it would just be my head knowledge and I could stay with whatever the prophet would say until God would figure it out Wow it allow me to understand because brother Brown say that they would have patience or godliness or whatever it doesn't mean they had it in the new birth of that age because that's what he's trying to explain in the new in the statue of a perfect man that we don't have those things but we must have those things teaching there's a lot of difference between heaven knowledge that is the Holy Ghost knowledge rock that God is dealing with us to bring us to a place than there is from head knowledge head knowledge will keep us confused the Holy Ghost knowledge will straighten this out but it'll work from that inside it doesn't work on this head Holy Ghost don't work on your head it works in your heart sure it has to go through that it has to use those channels etc etc but it's not trying to work through there he's trying to work through your soul your being on what you are and see those early disciples had those virtues what would your father want to say you know by having those virtues they could write the Word of God but those prophets the Word of God for their age they didn't have did not have the new birth well I don't like that because I believe they did well all right I'm not gonna argue we don't spend no months arguing over whether who's got water who's got whatever I'm just gonna go on down the road but I'm gonna preach it the way I believe it and to see it that the way I can follow it through the word that I can see then that these virtues are required but if they're not our virtues there are ours because God gave them to us they are his virtues their are his nature in ways and things it's not me and you if God bringing to me and you hidden his way his point his nature see then that way we get confused about words and thought instead of just simply relaxing and letting God take us through the mess knowledge knowledge is a wonderful opportunity of mankind to be able to have knowledge that's great but if it's only human knowledge you will never curious no word but to outer space it cures to the moon you can't argue with that that's what they were saying last night someone was asking the question what did to get to the moon I said what Lane go and argue about whether they got to the moon or not I'm just gonna say with the scientific ability that they have today what would hinder them from getting there I'm not gonna argue whether they did or not what I thought we're brother Brown sit around ain't gonna argue with you about it cuz there's no argument about it you know I just know one thing for certain if there is a human knowledge that can that almost there's nothing withholding because that's what the Bible says there's nothing withholding from mankind look at what they could do the little telephone that a lot of you have a little machine here to transmit that's greater than the first computer they made the first computer covered a city block it took that much to put all those switches in it on and off and on and off but yet you could take your little bitty telephone and do more than that they have come to the place until nothing is we refrain from proving it every day that they're hacking these people in and can do anything they want to they're proving that the supernatural is here because brother Brown said they broke into God's laboratory and they can prove these scientific facts sometimes I'm not concerned about scientific facts I'm concerned about the Word of God a scientific facts not going to take you in a rapture for brother Branham we read them to you the other day it's in the statue of perfect man that a man with these abilities is gonna be qualifying for the rapture you know what these virtues then is what we need if we're if that's what's gonna qualifies for a rapture or he says for a resurrection and he says they without us cannot be made perfect he said they're waiting on us faith virtue knowledge God adding to you his own nature his own being giving to you the things we have need of and revealing himself at that same time knowledge to know the to Bible don't contradict no except well I know what don't contradict you know what I said that and I was Trinitarian come on get off of him quit being some glory you said the same thing you believed in a trinity and swore they wouldn't know contradictions well you find out they might not have been no contradictions in the word but there was a lot of contradictions in us as humans there's no contradictions in this message the message not the things the Prophet had to correct where he was wrong because he was a human being and made mistakes and taught things are incorrectly but yet the Holy Spirit corrected him that's not in the message there's no contradictions in the message there's contradictions in our ideas of the message but stems they stay with him for a second but what I'm trying to say as I said we couldn't understand the Trinity we didn't know where they was three four ten or twelve really right although you're silly there was just three backyards all we believed in well you found out that was wrong but think about it a prophet just giving you a simple illustration of a father or son and the human being and you know what God could quicken and take away that idea of the Trinity away from us this is not a little simple illustration well why wouldn't I want to follow that man as I've always said I don't care what they prove brother branham would I don't care if they put out it and I don't see why they hadn't put out a lot of the lives because they lied about all the rest what's the difference I haven't much of them come up with a line saying that he's my 14 times and all this add the other whatever because there was one time Gordon made a man's life so straight until they couldn't find nothing against right but what about it hadn't you draw the file or something like that than to follow this all of these other things that are constantly changing what I said I don't understand what could they convert me to you mean you're afraid to go down to a nuthouse and get the afraid they might convert you to the Trinitarian doctrine well they you don't even have much sense you're not afraid of being converted that away well what could they convert you in this message that gets me how could you stay with this message 30 40 years swear by it and then turn and go somewhere to to what right what did you go to I never heard none of them explain what they went to they just found out how wrong he was well brother down here understand the truth was he's wrong well I've said it I don't mind saying it brother dick and I've talked about this for a long time he'd say it with me I don't care if they could come out and prove that brother Branham was the worst person never been a Hitler of Mussolini's and all of the things manifested in one man he led me to Jesus Christ I'll clap on that myself he led me to Jesus Christ he brought me to a place that God could speak my language that I could understand him that's what he is and it being in a person that I could follow him in love and understand the whole thing and not have to have all of these things you don't glory glory in the fact that he brought you to Christ so what I care what they want to say I'm kind of like to the little boys that put the food on the lady's porch and you know she come out hollered and glory hallelujah God's fed me a little boys one of them said hey lady he said God didn't give that to you said we brought it and put it on your porch she said glory hallelujah thank God for the food in the devil that Fox did right I could be happy about all things one because I know this message is right I don't have to worry about somebody coming into Lulla church and and doing it but you see I'm not allowed in the churches of this message that was settled a long time ago they won't allow me in it and these brothers that are going out now you watch them they're going to get less important they won't they're gonna be cut off too because they know where I stand and if they're gonna stand with me they're gonna get cut off I ain't worried about that I'm happy because you see I even tried to do that I ain't trying to be anything I've tried to turn everybody to the message what a wonderful message we've had do you understand what I'm saying it wouldn't matter how much that could prove brother Branham was wrongly what this is he led me to Jesus cry whole lot more than all of them over here with that great things that takes out the head they didn't lead me to Christ where could they be any contradictions in this message if it could lead you to Christ well you're just a silly old dude I agree we agree with your person but I'm still too human being and I've always been when I seen God promised in the word that he'd send a prophet most of you know my story I saw that before I come in this message I told my wife that they would according to Melek are in Malachi for that they'd be two prophets coming before the end of the world I never heard of the Prophet never heard of the message and I read the Bible and I believed it and I was a good Baptist that could read and I could understand Malachi for as to be the part of John the Baptist coming with me and Malachi 3 you know the fulfillment I could understand that because I could read the word I could go to Luke and find out then he done this and he done that and how it was done I could understand that but I couldn't understand that monocot forward no but I believed it then brother mote begin to tell me a little about Malachi 4 I said okay what about this Melancon 3 who is he I thank God I didn't run into somebody you gotta believe I've had a man that could put me in the word and he put me right into the Bible and said the Bible said here's Luke 1:17 we'll see I already knew those scriptures I already knew those things I had read them I just needed that Malachi 4 to be put into C then when he told me he said look here's Elijah there's Elijah f1 into yours Melik aisle three John the Baptist said there's got to be a malachi for because one of those two witnesses to Israel cos Baptist we did read the word I knew there was to be two witnesses we used to argue that it was Moses and Enoch you heard brother Brennan talking about using acid a lot of people think it was Enoch he said no it was Elijah we argue to test what it was because the Enoch was translated he did not die we had scriptures in time but I couldn't do it with that say it was head knowledge but when he put this five over here in one two three back here I said well they've got to be a four somewhere now where's that act and this is what I told him I said brother you was there and you saw because he's seen the dead raised the sick healed and all kind of thing I said but I wasn't there I believe you he told me about Robert Tatum and I knew Robert item and the Tatum family they were marvelous people I knew him and I said that's all right but I said I can't take it what you saw I can't take I didn't see it but if you tell me what he taught in the Bible and I'll know whether or not he was a prophet thank God I run into the right man that could put it in the Bible and show me the promises of God through Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelation 10 7 and all of those sons it went down from a head knowledge to an understanding that I could see the word is being truth and that God had promised a people come on I could read the Bible where he promised Israel that they'd be done our 400 years right I could read the Bible of all the promises but I didn't read the Bible to understand God was promising things to me but when I saw that he said I send you Elijah the Prophet if the Bible was gonna be speaking to me that was me and that's why I've never had any problems in with all of these doctrines and ideas and so because of one time let's get into the message let's get in the Bible I didn't leave my Bible when I came in this message my Bible is still the Bible I still got a lot of writing in this problem I still love to read this novel because it's the Word of God right it's God's Word you and I right it is the knowledge of God meaning the understanding of God you know the reality there's a lot in here where brother Branham speaks of knowledge if you want it you can have it what you ought to understand one time it can't be knowledge that puffs us up it can't be just knowledge of you know some life or man it has to be Christ in the word amen let's stand together we have the communion we'll go right into it take the communion I pray you'll just go home and think let's see no matter what everybody says I've gotten my point at one time this message and the Bible are one I solved with me I don't have to worry about it head knowledge won't keep you there head knowledge will find contradictions and probably but heaven more knowledge won't turn you from the word right it'll turn you to the work I pray you'll think on these things Lord as we go into this part of the communion we we've tried to explain today one thing that we've had on our heart that you brought your word and you've given it into our hands and left it with us to be able to study what the prophet has brought unto us and what all the prophets brought what all the writers of the word broke they brought a revelation of you Lord to us how much greater could we want anything to be than to have that revelation of Jesus Christ could be an Almighty God the great I am and just help us to understand I know I sound funny in art and the way I try to express it but I don't have no other ability Lord I just try to talk about what you've made known to me because in that then I know something personal and I can try to talk about what's personally been revealed but you just have your way with all of us forgive our sins forgive our attitudes in ways I know I hollered and scream Lord just have your way and goddess and take us into these things that you promised to add unto us because there in the words it says add to your faith then that is a promise all we got to do is believe you and you'll take care of it as we're going to the communion you bless and guide each one of us in Jesus I've received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do chew of the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord so let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged thank you Lord for this then when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together unto condemnation and the rest what I said in order when I come great man had a great understanding and God revealed to him why didn't God choose one of the disciples that had walked with it didn't do any chores Paul to explain the communion because Paul could understand it he could put it in the Old Testament go through all of those things that they went through the rituals and things that they went through he could see all of that and how it tied to so he was chosen to write it some personal to him right think on these things it says they take they had they prayed so let's just have a few moments of prior and just wait upon the Lord praying one for the other the Lord would bless us all and bring us to the right place in him mother thank you for your word that you've given unto us and to show us Lord yourself and what you are that you reveal here to the Apostle Paul and he wrote it down and told us about it and then it is speaking to us about the communion he was explaining to us all about you in your ways we love you and we thank you we ask you now you just bless each one we pray one for another that you would bless us all together in you just give us of your understanding of your love and grace forgive our sins cleanse us and keep us guide us in Jesus name the Bible said he took bread and blessed it father we thank you for this bread that's been made for this purpose this afternoon and we just break it as an honor to you and your body that was broken for each one of us the Lord help us to have a understanding of you and to what it's all about bless the food and the sanctify you and the partakers in Jesus name how wonderful it is to know truth just to even this little bit of the communion and what it's about that it's not the body it's not the blood it's not this it only represents that that's wonderful do you realize the biggest portion of the world today is taking this but yet not understanding making it all kind of things the literal body the literal this or whatever and then the others that don't understand anything about it yet God has revealed it to you and I the endtime people what this is all about thank God for the truth other we thank you for this wine it's made for this purpose this afternoon and it represents your blood that was shed for each and every one of us we drank we eat the little piece of bread we drank the wine and it creates blood cells literally in our body and how much more is the spiritual than our soul to understand your word your manifestation we love you and we thank you in Jesus name come morning
