roberts comes to speak the word of the lord unto us this afternoon right open the eyes of my heart beneath the eyes open the eyes of my heart lord amen open the eyes of my heart i want to sing glory i want to see and how do you want to see out there on the internet this morning if you were listening and wondering what uh brother anderson's sister anna was gonna have a little girl but we appreciate it amen holy holy holy holy i want to say amen god bless you this evening man y'all can be seated for a minute yeah i'm saying uh sister brandon wanted me to sing so uh sister ben yeah sister benny brenda that's all right so based try b flat i'm not sure there is peace and contentment in my father's house today lots of food on the table and nobody's turned away there is laughter and singing as the arts pass by but a hush calms the singing as the father sadly cries my house is full but my field is empty who will go and work for me today it seems my children all want to stay around my table but no one wants to work in my field look out through the window pane just beyond the house of plenty lies a field of golden grain and it's white unto harvest but the reapers where are they in the house oh can't the children hear the father sadly say my house is full but my field is empty who will go and work for me today it seems my children all want to stay around my table but no one wants no one wants to work in my fears hey man let's all stand i believe there is a field that's whiteful ready for a harvest amen i believe god has called us to a work i was listening to brother branham and you know you and i are the only eyes that he has the only hands that he has the only feet that he has you know we are to make known the revelation of this word to this world right amen you know i believe it was there in in satan's evening where brother randall was talking about satan was able to get to eve in god's perfect eating everything was perfect but he said let satan have have this eaten this is his world this is his domain see everything was going to be against this end time bride but he was going to prove to satan that she wouldn't fall everything's against us but we can't fall i'm so thankful for that i'm glad i'm not leaning on myself or my own understanding amen we're going to be reading from two scriptures and if y'all you know probably some of you may remember some of you may not remember this was something i preached on in july and so it may be familiar to you and it may be brand new to you even though you might have been here so uh we're gonna be reading from colossians chapter one and then we'll be reading from romans chapter 16. and also i want you to know that if you hear the same thing you heard this morning then brother brother bob didn't read my notes and i didn't read his notes amen but i know there was things this morning he was i told brother wade i told him this morning i said i'm just going to let brother bob preach this afternoon he was he was all over my stuff this morning but it ain't my stuff i mean i mean it's all it's all the word of god but praise the lord we you know somebody gave us something to say this morning and i'm not i'm not going and i i'm not going to say that i'm not worthy to be here because by god's grace i'm worthy god's called us to a job and if he's called us to a place then he's equipped us you know the lord saying is god don't call the equipped he quips the cult he equips us for the job that he has called us too and sometimes you know we i know i always tell everybody where i go and i get up preaching and i tell everybody i said well you know you know they ask you about the fivefold ministry i believe i'm a part of that but but i tell everybody the same thing i said that's right i said i i'm just a spare tire like brother branham said i said that's the reason god made me look like the michelin man because god made each one of us individuals and i can't be nobody else but who i am so i'm i'm happy to be who i am amen because i'm going to be changed as this song says from glory to glory he's changing amen so this afternoon we're just going to read the scripture and y'all pray with me we're going there's so many things this morning i'm not like bob said we're not you know 30 minutes and then we're going to preach all day but i don't know how long we're going to go but just you know brother brown tells a little testimony about the about the dentist he says uh lord fill my mouth with good things and nudge me when i've said enough so lord that's that's my prayer so let's just bow our heads and pray before we read the scripture this afternoon heavenly father we thank you for this day lord we thank you for your blessings lord we thank you for this time that we can come and gather in your house lord fill your presence lord we so thankful for lord this gift that you've given to brother anderson and sister hannah today lord lord for this opportunity to share it with them

lord as the scripture tells us let us just come boldly before the throne of grace lord that we can make seek help or we can find help from you lord you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered them from their destruction lord everything that we have need of has been given to us and now lord we just pray that you just come and open the word to us lord that we may receive what we have need of lord for each one that's here lord we just pray that you touch each one in a special way lord for brother jackie benton lord jesus we pray you just ministered unto him lord jesus and the family there lord just strengthen him and lord we just commit all things to you and we look to you we thank you for it in jesus christ's name amen chapter 1 verse 21 it says and you who were sometimes alienated and enemies in your mind by wicked works yet now hath he reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy and unblameable and unreprovable in his sight if you continue in the faith grounded and settled and be not moved away from the hope of the gospel which ye have heard which was preached to every creature which is under heaven whereof i paul and made a minister who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of christ in my flesh for his body sake which is the church whereof i am made a minister according to the dispensation of god which is given to me for you to fulfill the word of god even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generation but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus whereunto i also labor striving according to his work which worketh in me mightily amen amen we'll go to romans chapter 16 verse 25. romans 16 verse 25 it says now to him that is of power to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of jesus christ according to the revelation of the mystery which was kept secret since the world began but now is made manifest and by the scriptures of the prophets according to the commandment of the everlasting god made known to all nations for the obedience of faith amen amen the lord blessing the reading of the word you may be seated you know sometimes you you wonder what direction to go with something and you pray and you say well lord what should i say and sometimes you end up with so much you don't know how to you don't know how to get to all of it because you know there's certain there are certain parts of scripture you get to and you preach just the whole sermon on just one part of a scripture just that one phrase will you preach a whole sermon on so i just want to cover a few things this today but i want to speak on as as i was speaking previously on the mystery and the secret of god or god's secret mystery that and you know brother man even talks about the secret mystery but uh i also want to look at there's a phrase that caught my attention it's called the and it's here in the colossians and it says the riches of the glory of this mystery the riches of that and if you look up the word myst of riches you know the the word riches uh means abundance it means the fullness and you know if you go back and you look and and you start to study the scripture you know because we say well it's he's going to make known this riches but you know sometimes we we fail to see what he what he's what paul's trying to express to the people because we say well it's the fullness but you know actually what he's what he's trying to express to the people is he's trying to understand that when this mystery is going to be more than you can contain right because it's an over because what words can you describe it i mean it's over abundance it's overflowing it's it's excelling so you know when he talks about this mystery that becomes un uh open that's going to be revealed to the people as he's speaking this the glory these riches that's in the scripture is going to be made known to you as the scripture he said he said i'll open up the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing you can't contain exactly because later on we'll get to the scripture here lord willing now i want to get to the scripture there where it talks about the volume of the book yeah and you know and understanding what what is that and what does that mean if i don't know if we'll get to that far but you know understanding as paul said to understand these things so as we as we get to that point i want to understand what the mystery is the secret that god has for us and the riches because you know brother branham said you know we we don't comprehend what god has in store for us he said that would be a message of cheer down through the endless ages so we've not only scratched the surface of what god has for us we only we only in in this area we can only see things in a minute form that's right you know i don't know if many of you may not remember i preached a message one time i preached on the on the essence of god and you know because every time i go back to that same that one message that i preached and i don't know if you remember that's the only time i've ever used a chalkboard or the mark board up here and but you know you see the the things that open up when the word opens up to you you know what that's that's the foundation for something that's the basis for something because upon that he's going to build because more will open up from that amen so when you see who you are when you start to see who you are when this word opens up even more you're going to see who you are so so when we see when he when uh brother brown was speaking i would go back through some of these things and i want you to the lord's help i want to show you these things and uh y'all pray for them back there i've got all this stuff jumbled up and i don't know which order it's going to be in so i'm just going to i'm just going to tell the brothers where it's set and they just have to go back around trying to try to find everything but uh you're looking back at what a what a mystery is and you know we covered that understanding what a what a mystery is and what a revelation is i mean and a secret a mystery is something definition of a mystery something not understood or beyond understanding a religious truth that one can know only by revelation and cannot fully understand because you know brother branham said there was a supernatural element that remained despite the mystery so there was still a part there and and a secret is something kept from knowledge or view revealed only to the initiated designed to elude observation or detection so working with hitting aims or methods so there was something that is that secret that is to be made known and this is from the this quote is from uh the world's falling apart 1963 e e6 or e15 and brother brown's talking about he said and god is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god it's still god that's right it is the word and when you get away from the word then you're away from god jesus said if ye abide in me he said there's the sick there's the mystery there's a secret if ye abide in me and my word abide in you then ask what you will see the idea is first god's word got to abide here so that's the first thing we got to understand the word's got to abide in us and so when god start brother brandon said in christ the mystery he said now god's secret mystery he had before the world began this is christ the mystery 16 2. he's in a god secret mystery he had before the world began he said now back in the back part of god's mind there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon star i had a molecule in anything he was god but he exactly wasn't god at that time because god is an odd object of worship object of worship and there wasn't nothing to worship him so in his great mind he wanted these attributes to be expressed and in him was love and in him was to be father and it was to be son and him was to be savior and him was to be healer and all these great attributes that he that we see already expressed they were in god so we know that as brother dale's been preaching we know that he was elohim self-existing but he had these attributes that he wanted to be expressed and when you when you see that you know it's not something else that he was wanting to express because that was me because that was that that because if we if you don't see it that way then you're missing the point right well he has he has an attribute that he wanted to express well sure there was he wanted to he wanted to be a god so he created angels and then he could become god but you know what he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a healer he wanted to be a redeemer but you know what he didn't he didn't do that for adam and eve he didn't do it for anybody else he done it for aaron roberts it didn't matter it don't matter who else because that's the only way that it that it means anything is it means it's me it's to me because i want to get to it later on because see when you start to see him unfold himself brother madam said you become the center of the revelation so if you don't see that it's you see everybody everybody wants to make it the bride the bride the bride you know when i go back to that message where in the essence of god when i preach that message you know brother madam said in jehovah jireh in 1964 he said all that god was he poured into christ he said all that christ was he didn't say poured into the body he said he poured into the believer right amen amen why because you are the fullness of who you are to be in this day glory amen i'm not i'm not the fullness of the godhead bodily but you know what i am the fullness of what god wants to express in aaron roberts amen amen why because he was the fullness that's what god wanted to express so this is and you say well you're a poor excuse well i agree with you but you know what that's what he's doing so he started out with whatever but you know he's working it and molding it into the into the fashion that he wants it to be because he said that's the thing right here he said because when he had that attribute that thought that attribute he said he had something in his mind that he was going to achieve amen so guess what you say well you're a poor excuse i agree with you but guess what he's not done yet why because he said he was going to achieve it amen exactly so whatever whatever god has for me to do then that's what he's going to achieve amen it says you know god had a this is christ a mystery he said god had a purpose and a hidden mystery he said that's what i want to speak to the church on this morning this hidden mystery of god that he had in his mind before the world ever begin and how that has unfolded itself right down to this present hour that we're living and they will understand clearly you see oh i believe what is being done he said god's great mystery of how it's a secret he kept it a secret nobody know nothing about it even the angels didn't understand it exactly he didn't reveal it that's the reason under our seventh mystery when the seventh seal was open there was silence and then from continuing on brother braden says this is uh 22 4. he says now notice god has had a threefold purpose in this great mystery secret god in his great mystery secret that he had before the world began he's got a threefold purpose in it so he said there was a threefold purpose in that mystery so he had this mystery that he wanted to unfold and it came down as the scripture tells us it come down to our day you know from the beginning so we go back through and brother man talks in the message christ the mystery you know he said god started in the beginning and i believe it's in uh the message masterpiece where he talks about he said you know the patriarchs created the body you know he was bringing it down and he talks about abraham isaac jacob and joseph each one of them typing each one of the stages of justification sanctification and joseph being for perfection and then he talks about the prophets he said the prophets built the body he said every one of them came through and they was expressing christ for their time just like when he stood there and he said he said i always wondered why moses how moses could tell god a better way to do something and he said i come to find out it was christ and moses so that's how he could tell him because why because that's who christ was christ was making himself known all the way through the scripture so when he came to a certain time as each one of them unfolded he said joseph had his party ezekiel had his part and so even each one of them as they came through when jesus came they should have clearly known who he was because he had been expressing himself the whole time but see that was the secret that was was being made known because a secret was because it was unknown to anybody except for him and each one of the prophets had their portion of it right but that was the secret the secret was what he was trying to do right amos and if you go back to amos three and seven says he was surely do nothing but he said he revealeth right right he would say reveal his secret right singular he said reveal his secret unto his servants the prophets right so he was revealing the secret unto the prophets so that's what they came to do now revelation 10 7 see if brother brother bob's got that one but if you come to 10 7 then you'll see that he said that it's he came to reveal the mystery singular right so there had to be come see he said in the days of the voice of savanth angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of god why because the secret had been made known see it was secret all this time but then when when brother branham come brother didn't come to preach anything new he said i come to top the loose sins he said the the sales were in the scripture he said he come to understand those mysteries he said the mystery was there then the mystery could be made known but without a secret see it becomes a secret because if you've never seen anything if you've never heard of anything then you know it's a secret to you but until until then then it becomes something that becomes a mystery so you know that's the reason that you know they could read through the scripture as you know jesus told me it asserts the scripture he said then you think you have eternal life but they testify of me they should have known who he was they should have seen who he was why because all the scriptures identified who he was what'd he do he said he said who can who can convince me of sin show me where i've missed it and that was that was their job show me where where he had missed and what he had done but until but if if it if you didn't have someone to show you yeah right if you didn't have someone to show you and point these things out you wouldn't know it what because what what did the what did the prophets do each one of the prophets when they came when daniel come he said i understood by books who did he who did he read from he just didn't get it it didn't just fall out of the sky and hit him in the head right right he said i understood my books who did he read he read the prophet jeremiah he read the scroll exactly he said our deliverance is coming glory see he had to understand that when jesus came and he stood there in the temple he took the book isaiah when he took the book he took the book from the priest and he opened it he said and he found the scripture there where it said he hath anointed me to preach the scripture to preach see when he found well because that was the scripture see it had been spoken but someone had to show that and so each one of the prophets they went back and looked at what was what was previously preached what was previously taught and they brought it to present day each one each one of the prophets they didn't because you can't find contradictions in what they were saying on the day of pentecost it wasn't a contradiction well here's a bunch of drunk folks he wasn't drunk what was it it was a fulfillment of the word you know peter stood up and said he said these people aren't drunk as you suppose he said but this is that that was spoken of so we knew that each one of them had to go back and look in the scripture all the way through the old testament they're looking back at the previous prophets and so each one of them even even other ones when they even you look at david excuse me when you look at what david had to say how many times did he refer back to moses even when he's going through the psalms and he refers back to the previous people all the ones that were said god done this and god done that and god said to them so they're all the time pointing back so that's what brother branham done lots of times when brother branham come to to minister you know is amazing you sometimes when he preaches messages you know what he didn't go when he just take an example when brother branham preached the rapture he didn't go to the new testament to preach the rapture what did he do he went to the old testament well because he went back to what david done that's what david had said and then he brought it into the new testament and then brought it present day so that's what they were supposed to do was bring it present day so each one of them brought it through bringing it from the previous one and bring it to present day and so we see how it became unfolded so that he was showing how it was continuity all through the scripture he said so we see this secret is becoming unfolded so as the scripture was unfolding to each one of the prophets see that it become building the body the fullness thereof and then he could step onto the scene and show who he was so the scripture when they when he started to unfold this this great mystery you know this this great mystery that we've been a part of you know brother dale's been preaching on and you know when as he was talking about how does god predestinate that was because that that's the understanding the mystery of what was taken because it comes down to you because you come back and he said when when were you brother man says you know when did he choose us he said before the foundation of the world he said when his great hidden mystery this great secret he chose us in christ before the foundation of the world in the back part of god's mind he said let's go back to the back part of god's mind that's where this thing started right and he started to unfold this thing amen and that you know it's so amazing because you see we can look and say we we look too much to the to the things around us we look too much of of this world but if we could see you know i always was a part of god uh you know and to see who who you are right but to understand who how you came amen because you know so there's so many people that have got everything all scrupled up why because they're not looking to the one that could reveal the scriptures right you know there's a we have a i was looking at a a map the other day and it is something i i've seen before and uh so maybe you think about things and then someone else will bring it up and you'll hear the same thing over and over and it's you know something that catches your attention but we're working on a unit and uh had a schematic inside of it and the guy he was hunting the whole thing and uh do you who knows do you know what a legend is they maybe have you ever seen a map knows what a legend is and you know a legend is the thing on a map or a schematic or something that explains to you what the symbols are yeah so we're looking at this thing and this guy he's scanning this whole big schematic there and he's looking right he's a where's the legend where's the legend he's scanning this thing where's the legend where's he going because he said without it you can see a lot of things but you can't see things clearly you don't understand things clearly and you know that's what that's what it takes it takes a legend because you can have understanding and you look at a lot of road maps road maps and you know brother brown said that he said we use the bible as a road map he said we're getting here to glory he said we're going from mortal to immortality but you know what it takes more than just having the road map because if you don't have the legend i thought you don't preach a message called the legend of the word but you know if without a legend it doesn't it doesn't mean because you know you can leave here and travel someplace and as brother branham was talking about he said you know you need to take a map and he said if you take that map then you say well i'm going to a certain place and they say well which direction do i need to go well go north well how far do you go north you know if i was going someplace you know i can say northeast west south whatever i can go in that direction and that might get me closer than i am today but you know what before i get to that destination i've got to know have a better understanding of where i'm going and how to get there than i do today because you know i can say well i'm going north well how far north because you end up saying okay well now i've got to go south but see you start to go and then you've got to under brother ram said you've got to know the signpost you've got to find the signpost that's going to point you in the right direction but you can see the signposts along the road but if you don't understand what the map is telling you the signposts don't mean anything right so we've had we had to have someone in in our day right because see it was made known to us he came to reveal his secret that but see the thing was it was laid out and here it is but how many people understood what was said until someone came to show us what this said who knew what it said and it's like a lot of people you go down the road and somebody's traveling well people can look at a map and they kind of figure out what it means but you know what that doesn't mean they actually know what it means and let me tell you when you work on something that's this that's 460 volt three-phase you don't want to you don't want to be guessing too much about what what a schematic is showing you you want to have a good idea what you're doing because you know what you can get up there you can spend hours looking at something i've actually sat down with a manual and not even i i have no idea what what some of these air how some of these air conditioners work i've had to sit down with a book and i just sat in red red red red red red and you know what i finally figure out what's going on and then i can kind of work on it but you know what i've had to call people and ask them questions and somebody's they knew what they were talking about what had been through this had an experience with something you know what they could tell me how to work on something but you know what it took it took more than just looking at a schematic because that drawing explains a lot of things and a lot of people knew a lot of things about this message and i knew a lot about the scriptures and a lot of people have guessed and they've guessed right on things but you know what they were utterly confused on other points but you know what it would never get them to the right place so you know it took more than that because it took somebody that understood right and see it wasn't it wasn't uh when the seventh angel came when brother branham came to minister these things to us it wasn't brother branham it was the one who wrote it in the beginning the one that had the thought in the beginning the one that had the attributes that was going to be expressed when he expressed it here that he was the one that came and told what he had written that's right amen so when he stood there see the thing was see he became he came to speak to us the mystery that was hidden in the scripture but you know what people missed the secret of what was going on because you know what he was just like he was talking about the latter in the former rain coming at the same time see people miss missed it because they were looking for a lighter rain and didn't realize they were receiving the teaching rain right the former rain was coming and on top of that he said the former and the latter was coming at the same time see people missed that because he stood there brother brandon stood there and he was revealing the secret and you know what when he was bringing these things out it was still a mystery to people it was a mystery to begin with and it was and it was still another mystery right brother bob said he didn't drink that this morning so he told me to feel free i told him that brother i'm so we should be able to chew each other's chewing gum all things are sanctified by the word of god in prayer i'm not gonna drink i'm not gonna drink battery acid or nothing but you know i believe he said if you drink any deadly thing it's trying to hurt you i'm not going out picking up snakes or nothing but you know amen but you know the the secret was being he was unfolding what was there the brother i'm stood there and he was trying to express what was hidden in this in the word but you know what people missed was he said because he said have you called what's been going on this week he was trying to get the people to see he because he stood there and plainly said to he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand brother branham wasn't a lamb right he wasn't talking about some figurative speech or something he was not trying to get somebody to imagine something in his mind he was trying to get the people to understand that christ the word was there and he was the one expressing what was written in the word amen as you know as as bob kept saying this morning you know he said when you turn on elijah when you turn on elijah well you know that's the holy ghost that's jesus christ i'm not listening to brother branham see people people get their minds confused they think we're listening to a man right that's right you know you know it boggles my mind sometimes but you know you think say paul said follow me as i follow christ you think about where paul came from you look at you look at the life in the ministry of paul paul was a man who was one of the highly educated theologians of his time who had great rank in the among the people he had the best of everything a lot of people looked up to him he had prestige he had power but you know what he considered all that dung right and here comes a man who was polished in everything that he knew he knew the scripture he knew the word and he come along and the next thing you know he's down there bacon in the sun and he's sowing tents here's a man when you read in corinthians when he was telling the corinthians about his life how many times he'd been shipwrecked how many times he'd been beaten how many times he'd been whipped all the things that he happened to him he said i'll bear in my body the marks of jesus christ glory you know he was written in the scripture here telling us you know he bears these in his body face it and these things happen to him for the body sake the church you look at him and you know no one no doubt he was bent over and hunched over if you'd been tore and beat up and all the things that happened to him you know what he was not the same man that he used to be and you look at the kind of life that he had me stand up and say you know preaching and being in prison and people going around saying i follow paul i believe what paul believes i believe i preached what paul preached yeah do you not believe that there was a stigma that went with that people say you're crazy you've lost your mind well praise god i hope i do i hope i have that i can gain the mind of christ as paul said amen so you know what i'm not following a man but i am following the god of that man i want that god because you know there's one thing i want you to understand if i don't get anything else to you today i want you to understand one thing because when brother brandon spoke of paul in this great mystery when this mystery the secret that he had because he wants to feel as brother brown said he's able to feel every fiber of your being he said he said you know you can be so full of god the devil don't know what to do with see that's what that's what this great mystery is is to for you and for you to understand that you and god are one but you know because but see we we people are so confused on so many things you know there's one thing that i've been that i am thoroughly convinced of in in this message because people people don't don't believe what was said right people are utterly confused and they just won't admit i'm confused they've got to build up their their as as the expression is they got to build up a house of cards they you know they've got to try to build up something that absolutely has no has no basis and has no foundation and won't hold anything right right many times you hear these you hear these people and and you know you know it's so amazing it's telling way that we were talking you you hear these people and what they have to say you know it used to be that people would say a few times well brother random said such and you know you were going to say was that before the seals was that after the seals that's what we want to know you know what's gotten worse now oh yeah absolutely yeah it doesn't matter if it's after the seals or not they want to know what month was that 64-63 yeah now if he said in 65 then out of trump's 64 and 63. they tell me what month it was it's going to give way to go get to them get to the point the only message people want to believe is communion the last the last sermon he preached now this is this is what he said right here he was he was not the son of charles and ella branham yeah that's all that's all we're going to believe we don't believe nothing else when brother brown said talking on on the on the new birth he said he said i've preached this my entire life right amen amen but you know i've heard people that supposedly claim to believe this message and you know what they say if you believe in justification sanctification of the baptism of the holy ghost you know what pentecostal you don't believe this end time message if you believe that got it in black and white yeah because brother branham preached it it's receiving the holy ghost and that was it all you had to receive was holy ghost because brother brown preached the new birth different after yeah and they said well we're going to go to future home 1964 we'll show you we're going to 65. got you trumped 65. it's terrible that's right preach on predestination the full knowledge of god for knowledge out the window we don't believe that anymore chunked it yeah it's pentecostal that was you know that was something that brother branham preached after the seals preach it all all through it all through the message right chunk that out the window we don't do that anymore we got the revelation february 1965. i got one to trumpia november 1965 trying to do god of service yeah you know what he said he said not like you say i'll choose this one i'll choose that one right now wasn't for it was my foreknowledge he said he didn't use predestination the way you thought he did right by four knowledge but you know what try to show them that you think you think it's a joke but it's not right we go to these ministers meetings and sometimes it's sad i i honestly honestly it's sad you go in there and you try you try to explain something people and you know what they think you're a bully we got we have ministers our our pastors here brother dale and brother wade have been considered bullies the strong ones they call the strong bullies yeah i just tell i just call it what is i mean you know call white white black black it's bullies that's what they call them bullies you step on their pet doctrine you're a bully you know that's a new term if you hear if you watch the news or whatever you hear the news i thought bullying people get bullied all the time well we have a bullying spirit in this church praise the lord hey you know what brother dale i i'm honestly you tell me another minister in this message who's ever stood up and said as much as brother dale has and i want somebody to show me this got up and said my wife don't have to believe what i preach i just want her to understand it my kids don't have to believe what i preach but i want them to understand it you don't have to believe what i believe but i want you to understand it how many how many preachers do you know how many pastors do you know that'll do that they'll tell you if you don't believe what i do get out the door and make sure the door don't hit you you know someone amazed me brother man who said one time and they were they were asking and questions and answers and you know they were saying well you know should we come to we have to come to jeff and brother brown is the only one that can preach you know he's like you know you you read these you know if you listen to brother when he's when he's in question answer and he reads some of these questions you know you can tell they just catch him off guard and he's just like i mean it blows his mind that people are asking him these questions but that's what people believe and brotherhood said i'm not the only pebble on the beach how many times did he say you know brother you know brother snelling and different ones were out preaching he said you go and hear these brothers you go away or you go support them you know he didn't he didn't ever try to do away with fellowship right but you know what he wanted people to understand he wanted people to come to an understanding of what the scripture had to say you get your you get your understanding you can say whatever you want to then guess what it's it's time for us to be able to say what we believe and then you know you come and you say well show me exactly this is what the scripture said you showed me where it's where where it messes where it fails to follow the scripture because you know brother dale has always said you know you start with a white dog in the beginning you got to end with a white dog in the end and you know that's what he said jesus christ is saying yesterday today and forever if that's what he started with if that's the way he started then that's the way it's going to end right he don't change his ways he's he started a certain way and that's the way he's going to end now this is from this is from questions and answers you know brother i'm speaking and you know people people have put so much on on the new birth and you know they they make it well i was predestinated yeah you know they they come from here and you try to you try to tell them you come here lost you you come here as as the prophet told us you know we were all on our way to hell we you were all lost dying going to hell there was there was nothing except for the grace of god that passed by you one day but you know he knew that in the beginning amen but you know there was oh no no no no you know i was i was reading this and this is from question answers and i don't know if you some of you may have may have heard read this before but you know hey speaking of question answers and he's speaking of uh of peter and he's talking to the the early apostles there he says because your name is on the book of life because it is in heaven your name has been recognized he said that still doesn't mean you are saved your name is on the book now a lot of people put a lot of emphasis on that they've put a lot of emphasis on my name was on the lamb's book of life for the foundation of the world i was chosen in him and sometimes i still think people have getting that mixed up as he said because he says you were chosen in him not chosen of him and a lot of people still get one other point mixed up he chose you and hit you you know he came with you in him right right so you are a part of him amen he's not a part of you you were a part of him you're a part of him see people get all this mixed up they always try to make it's all me it's me me he's a part of me no go back to the beginning eve was a part of adam so you're a part of him he's not a part of you that's the reason you know you're he's not trying to match you you're trying to match him we're trying he said where i am you may be also so we're trying to go where he's at we're trying to become what he is he says you're not converted he said because your name is on the lamb's book of life because it is in heaven your name has been recognized that still doesn't mean you are saved you're not converted until you receive the holy ghost remember that you're only potentially converted he said if i ask if i if you ask me for a a oak tree and i give you an acorn potentially you have an oak tree potentially but isn't developed yet that's the reason i believe in the security as as the way i do if i ask for a cornfield and i see corn up that high potentially i have a corn field not it isn't developed yet something could happen now you're on your road through justification and sanctification to the baptism of the holy ghost but when you're genuinely baptized with the holy ghost you're in the kingdom and now you say brother branham is that true he said i don't have time to go through that he said i want you to look back here in the concordance and pick it up jesus told peter who had been saved and sanctified he trusted on jesus was sanctified saint john 17 17 he said jesus said jesus said sanctify them father through the truth thy word is the truth and he and the word is the same he said they were sanctified potentially through the truth the word the truth and then jesus told jesus or told peter the night of the betrayal he said after you are converted then strengthen your brethren then you're converted he said that man had followed him for three years and hadn't had name on lamb's book of life and had cast out devils done great works and healed and then all kind preached the word and everything and still wasn't converted see you're leading to conversion so when he told you know because he told peter he's you know because he said they came rejoicing and he said don't rejoice that the the spirits and the demons are subject to you but he said that your name is written on the book of life so you know he had all those things and he had preached the word and did all these great things and jesus had even breathed on them and told them to receive ye the holy ghost and they still hadn't received it and he had his name on the book of life and it still didn't give him the holy ghost he still wasn't born again he still wasn't converted so a lot of people they want to preach you know well i received you know because my name's on the book of life you know i came here with the seed in me and you know i was so i was so eternal and everything yeah it's mass confusion right exactly because there's one thing i still hadn't and you know wade has asked this many times and yet to have anybody really bring this to a point for anybody to understand how does god let dwell in an unclean vessel exactly if you know because if he's not going to take up his abode in you because he said he would have the holy ghost the fire of the holy ghost would come in and burn all of that out before he'd come in so he's not going to take up his residence in you until you've received that cleansing but he said peter and all of them they had received that and they still hadn't been converted so you can have all of this but you've not been converted you've not been changed and so that's the reason why there's mass confusion because until the holy ghost because brother adam said in christ the mystery he said that's the only divine ruler of the word is the holy ghost he said how big when he the holy ghost is come the spirit of truth is come he said he'll lead you and guide you into all truth until you receive that you will you can't go any further and see sometimes people you know we've had people that have had the holy ghost they i believe they're born again but they have the same problem that brother branham told the pentecostals he said you you bet cabbage down right there and he said you never went any further amen and there's lots of people they cabbage down that's it they've got on all you can't tell them nothing i don't i don't believe that that they're not children of god but you know what and because brother when you go back and you read the adoption series he said you know they were children right galatians tells us they they were children that were born and but you know what they did not come to the place that the father had for them until they come through the tudors and the schoolmasters and brought them to the place that they could receive the signet and the ring and have and receive the symbol to know where they were standing to have that bestowed upon them you know you go back through the old testament you know jacob and esau you know you know when you look at the uh the birthright you know what they still had to come even though they were the first board they still had to come to a place of learning they had to come to a place of growth to receive that birthright they just weren't given the birthright just because they were children so there had to become a time they've had they had to grow they had to work amen see sometimes we we fail to understand that's the reason it's so important to understand the foreknowledge of god to understand predestination because you know i have a friend of mine that you know he's uh he helps us out he works for heat and air company to come to work with us sometimes we have different issues stuff but he's got he's got a daughter that's 30 years old one that's 22. he's got a son that's 22. anyway and he was talking about he said all i want you know just get them out on their own i want to be on their own you know on their own on their own two feet and you know what he said they come right back he said my daughter bless her heart she's got two kids now and he said ever since she's she was 16 years old and got her first job she still ain't never learned how to handle money and you know and you stand there and he said you know i don't know what i do he said you work with them you work with them work you and you know what she comes right back and you know it's like she got a job and she got a car and i don't get too far off but you know he you know he was talking about you know she spends money on everything else and then she's oh my car got repo'd and he was like and he was like he was like okay start looking all the money where did he go oh he had this and that's like listen there's one thing you do you take care of your car but you know it's the same way it's the same growth pattern spiritually it's the same thing people go around the same mountain just like the children of israel going around the same mouth going through the same thing the same place and you know what you go places and you and you see and it and i honestly can say i've had the same thing happen to me god will come by and he'll speak something to you and you know what it's it's your word of deliverance it's your word for you to step forward for you to come beyond where you're at and you know what we miss him we have we miss him and then sometimes i wonder why i'm in the same plot why because sometimes it comes back to you it's like oh yeah sorry lord i remember that forgive me for being stupid i should have caught that he's got that big flash inside come this way step this way and we miss him so lord why don't you help me you know it's just like heard a man say one time talking about he said a lot a lot of people a lot of christians he said they're like mules they said they're hard-headed he said the you'll talk tom talks on top and you know he said the only thing that god can use to get their attention hit him with a 2x4 he said hit him with a 2x4 and you know what they start singing he touched me oh he touched me but that's all but see god's trying to bring us to a place he's got your word of deliverance but you know what we'll miss it and there's lots of other people that have missed him but you know what i i thank god that we we have the ministry that we that we have here for the simple fact that you know there's people all around the world that have heard the truth there's people out there hungering for the truth and you know what we've been able to give it to them amen we've been able to bless people and whether they agree with it or not whether they do anything with it they've been able to hear they've been able to hear the truth so i thank god that we've had that in our day that god has given us the truth that we've that we've heard we'll finish up here in a minute this is from this is what i want to read christ the mystery of god revealed brother brown says look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation of christ life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible a complete revelation of christ christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what he's trying to do what is the new birth then well brother brandon what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you not that you joined a church or shook hands you called some message preacher your pastor and you said under him for x number of years i go to brother so-and-so's church but i've never anybody ever gets the idea that brother dale's my pastor they don't get you anywhere you know what a lot of people a lot of people have a lot of head knowledge have a lot of things intellectually you know what i wish everything that i had in my head was revelation glory but you know what that's not what is what it's going to take brother brown says he said but all this mystery is revealed only as he promised in the bible hell is against this truth of the revelation of this mystery but the bride is standing on it that's her stand he said why do you hunger church why do you thirst it's the father trying to reveal his hidden secret to you but he says but you let so many things get it out of you he said you let your job you let your wife you let your husband you let your children you let the cares of life you let some some pastor you let something else get that out of you when you know that the way down in your heart there's a thirsting hungry it's god trying to reveal it to you the revelation amen he said the last day is here then we can see that the marriage supper is at hand now if i never see you again remember the marriage supper is at hand then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issu is issued in the great millennium this is from two different places i'm sorry it's not all the same same reading but it's just two quotes together that i wanted to read the taking up of the church and the destroying of the wicked he said in the world under the sixth seal is to be purified by volcanic take away all the corruption and sin of the world and to mold her out out again and to bring forth a bright new millennium for the age that is to come when we see all these great threefold revelations god in christ christ in the church and the kingdom coming adam and eve redeem back to the garden of ede in the reserve in the representation of christ and his bride and the kingdom is going to be restored again to his promise praise be to god amen he said he's he said satan's against this mystery he said he said but we love it amen right amen and he said when the bride recognizes who she is he said she will he said that when the bride recognizes who she is he said then the rapture will go amen let's all stand up amen and that's the time that we're looking for amen i believe i believe we're in the rapture now amen amen why because we've heard the shout right yes we've heard the word amen and as the as brother branham i mean brother dale's talking about brother brown you know he spoke of a rapture taking place and then by the scripture spoke of it but by the seventh angel coming speaking of the rapture he set the things in motion amen and i believe i believe that because it took brother branham and it it took god through brother branham right i never because i understand that here i can say brother brandon brother branham and it's not a it's not an issue but i want people to understand if somebody's listening i want people to understand i'm talking about god speaking through a man i'm not speaking of just a man speaking his own intelligence but i'm speaking of of god coming down and speaking through a man to set this this thing in motion that's how this thing has been set in order to take place that we now are in the rapture he said he said what did the seventh seal do he said it was in the ushering end of the millennium they don't put us in the millennium but it puts us toward the millennium why because we have received i believe i believe we received the word i believe that angel has come down he said time shall be no more right why because we're not we're not being bound by time we have stepped into eternity why because see would you understand one thing see luther's time had had time to it luther's age why because the word was for a time right luther's time had it was for a certain time that was that was for that time wesley was for a certain time pentecost was for a certain time but you know what we received in the last day we don't have a time why was because we received eternity one because it was all of the scripture is opened up so you know what that was becoming christ coming open to us so it's become eternity because it's the fullness amen there's not going to be any anybody else beyond us exactly right glory we are the last gentiles that are going to receive the word when it leaves because when we leave out of here it's going to the jews because you know what you and i are standing in a great place we are we are blessed people right you can stand you can talk to anybody else you know what they don't see what you see you know you can talk to your blue in the face but you know what there's nobody else that's going to take a rapture but this but this endtime bride the people that have heard this word you know it takes more than but it takes more than just hearing it right it's got to become true it's got to become real to you it's got to become a revelation to you it's got it's got to become part of who you are exactly see that is that is the richest of the glory and i didn't even get i didn't even get to the scriptures in ephesians where he talks about the riches of his grace to us because that is the riches of his grace to each one of us is to see who we are to where we're standing exactly that's right see if if we ever come to the concept and and i know that we will brother madam said we will but you know if you ever come to the place to understand who you are all right see so you know because you know satan is saying just like brother bob somebody this morning you know say he's going to beat you you know you know me and by the way we were laughing this morning because you know hey we've been there we know what it's like you get up here with something and you think well i've got i've got you can have 25 pages of notes and not have nothing to say you got nothing that you get up here and you can preach for hours exactly and you know and if any any preacher ever gets up and say oh i understood all this and you know if you're not if you're if you're a minister and you ever you're up here ministering and you know you're amazed at what you say sometimes right you ask any minister that's ever ever ever just be real honest you know you're you're amazed at what you preach sometimes why because it's not you right that's right but see that it becomes us this word becomes you it becomes me if we ever come to the place we understand who we are you know it's if you have a need if you have a need you know what it's it's not i'm waiting on god lord just give me something you know what it's already inside of me exactly just says joshua you know he told the son to stand still and go back because you know he was in a fight because he was commissioned to do something you know what we are in the same we are commissioned to do something you know that's the reason you when you stand up you can pray for somebody you can call for things you know sometimes everybody say you know what you hear lots of times you know just don't don't don't jump higher than you live don't jump higher than you live now well listen if you can't jump a little bit and get happy you don't need to be an altar and that goes for me too because you know what we're supposed to be we're supposed to have things under the blood we're supposed to be jesus christ we're supposed to be free we're supposed to have the word to make us free that's right people people that's all i got we just don't get too excited now well you know what something ought to make you happy amen you know god didn't i don't believe god put us down here to be sad you know i don't think god put us down here for the only thing to make us happy is things that happen in the world right as you know as i say brother bob talk about this morning you're walking down this street and the holy ghost speaking to him you know what he when he heard the word and something quickened in the word and people around him have enough and having an effect on people around you hey you may not run up down the aisles you may not walk on the back of the pews or whatever but you know what i think somebody has should have some kind of emotion exactly because brother branham said you know if it don't have emotion it's dead right it needs to be buried you know i've said this before and i'll say it again but you know you know some people some people act like they're so ashamed to raise their hands in church some people are so ashamed to clap their hands you know what that was a sign of victory in the old testament you know what they raised up holy hands it was a sign of victory you know they clapped their hands for joy all right bro well do you have joy if you've got something then you know what you can express it and if not then you know what i'm just gonna i'm just gonna claim it and i'm going to act like i got it he's the high priest of my confession so i'm going to confess it till it comes all right because you know what i you know if i don't have something that i'm looking for by the way you know what i'm going to get happy because i can confess what he's saying right exactly glory i can stand up and say guess what god promised it to me and i don't have it but you know what i can claim it right and i can get happy about that see if we can understand what god has been doing all this time revealing his word to us that we can understand what the reaches of this word is to us claim what's yours exactly let's claim reclaim what's mine right i don't know when it's coming or how it's going to happen but you know what he said it was going to and he would do it right right amen god bless you amen if you have a need this evening do you like prayer are you just claiming where you're at that is fine tomorrow's tyler's birthday oh her sister here is asking you know she said tyler's birthday's tomorrow and she's standing for him but she said everybody's kids everybody's grandkids their husbands their wives whoever glory if it's your family and you claim them then you know what we claim them amen and she said let's let's pray you know what and and don't pray lord do something thank the lord for it exactly lord you promised him and i'm gonna thank you for it all right gloria say i thank you lord because you promised me and i can ask right and then you do whatever you have to lord if it's changing me to get me out of their way sometimes sometimes we don't we don't believe that we want to turn our kids over to the lord well maybe sometimes what what need what they need is they need to see you maybe you're the maybe you're god's representative maybe you're the one that they see god in and maybe that's what we need to have them see god in us amen that's what i want people to say i want people to know i want them to see him and me amen you know there's a song that was written and it says when they looked they beheld him when i spoke they could hear him when i walked my every footstep carrick led them all to calvary he said give someone else worldly fame but when someone else speaks his name let them recall they first saw him in me amen that's a that's a that's powerful words that every time i've heard that song i want somebody to know when they say just like just like that lady whose husband was a drunk and they were asking about they couldn't find the christians that i know where one's at i want people to know that when they point to somebody they say that's a christian exactly that's right let's just all bow our heads and pray right now and believe right and thank god for it father we thank you for this time lord that we've come lord that you've laid this on our sister's heart here to come and lord for all of these lord our young our loved ones all these young people lord jesus lord tyler here that lord he's he's went away but lord just as the prodigal son he went away but lord he came to a time he realized you know where he stood he said is so much better in his father's house lord there was a place to go back to and lord there's so many here

things lord because you promised it but you said for us to ask that our joy might be full and lord we ask and we thank you for it and we believe it glory and we we just committed all to you in the name of jesus christ amen amen happy birthday you all happy birthday to you every happy birthday to you and the best year you've been and only he can change your heart and thank you peace jesus the wealth you could obtain for only satisfy your souls i am praise him i'm going to crazy amen i'm going to share one thing with you i was have a friend on facebook a girl i used to go to school with and she had asked for prayer she's a nominational christian she was on the on the way to church i think it was like two sundays ago sunday morning and her son was in the back seat and he had some juice or something he had a granola bar and he was eating and he started to cry and panic and then she looked back and she saw him and he's only like five six something like right in there and it said it looked like just like a stroke it hit him he said he was paralyzed on one side and his face had drawn down just like you know you see somebody had a stroke and he said all that granola bars throwing out his mouth and he couldn't talk to her they're just crying and she said just pulled over she really panicked and she went the car in some driveway and she ran over and she jerked him up and she started praying and she said he just faced this came back just like just like that quickly just boom well they took him to the doctor and she was praying you know she was requesting prayer that that they had to take him to the doctor and they run and test on him everything right and they find anything wrong with him and you know she was just thanking everybody for praying and you know what you know when you hear something like it just really touches your heart but you know it god is real right and the doc and the doctors center said i can't explain it they said that they thought it was a momentary lapse of bell palsy you know how it but usually i don't usually i think they're just you're kind of paralyzed i don't know if you draws your face like that as hard like it's almost like a stroke did but you know it was so amazing that he was there just happened and god came down and touched him and they said they can't find anything wrong with him thank you lord and you're just
