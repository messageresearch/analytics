thank you bless each one remember the sick among us you said you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so this blessing got each one have your way now and keep us Lord in Jesus name Amen showing one maybe this will begin to be opening up a little bit to us and to give us a little better understanding because I'm trying to express something and I've been doing it for many years but it kind of keeping the point or talk before you but yet not opening up so far to just say things you know but to be something that I can decode has been on my heart for about probably 15 20 years something on the Godhead and I've been speaking on it and trying to bring it just a little more at a time a little more at a time and you think I repeat myself well that's good weary keep repeating ourselves and until we get it but if you'd watch you would see that I move up a little bit I do that deliberately I bring it and I move up a little bit I bring it and I move up a little bit so you know maybe you need to listen more careful and say well you know what he didn't bring it that way the last time it might open up a little better unto it okay now in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by who made by the word and without the word without him not anything made that was made not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and the light shyness in darkness and the darkness there's no way the darkness could comprehend light because light automatically puts out darkness it doesn't matter how dark it is strike one match that light will put out all the darkness all right see but you can pile all your darkness you want to up and keep piling it on that match it won't put that match out there's no way because it is the word okay we've been on the thought here and we'll pick it up a little bit so let's go to 2nd Corinthians 5 and we'll begin verse 1 well we know that if our earthly house of this Minako were dissolved we have a building of God in house not made with hands eternal in the heavens for in this we groan earnestly desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall be shall not be found naked for we know we know what for we that are in this tabernacle and then do groan being burdened all right not for that that we should be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life and he that hath brought us for the self same thing is god who also hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit you may be seated the Lord that is listening to the reading of the word now I want to try to keep you know dwelling on some things until you get it oh you know but now what we'll be doing today if I can get through this morning I will try but if not I will do it next Sunday you know to try to get everything in the line because I want to make sure you keep it in a line and a thought all right now what I want to do today is talk about that we've been back before time we've been back you know in eternity zand showing and they're things like that and we'll repeat some of that coming down but yet my whole purpose has been in mind is to get us to think about how that it will eventually come down to where we are all right if you're talking about before the foundation of the world we've been talking about how God condescended downwardly to reveal himself to man all right there was no way to just you know him to be able to just step out and and that would be it you know because there would be no way to understand because you said well you could but cause you can look and see you could see him you know he would be standing there yes that may be true but remember the devil can impersonate all of the things and he could be standing there also but if you descend slowly from and that's maybe a hard way of saying it but it's the best way to I know and I believe that's what God has done he has so slowly unfolded himself down to reveal himself to you and I all right now we said well we just believe it's God you know why do we need to know all of this and all of that we just believe it was God well everybody in the world believes his God so what do you got you know we believed it when wizna Baptist we believed it and we're the messages we believed it was in the Catholic we believe we believe in God well sure that's why you don't hear me throw those people because they do believe in God but you know what that was where were you an hour and a time no I've always believed it this away but I just you know well that's our haptics it's up to you to keep on being deceived but now thinking about the great eternal God and how he's condescended to reveal himself to you and I why would that not be the greatest goal of any Christian life I mean if you believed it if you believed you had a totem pole and it was these to be in the image of your God wouldn't you want to study that totem pole to see what you could know about him where he come from and what he is what he's made of and and all the things wouldn't you want to do it that one well why wouldn't you want to do within God to that much more of understanding the greater extent of understanding to to be able to comprehend a living God to manifest himself - you and I all right now but yet thinking about him and thinking of how that he's condescended and to think that he has he doesn't uh he said I'm God and I change not he said well he changed what if - that no no that's where the problem we think he changed no he didn't change he just transformed into another form just like you you as when you got married you become a husband then with children come along you become a father and then a grandfather and a great-grandfather and on and on that what you didn't change you just manifested more of your nature and your ways and the things comes into being all right and that's the way that I believe God is doing to reveal itself to you and I but now what I want to do today is if I can get through if I don't I'll finish it next week I want to talk about how Jesus Christ came into being all right cover that part and then cover the way Adam came into being uh-huh and cover that part and then cover how you and I came into being all right okay then that way you know we can say well we've got it lined up at least we understand the Scriptures because we can follow it down all right so then we've spent a quite a time speaking about in previous messages that we don't believe in an eternal sonship all right but we believe that God Himself condescended into another form our took on another phone what's the way you want to express it you do your terminologies I'm not into all of that I just look at it the way that I see God how that he would unveil himself and he could not be made known without it coming the way that it came now you say well they could have done this he could have done that well you know the Bible says that who was backwards you back there I believe it's in the book of Job in it was you back there to tell me how to do these things oh that's wonderful in it we think we're smarter than his now remember one thing the way God came is the only way God could come he couldn't come another way cuz he'd be changing his mind his daughter is being or whatever so then why not just think about the way that he came and it's a wonderful understanding too to be able to you know we talked about God when we were in the Methodist Baptist Presbyterian Catholics or whatever we were we talked about God we prayed to God we we worship God we see now it's becoming more personal to line up into a fellowship with the very being himself that created us all right beginning to understand why we're here and what we're doing we're just not a not on the log it has happened to be a Polliwog one time and a frog the next time and a just out of the other the next time and I never didn't know how they got from the alligator to the bird that was one of them it was in that theory of Darwin somewhere when tonight was coming up believe you come from an alligator to a bird there's a lot of chains art had to be done but but listen see we've been talking about that we don't believe in eternal sonship no but we believe that the Son of God was God made manifest in another form a simple in you are a son and then you have children that's in another form it just keeps unfolding as it comes down alright but see really what we look at see he's in another form called a Sun and that's were that see the people of the message that can handle it pretty good and talk about things a little bit they it's hard for them to go back i watch this ever since being in the message he's hard for them to back up in eternity and talk about a Sun because automatically your mind clicks insists that at work because automatically your mind says wait a minute you back an eternity in you're talking about a son a son at the beginning their son had a beginning they then you've messed it out but if we just think about that back in eternity before the world or anything ever begun God himself just unveiled another form maybe that's the way of saying maybe instead of stepping over into or whatever you want to do use your terminologies your thought in your mind to understand but yet we know he he didn't change himself but he changed the way he was doing and he condescended downward to to be see then you would come up with John one or you would come into the word and it would say you know in the beginning was the word workers we've got in the Word was God alright see that's not a with God it's never over here now it's God revealing himself alright so he stepped down from the great eternity z-- and brought into being the word great words we used logo a theophany see we where we like to think about that we know them big old theological words but do we know what it means see then we can we bring it out that the word was the creator all right and being the Creator God the word would be easily called a son not another God not another being but the same being stepping into another form that our minds can start comprehending what is taking place all right so he steps over into another form called the word and he begins to create who the great eternal God seek begins to create in another form and is like I said to you over and over we went through the scriptures we brought it down from Genesis all the way the same God creator all the way through the word but is talking about the great eternal God within that great eternal God has made flesh among us all right now that flesh man Jesus he never created not because he was a creation himself all right see then I've told you over and over but yet been to look at it the father never created the he stepped into another form to reveal himself or condescend downward just like you are your father rather than your father all right now how would you say you know the Bible is full of dust saith the LORD right all right and we know that when it finally come to Jesus Christ he never said thus saith the Lord show and he was Almighty God all right now that's enough proof to prove it but he never said thus saith the Lord but all you prophets said thus saith the Lord why because God was using the vessels to speak and the Prophet was standing here I don't say looking Dehradun whatever but yet he was saying thus saith the Lord and other words God was speaking through him to bring it out but then we come over to David and Zion to showing that how great it would be see David would not say to us say the Lord David would say in the spirit he would say they pierced my hands and my feet or or saw them whenever was wanted was to do anything he would speak those things showing that it would eventually come in to a greater form because he we don't look in the Old Testament to find the Son of God because our human minds think of a time that he had to dwell on earth but that is the flesh man that inward man the soul does the often is we call it the inward part we'll get to that more today trying to describe it because what it is it's a word body it's a word form body that's worth for the Prophet all right it's simply God moving over into another one form and speaking but what's the difference then listen God says to a prophet you know go down and tell this go down till that go down and say this or that the Prophet goes down and he starts describing what's going to take place of Nineveh or whatever we're thinking on the sea and you know Jonah and he says looks back he tells this this this going on he said that's dust saith the Lord well you know what he has delivered to mankind the voice of Almighty God there is it right see that's why your prophet would say thus saith the Lord because it was it was not just saying to your mind that wouldn't work now had he moved over into a New Testament form you can get to the to that and understand it but as long as he's back darzee he's coming forth and he's using that say it the Lord meaning God is speaking through a vessel God speaking see through a vessel but then to show you what it was going to turn out to be and you never thought of this why would he come forthwith with David and M speaking in the first person I mean that's a wonderful thing see that moves a little closer than thus saith the Lord David didn't say thus saith the Lord they pierced my hands and my feet no David in the spirit spoke of what would take place meaning the son of God now listen because I'm trying to express something to you meaning the son of god was back there speaking through the prophets of the dust at the Lord now watch this in a minute and it'll open that wild prophet would say something why would he say he said we see mount 70 he said but then we see no more of melchester day he said because melchester day become Jesus Christ no charity become Jesus Christ is that another person no we got to keep the same thought all right all right see God begins to condescend and reveal itself and as he does see those prophets would say thus saith the Lord but then it would move into a little higher form with David and Solomon enough and they would prophesy our speed as though they were the very one that was talking and David didn't say you know well they'll pierce his feet no he said they pierced my hands and my feet just like it was happening to him well you know what in spirit it was it was happening that's what David would say by the spirit the Lord said unto my lord the big doctrine in the message now called to lords but you know what I never didn't hear that person use that thought I'm honest as can be I never heard I heard a lot of the messages of the brother trying to understand what he was talking about but I never heard him try to use that form see because it's not to lords see the Lord said unto my lord this is the Lord this is the Lord it's just a cordon who's talking same person just another form we're familiar with the word sin morphe the terms we talk that means change in form but not change in person no change in personality but change in form to make itself known all right as I said those prophets they would you keep gonna pray for me because this thing's bothering me then he says I got pneumonia I on a map Omonia but not know you have a lot of oh but listen thinking about the great eternal God to reveal himself and the way he done it he could never do it any other way so he would come down he would become the word he would create and the things would take place but then he wouldn't leave that's why I love that statement to prophet made it he really really shoulder thing that when he said when he created man said even though he's sinned he said he never went back off and left him I love that he said he'd come right down to live with us what in a sinful condition to live with us not to Quall somewheres else has been me and you we didn't throw the thing down and walk out wouldn't what think about it all right she's in those prophets as they'd say thus saith the Lord he meant God was using the vessel to speak forth well do you know what the words they say it now listen I slow it down a little bit okay the words those prophets said I'm asking you a question was not that word just as much a part of God as it would be if God said himself are you listening he's not that word no matter if it spoke by donkey or a bird they don't change the word the word is real and see how close those prophets were to the eternal God then as I said to show that it was going to change and come power David will say they pierced my hands and my feet that's a higher form or a greater understanding than it would be to say they're gonna pierce his feet and it was thus saith the Lord you know he didn't say it that way alright now getting the point of seeing how that he condescended God Himself condescended to reveal himself to mankind now if you rejected the words of those prophets would there be any difference in the rejection of the words of a prophet than to reject the words of God himself if he was standing there would it be any different see what that's all we think we don't see God well that bald head going up lowball head you know what I've always said about that who was the one that kept telling us their kids and the kids when I turned talking about old bald head who was that mom and daddy almond daddy's one calling him ol ball here called mom and daddy didn't believe God was speaking through the man oh yeah every once in a while he gets it good because when he rides on me right when he brags on me that's God but said when he tells me that I'm doing wrong that's not God well I didn't know God changed that much but anyhow getting the point that that eternal God begin to condescend downward and as he moved in he became the word and then he could say let there be all right let there be and things would come into being who've the word now who was that word now come on let me ask you this for it makes a statement how many years it allow you been here and hear me made it what is the new birth what is the new birth and many times you heard me explain that for it's the birth of the word right it's the word made alive oh no it's you Gibson it's just see that's where you you're still open a costal the new birth is a birth of the word well I keep that thought in mind for a minute if it's the birth of the word then you see how it comes from glory and you'll see why Jesus said what he said cuz in plain language when he said to Nicodemus you must be born again you know what brother Brown he said they're right he said you must be born original says you must be born from above where I was born from that's really what he was saying to Nicodemus all right coming in to a form that we talked about it's called the word all right and as that word came down that that word would be the offspring of God you were thinking while ago about the new birth is being a birth of the word so why not think about the birth of the word would be God birthing himself in you as a son and daughter of God all right see not God the Son that's trinitarianism but the son of God see we're still we had that you know we believed God the Father God the Son and God the Holy Ghost no there's no such thing in the Bible within the Bible there is no son of God and see that's where we don't keep our thinking in the right order when we talk about son we think about the beginning and we try to figure out some beginning instead of thinking about the condescending of Almighty God down word that we could see in and he would reveal himself to us and it would be the word now when I talk about the word you don't you'll get it in a minute so I'm gonna let here in a hurry when I'm talking about word of God I'm not talking about dead letters on the page now Paul's done made that plain the letter killeth right but the Spirit gives life so I'm not talking about dead letters on the page now I ain't talking about something you read I'm talking about something that when it's made alive to you then you are seeing that Almighty God just as real as it would be if you were standing before the foundation world dwelling with him all right we'll see it's not God the son but the son of God in other words the word made alive make it now listen let's hold it to his part for a while see it's not God the Son we don't believe in eternal son ships and all different things like that all right well we believe that God himself reveals himself in another form called a son now why would it be called a son because you got to figure out some way to get his children here and I have to put that in because it is what am I going to say why would it be called the son God why wouldn't it just call the word see we could get by if it was called the word we could get by with using the terminologies of mankind but remember I invite you if you got a Scofield Bible I invite you to go back to the creation and even read what he says when he says the son of God was the word see the son of God is not a beginning of a God he never had in the beginning so why would you have the second person to have a beginning or the third or whatever he never had no beginning it's the same God as he reveals himself as he makes himself known in another form and he's called the word now you're to John 1 in the beginning was the word with God remember though 1 Genesis I mean John 1 is back for the foundational world you transfer it down to Genesis 1 and then it says God created heaven the earth now you're bringing it down to tense abilities we're we've been all of this time for months now still up in heaven and we're trying to condescend a little bit downward now and as we condescend downward to and we're talking about the world as it was back there which was the Son of God not if he had a beginning it's the same God we talk about Jesus being a son of God right no he was not just a son of God as another person he was that God made manifest in another form the same God but I'll make this statement or you can think about it there's a whole lot more to this than just what we say who did Jesus pray to and then we say who do you pray to there was a communication gap between see that's where I hold it and people don't want to follow that line don't bring that father out of heaven yeah but you're a tunas mm-hmm don't bring that father out of heaven and it even change your form and come down and kind of send down through those forms but yet he himself stays the great eternal or else how are you gonna call Jesus a great eternal God if you don't condescend slowly okay watch now all right see Jesus was now watching Jesus then was the son of God not God the Son he was the son of God the word made alive making him by the word being alive making him the son of God are a child of God generally no problems with that I could take the same person and keep descending and don't have any problems because see you buy the new birds will get down into you become a child of God but you're not another God you'd the same God made manifest as a child may I quote brother Branham I did the other day there he said dar he was like a child play in before the father's door in the creation instead he said let her be and that comes forth he said like a child there's no trouble using those terminologies but yet he was still believing it correct all right see all right not another person but the same God that was in heaven is now condescending toward earth we're beginning to gradually move out of the Eternity sin bringing it to war to earth all right see then the son of God was the father in another form called a son I'm quoting brother Branham the father me may he manifest himself in another form and you can call him a son of God because any child of God is this child of God her son and daughter of God all right see now John one should be becoming more clearer unto us because that son the Prophet we gave them back there the other day questions and answers on Hebrews that God begin to move out into another form called a son and then he could create see now you can hold your scriptures correctly God created Genesis God created this God created God Chris and then it comes over said ever it created all things by Jesus Christ well you know what he's like I trying to do that last Sunday then that means one thing for certain to me that person I'm talking about is God I was trying to prove he was God in the beginning of doing the creation and it was guarding and he was creating a body a rod he's still created he's creating us a new body not a new like another he's making this body new see that way we coming to the understanding all right brother Brown said on the message who is God he said out of the bosom of the Father came the son what not he stayed up here another one over here and that's moving over there he just changes his form to reveal himself to whatever form he wants to do and he would have to condescend to Word to speech because the word low-cost and think it means speech breath right Jesus comes over in his Bible I'm in darkness scripture and he breathed on the disciples and says receive ye the Holy Ghost they didn't get it right then they didn't get it till the day of Pentecost but yet he breathed on them now would he would they have ever been a Pentecost if he hadn't to breathe these are four units and they let down and you ain't got no leg to stand on now you don't understand it because see once he said that that proved he was the creator god when he breathed on them disciples he spoke them into exists has to become the children of God and he spoke you and I into the same existence they would have to go to Pentecost and get the word breath word that they had held made alive right they become a children of God okay now then we covered that in Romans 1 and 8 the Bible says that he was declared to be the Son of God with power he was declared to be the son of God now can we get into a thought brother branham made and you have to listen real careful he says now he said there's no scripture where he called himself son God now I'm quoting from one message right he said there's no scripture and he was called himself son of God see he called himself son of man and that's exactly right because the son of man was that man flesh that was standing there but the Bible would say he was declared to be the Son of God then brother Branham comes along later what about him what about a prophet they would make a statement he makes a statement of it he says in other words show me the scripture he says where Jesus ever said he was a son God he comes on he holds that thought he's right and he says see that he said you say well where did they get the you say from him saying it he said you say that Jesus never declared himself to be the Son of God he said see there he did because he was the word now that is that a direct contradiction now because he never declared himself to be the Son of God when he was declared himself to be the Son of man but yet all the way through he was declared even to the king you know he said what was it he said unto this end was I born he said in other words not born to be the son of God and see you say well you deal with me and you said what brother Dale you just confused no I didn't confuse you but you got brother Brown saying one day that he can't call him this on the block then he got another was served where he did call him song God so evidently a lot of people didn't understand what he wasn't saying okay get the thought declared to be the Son of God the power and the resurrection it says in that scripture all right he was declared to be the Son of God with the three Hebrew children because he was the preserver he was not the son of man in that situation and the king said we told one a43 announcer now these four and said one of them looks like the son of God because like I've always said hey the guy had a little sense he looked down in there and he saw forward he needed a third three in and he looks back and he says where did that other guy come from and said if that thing so hot it burns up and killed him out here and who's been protecting these people all night long and said he can't be nothing but just gonna go you know what he was declaring to be Almighty God come on King was declaring him to be the Almighty God not just a son of God couldn't you if he could see him he was seeing something and he the could see it he'd have to call it a son come on church but the Bible said and we're still with him trying to converse in the Bible said God want to read what the prophet said here in just a minute in Colossians it says in him dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily in him who the flesh man dwelt the fullness of the Godhead bodily right that was Almighty God the Creator that I told you there was talking about Sunday that Peter said thou art the Christ the Son of the Living God he was saying you are the Creator God there is no other god beside you Peter when when he said that Jesus said well you didn't get the whole story about the Son of Man but said you got enough to build a church on the church is built on the revelation of Jesus Christ being what one true and living God listen called the word called the son he didn't have any problems then we shouldn't have any problems why because of knowing the way he came now listen to the way he came then we'll read it I know ain't gonna get to it that's alright Jesus Christ the word created all things you go with me so that means you had to be Almighty God so we don't believe in such a persons or a son and eternal son ships or anything we believe in God making himself manifest in many forms our ways just as we are any many forms in ways and the Bible says even the eternal Godhead can be understood by the things that we see you're a father you're human you're a son you're your grandfather you're what you know just looking at ourselves and see Almighty God come into clarity to where we can understand alright but now think about it he came as the creator the word now watch him now who is the creator word the son of God now God the Son not another person the son of God the word was back there to create right and Paul could call him Jesus Christ because he knew that the flesh was not to point you done that but it was the Christ but he knew Jesus was Almighty God made manifest in another form called the son now watch the way he the sins he creates he does all the things he's back there he's back to her in a mighty way are you falling with me he was there in a mighty way who was it that pulled the skins off of those animals and throw them back guard for Adam and Eve to put on well I'm trying to get you to see how it really is no he just a spirit on plain language spirits can't pull skin off you got to get something a little more tangible right all right so who was that that stood in the garden who was that it came down each day in the garden and talked with his children who was that that when sin entered the picture he didn't run off and leave them he come down and he pulled the skin off the manimals well yeah I've always believed God and I make it real I would've gone I could make him so real you could see him standing here if you ever see him by the our faith you will see more about how tangible he is when I saw him at 11 years old I had no problems understanding and knowing something real was standing there I've seen him since then a lot of times okay all right that's why I don't have no problem you can believe it if you want to that's nothing to me because it ain't gonna put no feather in my hat and you're not gonna believe it unless God reveals it was listening to at a place not where brother Branham was talking about as he's called the house and he was talking about the people and he said but they can't believe it that's what he said he said what they can't believe it he's a prophet telling people it's like why he was bringing out the other night you know the word brother brother said it's gone from you there's no way for you to know it I said right around to coming to the Lord what's it's gone from you well what about all the people sitting there I know what he's talking about why don't I got it he's just gone from you oh that was some secret thing that he was to know okay it's gone from me no problem no troubles it still signs on me it's gone from all right listen then the word was the Creator so he condescended down from being the great eternal in the word form now watch him tell you what that word form is and then you'll understand more about the message so let's pick that thought up with her brothers we'll go over to to number two okay let's pick up number two on the notes this is taken and this will be for most of it will be taken from who's this Melchizedek and watch him now in the beginning God dwelt along with his attributes as I spoke of this morning that's his thoughts as I said you know that's this house there was nothing just God alone but he had thoughts just like a Great Architect can sit down in his mind and draw out what do you think it's he's going to to bill create now he's talking about the architect he cannot create he can take something that's been created and make it out of different not like that but he gets in his mind what he wants all right that's not the way with God see that's what's out then it's he speaks it that's the architect guy all right he's the word then I thought when it's expressed is the word now we get into God I thought Express is a word but it has to be a thought first so it's God's attributes then it becomes a thought then a word notice those who have eternal life was with him and in him in his thinking before there wasn't even an angel of fear of him or anything that's eternal if you have eternal life he always was not your being here but to shape and form that the infinite God okay not our beings are doing all the things okay drop one over now okay let's see now go ahead number four can we pick up that point I just want you to get this four we get through go ahead to number four word right still taken who it is Melchizedek paragraph 64 just a continual reading garden desist this stage of his creation later formed into flesh Jesus know from what from the great beginning spirit then he came down to be the word bringing itself out the word doesn't yet make itself listen it's just spoke out in morphe later he becomes flesh now watch that in a minute you've got two thousand years from the beginning creation to come to Jesus Christ kinda watch him later he becomes flesh Jesus Mortal to taste that for all of us sinners when abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the final in ever son of Abraham ever son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing but I want you to watch how we have to come now think about it you know that Abraham met the word Abraham met God in theophany the word now he said ever some of the faith would have to do the same now we're not going up into heaven and God set us down teach us a whole lot we better get the idea and write this down here is worse gonna take place right I think do what he wants to when he gets dire but we got to get there first so we got to get something here to get us dire is that plain enough how about ever son of the faith meeting Melchizedek that's what he said he said every son in the faith would do the same as Abraham what did they round me why did brethren spend all of that time and people saying you mean to tell me now that that Melchizedek was God he said it was Almighty God right Abraham I don't talk to him fellowship with him but one day he met him and Gudrun said he met him in he saw him and theophany read who is this melt shattered if you will and read it over and over and over see you I don't get that part but that's alright yes you'll do it because you'll do it anyway you won't go read what I asked you to read and then you're confused about what I say about what he said well at least if you read what he said you would know I said what he said right I mean at least you'd know that you'd have to say what he thought he said that but if you don't go look it up you don't know whether he said it or not you guess an editor trying to hit on this but if you go read it well you're just reading it the way you won't read nothing okay I guess I can read this away and you can read this away I thought John was John I thought cat was kid I thought there was 20 how many 26 letters in the alphabet and it takes all of them to make all these words on this page that's why I see I print them out and give them to you you know yourself what most of the preachers do come on one of these days you'll wise up a lot of them quotes you what Brett around said but there's not verbatim a lot of it's not verbatim a lot of it is what they think he said at least I tell you give it to you where you can read it okay what you do with it after then if you ain't got enough to go home and look up and listen to a message of who is this melchester dick but you know what do we do now I'm not throwing off on her brother I loved him but I made a statement one time I said see there we need to read a message you know in him titled mastered yo who's this Mel Chad we need to read the book you know what the brother got mad at me about he got mad at me because that I said we need to read it and he said I was throwing off on him because he couldn't read you say people won't do it you're sitting there doing it right now letting those little boogers get on your shoulder and talk to you about what with the brother he was mad at me for cause that I said we need to read it you know what I meant everybody else did but seeing he did too but he used it as an excuse to not listen to the tapes or get somebody else to read it you think people won't do that listen but what is he excuse me he unfolds whatever attribute will do it's what we just read he unfolds when speaking of Abraham of whatever attributes would do Abraham met Melchizedek served him bread and wine and sit down and talk to him and that was Almighty God in a form called a theophany that's your prophets words all right what kind of a man was that what kind of a man did he meet prophet said he met Almighty God well what is your new birth is it not the birth of the work which is almighty god okay listen let's go to number five brother we don't get we'll get a few of these time paragraph 67 going on through a little bit now we see the attribute sons of your spirit have not yet entered into the word form body now what is it theophany soul of an individual and what is the soul of an individual it's the body you go to when you die all right sinners have that we've been through all of that but Christians have eternal theophany so it's a lot differs from the Christian in the center so you were to define that out of what we're reading we yet leave it at town now we see the attributes sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body we was not born in Word form body I've spent the whole message to declare one thing he came one way we're gonna come another way cuz he never came into world to be tempted he said oh the Bible said he was tempted in all points he never came into the world to be tempted he came in the world that's Christ himself eternal God Adam and mankind came to be tempted he said we'll wait a minute Adam here to eternal life yeah he had eternal life but he had a natural body that he could be tempted and he was and he fell okay so we're talking about how God comes then Adam will come and then we will come right that the three-point but who is he now well you and I have it to come that what a theophany this body is subject to the world an earthly waiting for the earnest change of the body in other words when we go we go back now watch the difference between him and you as a son now there's a difference between Jesus Christ and you and me as a son okay is that words the difference between him and you as a son see he was at the beginning the word any morphe body he came and lived in that he Jesus Christ Almighty God came and lived in that in morphe body as who milchester day he appeared to Moses in the burning boat he appeared in many forms right he appeared many times to many ones in the Old Testament right what is Almighty God to watch you see he was at the beginning he Jesus Christ was at the beginning the word in the morphe body he came and lived in that in the person of Melchizedek there's he son god there's he'll oh gosh there's he theophany there's all the terminologies back in the Old Testament you have a brother Dale he never was the son of God till he come into the new test i sweatin what he said so I'm gonna listen what he said you play all you want to look look what he said he came in and lived in that in the personal male charity then later we never heard no more of melchizedek why why did you never hear anymore of melchizedek I'm asking you a simple question I love questions I love to ask them brother brother kind of got me one time he said he's in a meeting of that misters meeting and I got up and asked a question I love you was sitting there that day brother got up behind me he said I hate for a man to ask the question said when he was the only man in the building had the answer I said I would not ask the question if I hadn't had the answer I stood that way the answer they had to agree when it was finished that's why I got out he's a lifer that's a man a question and he's the only one in the building got the answer you brag all you want to listen then later we never heard no more about yesterday why because Melchizedek became Jesus Christ now let me ask you a question was Mel Chadwick God brother now brother branham spent a whole message declared that Melchizedek was Almighty God all right then when he went into Jesus Christ who was he a second person or a third one no it was the same God stepped into another form what was the difference in Jesus and Melchizedek Melchisedec was spoke into existence the flesh God stepped into it and come to live and be that all right come on now his body was not at the Alpha knee part because the Alpha knees don't eat in that man that Melchizedek the flesh man ate all right so then the flesh man wouldn't God the flesh man was a creation of God to step into right full-grown man Melchizedek could not die for your sins but he became Jesus Christ to be able to die what a baby to fulfill the scripture is born of a woman a flesh born of a woman created by the prophets of the word they had brought and God stepped into that flesh what was the difference in Melchizedek in Jesus they looked alike never didn't leave cause brother I'm the one who said it he said Abraham saw a male chastity but the off in the form of God he said Moses sawmill - I saw the off in the form of God so who's Moses see he saw melted it it's just not listed at that point Lots now come on we're getting to where we're at we're gonna quit in the minute then later we never heard no more of Melchisedec so he just goes off the scene we hear no more of him he's really disappear you know he didn't disappear he just hung around a little while and come in another form come on that's my whole story of trying to get you to see God condescending is a great eternal changing in form not changing gods look because he became Jesus Christ Melchizedek watch him was the priest but he became Jesus Christ what all the fulfillment of the Bible advocate healer savior deliverer this whatever you want to name him he became all of that the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end Mel shattered it was the priest that's why it's called the priest of the Most High God he was the priest back there to help him but he wasn't the rest of it but he became Jesus Christ then watch him now you bypass that because in that form he knowed all things and you have never been able to know that yet we'll back up no minute but I want to stay up there with that but I'll get you come like Adam like me I remember brother trying to decide that one time because of the English major of the way the commas and things fell and he was trying to say that Adam come a different way well we know Adam coming every way he was a creation that's no problem you and I were in the creation we come from natural birth yeah he was trying to make it into a doctrinal listen you become from the attribute to the flesh to be tempted okay now we got to hold that right now because we just to the point of talking about Jesus so let's keep him here now who is he what is it theophany into the word form body a word form body a body formed by the word of the person and he became Jesus Christ and can be called a son of God God is not another God it's the same God he's the fulfillment of the Old Testament brought into the basis of seeing him standing on earth as the great eternal you need to say if you don't believe that I am he will die in your sins he said on my father one if you've seen me you've seen the father right cuz who was he he was the word come on brother he was the Word made flesh what is it theophany word body he said you bypass that will pick that part of why because it don't mean bypass like going around 285 because if you do you're gonna get hooked up with Perez I believe was his name wasn't the ball player and you're gonna go around and around and around and around and he couldn't find how to get off for that time right by Pais don't mean you got something you got to bypass you'll hold this till next Sunday's where we start talking by face simply means you never came that way you never came like him he came straight into word but you know what well he was there in word you and I was in him but just remember none of us can ever be all of God each one of us could be a part that we can never be all of God but he was all of God he was all of God he was the word body and the prophet uses irony uses word body later but he seemed to hear word form body a body formed by the word which is the word we never see Melchizedek no more why not why couldn't he be in other places in there no because he's changing his form to be Jesus Christ now listen what I'm saying your prophet said it Melchizedek and the Bible says that he was made after the order of a priesthood Jesus Christ was not just a priesthood he was a further development or unfolding of Almighty God from Melchizedek into Jesus Christ which would make him Almighty God and then he would be the fullness of the Godhead bodily bright but as a baby he could not die for your sins I'm no problem with these brothers that want to preach that Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan he's still terminology they were used the wrong term he wasn't a full manifestation until the River Jordan there's no problem he said well maybe that's what they're saying well maybe it is but that wasn't what I heard but that's alright I'm accused we're not hearing too good anyway so don't worry about it but why do you see mouths as dick don't more in the Old Testament because he met Abraham who is the father of faith it's not meaning that God never appeared no more if you're to Moses he appeared many things after appearing to Abraham it's just meaning that Melchizedek was the high priest and you needed nothing else anymore because he was not going to be able to die for the people you needed him as high priest to make intercession right but when Jesus Christ came he was o mighty God but you know what you know what I love about it that's where you won this drivers crazy trying to understand on there you see one that says Jesus was the last form of God I differ with that the people of this message say Jesus was the last one I differ with them because the bride of Jesus Christ is the life form of God to the Gentiles then he transforms himself to the Jews in another in morphe so it's not over with it just comes to you and I to the greatest of all this thing what about it what is it theophany a word form body a body formed by the word it took those prophets to bring forth the body of Jesus Christ take any of them out and they would not work put them all together and let them bring their part they will they produce Jesus Christ John being the life to introduce him right you'll notice I don't remember John they were saying thus saith the Lord if I'm wrong on that you correct me to scripture but I'm not making the doctor in this making appointment John never said thus saith the Lord he was so close in his introductory till he said behold the lamb of God it takes away the sin of the world or what are you trying to say trying to make a simple of the point a prophet says thus saith the Lord that's God speaking through the prophet to mankind right David said they pierced my hands and my feet that son of God that was back there kept stepping in to mankind until he stepped in enough to say they pierced my hands and my feet why because he was Melchizedek but then you don't see him because you don't need you priest you're heading towards a priesthood there's a lot of difference in the priests and the priesthood Jesus Christ was all of the priesthood even everything because he was Almighty God listened called a son we're not Trinitarian sir we believe in the Word of God what we got really predictive or anybody have a need just
