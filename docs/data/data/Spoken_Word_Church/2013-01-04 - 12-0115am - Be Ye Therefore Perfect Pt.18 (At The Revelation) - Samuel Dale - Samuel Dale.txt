have your way with you to number one of us and let your light shine guide us now as we read your word keep us in your love in jesus name Matthew if you like to read Matthew 5 and then we'll go to 2nd Peter one we've been on this part while speaking on this topic in and we'll try this afternoon to how you know to be able to that questions and answers and times and be able to just to discuss it no when I go when I'm going to use the spray okay i'm getting a word to pull the string that clip sr when i'm going to use it we just read the scripture okay to matthew 5 4 43 you have heard that it hath been said thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate down the enemy but i say unto you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you what that ye may be the children of your father in other words you may have the nature of your father because that was what he had right that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven or he maketh his son to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust or if you love them which love you what reward have you do not even the publicans the same and if you salute your brethren only what do you more than others do not even the publicans so many summed it up by saying one know where this is the way to be like the father right be therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect alright let's go over to the first Peter down to stick of it a scripture first first Peter I might've said second Peter by the first Peter first Peter one when we get reading the verse 7 that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that khurshid do it be tried with fire might be found into the praise and honor and glory or at the appearing of Jesus Christ whom having not seen you love in whom though now you see him not yet being believing you rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your soul of which salvation the prophets have desired and searched diligently who profits out of the grace that should comin to you searching water what manner of time the Spirit of Christ which was in them did signify when it testified before hand the sufferings of Christ and the glory that should follow unto whom it was revealed now once these revealed them that it wouldn't happen in their day speaking of us coming down right unto whom it was revealed that not unto themselves but unto us they'd administer the things which are now reported unto you by them that have preached the gospel and to you by the Holy Ghost sent down from heaven which sings the angel is desired to looking into we're for now watching gird up the loins of your mind of the sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought to you unto you at the revelation of Jesus Christ and they succeeded the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word nobody get it too hot lately may have to click a little about her where we can survive right but now as I said I've been trying for a while to speak about something that I'm leaving it's been needful to each and every one of us in it and trying to bring it now its message 18 and I know I'm pretty slow but that's the way things go you just keep on going and do it too to understand the the word and I you know you can't you can't exhaust the word so you just keep believing it enough we've been talking about the topic of what be there for perfect now and a human morals realm life me and you you know us there is no way for any human mortal to be perfect he calls that the way we're born is the psalmist David said we were born in sin shape with an iniquity equipped with three scriptures together and we were spouse from our mothers wound and go forth a liar you you you don't want to say it about them but you look down in a little baby you know and you see it and you say well that value is a product of mother and Daddy through the wedding bed you know you know coming forth but still it's born in this realm out here we're all born in a realm which belongs to the devil like one that even the Lord Jesus or remembering the temptation there that Satan offered him this and he offered him that offered him he said all the kingdoms of the world well jesus never argued with him did it hide he just said get behind you say no cuz it even out of argument with him about it because Satan does own all of this all of this out here in the world belongs to Satan in his domain and that's why the trouble is so horrible among the other thing around the world today is it Satan knows he had just a little season the Bible said so he's doing everything he can to tighten it down and everything else and you know and destroy mankind because that's his purpose but see the lord jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect well now that's the requirement he didn't say maybe you will my hope he will think about it you know whatever he just made a statement be therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect well then if he made that statement our requirement that he must be able in some way to produce that whatever would take to be able to make a person perfect and we as human mortal we can't be because we're bored ears our mind or are thinking this is a whole messed up because of all of the things that happened in life and it always say to you about a little baby you know we love them and they're so sweet but yet they little baby when it opens his eyes in the nursery Verena in the hospital the first thing it here's the first thing it sees it right and then it here's a couple of nurses and they said well if that blankety-blank little baby come in here messed up her to all our whole day you know and we were going to have some funds another in the poor little baby he starts out wrong right you know you said well I don't an open well here you go back to very different lives it does you know and then they're always said my head yours a full moon you know we're gonna have a bunch of babies tonight so what you know but it's it's the fact in a way that we're born and perverted all right then it's surely a fact if we know that we need salvation that's right we know that without even having anybody to talk to us about it we realize that we need salvation and no matter where you would go in the world you would find people that have never even heard of Jesus Christ or something like that and you'd find them worshipping something right you know totem pole miles animals whatever you know and as they're doing they're showing what it is in man panco we were made for that price we were late for the point to where that we need a Savior all right so then the only way that mankind could ever come to a thought of thinking about being perfect it wouldn't have to mean that God would have to make away his self and that sits within it that he would have to make away right all right you said well there's none of it perfect i greatly we're predicts exactly right we're not perfect all right then you get the points a lot of people say I'm not perfect I just forgive it what i don't realize if you're forgiven if God forgives you then that wipes the slate clean bad he doesn't remember what you asked him to forgive me write you about it's gone and the Bible caught it in the sea of this forgetfulness and you know you can can go out there and then you can't find the bottom of the ocean know where they go down as moment and they still just keep going but you know I'm sure they can technically now find things but this the point of it is our sins are in see if we're giving us and God all right now if they're gone you know now i know we we grandmother's and granddad's to talk different than your other people now you know our kids always said my kids hello with a little horny you know because Richard kids are gently the meanest ones you you know and deacons phone right behind that but yes and they pointed each other you don't say much the other one but there comes a grand babies you know and they come along and you know what we saw everything in the world our kids done and then when the grandkids came I mean our kids to tell you don't get on the bed you get a woman we're getting on the bed we're here comes the grandkids you right up in the middle of the bed this Max's morning mean because it kind of gets we're using you your you don't see as much I'm trying to show you how God is you know right now the great grandkids come along it just gets the worse and worse and worketh anyway no they just don't do anything wrong I mean they didn't matter what they just don't do anything wrong we'll see take that is an example of what God would be with his children that he looks down to you and I and he sees us not as sinners cuz he's looking through the bud abbott all right now that's what i've tried to express see if that blood of the bulls and goats in the Old Testament when they would offer the lamb you know and the gun at each year for further they hold you know group of Israelites and that covering would cover them for a year ma you know that God couldn't see them as I tried to explain to you were bailiff company in that time you know and he tried to show God the bad parts of Israel he looked at her and CEO nice called a hundred parts you know look down and see look what they're doing God says I don't see him Haven one was it he couldn't see him now being the omnipotent omniscient annoying and everything we know that he knows about it but yet see he had made a sacrament with his real man that if they would make the sacrifice they would cover their scene right he abides by his word yep that's where I love about the word of god I love to read the Word of God card i love to regency it promises man no i don't i said really and it said one day said you'll be there with your offspring we know what I believe that okay well but I let they gotta be safe too but I believe they're coming to that point you know the worthy will but I just believe what I say alright so we've looking at it is ruining season but yet he's covered they're covered by a covering of the blood of an animal it would offer but you know that animal could not saving buddy it could only cover their sin all right year later they had to make another atonement leave a year later they had to make another atonement it had to be done on the yearly basis all right but then one day the all of that came to an end event with that God Himself came down to pay the price because the animal has no soul they could not come back upon the belief and it's just an animal it has a life it has a spirit about it it can be trained to do things they can even teach them to call and things but they can't make decisions like the mortal human being because that when dealing with their soul of that person so the animal has a life he has a spirit about it you can give me talk but yet he still feels his bird that's the same way you know we got a couple o rabbits we have to deal with all the timing you know they're smart enough to figure out how to get out of the pen but you know I've rewired everything I'm thinking about putting an electrical shock all the way around the whole thing yes now then booters are smaller cubes the mother day of nine one of these we call it dog chain fence things you know and the boogers went right in the corner and over that money up you got out that's not well they pretty smart now really looked around to see if I can find anywhere pliers if they took the paint looks with you because linea I'm you going to get to wireless when you can't make me with your hand you go in a try no but you know but anyhow but they still can't reason it out right because of acceptable let's stay in that be I know what goes to of the neighbors has got dogs and they love rabbits so I'm chasing rabbits to keep him on getting the dogs and getting to Lamar but my point is that rabbit he can't make pain but if he was he'd be coming at the back door knocking won't get my but he gets thing I and that's the difference a human mortal tomorrow baby a baby no matter how small they are they thinking right I mean they're very something begins inside of them to motivate and it's amazing to me to seal I always wanted to be able to some way scientifically take about faith the legs but little Matthew is and take him and be able to some way get into his brain and here when you love to just get into his brain to be able to see what he was thinking he's looking at Cindy's grinning be seeing them man i got it made look at everyone leading the whole plane wasn't it anytime the only thing i just go man they just room I mean you think they don't think I lately though because that's the soul of the baby it's beginning to develop within and which sold means real you that's what it isn't so lead you let's that's the difference of what the animal doesn't have that interior he has a body in a life we have a body spirit and soul to make us an individual come on but I get the point that animal I couldn't come back so God came himself down in human flesh according to the scriptures Emmanuel God with us and he paid the price I thought he died did he might release him life right as i say of it many times we have the only religion in the world that required that our for our instigator are the one who started it maybe had to die the end is nigh to give his life that you and I my legal right that simple simple doing in it says he gave their life then there was an ability for that life to come back alright so there are in the Bible He gave His life they put him on the cross they didn't kill him right my sins and your sins is what killed Herod right all we had to do he said I can call twelve legions values we come delivering that's 12 Legion that's 1200 for 12,000 close out huh wormwood destroyed the world water just that would take one right so he could call all of that but instead of that he he stayed there for you and me then we might receive that life that was even he answered mmm do we may be able to receive Jesus Christ as our Savior right can be able to accept him and let him become the one they would be living within us all right now we know God is perfect right right no problem good run going is perfect all right joy he put his lap within us yep right now he breaks his life and gives it to you and I who were that lastly that would have to be perfect because that's what he done he made it perfect right I am coming and living in US makes that sold our body spirit i'll still the sunny yeah I here in this body that that I'm here I'm still a sunny I have problems with this body is getting older it's all they think are happening do it right and I have a spirit within late which is rim the memory reason concerts effects it done in that real I have trouble living in life but as a Christian inside of us the our soul has been my eternal by the new birth whatever you want to call it being born again salvation your words you want to use coming to a place to accept Jesus Christ as your Savior not just a little talk that's what a lot of people teach and believe that salvation is a mental thought but it's not it's an experience of Jesus Christ coming and living within you cuz that was the Rings again he could give us a little talk without having to die true right and with us did you know but he had to die to release his life Evan that life to come back in me and you yeah and to give us then his own life well I've been his life is perfect yeah bad right as I said we look at the baby and we say what's perfect in our eyes it is the little grandbabies ladies man they can get you you know t ho I want a puppy with you and I gonna be alone you'll have a puppy one because it if you just can't stand them little eyes looking at you talking you know and all of that this gets in the heart and everything we know that's the way God does us he hears our prayers yours are crying out unto him saying Lord forgive me I guess I didn't mean to do that I didn't need to go that away I need more rest more in you and just be a Christian not to be worth if we look at somebody said well you think you're perfect know I know I'm not perfect but he's perfect he's living inside of me where he living that part is perfectly good my Bible said God will dwell in an unclean vessel all right now if he won't dwell we're seeing as that then it would have to take away the sin and that's what he does he comes to you and I we accept him as our side here and he comes to the lives in us to make our soul eternal right all right now I know that a lot of doctrines of people is it like we're going to get eternal life over there that's the sign that's you're looking at but why would Jesus cries out to die if it's gonna be over there he died to release his life now I to make this as we read there in the scripts right about the children of God Oh Congress is all free man what about being the children of Almighty God Evan and you know the thing of it is we know the truth about it we god no how no grandchildren he ain't like of us he don't have grandchildren he had sons and daughters all right now the reason I'm saying that is and sometimes he asked a witless right then that can tell you he's only one that ever got a spike in of the grandkids and I really whooped him good i mean i just really you know one day like that and he cried for an hour but because he didn't know pop all can do stuff like that well little happy she's come along you know we've had to i minus her a little bit no he it's just the way it is but see you're trying to raise the child to were that the child do what's right no you heard about that he was going up down the ladder never taught me two years old about three and lisa well i used to take him out set him up home instead of reading right up on the top of the peak of the roof of a house that was dirty foot off the excite and he just said sorry you know and he said popo i'm flying us now you're not you can't get off he set up her Whitney you know we we would be working on times but thee sometimes you have to correct your children's by and God has to correct other side don't we already his offspring and he wants us to raise up to be right but you raise a child to be right I don't want to raise a child up to be uh you know they're bad enough as it is because living in life but you don't want to raise them up to worth it there this to spoil brat sometimes you gotta say to the kids no you don't get it I don't like it of course like I said now the grandkids come along and they say daddy I want it near more in for more lenient in on maybe in half get back to the story salvation comes and lives within each one of us i saw crash 94 that's right he died to give us his old life to make us a new creature we've been talking about a new creation me we're not still the same as we was inwardly outwardly we look the same salvation is not in your body it is not in your spirit is in your soul it makes a soul eternal alright then from dire is supposed to work out where this right the life of God out through you and I to were that we can accept Corrections and in doing you know and be his children to be his offspring but one because they said now the blood of bulls and goats imma let me do was cover right but the blood of jesus christ he release the life right yeah cuz the animal heads instead alive and he has a blood and think but it is no solar but when Jesus Christ came up on earth you would body spirit and soul oh mighty God huh the Yeti was in flesh like we are his body was a virgin born body not either he demon huh Mary didn't produce the egg because we did that would have made the body coming from from area and that will work or the virgin birth is the creative old egg and sperm and put them together all Mary was with an incubator all right you see that today man right right we're in a day when when the virgin birth can be seen easily won because you can go down there they can have a test tube baby right right right take a journey from this one of the sperm from this one put it in our Joseph virgin birth and what it was a man that God created the egg his firm remember what the words you want to use German whatever the words you want to use Nikoli for it Lee and when he did Mary was it was an incubator right that's why he never did show in description he never called her mother right now listen I got a little sense I may look Don but I got a little since I know when he was a baby called her mother right right I mean he did go around saying who are you he knew who it was he called her mother but when it come up in his life to his head of his men entered his ministry and begin to preach she never called her mother anymore he called a woman why because even she rejected him as to be in virgin born the hell up to the time he's about 12 years old remember the temple they come back hunting him and she said your father and I right there was really saying Joseph is his dad he turned around and rebuked her he said I must be about my father's yesterday but she showed up and hurried it because she knew that he was correcting her the word was what was doing it right because it was God coming down to give his own life and you and I right so you could come to this place of being perfect right man Marnie now it may have been down through time that we didn't understand these things we understood that you earth and the things but we might not have talked about it but I've heard people arguing discuss it what Jesus were talking about you know i'll be there for perfect and you know over what i just read it i could say as he required it and God made away and he did so in the end time at the revelation that's why we read in Peter the race that is to be brought to you and I at the revelation of Jesus Christ in the meantime we are to receive the revelation to finish of all things you agree no that's the purpose of us being here we were to come down to this end time and we started all regarding Peter where it said that the appearing Jesus Christ all right now the other scripts you'll find at the coming of Jesus Christ cuz he can appear along today and that not literally be his coming he's coming is through the revealed Word and then it brought to you and I that's right he appeared in the end time wants to pay the price all right so everything's pointing down to where we're at right we are the people at the end of the earth of coming home honey we're the ones that Hebrews 11 40 says they without us cannot be made perfect right that we're perfect means of completeness full age you know you look at a child you say they've said Luke look Lou Matthew a specter knees he said well he's perfect but that means he's got every part unless something goes wrong with him in life you know some happen he's got his fingers he's got his toes he's got it dude he hung out some teeth before long then you know when I'll Lydia start biting Matthew for calling in Matthew ace mr. days Matthew but do he'll see he begins to develop would have but against no new parts right in the Christian life we don't gain hearts as we go along we gain growth development we grow up right you read the Bible then you read it but then you go back one day you read it again and it begins to open up you begin to see more we go back you read it again you begin to see one because a growth development is happening heaven so then you don't dare turn around a little little ace when he gets about five years old and you handing the keys to him and go get out of the car no no no goes its growth developments not enough right when you're 25 you can rust amenities you notice that I said 25 no no that's we all kids are they power start out they have all the wrecks in the first year that's why when they hadn't come along you know the boys egg roll clunkers it didn't make them here long as they got the earth it didn't matter Volkswagens or road trucks or whatever you know low and chanukah long you know everybody is you gonna buy a new car huh we found her a four-hundred-dollar toyota corolla for the bureaucrats headed we bought it nana looked at it she said daddy you mean you want me to drive that that's it n and many kids in schools got a car 16 years old got car none so I said drive it I was in the first year so if you have any reaction or Nothing right turns up any honey well when she come alone after a while we bought her a nice ricardinho honey one because she learned her to drive that's the way God does he starts at all and he lives out of races and then he knows how to raise children don't let him he did well sometimes he says no you can't have that yeah but daddy I wanted no you're not old enough yet alright so Ashley does in the Bible that in the Word of God he he gives us gradually what we have need of habit our growth development starts to wear that we can comprehend dammit that's right the funds all right and to do that means that grace must be hard probably read that scripture brought to you too grace that is to be revealed at the revelation of Jesus Christ Oh grace is unmerited favor but it's a wonderful word of saying you don't deserve what you're getting that's their right much call American fight was a good webster huh but it's saying you don't deserve it but I'm gonna give it to you right I'm going to give you the ability to grow up I'm going to supply you with the word i'm going to open it i'm going to to give you an opportunity to be able to study it study the Bible you will never wear it out amen that's right you will find out that it will constantly keep unfolding right they like a book that you read you know like what was it about a hundred years ago when you got sick you know what you're done they just somebody else or find a nails out and let you bleed a couple of pints yeah and your body you know what procreating you blood and and all I Kevin and they killed a lot of people by stood in that but that was her way of trying to do now they knew if he took the old blood out and you blood comes it brings healing car when I we don't want to read that medical journal today do it I mean we go down and dear you're already an e making you you go down to the doctor a doctor it okay rang me the pliers now I'm gonna pull off a couple of tone I open no you're already anemic you know they've learned a lot yeah right let me learn how to dr. us and take care of us we don't got it out to learn you already knew how to do have a drive to a sense trouble our way you send problems our way to see how we will deal with have it run we call it test and trial honey and extended my way that we learn how to deal with those son but the way that to me that I've always talk to your way I believe it he's by the revealing of this word I learned to overcome yeah he's a running man I tried my reading and studying God's Word I learned to overcome a man what I'm really learning is is the nature of my father all right Evan at that right because that way I'm learning that my father didn't do these things right people will say what I can't have it do it now that's alive you go ahead and blame the other thing I don't blend the deal for everything I think we got a lot of problem ourselves that we we come up with our own say what you see God will trash ditched us to prove it right and then like driving a car you you know I mean I'm 64 / got a bride bicycle but I describe slow you know all right but after a while you learn to drive right yeah first time I was in the car I remember coming up the whole store right there in front of the house used to be when i'm back to having the road I mean I had the whole road at all the parking lot I went over to railroad track back talking you know next to the track no you know I thought I really know how to drive I found out in a hurry I better take it easy I'm not going to hurt somebody but see God knows how to train his chew em I think you're right but he does it's my giving his word you know you spent a lot of time today and people do and that's wonderful and they want to know who their mama or daddy is maybe they've been raised up there's more fun or so and they want to know who their mom and daddy really is we'll have always told you my way I'm sorry if I would have been an orphan you know and somebody had adopted me I've always thought that would be my mama daddy you know because they raised me right but that's not Gordon all mankind no most everybody wants to know where they come from but I'd like to meet my daddy will you daddy's that throws your way when you're the baby and you want to me you know that's all right i'm not against way people do things I'm just honest I just tell it like it is I wouldn't want to know who my mom and daddy is if I was orphaned and somebody raised me I take you over who I had for my mom and dad right you know what not what my father to have all the honor and glory for raising me right right Evan I won't even reveal yourself to me through the words rang it on and show me hey Jimmy its nature show me his waves through the word I lead in the word and I found out it you know he would turn the other cheek what I need to get that nature I want that nature of him there of his nature his character because i'm wanting to be a new creation the word creation our creature is the same word which you know it is it's really Jesus Christ came down upon the earth he was a new creation I thought that he was not of the old he was not a product of the virgin birth prove that he was not a product of the old nature of ways of man he was a new creation event all right he proved it in his life and living happily when he was a kid whose kid I'm desert I don't believe he was in living I'm going to hurt a lot never have thought nothing like that I'm always thought he was raised up he was raised in a good family and good home and taking care of you know all of that and you heard a trade he was partner you learn a trade with somebody right you know and you went out making his own living oh you know really furniture all right but in that it was Almighty God showing himself right as I said even had to correct his mother when he was like 12 13 years Overson because she was wrong you see then when come down to words it was that she learned enough confidence in him because you remember the first thing that happened he went to a wedding you remember in the Bible when it first starts his ministry and he went to a wedding and they were running out of wine since she's goes to him and said no Jesus they're running out of one he said my times not yet did you know but she didn't take that house she doesn't sing him all through it laughs and seeing the way later than what he done should she goes over the pic would say whatever he says do you do it right so we turn to reading okay pour water out and it became wine all right now he had the nature of God because he was gone all right then we need to have the nature of God heaven living within other it would solve a lot of our problems you know there's like I say the kids wear that little band around on her arm you know what would Jesus do well that's good as long as they're doing it right you know but you know you say well walk with Jesus doing it so if I say something you punch him in the no that's not exactly the way that Jesus was doing that you know I think it was a kid but yet he was a wonderful kid at a man that's right you know but just think about it now that's what I'm trying to get you to see at the revelation of Jesus Christ another word here at the end time when God has opened the unto us I given us the understanding of God of these words to be able to see who we are I think what we're doing and what's happening then you know in life and do it and we even know by reading the Bible what will happen when we leave here I think God will turn to Israel and save them right we know that there will be a millennial reign is recorded in the Bible and for a thousand years of perfect peace upon this earth and thanks and then they'll be an Armageddon or battles and things that will take place alright and then there'll be a future home if we read in Revelation 2 21 22 right in there we know all about this one because he's given us his word that's right and by giving us his word he's given us that revelation of Jesus Christ right Emmett thought is the prophet of God said if you read the Bible and they'll see Jesus and then reverse back reading again mmm well I admit I read the guy she lunch what we got short sojourn to open got cilantro until I got tired of reading so intro we got so and so but then I realized one day that right in the middle of all that it would say something that would be a real key that I needed an understanding so I went back and I read it again right all right because it was showing the ledge right now handling it would come down to where this lineage come from this and this group come from this and I needed to know those signs not that I had to have it as a Christian but to know the leads of God coming down through mankind would come out to Jesus Christ that's the Langley that's right that's right you can see who we are and what we're doing is the hour that we're living right this is the time to come to understanding who you are right Luther taught the judge shall live by faith we believe that Wesley come along call sanctification we believe that the bag has come along with bringing back eternal security and immersing by going daily water you know and bringing back the baptism not going in the water with it cuz imagine this had got forth with the sprinkling is that i'm not against all that i'm just showing you that each one of those and a truth for their time and then we came in around the zoo the street and there you come in what you call a Pentecostal people as they begin to speak in tongues and Sons & wonders begin at a place and that's where we're at we come down here to an end nor God is people unfolding right to the end of quote Monaco the end of the earth is come you used to enter look around a bit when I talking about tomorrow and whenever code I've never been concerned about when the end of the world would come I'm concerned about getting ready to accept Jesus Christ and walk off the earth well I'm not concerned with dates and times and seasons and Paul said I'm a scared of the eye because you do those things right but that's just people trying to figure out things right all right we come down to where we are the end time that the word is open unto us not a sinister the word through the way of a profit that would leave came and brought us to life stay messy all right do we believe that and we want with it but we don't make that profit God we don't worship no man we worship Jesus Christ we do as Paul said won't sit follow me is I Pollock rock all right I'll follow anybody that follows christ ever had right because we need someone to help us we are human morals that need someone to guide us and better all right we follow anyone who would lead us to it you said I believe in all of the real cute true genuine Christian if we follow HYFR then we walk in the light yeah man all right then when we do we come forth as being one God wall right he wants his nature to be instilled in us then I'm just to be babies right you don't want us to stay babies we just a picture all of all the kids from the baby was born up to there whatever age they were but I was looking at that one day my thought we ought to be good you could pick out an age and say well I was late at that one did you say that our tariffs has happened and at that one you know but you know what if I stayed are we with the hell no Matthew and Josh it we will now know that right so it's really selfish to think about what we do we shouldn't want our kids to just remain right as they are they brought into the world for the purpose of growing up right and having their own family now I don't believe in pushing them out and make them get married no I believe you just wait around long enough you find a rough life than ever and then when you do that'll be your wife I'm leaving praying no for a wife all right in the Nano that'll take care of it but you what I'm saying we are new creation in Christ Jesus and he keeps unfolding his word to show us his ways and what he wants out of your night we're not in the days of all of the things that would happen in the bag on days we're here in the end of all things and we're saying Lord come on the scene now and give us what she wants to have because that is the grace grace God promised it right he promised to bring us to the place that they could be a change of these bodies there could be an end of all things they can be a rat sure that we spoke out of me of that he promised that well like I said to start with them when he said me therefore perfect if that's God's Word then God is required to make away for somebody to reach that so he did to himself amen alright George we're going to take a change to the body we're going to have a rapture whatever words you want to use and terminologies see then he made from he promised it lion you better believe my kids my grandkids I what I had to do they say daddy can we nice and we'll make well they just got ready yeah oh they knew whatever possible could be done I do it because I would give him my word me and I didn't want to break it I wanted to do what I could do that we see God when he gives his word he came right back heaven he got to keep it I that's why he says our description Romans 10 hell you want to be excited than what is the clue believe in your heart confess with your mouth right now it's fine to believe in the heart whether we don't confess with thy mouth more but it's good to believe in the heart but if we know you know if we don't have it in our mind our thinking I do believe and then confess alright so what do we need at the revelation of Jesus crown can we believe that Jesus Christ with Almighty God that drivin now know the Trinity doctrine and etc is the oneness I know both sides of the doctrinal issues of the teachings of the Godhead but yet I believe what your mom will say hey there my old said he was born Lord the Christ the Bible said he was a man you and God with us all right he came down to play the prize it's you and I and that would opportunity to be cited hey all right then why are we looking for another gone or another thought right that's right yeah but we've been taught that us that's fine because you taught that you come down to life yeah but now let's get down to read the Bible hey that's right jesus said unless you believe that i am he you will dine you're safe now according the gospel right so it wasn't two or three guards Almighty God made manifest in human flesh yeah that's right yes their old testimony was called Jehovah God Father and wouldn't call it son in Jesus Christ upon the earth now it's the Holy Spirit Father Son the Holy Spirit you're a fonder right your son run mother Kali your father okay moderately father he's our son because he's a human mortal and he's a being I don't make him three people it makes me one the a can reveal yourself to me age that's right the we do things different oh my guess and what everybody but everybody called his coffee name I'm right here to church college mafia name no matter what at blackbaud burning the other come from Africa India wherever you from we've got them here from all over the world
