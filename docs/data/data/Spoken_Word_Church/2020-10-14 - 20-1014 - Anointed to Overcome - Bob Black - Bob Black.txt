everybody's doing doing good um it's good to get to see and see some faces you haven't seen in a while you know with all of this things going on but um yeah we're our hearts and with brother dale and terence and everything we'll just continue to pray and just believe everything will be uh we i so tonight i i i just want to bring a message of encouragement and um maybe maybe uh brother dale can look on and and and say with pride it's been a long time waiting for somebody to preach a sermon like this so uh we're gonna read from exodus chapter 14 13 to verses 13 to 25. before we go to the scripture let's just give the lord in prayer lord god we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word and among these precious believers of life precious faith lord look into your word and i pray god that you'll give us permission lord jesus help us lord and not just look on on on just letters lord but something that will actually come alive in our hearts and i pray god that you'll let us yield ourselves to to your word tonight with god and give you permission lord jesus make you welcome lord come in among us lord jesus that you might walk freely down the pews and down even the aisles of our hearts lord jesus that you might have preeminence through all the rooms in our heart lord jesus said we'll just open up every door and every place every crack and crevice lord that you might come in and inspect and find anything that shouldn't be there lord jesus and just root it out and be with brother dale and terrence tonight lord jesus and all the all the other ones lord jesus that that are sick and afflicted and needed touch from you lord jesus all the different ones little god we we know lord jesus that you still care for us that you haven't left us lord that you're still moving amongst your people or god and i pray lord jesus the words that are said tonight will be an encouragement and a help lord god to know that you're still ever present help in time of need a time of trouble thank you lord god bless the remainder of this service we pray in your name all right so let's read let's read i i really um i told the brothers in the back i i've just got this one scripture so maybe the rest of the evening i do have a few quotes to read but just just tonight just listen and just just kind of just meditate on the things that are being said and we won't really have anything to put on the board on the screen but just to sit there and listen all right and it says and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace that sounds like a sermon right there that would preach what moses just said there that's encouraging that's a that's a confession and everything hold on you're going to see all the enemy you're going to see uh all your enemies destroyed but then it says notice how how kind of strange and mysterious the scripture she is sometimes the lord said unto moses wherefore christ thou unto me must be something written between the lines here right that moses said something real encouraging it seems like and then all of a sudden the lord is telling him why are you crying unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward amen come on but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out that hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea and i behold i will harden the hearts of the egyptians and they shall follow them and i will get me honor upon pharaoh and upon all his hosts upon his chariots and upon his horsemen and the egyptians shall know that i am the lord when i have gotten me honor upon pharaoh upon his chariots and upon his horsemen now it seems like seems like the lord is kind of reminding moses of what he's supposed to be doing doesn't it and the angel of god which went before the camp of israel removed and went behind them and the pillar of the cloud went before their face and stood behind them and it came between the camp of the egyptians and the camp of israel and it was a cloud and darkness to them but it gave light by night to the east so that the one came not near the other all the night and moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the lord caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night and made the sea dry land and the waters were divided and the children of israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground and the waters were a wall unto them on their right hand and on their left and the egyptians pursued and went in after them to the midst of the sea even all pharaoh's horses his chariots and his horsemen and it came to pass that in the morning watch the lord looked unto the host of the egyptians through the pillar of fire under the cloud and troubled the host of the egyptians and took off their chariot wills that they drave them heavily so that the egyptians said let us flee from the face of israel for the lord fighteth for them against the egyptians you may be seated the lord add his blessing to the reading of the word so tonight i want to take a text anointed to overcome because and and really i y'all know by now i've been really trying to just take a take a message that brother brown preached and just break it down and if it's not obvious to you yet i'm really preaching tonight from the message why christ speak and in this message this message let's let's go ahead and jump to the to the point of the message this message is really not for little baby christians this message is about maturity and and you know the whole brother brahma's message was to bring us to maturity we know that the message was not supposed to give us a new better way of being born again although it it it tied up the loose sins of things that we didn't understand about being born again but the message was given to us to bring to bring a it was a capstone message to bring to us the full revelation of jesus christ which would bring us to maturity the message is supposed to prepare us for the harvest because i was i was sharing down there in mobile about how the the the the plan god's plan for a rapture is that when the original seed is planted in the ground and it begins to grow except the corner we'd be playing in the ground it will abide alone but when jesus christ was planted in the ground by dying for us then this wheat plant began to grow up that began on the day of pentecost and and you see that what we're waiting for is for that wheat plant to come to maturity to come to material again because then you can have a harvest now there's a wheat plant growing up down through the seven church ages typing the whole bride but there's also you also are individual wheat plants and you as an individual have to come to maturity so that's what this message is about that i'm speaking on tonight that to going going from planting to full grain back to the original seed when you're back to the original seed again then you can have a harvest now what kind of perplexes people is it to explain what's gonna what's gonna when can the rapture come well we've got to come to maturity all right now so so you go out into the wheat field and you see a few few different sprigs of wheat or whatever they come up to maturity but the rest of the wheel field is not mature yet well you can't have a harvest that just makes sense as far as just natural farming you can't have a why would a farmer go out if he's only got a couple of wheat plants come to maturity and and go and have the whole harvest now he might take those few little sprigs of of wheat and that that have come up and uh like the priest in the bible will go out and grab a handful and wave it a fir offering of first fruits and that shows though that the whole rest of the heart the wheat field is going to come up to it's coming to maturity so you got to wait for the whole wheat field to come to maturity and then here comes the combine so so this message and it you'll find out that brother brown says where should the bride be right now we should be we should be mature we should have an understanding of who we are and what we're doing here and what our purpose is we're talking about maturity because maturity is what's going to bring the dead from the ground when the bride comes to maturity then that voice in her the same voice that caused lazarus from the ground that voice in her will cause the dead saints to rise from the ground because it will be like a magnet a magnet and the word pulling the word from the ground they're the word waiting on us it doesn't isn't that what the scripture says that they they without us cannot be made perfect they're they're over there waiting on us waiting on us to draw them from the ground so they're waiting on us and so many scriptures that brother that brother brown said that we think that god that we're waiting on god but actually he's waiting on us and what's he waiting on us to do is to actually get in the word and and and accumulate but we'll read a little bit later accumulate all just accumulate the word just accumulate it and and pile it on pile it on until it is actually producing something in us and i i find it to me the more i get into the message and really dig into it and find these little things one one sentence where brother brown says something you just highlight let me tell you it it's worth more than gold i i wonder maybe if those of you that might be a little bit cold tonight and and get a little bit starchy and things if you get back into the message and just really begin to dig you will find that is something worth more than life itself worth more than just anything of this natural earth there's there's things in this message this message will change you it will actually change you and you can look back in your life and see where you've come from and know that this message is actually having an effect you can watch the effect that it's having on your loved ones and on people that go to church with you and look back in their lives and see that they're not the way that they used to be because this message will have an effect i'm trying not to start crying now now now so this the scripture that we just started off with is really is really the end of the story tonight that i'm going to be relating but to really tell the story correctly you got to go back to the beginning because brother branham says that there's a background in this message she's talking about the background now now if you go back and listen to why christ speak it it might be real tempting to just kind of play it in the background and and and you hear brother brown saying things that well i've heard that so many times but really meditate on what he's trying to say he's trying to communicate to you something not not just about moses life or if you listen to it and say well he's always talking about himself well that might be true to some aspect but but what he's really trying to communicate to you is something personal about your journey something personal about you isn't that true about all of the scripture when you look at the seals it's it's fine to look at the seals historically and see how things were open to the first church the first and second and third church age and how it moved down through through history but the seals are supposed to be something personal to you the whole bible when you read it it's supposed to be something personal to you that when you read it you begin to see your your own life identified in it and you begin to see that christ that you're reading about identified in your life to know that that god is not not just some dead history but it's a living resurrected jesus christ so you got to go back in this story go back to get the background first and we'll find brother brown says that moses moses was born with a gift of great faith and and he says he was born to be a prophet and he was born to be a deliverer and he said he was born with the equipment born in him and then he clarifies as every man that comes into the world is born with this equipment with the equipment to choose or to choose to believe or not to believe the equipment to to accept god's providence to accept god's plan or turn it down and then he said not that god is willing that any would perish but all might come to repentance but being god he had to know and and does know the end from the beginning so he's he's laying all this out moses was born with a gift of great faith he was born to be a prophet a deliverer because because moses came into the world with a with a special purpose but you also have a special purpose that you are fulfilling here on this earth moses had a special purpose to deliver all the children of israel but you you got to see yourself in this thing you you're not here sitting in this church just to fill up a pew to warm up you but you actually have a purpose brother graham said he was born in a great family he was born of a very odd birth you think about that he was born in a great family do you do now reflect on this that god will put you in a home i believe he even put rahab uh the way she turned out he put her in the home and he put her in the place he put her in that wall so that so that she would come to the place where she would be able to one day manifest the word of god for her age wherever you wherever you start you might be sitting young people you might be saying well i don't want to be in the house that i'm in i wish i had different parents but god put you in that place so that you would you would be able to manifest the word for your day if you can guess if you can just catch that if you can just catch catch a hold of the promise of god for you he said he was born in a time of persecution like jesus he was born to be a deliverer like jesus he was hid away from the enemy like jesus he come to his time of service now see all this all this comes together to make a background is the person has a purpose and the person is in a place in a nation in a in a in an age that when you see all of the things of the age and the nation come together it's creating a background of faith that that moses that amram and jochebed could look around and see that there's got to be a deliverer come on the scene because they were looking at the circumstances of that age they were looking at the timeline that god had promised to abraham that his children his descendants would sojourn in the strange land for for 400 years and they would be in bondage and they knew after 400 years it had been about 400 years and they knew that something had to come upon the scene and brother brown says that that he said when the time of the promised no grows not draws nigh it sets people to pray and then hungering amen so abram and jochebed began to pray and hunger and call out to god now think think about that in your own situation looking around and well we got we got coronavirus we got strange things in politics we've got all sorts of things all around the world uh uh people in eye places doing strange things it's truly a sodom and gomorrah people don't know whether they're men or women they're they're they're they don't identify with anything they'll get mad at you if you call them their own pronoun they the the world is what it is though is the world is identified biblically it's identified with what the scripture says it would be at the coming of the son of man so if amram and jochebed began to hunger and and something within them was was yearning to see the word of god made manifest how much more should something in us be hungering and draw desiring to see the word of god made manifest to see the promises of god be birthed in us if the bible says that the son of man would be made manifest when it when the world is like sodom and gomorrah shouldn't shouldn't we be desiring to see god's fullness made manifest in our lives shouldn't something in us be hungry and desiring see now is not the time to be watching movies and play it playing with stuff but now is the time to get back into the word and see if we can find the little nuggets that maybe we've left off in our journey maybe we forgot how what a joy it is to get in the message and find out what it really says but now is the time to get serious with god and and brother brown said their prayers were exactly with the scripture they weren't just praying some kind of willy-nilly prayers i want to i want a new porch i want a new cadillac or something but they were praying for a at the delivery that god had said would come up on the scene they were praying according to the bible and he says their prayers was we're the promised word you think about how powerful brother ram said your prayers are and if you can align your prayers with what the bible already has spoken is going to come to pass think about how how much power is in the the the prayer of a believer to know what they're praying for to not get down and just pray haphazardly but to pray with a sincere confession of a believing heart something on the inside begins to speak something begins to move and before long it's not you speaking anymore it's god on the other side speaking on your behalf and he will bring it to pass because when his word is spoken it will not return to him void and brother brahma said god promised at that time to do it they prayed for it and there was a proper child born now now you think if amram and jochebed could pray and that proper proper child that god had promised was born had come come up on the scene through their lives think about what you and i could do if we would get serious about god and begin to call out to god to see the capstone come in our lives to see us grow up into the full stature of a perfect man to come to maturity to begin to realize our place to become that invincible army that barbara said the bride will be when she begins to realize who she is and you see brother adam said all the background all that background of moses life just began to heap up he said all the background begins to heap just keeps up and and what he meant was he said this is going to happen he was born this way he came this way he was he was in the scripture this way and all that begins to uh heap up and he says it accumulates together and draws a picture for us now isn't that just the way that the promised word comes it accumulates together in your heart until little by little you begin to see the picture of jesus christ you begin to see the picture of redemption as it really is that it accumulates in your heart until maybe like paul said through it or it was the song with solomon's we're looking through a lattice and we can barely see we can barely see the picture but a long and long as the word is accumulated in your heart you begin to see things as they really are that's why you've got to get in the word because you cannot see who you really are you cannot truly understand your purpose unless you are in the word all the way and that's why brother brahma said the bride will be in the word all the way she's not going to be dabbling around with denominational ideas she's going to be in the word all the way to understand her purpose brother braham said in spiritual food and due season and again they don't have this back back there but but just just listen and he said i want you to get built up now this is one of my favorite quotes i want you to get built up now in this holy oracles of god in the faith the faith of this hour he wants he wants you to get built up in this faith of the hour the faith is going to take more faith than ever was in any age for this has to be rapturing faith be taken up and so we want you to believe tonight and all that you have seen heard the word that you have preached the signs and wonders that you have seen done we want you to accumulate all that together in your heart and consider it whether it if that be god or not so he's telling us he wants to accumulate all that together accumulate just like all of moses background heaped up until he could look back on all that had accumulated and it gave him faith and brother we'll see in a second that it it actually anointed him that looking at the circumstance and looking at his birth looking where he came from looking how god had dealt in his life built up something until it it accumulated faith in him and brother brown said in the power of the devil in 1955 way back in 1955 he said oh if we could only accumulate that kind of faith tonight get that kind of faith living among us and you know we can accumulate that and god has given us the prescription to accumulate that kind of faith and the way to accumulate that faith is by hearing of the word the the gospel has power in it to when you hear it it might come a little by little precept by precept line upon line but over and over it will begin to accumulate in your heart until you become the living walking manifestation of deity on earth again god manifesting himself back in bride again in a bright form i thank god i feel good tonight and he said and now moses had all this as a background to mo so moses knew he was sent for the very purpose to deliver the children of israel he said he was born with this great gifts and quality within him then it only taken something to flash across that to bring that thing to life and he said the seed of god is actually placed in us from the foundation of the world now now let's think about that brother brown said so many times that you come you come with the seed already in you and what that seems like a very perplexing thing to say does that mean that you don't need to hear the word is a word already in you and you just need like an anointing to come listen the way brother brown says this he says he was born with this great gifts and quality within him listen i want to preach on that tonight because listen i believe that when you're born god knew that you would come into the world before the foundation of the world and he knew what your reaction to the gospel would be he knew that you would accept it and so before the foundation of the world he had a plan and purpose in your life that he laid out before you he knew he he planned out who you would be born from what family you would be in when you would hear the message he had he had an angel with a message waiting for you to wait ready to lay it in front of you and all it took was the light to strike that and what did it strike it struck something where within you was equality god god had and you all god i believe he was looking at you when you were born of your natural birth saying that i know he was born or she was born of the the wrong way but when the light strikes that individual they're going to come become the manifestation of what i had in mind for that person before the foundation of the world i had something in mind for that person and they were born the wrong way but i'm going to make it so they come the right way and you see you see god knew you would be he knew you would be here he knew he knew the hour and the day that you would come to it and all it took was for you to hear the gospel and when you heard it it was like you that that eagle in the barnyard that said i believe it i recognize that's my that's my father calling me i recognize that's my the mother word the new jerusalem calling me i'm born from the word and you recognize where you came from not that you just recognized it and you didn't go through a birth but you come through a birth and you realize that that you you weren't born you you weren't you your original birth is you like brother brown said i i one day i realized i didn't come from uh charles and ella brandon what my real parents but i come from somewhere somewhere that now i can be identified with brother brown said just like that woman at the well that light flight flashed across her path and you think about that woman at the well that she was she was put there beside that whale god knew where she would be and he was there waiting for her he was he showed up at just the right time so that he could flash across their path he is the word and he's shown across their path and she accepted it and believed it [Music] excuse me you know you know the parable of the sower in matthew chapter 13 jesus he actually gave two explanations for the sower the the or the seed and one explanation he said the seed that is sown into your heart is the word of god and if you'll if you'll receive it uh it gave the parable of the the tares and uh the the or or not the tares the the seed falling by the wayside and on the stony rock and all those different things the seed the seed is the word of god but in in in in the other parable and the other explanation that jesus gave he said the seed the good seed are the children of the kingdom so in one sense that seed is the word of god being sown into your heart but in the other sense he's sowing into the earth the individuals that he thought of before the foundation of the world and so you see he thought of you and he knew of you and he had a plan to bring you into manifestation and see all this all this produces a background that's why brother branham is laying it out for us in this sermon that all this produces a background of faith that when moses comes to the red sea he's got all this background that he should be taken advantage of to know his place and his position you see you're not anointed just to be just to let the devil run over to you but you've been anointed in this age to overcome to overcome everything that the devil throws at you and you've got the background to prove it you've got the background to know that god has been with you from your birth he was watching over you he had it planned out when you would let when that light would cross your path he knew when you would receive it and he knew you would receive it and you've got all that background of faith to give your faith to give you faith to cross over your red sea experience when it comes time he said moses born and then brought to a place where he was anointed from intellectual conception to anointing moses he he started out his journey with an intellectual conception but when the light crossed his path he said brother and said notice the seed laying there with an intellectual conception with all the faith that he was born to deliver this people and yet it never come to life until that light from the burning bush flashed across until he seen not something he read about but something he's seen with his eyes something that spoke to him and he spoke back to it oh how that did bring things to life you know i believe that every born-again christian here tonight can look back to your own burning bush experience where you met god for yourself where the word began to come alive and you and you realize that this was not just some fable but you were looking god in the face that the things that you were reading about are true that god is real and he's making his word manifest in your sight you see brother brown said god had a purpose for moses and he has a purpose for you and brother brown said he made this little statement he said if you can only get to that place how much trouble you save god and yourself too if you can only get run to that burning bush experience if you could only get to that place think about those of you that took a long time to get to that place think about how much trouble that would have saved you if you got there earlier think about all the troubles and things that that would have saved you and now maybe those of you that haven't yet got to that burning bush experience think i want you to reflect tonight i'm preaching to you i want you to reflect and how much trouble that could save you if you could just get to that burning bush experience and we know that no man can come until the father draws him but yet the the father is drawing by his word and the word is calling and telling you that there's a place in that burning bush for you that god wants to see you save that god is drawing you if you'll just yield yourself and humble yourself and let loose of all the pride and things that may give you that haughty attitude to think well i'm too good for this yield yourself to the word and let god have his place in you brother brown said he he said i have heard god told moses i have heard the cries of my people and i remember my promise to their fathers abraham isaac and jacob and i have come down ah there the person on pronoun i have come down to deliver them and moses asked he said can i have an evidence and god said yes i'll give you the evidence of the rod throw your rod down and it'll turn into a serpent i'll give you the evidence of the sticking your hand in your in your breast and it bring it out it'll become leprous and see brother brown said from that time on moses had no more questions he said did you ever notice he never run to the wilderness again he knew he was anointed now moses had evidences he had an evidence of the of the rod and his hand and all those things but do you know that the evidence of the new birth to you there is an evidence that you can actually see the new birth working in your life there's all these evidence that the evidences that brother brown talked about other people can see the evidence that something has happened to you that you've been at that burning bush there's been a change in your life because they can tell that your eyes have been opened that they're not shut anymore that your eyes have been opened to the word they can tell that you're speaking different that something has happened to you they can tell that you're walking different and you can tell because listen the whole journey that moses took signs and wonders followed him and signs and wonders will follow the believer that's the promise of god signs and wonders will follow the believer now in the spoken word is the original seed and a lot of other messages the anointed ones at the end time brother brown talked about how the signs and wonders can be a deception maybe the one of the greatest deceptions of this age that's why we don't follow after signs and wonders as an evidence that someone is preaching right or doing right or living right the word is our evidence the word is what separates us and identifies us but yet signs and wonders will follow the true word the a real correct revelation of the word so don't ever get away from expecting signs and wonders if if we are true believers the signs and wonders will follow them that believe because that's a promise in the bible god said i'll be with you so that settles it he said it and so that settles it see we don't have to prove it all we have to do is believe it i preached on that many times before now now you see all this whole this whole message why christ speak is building up to the proof of what the real genuine anointing is that when when moses got to the red sea it didn't matter if he felt something or he didn't feel something it didn't matter because a real genuine anointing is not based on feelings yeah when you when you were born again your natural birth was associated with sensations we're a mixed audience maybe so we're not going to get into that but your spiritual birth had no sensation your spiritual birth was the word of god being born in you and something began to work from the inside out and and it might manifest on the outside as a sensation as a movement as a happening something going on but the birth of the word would happen without sensation so you see you say well what is the evidence of the anointing how do i know if if i have the anointing brother brown said and where i think pentecost failed he said jesus had the greatest anointing that of any man that was ever on the earth is that right he said one day he went into the temple they gave him the scroll he picked it up in his hand he sat down and he read over in isaiah where it said the spirit of the lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year he began to identify himself in the scripture he began to identify and place himself in the word now listen when a believer begins to identify themselves by the word and place their life in the word and be able to see the same things that the scripture says what happened with a believer identified in their life there's a real anointed believer something on the inside anointed by the word something quickened on the inside and you may not feel it because feelings can be to say deceiving you may not even see it with your natural eye because feel sight can be deceiving but you can't deceive a revelation of the word you can't just deceive a true anointing of a believer that's got that's filled with the with the power of god on the inside of their heart he said the spirit of the lord is upon me to preach the acceptable year and so forth the jubilee year and he took the scroll and handed it back and sat down and precious words proceeded from his mouth the greatest anointing that was ever in the world on the lord jesus the greatest anointing and he was not necessarily running up and down the aisle jumping and screaming doing things that normally is what we associate with anointing but yet he would stand standing there at calm assurance knowing who he was knowing what his place was knowing what his purpose was knowing that he was not there just to just to fulfill some whims of the of the of the priests and the sadducees and pharisees of the heiress but he was there to fulfill the the plan and purpose for that age now now what would it be in a real a real believer of this day you see you've got a purpose that you are you are here to manifest in your life he said we methodists get noise confused with anointing noise ain't anointing no no i've seen where there's a lot of noise and not faith enough to cure a toothache see you've got to come solemnly to the father you've got to know exactly where you're standing that's right you've got to know exactly where you're standing so when you begin to accumulate all this background and accumulate all this faith over time over time you begin to know where you're standing you begin to have an understanding of what the word really is what the baptism of the holy ghost really does what your place is in the message what you're really doing here after i'm gonna just share this after after i got done preaching down in mobile one of the young people came up to me and he said i want to know what i'm supposed to be doing here i want to know what my purpose is in life you want to know what that does to a minister to hear a young person come up and say i i want to know what what god wants me to do with my life and i told him you get in the word and you'll find out god will reveal it to you but until you know until god shows it to you until god places you the way he wants you to be you just be a light because that is what god has predestinated every believer to be as a light to the world in your work and your school wherever you go when you walk and talk different from everybody else it will be an example to them it will be a testimony to them this is a story why christ speak the story of moses coming up to the red sea is a story of the anointing accumulating not dissipating it's not a story of god leaving that's the story of god being present but moses maybe not recognizing that he's still on the scene i wonder do we recognize that god is still on the scene in our lives i wonder if we recognize what our purpose is because if you don't recognize what your purpose is what you're doing here you will falter when you get to your own red sea experience you will begin to wonder what we're doing here see this is this message this message is not for little babies again this is a message for mature individuals and that's why sometimes it's so hard to preach because if you're not at a stage of maturity it can seem very confusing so just continue to keep accumulating the word until it's not confusing anymore until you begin accumulation makes the picture clear when you accumulate the word it will make the picture so you can see exactly how it is brother brown he got to the place where he he started looking started talking about looking back at his own life and he began to talk all these life experiences of the boy in finland that was raised from the dead and how he said if this child doesn't raise from the dead i'm a false prophet and killing the care be with 42 inch horns and the silver tip grizzly bear and all those things and he said and it annoys us it annoys us this is a quote when we see that we're living in the last days to find out that all these signs that we see being taken place that spoke of in the scripture would take place in the last days all the way from heaven to the political powers and the nature of the people and the demoralization of the world and among the women and how they would do in the last days and how the men would do and how the churches would do how the nations would do and how god would do and he says and we see it all laying right here on us when you begin to look and to see all these evidences it begins to accumulate in you of faith it begins to anoint in you that now we're actually living in a vision we're actually walking in things that the prophets foretold we're actually living out a vision and you have a place in that vision because you're a part of god's plan he said it anoints our faith it moves us out in the great cycles and he said we were predestinated for this hour and there is nothing going to stop us from seeing it my you think about a promise like that if you stay in the word there is nothing going to stop you from seeing it if you just keep walking in the word he said listen as long as you're walking in the word you actually have authority over the devil amen everybody doing all right you see faith is recognizing your purpose these do you see that's where as we get up to the to the end of the story i'm not there yet so well i've still got a ways to go we gotta we got a little bit further to go but to the end of the story moses faltered at recognizing his purpose do you see the power and in that quote where beram said when the bride begins to recognize who she is she will be an invincible army when we come to maturity when the bride becomes to a place of maturity you're supposed to recognize what you're doing here and recognize your purpose that you're not here just to just to be part of a lodge that you're actually here to overcome the devil to show the devil that that there is going to be a bride in this day that will believe every word of god that will not do like eve and falter it one word but she will believe all the word of god she will she will believe every last word of god and she will be able to take the hebrews 13 8 test that says hebrew he's the same yesterday today and forever she'll be able to pass that test and you see that is what your purpose is your purpose is to prove to the devil that god is going to have a bride it come out of satan's eden come out of the where god is the god of this evil age has elevated himself to a place of worship put himself at a place of maturity god has also got his bride is coming to a place of maturity the brother said moses esteemed the reproach of christ greater riches than the treasures in egypt for he had respect under the recompense of the reward and he talked about how moses by faith he was watching what would be and this is a very i wonder if you ever really meditated on how brother branham explained faith in this sermon because usually we think of faith being something looking present tense but here in this sermon brother brown says that faith is looking watching what will be now think about that think if you're sitting there in your bed of pain moaning with sickness and ailments if you begin to look at what god has promised that you will be and walk into that you will walk into what his word says you will be if you're sitting there in sickness and you you look at what he says you will be not what you are you will walk into that you see how important it is to look at what his word says you will be as we get as we get to the crossing over the red sea crossing over into a glorified body you look to that knocked to your present condition you look you're looking to the unseen what his word says will be he said look at tomorrow instead of today look at the promise instead of the glamor and then in this message he spends maybe 15 minutes hitting on how people look at look at glamour look at the magazines in the supermarket look at the movies and things and they try to pattern themselves after the glamour of the world and he says doing that this is an extraordinary statement looking at the glamor of the world will paralyze your faith but he says don't let that paralyze your faith but let your faith paralyze their circumstance now think about that if you're looking to the promise of god in his word if you're looking to that then that actually paralyzes the circumstance all that disease is creeping up your body but looking to god's word will paralyze that it won't be able to move anymore because your faith is looking at god's word look at god's word and and your lost children it will paralyze the devil being able to move in their life because you're looking at what god's word says that there's a promise that me and my house the promise just like as in the days of of the israelites when they put that lamb's blood over the little of their door it was for the whole house and if you'll look to god's word it will paralyze anything that the devil can do in your house it will paralyze what the devil's doing [Applause] see brother said moses faith took the word of god he said faith sees what god wants done you see where he began to falter at the red sea he didn't realize he began to falter at what god wanted done listen meditate on this as i'm speaking now all of these things are beginning to accumulate in your heart that you must know the plan and purpose for your life in god's word that god wants something done and if you can if you can begin to get a revelation of what god wants done and stand firm on that you can come like all the saints of old that didn't have to go pray to check up uh whether or not it was god's will for them to be healed or whether or not it was god's will for a after the day of pentecost to receive the holy ghost you don't have to go pray to check up whether it's god's will for you to do these things because it's written in his word and if he'll stand up on the word he's already gave the promise he's already said what he wants done with the word a mature believer knows what god wants done with the word and they begin to speak it because they know what he wants done they believe it and they can say it see brother and said faith doesn't look at the present time faith looks to what god wants and works accordingly faith is a long-range vision it sees what god wants and works through that and then brother brown began to use the the metaphor of the of a man looking through binoculars and he said that's like somebody looking through the old and new testament so if you want to have clarity on what god wants you have to look through the word through the binoculars of god's word of the old and new testament held up together to be able to see clearly what god wants and see then it becomes then it becomes like reading the bible becomes like reading tomorrow's newspaper it'll become like reading what god will fulfill in your life tomorrow if you just keep walking in his word you see you see it was written that you would overcome in revelations chapter three that there will be a overcomer in the age of of layout of sea it was written that your your hearts would be turned back to the original faith in malachi 4. malachi 4 wasn't just about a prophet but it was about your heart being turned back by the preaching of the gospel in this day it was written that in first peter chapter 2 ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house that was written of you and you see that's god's purpose and plan for your life is to be built up as lively stones and it was written that you would cast out the devil in mark 16 how would you cast out the devil by the word by the revelation of the word in your life you would see the devil leaving you by the revelation of the word you can cast out the devil and others if they will believe your word by the revelation of the word god has given his church power to cast out the devil by the word you have authority over the devil that is fulfillment of scripture people in the bible were promised something that their offspring were seeds and many times many times you know abraham was promised the promised land paul was promised but he promised the thessalonians the rapture paul promised the corinthians the change of the body a jesus promised spoken word power to the disciples but it and it didn't happen necessarily in that in that time period but it was something that would be manifest in a later day and now we're living in the day when all of these promises are rolling up to be gathered up to heaped up to be fulfilled in your life you talk about being excited by the message all of these promises are here for them to be fulfilled in your life and that's what that's the problem that moses had there the red sea he lost sight of the fact that all those things that had accumulated up in his life all those promises that he was there he was predestinated to fulfill he lost sight of his purpose in god's plan brother graham said there is no fear in faith moses faith never did fear pharaoh he said faith as i've always said it's got great big muscles and hairs on the chest faith said shut up and everybody shuts up that's all i know where i'm at the rest of them say well well now maybe he does with that kind of confidence speaking out somebody that really really believes what they're saying that'll make everybody else turn and look maybe he does know what he's talking about all right brother ryan said you got to show your muscles this is when the devil comes around and begins to say buddha you've you've got to say boo back don't let yourself you do not have to be run over by the devil listen the devil the devil will try to run over you with complexes and things he'll try to sit on you with a sickness and make you think well this is just how it is now but there's a promise in god's word of deliverance you don't have to let the devil run run rough shot all over you brother said pharaoh said if you do this that will see just so far and he began to talk about how pharaoh said now now let the elders go out into the into the desert but don't let the people begin to get a revelation of what i'm talking about you can just go just so far go out for a little way and do what your little sacrifices in the wilderness but then come back the next day just go so far isn't that the way the devil wants us to do is just just go so far now now we can't like some of the young people say we we can't get the capstone until until we go in the rapture then we'll be we can't ever be perfect in this life listen how are you going to be per the blood of jesus christ was given to make you perfect he atoned for you so that you will be made perfect it's not he it's not our righteousness that we're looking at it's not our righteousness that god is looking at he's looking at his own righteousness his atoning grace his atoning blood that he paid the price so that we could have his perfection he took his our sin upon himself so that we could have perfection in him i see brother brown said the faith that moses had didn't believe in us so far religion he said we're all going we're all going we're all going all the way that's what my confe i want my confession to be tonight is that we're not going to leave any stragglers we can say maybe like the marines no soldier left behind we're all going if you'll if you'll just yield yourself to the gospel believe the word that's going across the pulpit that's being said on the tapes we're all going all the way and he said brother brown said that i'm so glad that a man can completely serve god till he the devil don't know what to do with him you see that's what happened was moses was so completely yielded to god pharaoh and all the egyptians didn't know what to do with him until finally they said i can't do anything else with you so just get on out of here a real true son of god that comes to a mature place after a while the devil he'll circle you now he's not going to leave you alone but he'll continue to circle you and poke at you and try you until finally the bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you and he'll flee from you he said moses served god so completely until the devil didn't know what to do with him but you see it's building up your confidence all of these things accumulate until you can see god you can look back in your own life and see god working in your life from your new birth all the way to your present condition see god god was constantly working in moses life all through his journey to vindicate the claim that he was who he said he was and he is working in the heart of every believer to vindicate the claim and their life of who they say they are if you say that you are a real true born-again believer god is on the scene to vindicate that claim if it's true if you're not a hypocrite he is on the claim and he was on the on the scene to vindicate in moses life when moses said let the w river turn to blood god was on the scene to vindicate that when he said let frogs come out let lice let fleas let boils come on on the cattle god was on the scene to vindicate that and he was on the scene that time you were seeking the new birth he vindicated your claims as you as you as you laid the scripture in front laid your scripture out there and said god i'm confessing what the promise that you already made he vindicated it that time you needed healing that time you had a problem at work or maybe that time that you were confronted with false doctrine god came on the scene and delivered you from that he was there all those times if you could just look back and see all the times that god was on the scene isn't that what brother brown was preaching in the seventh seal when we the first time we were listening that we thought well it seems like brother brown was talking about himself an awful lap a lot but he was looking back at his own journey so knowing that god had taken him from a place he took him on a journey and he knew he knew where he was positionally so let's get to let's get to the point of the message in exodus chapter 14 verse 13 it says and moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace now moses makes this bold declaration seems like a a brave confession perfectly in line with god's word perfectly in line with what it's about to take place but then there must be a little gap in this and something hidden there something that took took place maybe maybe all of a sudden moses just felt real downtrodden maybe he felt maybe this just he didn't feel anything maybe he was standing there and he didn't he didn't feel the anointing anymore now what are you going to do if you don't feel the anointing do you have to constantly feel something in your life to know what god wants you to do do you have to constantly see lights and see things now listen don't fall asleep on me now now it's not the time to fall asleep arise and possess your inheritance let's wake up arouse yourself just for a little bit lord brother graham said he back there back there he waited say now lord i'm just a baby let me tell you now he's saying back there and mo at the beginning of moses life when he was just a baby he moses could say let me tell you now he said yeah i'll go do this i've got they say of the lord brother is that thus saith the lord yes yes brother moses that's thus saith the lord yeah and it happened never failed one time never did fail but he said he wasn't a baby anymore now it might have been fine for him to cry and boohoo and and look for anointings and things back then but now he's not a baby anymore what should the church be the church should not be something that you have to baby and and cuddle and and say nice things for them to come to church the church should be at a place where they know what they're here for and you don't have to prod them to come to church brother said god had performed everything perfectly he started them on their journey he's got the church together they've been called out they come from every denomination and he said god brother i said and god said now i've gotten them started on their journey they're all done called out the church is together so i've got them on their journey now moses take them on over i've told you to i'm going to sit down and rest a while now what this means brother rob you're not supposed to interpret what i'm saying now listen god's not going off the scene but he's got he's got a place of confidence see this message is about confidence but god looks at you and he's got confidence that you know what you're doing after all this training all this time he's brought moses up into a place now you should know what to do and he's like okay moses you know what to do do it you know what you're here for do it you don't have to come beg and cry and plead with me to to find out what you're supposed to be doing here you're supposed to know what to do and you're supposed to just speak and go forward brother brown said here it is and the circumstances comes up again he's got on the journey the church is already called out and they're moving up and moses started crying out lord is it thus saith the lord what what must i do is it thus saith the lord for people to be healed is it thus do i need do i need brother brahm to come back from the grave so that we can have thus saith the lord or do we have confidence in the words that he's already spoken that they are thus saith the lord that when you have a revelation of what god wants done with his word it is thus saith the lord and you don't need to go boohoo and cry to find out whether god wants done with the word what he's already said he wants done with the word he's already put these promises in the word and you don't have to go cry and grovel at his feet to find out what he wants done with the word he's already said you can be healed if you believe it he's already said that we're going to take a body change we don't have to go cry and grovel to find out if he's if we're going to take a body change we don't have to cry and grovel to find out if these virtues are required we know we know what god wants done with the word you see we don't have to you see he's talking about moses but he's talking about you and i he's talking about us where do you see yourself in this plan right now moses said oh lord look look coming here comes pharaoh here comes after all the things that god had done how how he had by moses mouth spoke fleas and lice and all the different things that all the plagues by moses mouth and now moses at a place where he said oh trembling in his knees look at look here comes pharaoh the people are all what must i do what must i do see there isn't that just human beings now see that's the same thing that we might be doing looking around at circumstances looking around at all the the pandemic and and maybe shaking it out what are we gonna do i can't go to church now even if i wear a mask i'm afraid listen now is not the time to be looking at circumstances now is not the time to be looking at the glamour of the world now is the time to look forward to the promises of god what god wants you to fulfill he has already said in his word he wants you to do and to walk in it and to put one foot in front of the other until you see it being made manifest in your life and you will see it may manifest in your life because he promised it we're not following the promises of a man we're not laying under the shadow of a man but we're laying under the shadow of the gospel is what brother raymond said in this message we're laying under the shadow of not just some pretense so not just some some something conjured up but we're laying under the preach we're laying under the shadow of the revealed word of god now brother brown said now you remember he had already prophesied here for he said these egyptians that you see today you'll see no more and then immediately begin to cry out god what can we do see after he done done a pretty good job and prophesying there you see he done told them what would happen if the word of god was in him it was in him and when he was telling that it actually come to pass what he said was already going to come to pass and here he was crying out what am i going to do he had already predicted what they was going to do that they were going to the promised land see we're going to the promised land and we know where we're going but don't falter at the red sea you must have confidence in what you believe in it's time to flex those big faith muscles and stand for something brother said he predicted the end of the very nation he was brought up we're in now let's make this present tense for you because the bible says in revelation 11 to 15 the kingdoms of this world are become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ that's the seventh trumpet sounding the seventh trumpet sounds to announce the kingdoms the end of all the kingdoms of the world and brother adam said the seventh trumpet parallels the seventh seal which is what the end you at the end of your overcoming journey the complete conquering of all of the devil's tricks in your life until god is manifested completely in you god revealing himself in you the coming of the lord the seventh seal the kingdoms of this world have become the kingdoms of our lord and of his christ and moses predicted the very end of the end of the very nation he was brought up in and the bible predicts the end of all of the carnal desires all of the things that you were brought up in it predicts the end of all of this carnal nature that you are going to overcome this flesh that you're going to see and overcome the bible says that's going to be overcome and look to that look that one day you're walking toward that glorified body that's going to be the final like brother dale says when when that day comes then you'll know that you've been born again that's fantastic see he was called for the job man wants to rest and let god do the pushing but god wants you to have confidence in what you believe in so he doesn't have to keep constantly pushing you and prodding you now did not i told you you can be healed if you believe i told you you can receive the new birth i told you there's a capstone didn't i tell you all these things he didn't he doesn't want to keep he wants you to come to a place of maturity now isn't that what maturity is you see you see a grown man in the natural acting like a little baby you're like that's something's wrong there that's not a mature person the same thing in the spiritual a preacher or whatever a minister behind the pulpit groveling and acting like a little baby that's that's odd that's off kilter that god doesn't want us to be little babies that have to constantly cry aren't weaned off the bottle yet but he wants us to know positionally how we're placed and what god wants us to do here moses was anointed for the job his claims were vindicated it was time for the people to be delivered in that the case now is time for us to take a body change god had drawn them all together in one group now we're not all grown together in one group physically but we're all united by faith by one spirit one baptism one truth together we're all united all around the world everything god had promised he had done it and he said brother brown said he wanted to wait for thus saith the lord and he said his the very vindication of his call was thus saith the lord he said his job was thus saith the lord my you think about that i'll be honest i was thinking about that before i walked out of the office that if you're a god called minister that is thus saith the lord if you're a god called song leader that is thus saith the lord if you're a god called deacon if you're a god called whatever it is if you're if you're a god called housewife if you're a god called worker in the workplace with your little lunch pail that is thus saith the lord amen right see a lot of people are waiting for brother madam to come back from the dead to give us thus saith the lord when you've already got it because it's already been preached and you've already got the saith the lord moses was at the red sea waiting for the sith lord i wonder could we be at the red same red sea experience tonight waiting for thus saith the lord when we've already got it and god wants us to recognize that we've already got it you've already got thus saith the lord we've already heard all eleven hundred sermons we've already heard the word preached we've already heard it all accumulated accumulated and built up within within it within us like lively stones built up into a spiritual house built up built up until now we should be standing as mature believers knowing what we're doing and able to speak it yes amen and said god must have got fed up he said why are you crying to me haven't i already proved my identification haven't i told you that i sent you for the job didn't i tell you to go do this didn't i promise that i'd speak through you didn't i promise that i'd show signs and wonders didn't i call you didn't i say it wasn't you it was me now make that personal all of those things could be applied to your own life if you will recognize that you have thus saith the lord he said then when any little thing comes up why you act like a baby you ought to be a man and brother brown said whatever it is if it's sickness if it's sickness or whatever it is whatever it is to raise the dead or whatever it is speak i've proved it speak to the people he said the church ought to be old enough to speak and he said but we don't know that you see we're still little babies with a bottle in our mouth see he said he said what this church ought to be this morning he went on to to explain all the things that we can observe to build to anoint our faith here is the world in this condition there's the nation in this condition there's the women in their condition there's the man in the condition i was telling the believers in mobile that that that brother brown and the message god this evil age he really hits on the women but in the message satan need satan's eden he hits on the men and one of the things he hits on was how men and women don't know who they are they they dress they cross dress and all that stuff and he said there is the church in the condition the church that's rejected the truth for their day and then he says there is everything now if you can look at all these evidences and observe no look at your own life look back at all the things that all the evidence is in your own life all the things the times that god has been with you and accumulate all those things together in your heart looking at the signs of the times that we're living in that should that should anoint your faith to know that you're anointed for the job that god has given you thus saith the lord and you're walking in it and see then brother branham begins to lay out all these examples in the scripture that david was anointed for a job when samuel poured that anointing on him he wasn't afraid to go faith goliath and he went with all of the accumulated experiences of fighting the lion and the bear that i know that that same god that delivered me from the lion and the bear that delivered those things into my hand he will deliver you goliath into my hand he went with all those experiences accumulated in his heart building up his faith and you see moses should have accumulated all those things and you and i should have accumulated all those things so that we know who we are that we're anointed for a job joshua was anointed for a job where the bible says there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee and he had a job to do and that's that scripture that brother that brother brown the famous one the one that we think about in this sermon why christ speak that joshua in the hour of need knew that he was anointed for the job as he was fighting as the israelites were fighting the enemy and he saw the sun begin to set and he knew he knew that god had given him a job to destroy the enemy not to leave one standing but to utterly destroy the unit see god has given you a job to see the devil completely destroyed in your life completely pushed out and joshua had that shame thus saith the lord message that same commission to see the enemy destroyed and he saw the sun setting and he spoke he didn't have to go run and ask god permission because god had already given him thus saith the lord and he spoke it and he said let the he said son stands thou still upon god and thou moon and the valley of agilent and it did and he didn't maybe know why or how all he knew was that god had given him a commission and he he was so confident in that commission that god had raised him up for a purpose that he spoke it and it came to pass david had a job to do joshua had a job to do and moses had a job to do and you have a job to do you have a thus saith the lord commission to do your job brother abraham said samson was anointed he was raised up he was ordained of god given a gift of power and ordained to destroy the philistines and when he got surrounded one day he didn't say oh lord what should i do but he just reached down on the ground and found oh maybe crumbling up decaying jawbone of a donkey and he reached down because he had a thus saith the lord commission he didn't have to go beg and plead with god to find out what he was supposed to do but he grabbed that jawbone of an ass and he slew a thousand philistines you see we've got to have that kind of confidence in our commission you say well i'm not a brother brand i'm not a i'm not a big minister or something i'm not a big name listen you've got a commission just the same as any big person you might even be bigger brother brown said he never cried to god talking about samson he used his anointed gift he knew he was sent for the job he knew he was born for that do you see why mo well god brother brown spent so much time laying out how moses could look back and see the way he was born and the time he came he knew he was born for the thing for the job that he was going to take and see you can look at your birth your spiritual birth and know that you were born for a purpose he said he never asked nothing that was his job that god was dealing through him he didn't ask no questions he didn't cry out can i take the philistines lord he routed them nothing going to bother him he was anointed for the work he took what he had and beat into them and he said there is nothing can harm you there is nothing that can harm you that god doesn't allow god will allow sickness to come on you to bring you to a place but his word says that he's a healer his word says that he took upon himself all those beatings and stripes he took so that we could be healed y'all getting tired on me a little bit i'm trying i'm trying to come to a place where i can close but brother braham said if there ever was a time that man should speak now listen close now if there ever was a time that man should speak it's now and he said no more crying about your purpose what to do he said the bride has the background the bride has the background the accumulated anointing and he and he went through all these examples he said peter when he came to the great gate beautiful and he saw the man laying there laying on his feet he never went off to pray and asked god do you want me to to do this do you want me to tell this man that he he can be healed he he all he did was he said silver and gold i don't have any silver and gold but i'll tell you i got something and if you believe it you can rise up he said rise up and walk in the name of the lord and that man did and not because peter went off and worked something up but he had confidence in his commission he knew what he was predestinated to do he had a thus saith the lord commission jesus never cried when they brought him the maniac bored and said and said satan come out of him he never had to go cry and you know figure out if it was if it was god's will for that boy to be healed all he did was he said satan come out of him he never said now wait i'll kneel down here all of you kneel down and pray at the tomb of lazarus he never said now let's all get together and just pray a little bit so that i can figure out if that's if this is god's will he knew what god wanted he was god in flesh jesus at the grave of lazarus he said i am the resurrection and the life he knew he was the messiah and he just spoke lazarus come forth do you know that same voice is supposed to supposed to cry out in this day and all the dead saints will come forth from the graves that same voice brother braham said he knew his god-given rice but we don't he knew what he was we don't and he goes on he says moses forgot he needed to be a reminder we got all these promises in the bible of john 14 12 verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because i go under my father you know brother brown said that when when the bible speaks of when jesus said in john chapter 2 verse 19 destroy this temple and in three days i will raise it up brother raymond said the same scripture that said he would raise up his body give us the authority the power that same scripture that spoke of jesus is speaking of you because it says in my name they shall cast out devils they'll speak with new tongues if they take up serpents or drink deadly things it won't harm them if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover that's a commission of thus saith the lord commission to you that if you will believe it and walk in it it will come to pass see i believe we're coming to a place where we don't need to go pray up for a while to find out if god really didn't mean what he said he said it any minute in matthew chapter 17 verse 20 it says and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hints to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you if you just have faith as a grain of mustard seed knowing your commission knowing where you stand knowing what god wants done with the word speak to the mountain and it shall be removed i i wonder tonight how many still regard that as just one of those scriptures i believe that even in our ears that scripture even in our sight that scripture is now beginning to become reality to us that now is the time when the sons of god will be made manifest i believe it's happening because it's been spoken brother brahma said in the rapture message he said the rapture has been spoken now let it come to pass and jesus spoke this word and it's now coming to pass he said in john chapter 15 verse 7 if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you ye shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you not somebody just asking for a new car or something but somebody asking in faith based upon the word based upon the correct revelation and understanding of the word and that will give you power and authority to speak it and you because you realize that you have that you have confidence in the word because it's been accumulated in you it's been built up to a place where now you have confidence in the word and god has confidence in you brother brown said why cry to me the musicians can go ahead and come forward i'm i'm coming to a closing place why are you crying to me when i proved to be with you haven't i healed your sick he'd say haven't i told you things that happened just exactly your pastor can't do that now i love this quote because it sounds so similar to the quote in looking to the unseen what god actually speaks through brother branham this quote is almost a verbatim quote to that if you will go back and listen to that and how he says i'm the one that gave the promise in looking to the unseen and he says brother brown has nothing to do with this with this i'm speaking through him now listen to this as i just read this in closing he said he can't he's a man it's me the lord that he would say i'm the one that did this i'm the one that tells him these things to say it's not him it's my voice i'm the one that raises up your dead when they drop down i'm the one that heals the sick i'm the one that foretells these things i'm the one that does the saying saving i'm the one that give the promise you see brothers and sisters i don't believe that we've heard a message just from a man but i believe that was god speaking to us confirming his word to us confirming the commission confirming your personal commission you believe that tonight well let's just stand and worship the lord i hope this was a blessing to you and would build up your confidence [Music] we're on a journey i am bound for the promised land [Music] [Applause] [Music] one eternal day there god the son i am
