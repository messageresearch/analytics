lips. Jesus has set me free. I'm happy as heart can be. [music] No longer I bear the burden of care. His yoke is so sweet to me. My soul was as black as [singing] night, but darkness has taken twice. [music] Now I shout the victory [singing] cuz Jesus is in to me. I look on the great white throne [music] before the ransom stand. No longer or tear, no sorrow is known for death is that goodly land. My savior [singing] has gone [music] before preparing [singing] the way for me. Soon will be to part no more through time or eternity. The Jesus [music and singing] has set me free.

There's not a secret formula. There's not something you drink or something you eat or except the word of God. &gt;&gt; The word of God is the only thing that's going to get us out of here. And that's what the the souls in the sixth dimension, [clears throat] that's where the word people go. &gt;&gt; But them word people over there are not in their right to be conditioned. &gt;&gt; They are longing. Now, that's kind of strange. We're longing to get out of here. They're longing to come back here &gt;&gt; cuz they're coming back here though to complete they without us shall not be made perfect. &gt;&gt; Then we'll come down here connect with the with all of us be perfect together. And then we're going to get out of here. Then we're going to let we're going to let the Lord do what he's going to do and and uh just pray to God you're not here after the rapture takes place [clears throat] cuz all these little things that we see today and earthquakes and tsunamis and um hurricanes dropping a bucket &gt;&gt; dropping a bucket to what it's going to be after we leave this place.

So, being a being a postman, I know that means something. Old Gills Road. All right. Put that in there and you will be able to get there. So, let's [clears throat] turn to First Corinthians. We're going to if you want to keep your Bibles open today, we're going to go to the book of Matthew and we're going to walk through the seals as Jesus preached them. And um and that will kind of give us a foundation to what we're looking at because the seals the seals were preached by Jesus himself as a prophecy. &gt;&gt; All right? And it was for a natural happening. &gt;&gt; Keep that in your mind. A natural happening in Matthew 24. Is everybody with me? All right. Then when brother Brandham comes and and when Jesus Christ left the scene, he's the headstone. He's the seventh seal. When he left, all that went with him. &gt;&gt; Wasn't revealed to anyone else. Even though he spoke it, they didn't understand what he was talking about. But then in the end time, it had to be open for that to be released back. And Christ, the mighty angel, Revelations 10, had to come down with the book in his hand. That same book that Christ is. Now remember, Christ is the book. &gt;&gt; All right, everybody with me. Christ is he was standing there with everything you read right here. He was standing there with it inside of himself [snorts] &gt;&gt; because it came from the mind of God. &gt;&gt; So it was sealed up though until the end times so that we can understand and go back to the book of Matthew. We can go back to all the different scriptures that man has probed that many times, but we know the true revelation of what's going to happen. So we'll go to that today and give you the natural happening. Brother Brandham [clears throat] came and when he opened the seals that was a spiritual application. &gt;&gt; All right. And remember they didn't they didn't break to the people in 1963. &gt;&gt; Remember he said it's not for you. &gt;&gt; Okay? It's not for you to get. But right around the coming of the Lord, there's a group of people that's going to catch that revelation just as Matthew and we'll get into it in just a little while. So, let's bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, thank you for the the [clears throat] song service, Lord. Things that we have uh done, Lord. We've done everything that we all the ordinances that we supposed to do. Now, Lord, I pray that you would Lord, you speak to the people, Father. Lord, you be the one that that does the speaking and also the revealing, Father, because as a human being, there's no way a human being can give another human being a revelation. It has to come from you, Father. [clears throat] And we are revelation people. We love it, Lord, when when we have that moment that that it was that it was closed and now it's revealed. Lord, it's that moment that the light comes on, Father, and we see you more clearly. Father, I pray that you'd be with us now. Be with the ones that are sick, ones that are on the highways. We have many, many that are traveling because of the holidays. I pray that you'd get them all back together safe with us, Lord. Be brother Anderson as he takes off and and [clears throat] heads north. That the roads would be clear, Father. Lord, give us a blessing today. We come Lord looking for a blessing from you father and we're expecting it in Jesus name. Amen. 1 [snorts] Corinthians 2:9. But that as is written eyeath not seen nor ear heard neither have entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that what that love him. Most [clears throat] the world don't love him. [snorts] &gt;&gt; You know I know I got you standing but just a minute. I want to talk to sister Regina just for a moment. Is that okay? Me and her. I'm right here with me and her. She's not going to turn red cuz you understand what I'm talking about. [clears throat] When Rex, her brother, Jim's brother was saying the things he said and he asked me that question. He asked me about blasphemy. You ask about why if you say Jesus Christ and they [clears throat] say Jesus Christ, how is that blasphemy and this is not? Well, it's all in how you speak it. All right. &gt;&gt; It comes from their soul. &gt;&gt; All right. Listen. It comes from their soul cuz that's a real them. It comes from their soul though as a derogatory statement. &gt;&gt; It comes from our soul because remember I've been reading scripture folks in Romans. Look at this. Daddy preached this years ago. If you don't put Lord in there, see, they don't say, "I'm sorry, but I'm going to." They don't say, "Lord Jesus Christ." They say Jesus Christ. They're just saying making a statement, but we know he's our Lord. &gt;&gt; He's the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; He's Jesus Christ to many people, but he's our Lord. &gt;&gt; Read in Romans, if you'll keep reading in Romans, I never saw it like that before. You keep reading in Romans, it says, "Lord, Lord Jesus, Lord Jesus Christ." We put that on there because we know he's our Lord. &gt;&gt; In the world, they can say that they mean nothing. It's blasphemy. &gt;&gt; If you don't repent, it's blasphemy. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; But he's our Lord. &gt;&gt; And he is the what? He's the curator of my soul. &gt;&gt; He's the one that takes care of it. See, if they would if they would if they would say if they would say, "God, forgive me," they'd know who Jesus Christ is. &gt;&gt; But other than that, it's just words. &gt;&gt; And it's words that are used by the devil himself. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. But he'll never he'll never call him Lord. &gt;&gt; He doesn't want him to be Lord. But you and I, we want him to be our Lord. &gt;&gt; Satan will never do that. He will never say, "Oh, Lord." No. because he don't want him to be as Lord and the world don't want him to be as Lord, but they want to say that Jesus Christ the way they say it, you know, it's many, many times we've heard it and it's just become common and and I hate it and I know y'all do too. If it doesn't give a little sting in your heart, then you need a heart transplant. &gt;&gt; Amen. And and the name in vain and all that stuff. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Cuz that mean that name means something. But when we put Lord in there, he's our Lord and Master. We know that. &gt;&gt; And I say Jesus Christ. And I can put every moniker there is. Father, son, holy ghost, redeemer, savior, healer, Jehovah, Gyra, Rapha, all we can. That all goes to our mind. What goes through these people's mind is is a derogatory statement towards someone. &gt;&gt; And I hate that. But it's a spirit that Satan puts on them &gt;&gt; to say the word like we say the word. But how does it come? It comes from a heart that loves the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not just this word over here. So, I'm sorry. Let me I just wanted to answer that because it came to me the other day after we talked about it on the phone. So So that was [applause] that was for you. That was to help you [clears throat] cuz you know I mean really they say that word now more than they say the GD word. &gt;&gt; They've done moved up cuz you know what? Satan wants to be their Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But they can't. &gt;&gt; He can't. &gt;&gt; No. He's not the Lord Jesus Christ. I'll promise you that. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; All right. Listen. That's why I said prepared for them that love him. Cuz we know who our lover is. &gt;&gt; Our lover is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But God hath revealed them unto us by his spirit. For the spirit searchth all things, yay, the deep things of God or even the inmost depth of God's being. You may be seated and the Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word. But praise God for revelation, for knowledge, for to know that that written word is going to this word right here, this Bible is going to kill &gt;&gt; billions of people. &gt;&gt; Amen. They can read it [snorts] &gt;&gt; over [clears throat] and over again. &gt;&gt; Junior's brother said he read the Bible three times. Three times. &gt;&gt; That's just like reading a That's just like reading a a novel or or a newspaper. &gt;&gt; What do you get out of it? &gt;&gt; Nothing. But you and I are the very word made manifest. When I read that word, there is an imprint. As brother Steven Wilson was talking about, there's a DNA imprint that you and I As Christians have, when we get born again, we receive the DNA of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; We still have the DNA that that that mama brought, daddy brought right here. Okay. And you [clears throat] still have that old Adamic nature inside of you if you don't get changed. That's why that Jesus said, "Nicodemus, you must be born again." Not born. And then Nicodemus, what' he say? Have I got go back? Well, see, if he went back in his mama's womb and come out again, he'd still be dead. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He'd still have the same DNA he had that the mom and daddy gave. &gt;&gt; But no, Jesus said, "You must be born from above." &gt;&gt; You and I today must be born from above. When we are born from above, we can read the Bible. And the mind of Christ is with us and in us to show us even the little minute details about leaving the word Lord out or putting the word Lord in or having a capital L or a lowercase L. Brother Dale preached that years and years ago and it means something. &gt;&gt; Right? [clears throat] It means a lot actually. &gt;&gt; Listen, every word of God was predetermined by God himself. before the foundation of the world &gt;&gt; to help us. &gt;&gt; Now, I may have Acts 2:38. You may have Acts 19 as your favorite scripture. Mine's Genesis 1:26. But my DNA is woven that. &gt;&gt; Come on, folks. That called your name. That's what called you. &gt;&gt; Your mom and daddy DIDN'T CALL YOU. GOD CALLED YOU. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; But I want you to remember one thing. Without the DNA of your mother and father, you wouldn't be here today. &gt;&gt; God's not gonna just bring a soul &gt;&gt; without bringing a spirit and a body. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, we're a unit. And because of what happened in the fall that we couldn't come by theophony form, we had to come in flesh. &gt;&gt; But remember that theophony is going to be flesh. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. We're not getting a different flesh. &gt;&gt; It's this [snorts] one redeemed. This one made new. This one changed. That's why they call it change. &gt;&gt; This one changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye. We're not going to get started today. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; But now look, but he said it meant it takes the Holy Spirit to give us revelation or we fail to get it. So that's what we were talking about when June's brother, I hate to use it, but he called me and said, "What's the difference?" And I said, "Where it comes from?" &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The source behind it is what the difference is. That's right. &gt;&gt; You say it different than Sister Regina does. Same word, same wording, spelled the same, said the same, but different meanings to different people. &gt;&gt; Now listen, let me tell you something else. Let me warn you, though. You can sit here for 40 and 50 years &gt;&gt; and not hear that word. And Jesus will not be your Lord until you let him. &gt;&gt; Until you let him. You got to let him be your Lord. &gt;&gt; You can't let everything else be your Lord. You got to let him be your Lord. You say, "Oh, no. God can do what he wants to do." God can do what he wants to do. But remember, he gave you a free will to choose what to do or not. &gt;&gt; If not, he just said, "Adam, you can't do that. You can't do that. You can't do that. you got to do this over here. No, he said, Adam, here you are. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let I'm going to let Eve make her choice. Then she's going to bring it to Adam and Adam's going to make his choice. &gt;&gt; We We burned Eve a lot of times, but Adam's the one that sold us out, folks. &gt;&gt; Adam's the one that let all this happen just like it is right now. &gt;&gt; But we love the Lord, don't we? &gt;&gt; But it takes the Holy Spirit. And when that Holy Spirit gives you revelation, you will keep it. It will never leave you. How do you know you got a revelation? It'll always be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It'll always be there, sir. &gt;&gt; It'll never leave you. I don't need Listen, you and I both don't need a revelation of water baptism again. &gt;&gt; Now, we can add more to it. &gt;&gt; We can add more to it, &gt;&gt; but there's no more. I MEAN, WHEN I KNOW I got a the the water baptism in the name of Lord Jesus Christ is the only baptism, I don't have to have that revelation again. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You know why? because that is molded inside of me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It is a part of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like your DNA of your whatever your hair color and your nose and your eyes and your ears and all that stuff. Let me get back to that. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; If you're a bride today, God loves you so much. He handpicked your body. &gt;&gt; You say, "I don't like the body I'm in." You better be careful. I don't like the things I do in this body, &gt;&gt; but that's me. Do you hear me? I said I, not God. It's what I do. That is what I hate. I don't hate being alive. Not if I'm born again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't hate being alive. &gt;&gt; I love being alive. &gt;&gt; But you know what he done? He come way back at the beginning of time. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He come down to Noah, Ham, Sham, and Jpath. That's where we all came from. Amen. &gt;&gt; Every one of us did. &gt;&gt; And he handpicked &gt;&gt; every how many thousands of years to today all the way back. He put this one with this one, this one with this one. You wonder how did my mom and dad get together? God put them together. &gt;&gt; But they were vile. They were this. They were that. They were, you know, that ain't for you to choose. You don't choose how you get here. Amen. &gt;&gt; And if you adults know what I'm talking about, during an act, there's thousands of things can happen. There's thousands of germs and thousands of eggs or hundreds of eggs that you could have been anything. &gt;&gt; Well, it was one &gt;&gt; God directed that one &gt;&gt; to get your character here to match the character he already knew you'd be in the Bible. &gt;&gt; You got to find your character. What is the character of God? It's in the Bible, but it better be in us. That's why that statue of perfect man is something we got to work on. Sure, it's there. You get everything you need at the baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; BUT YOU GOT TO USE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO LET [screaming] IT OUT. &gt;&gt; LET GOD DO THE WORK. &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm just I'm If you got an uncction to get up and run, Regina, be careful. Get up and run. I pray to the Lord that maybe one day we can expand this building and we can have a Jericho march. &gt;&gt; Anybody ever participated in one of them? I I have. Well, bless y'all's heart. We don't have room to do it up here. We'd run all over each other and get hurt and have to pray for the sick. Right, brother Collie? [laughter] Now, bringing these two thoughts together, you'll see it won't take just ordinary study. See, ordinary people, they they wonder how they got here. Wonder what they're doing here. And like Junior's brother, just when you die, you just go back to dust. I told her, I said, she needs to tell, and I'll tell him next time I see Rex, I'll say, I'll promise you one thing. When you close your eyes in death on this side, you're going to open your eyes somewhere. &gt;&gt; I'll promise you. I'm telling you, these these guys that the popes and all these different things that think that they're so high and mighty and they may be, but when they close their eyes on this side, it's going to be oops moment on that side. &gt;&gt; They ain't going to be where they think they're going to be. And I'll promise you, you can will people can will yourself that all I can do anything I want to cuz I'm not going to be judged. And that's okay. You will be judged &gt;&gt; when you close your eyes here. You going to either be in the fifth dimension or the sixth dimension. &gt;&gt; One of the two. YOU'RE GOING SOMEWHERE &gt;&gt; and then you got to come back to be judged. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gee, I don't know where that all come from, but it's good. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; It'll take the operation of the Holy Ghost. That means this book, what are we talking about now? The Bible. This book can't be revealed to anyone but a special class of people. It will take one with prophetic insight. That's what we have. We have prophetic insight. When you sit here and you listen to a minister and he gives you the word of God and it becomes a part of you, becomes a revelation, it becomes a part of you, that is your prophetic insight working. &gt;&gt; You're working the gift, but you are prophetic people also. &gt;&gt; Okay? If you've not had a revelation in a long time, you haven't read, studied, or prayed. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Well, praise God. I got one that that when we were talk I got one when I read Romans over here, man. I've been reading Romans and I'm getting some good things out of Romans. I just got started writing stuff down. &gt;&gt; You ought to try that sometime. &gt;&gt; It will require the ability to hear from God, not from a human man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God, it will require supernatural instruction, not just a student comparing verse with verse. Though that is good. That's good to have a Sunday school teacher. &gt;&gt; It's good to have somebody to come and teach you. But God's going to have to somewhere drive that down into your soul and it stay there &gt;&gt; and it stay there RESIDE INSIDE OF you &gt;&gt; and become you or you become it actually. &gt;&gt; All right. That's the transforming power of the word of God. By the Holy Ghost Lord &gt;&gt; by the Holy Ghost you are transformed. Listen. &gt;&gt; Who had temperance before? &gt;&gt; I knew you was going to do that. Before Boy went before you got born again, &gt;&gt; cameras, nobody raised their hand. &gt;&gt; So what? But when you got born again, that brought the ability for the patience of God to come inside of you, not the patience of man. Because there are some people, we've got a girl that works with us. She's just as patient, just as laidback. I mean, willy-nilly. And that's just having normal patience. But remember, Brother Ram said the first thing you got to do is have patience with God. That when you ask him something, you're not going to be a spoiled brat if he doesn't give it to you. You're not going to get on the floor and start screaming and bound and and pounding the pounding the floor and kicking your feet like you would if you were a child. You're going to sit there and you're going to wait. You're going to do what God said. We're going to get into that a little bit later in the seals. If we will do what God tells us to do, we will have a body change. &gt;&gt; But you can't waver and do something else. You got to do what he's already prescribed &gt;&gt; in this Bible &gt;&gt; and then the advanced version of the 1100 something sermons that we give by a prophet which makes it prophetic insight. &gt;&gt; All right. [clears throat] A mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear. I mean how many of us really even in our born again experience how many have walked for years and did not understand certain things? Well, we all need to raise our hand on that one. Okay. But a mystery requires the teaching of the spirit or it never becomes clear how we need to hear from God and lay ourselves open and become yielded to the spirit to hear and to know. &gt;&gt; To hear and to know what what you're doing here, &gt;&gt; what's your purpose? So, we're prophetic people. People with insight. So, now we go to Revelations 10 11. And he said unto me, thou must prophesy again. And who's he talking to? He's talking to John. All right, John. You eat the book, but you're not going to you're not going to uh go back to the aisle of Patmas and stay there. No. Soon as you get back, you going to start writing. You're going to start teaching. You're going to start preaching. &gt;&gt; God let John lived to be 96 years old and he still had his mind and he was still teaching people. Brother Ramstead, he was the the pastor of the Ephesian church because all the other ones had been killed. Paul, all the different ones, Peter, they're all dead by the time that John gets here on Patmas. All right. He said unto me, thou must prophesy again. So, he has a prophetic message, which is that John types to what? The bride. &gt;&gt; So, the bride has a prophetic message that we're not just going to sit on our hands. We're going to speak or preach before many people, nations, tongues, and kings. All right. So, now as we get into the seals, we've already been through the numbers, and we're working on something that I want to present a little bit later on, maybe the first of the year [clears throat] as far as the numbers that we were talking about, the number one, 2, 3, four, all the way to number seven. All right? So, just hang loose on that. But [snorts] we'll uh [clears throat] we must see this before we get started. Now, [snorts] there's many people in the message that they believe they only take what brother Ram said after the seals opened in 1963 and not the rest. Okay. But now there were things that Brother Ram preached before the seals that was wrong. Don't kick back on me. &gt;&gt; I'll read you where he said it was wrong. He said, "Thank God for a prophet that wasn't so high and mighty that he couldn't tell you what his mistakes were. That he couldn't tell you a story several hundred times how he almost killed himself twice. &gt;&gt; Took his own life. Almost killed the boys. didn't do what God said. So God took his baby away from him &gt;&gt; and wife. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; But you know what? That was for an example to show you that William Maron Brown was human being that made human mistakes, but God protected the gift. Yes. Yes. &gt;&gt; That gift had to come until he was taken away from us there in December of 1965, &gt;&gt; whatever time he had the wreck. &gt;&gt; Okay. Do we believe that? &gt;&gt; All right. So then he came to literally he did come to do two things. &gt;&gt; Now this messenger in Malachi 4, Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things. One, according to Malachi 4, turn the hearts of the children to the fathers. Now what did he do? He's going to tell us in a minute the years of preparation was the years of turning us back to the truth of the Bible. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; All right. Water baptism, no eternal hell, this, that, and the other. All the things that he came in that first part from 47 to 63, he was he was turning us back to the faith of the fathers. Right. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Which was the Bible. &gt;&gt; Okay. Which was the Bible. All right. And in the Bible, it tells, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved." There's a lot that goes in that. [snorts] &gt;&gt; And and Brother Brown told us that we had to get back to there first because God, listen, God cannot work ever work on false doctrine. He can never work on man's ideas. &gt;&gt; That's why when the seals open, Brother Ram said, "I wondered why I hated that thing so bad." Cuz he saw the spirit behind it. And it wasn't a spirit in the drunk house, the drug houses. It was a spirit sitting in the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the second thing according to Revelations 10:7 is to bring the mysteries. Now what's a mystery? something previously hidden that now has been made known. All right. He will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10, which are the revelations contained in the seven seals. And that's what we're going to get into cuz he got into them. So, we're going to get into them. It will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers. Now, that word literally, I am not almost standing up here today. I I'm not standing up here and y'all going wondering where I'm at. Okay. Right. &gt;&gt; I'm literally standing right here &gt;&gt; because I am manifesting myself by me being here. I'm manifesting I am here. &gt;&gt; So, we wonder where God is. Now, I'm not pointing to me. I'm pointing to all of us. God is here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what brother Brown's whole even through the seals was to tell us that God is not up in heaven with his arms crossed. He is inside of a group of people and that group of people is going to defeat the devil standing or sitting in bodies that are corrupt. &gt;&gt; That's his whole that's listen as we said before HIS HIS THANKSGIVING message was the invisible union. &gt;&gt; One of the greatest messages he ever preached. He said, "This is my thanksgiving message to you." He said, "You have united &gt;&gt; with the man himself, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; You are the bride, the virtuous, sinless." How do we get that way? &gt;&gt; He's going to do it. &gt;&gt; YOU AND I ARE NOT GOING TO DO IT. HE'S GOING TO do it. BUT HE'S GOT TO DO IT BY THE WORD OF GOD. AND LET'S DO like Mary say that ain't nothing but the truth. Or say, "Be it unto me according to thy word." &gt;&gt; But now I thought, let me think about this for a minute. No, that's not thinking about it for a minute. &gt;&gt; Stinking thinking. Remember, if you start a conversation with me that says, "I thought or think," I know one thing's for sure. We got a problem. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; But it will literally turn us back. So, it's going to not make us a second person of a trinity. &gt;&gt; It's going to make us an last immorphy of God called a bride. &gt;&gt; [clears throat and cough] &gt;&gt; We will be the bride of Jesus Christ that God wanted in the Garden of Eden. [snorts] &gt;&gt; He wanted a man and a woman in human flesh with eternal life, body, spirit, and soul. That's what he wanted. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. [snorts] [cough] He [clears throat] will have that just for a moment when we get oursel out of the way and get him in the way &gt;&gt; to change our bodies. Because for 30 to 40 days, folks, we're going to have an eternal glorified can't be beat. Can't be leg don't hurt, head don't hurt, feet don't hurt. Hallelujah. Somebody shout amen. &gt;&gt; But we're heading toward that, folks. But it's going to be it ain't going to be it's not g it's going to be like a light switch. I believe [snorts] you know why? Because I don't believe it's going to be well my arm don't hurt but boy my leg sure hurts. No, when you get a body change it's going to be Abraham go to bed. [laughter] Abraham go sleep. Cuz when Sarah at the time of life which is 28 days you sisters know what I'm talking about. He said, "According to the time of life, I'll visit you." Well, what did he visit them with? &gt;&gt; A body change. &gt;&gt; That he went to bed one night. The next morning, he woke up and thought, "Where have I been put &gt;&gt; Sarah?" make you excited. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; But that was in natural type in the spiritual &gt;&gt; because you know what? Abraham finally died. Sarah finally died. They had aches and pains and heartache. She had several, you know, when she had kids, she had she had problems and then their [clears throat] body eventually went back and they died. &gt;&gt; This time it's not going to happen. &gt;&gt; This time when Melzdc visits our tent, Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. When Melzdc visits our tent, &gt;&gt; he come to he come to Abraham's tent &gt;&gt; and said, "I'm going to visit you according to the time of life." Well, he's going to visit us according to the time of life. &gt;&gt; Everybody [clears throat] with me? &gt;&gt; So, what is a mystery? It's a hidden hidden or secret thing. Not obvious. Listen, not obvious to the understanding. Okay? So, revelation revelation to me sometimes is awkward cuz it's not what I previously thought. You think, man, I've been wrong this whole time. Well, brother Brown said the same thing. &gt;&gt; He said, I'd have been I made a horrible mistake. I'm going to read you all these. I read the seventh seal this morning, and he said, all these that has opened has been contrary to anything I thought it was. He thought that fifth seal Jew was us under the altar crying how long. How wrong was that? &gt;&gt; WE DON'T call for somebody to avenge the blood. [snorts] &gt;&gt; No. Right. No. &gt;&gt; And we're not going to a sick seal judgment here on earth. &gt;&gt; We're going through that now inside here. Your nature is being disrupted. You're having earthquakes. You're having tsunamis. You're having all kinds of things in your life and even in your body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God's going to just listen. He disrupted Abraham's nature. That's for sure. &gt;&gt; Him and Sarah both. &gt;&gt; But now remember, he changed Sarah, but he had to what? He had to restore a womb because she couldn't have babies. They didn't have babies for 70 something years. They were together. &gt;&gt; We'll get to that maybe later on. [snorts] So, a hidden purpose or counsel, a secret will, that's what it is. It's a secret will of God. People are going to read this will today, which is the Bible, and they're going to preach a father, son, holy ghost. They're going to preach an eternal hell. They're going to preach it don't matter what you do. &gt;&gt; Same book. &gt;&gt; We ain't got a different one. We got the same one. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But what we do is we see the secret will of God as in the U analogy there with Jesus and Jesus Christ. We know who he is. And I dare &gt;&gt; I dare and you dare either blasphem his name. Listen, you can't do it if you're born again. &gt;&gt; You cannot &gt;&gt; cuz blasphemy is the only thing can get you out of heaven. Right? &gt;&gt; Blaspheming the Holy Ghost, which means you didn't have it and you'll never get it because you blasphemed it away. You you send away your day of grace. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; But if you got the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; you can't do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. There's no way possible God may take you off the scene like he did that preacher that time that started drinking beer and said, "I don't want to preach no more. I don't want to." God said he got an evil spirit on him and God took him home so he wouldn't mar his name. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like brother Brandham. He didn't try to kill himself in his spirit in his soul. &gt;&gt; He was in his spirit realm. His memory, reason, conscious effects, and imagination. That's what bothers us. If we listen, if we don't let that soul inside of us which is born again, if we don't let that soul do the work and do the talking or or raise UP AND WE'LL ALL &gt;&gt; do things wrong. &gt;&gt; We do things wrong anyway, but we'll really do things wrong. That's the reason we couldn't that's the reason we weren't Let me put it this way. That's the reason we weren't held accountable before we were born again. Well, think about it. &gt;&gt; No, y'all say a cuss word before you got born again. That's what I thought. Might have even said the bad word. Several of them. But God didn't count that against you when he saved you and you got born again. &gt;&gt; Tell me what he did with it. HE PUT IT IN THE SEA OF GOD'S FORGETFULNESS, NEVER TO REMEMBER IT AGAIN. PEOPLE, THAT'S GRACE. THAT'S WHY HE'S GOING TO HAVE A VIRTUOUS, SINLESS BRIDE OF JESUS CHRIST WITHOUT SPOT OR WRINKLE. &gt;&gt; THAT OUGHT TO MAKE YOU SOMEBODY OUGHT TO BE EXCITED ABOUT THAT. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY, "WELL, I'M THIS." DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. &gt;&gt; STAY IN THE PROVIDED WAY OF GOD. &gt;&gt; HE'LL WORK YOU THROUGH THAT. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. But you got to make sure you yield yourself to it first [snorts] &gt;&gt; cuz I yielded myself to the devil out there. &gt;&gt; Well, me and brother Donny's only two people. Maybe brother Boyd. He said, "Amen, man." Yeah. So, &gt;&gt; all of us did. &gt;&gt; We yielded our members. Even Paul did. &gt;&gt; Even Paul. PAUL SAID, "THE THINGS I DO NOT, I DO. &gt;&gt; I DON'T WANT TO DO IT, but I do it. I do want to do this and and when I want to do good, evil's present. &gt;&gt; Man, we listen. One [snorts] thing's for sure. Every example that we have in the Bible of people that are our um pillars are flawed &gt;&gt; except one, &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. EVERY ONE OF THEM PETER CURSED &gt;&gt; THREE TIMES. &gt;&gt; Paul persecuted the Christians, &gt;&gt; the very people that he preached to later on. &gt;&gt; Abraham laughed at God. &gt;&gt; Give his wife away twice. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? The hall of faith and the hall of the statues of [snorts] the believers that we are saying that are our foundation all had flaws. &gt;&gt; They all had flaws. But you know what they looked to? They without us. &gt;&gt; They were looking though, brothers and sisters. They didn't know us by name. They didn't know that we'd need a prophet. They didn't know we'd be sitting in Lula, Georgia. We'd be sitting wherever we're sitting. They didn't know you by name. Oh, they will. But they were looking for a group of people by the spirit of God. There was a group of people that they were yearning to see bring this thing &gt;&gt; to a culmination &gt;&gt; because they listen Hebrews 11 is what? That's the chapter of faith. RIGHT? &gt;&gt; READ ALL THEM NAMES and you get down to the very bottom and Paul said they all had a good report. They all loved the Lord. They all did the best they could. &gt;&gt; But they without us &gt;&gt; cannot be made perfect. &gt;&gt; We [clears throat] got to start being in that group. &gt;&gt; You cannot be perfect. You and I both. Either one. But there's a perfect word that we can attach oursel to. [snorts] &gt;&gt; Because remember, I want you to remember right now today, if you're born again today, that perfect one is inside you. &gt;&gt; It's not in heaven. &gt;&gt; It's not over the sea. &gt;&gt; It's neither. It's inside of you. That new birth that you have is a perfect person. &gt;&gt; People say, "You ain't perfect. I ain't perfect." Well, which one of you you talking about? &gt;&gt; Which [snorts and clears throat] one of you you talking about? Because there's one inside of me that is. &gt;&gt; But remember, if he's inside of you, he'll start showing it. &gt;&gt; That says stature of a what? &gt;&gt; What does that say? &gt;&gt; All together of a &gt;&gt; perfect man. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And that's for us to live. &gt;&gt; That's for us to live. Now, Brother [snorts] Brown tells us the mysteries will be revealed in the last day when the seventh [clears throat] angel messenger comes. Not when he starts out doing this, but when he begins to sound his message. Brother knew that his message started when the seals were revealed. That [clears throat] was his main goal. That was his main purpose. That was his message. [snorts] All the others was to bring us to a place. All right. Now, look. says, "Not the years in preparation, but when he begins to sound the message, these mysteries then will be revealed." And here they are not knowing them, and you people are witness of it. They're sitting [clears throat] right there listening to him, watching him. So now, if you have your Bibles, you can turn there, but let's go to Matthew 24. Now, Brother Brown, [snorts] he waits till the sixth seal. Now, listen to me. [snorts] He did not know this in seal number one that the seals had already been preached. God had to wait till he got to the sixth seal. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? To reveal to him that Jesus already preached him in Matthew 24. &gt;&gt; The angel took him back said, "Hey, the Lord's already preached these." But see, now I want you [clears throat] to understand this is in its natural form. When Jesus preaches this, they ask him, "All right, let's start right here. [clears throat] Give me a few minutes." And when Jesus went out and departed from the temple, and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple, and Jesus said unto them, "See ye not all these things? Verily I say unto you, there shall not be left one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down. Now he's talking about a natural building. Everybody with me? All right. Natural temple. They built it in 40some years. And he said it was going to be totally destroyed. Now we know he was telling them that Titus uh the Gentiles were going to come and and obliterate the town. All right. They didn't catch it at first, but I believe they caught it later on. in his sermon. [clears throat] And [snorts] as he sat upon the Mount of Olives, the disciples came unto him privately, saying, Tell us, [clears throat] when is this going to happen? [cough] [snorts] What shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world? Brother Bram [clears throat] said, and I don't know how he knew it, but he must have went back into history or the Lord revealed it to him. If you'll look in the seal book, Brother Rime said they asked him those three questions in the morning and he answered them in the afternoon. So, April the 4th, AD30, he comes down to a day cuz it was right before he was crucified. All right. So, he pre the last come on somebody. The last great message he preached was the seals. &gt;&gt; He died right after this because April the 4th was whatever day that was and if you'll go through Daniel 70 weeks, he died on like the 7th or 8th or somewhere in there. So he was right at leaving the place, leaving the earth. And he sat on the Mount of Olives. The disciples came and said, "When shall these things be? What shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world?" All right. Now, Brother Brown breaks them down, but we're going to we're going to go through them just really slow just for a minute. Is everybody all right? All right. It's a little warm in here, but it's 71, [snorts] so just shake yourself for a minute. Now, [snorts] what was the first seal? It was a white horse rider. Had a bow with no arrows, &gt;&gt; a bluff, and it was the devil. &gt;&gt; All right, we're going to get into it later on, but this is going to help us. If you'll go back and read in the scripture, Jesus preached, now look, Jesus preached six seals. &gt;&gt; All right? He did not preach number seven cuz he was number seven. He was the head of the church. He was the headstone that's got to come back in the end time in a group of people. &gt;&gt; All right. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; All right. So Jesus answered and said unto them, this is verse four, take heed that no man deceive you. What happened in the first horse rider? white righteous church went riding out and it was the devil himself riding on a religious white horse. &gt;&gt; And even brother Brandham was fooled. Come on somebody. &gt;&gt; He preached the mighty conqueror and he re he read that scripture that he was a mighty conqueror and he'll I he read it on the first seal and I'll read it to you later on. So I'm not I'm not saying anything about brother Bradom. is just one thing. God led him through &gt;&gt; to that perfection &gt;&gt; that he was trying to get to from 47 to 63. Is everybody with me? &gt;&gt; He listen, he said if if we don't he said we're just presuming today if this thing don't open. &gt;&gt; Presuming is what? Venturing without authority. Well, I'll promise you when brother Brandham was sitting in that room, come on, somebody. WHEN HE WAS SITTING IN THAT ROOM AND THAT angel came in that room and said, "William Brandom, THAT'S NOT RIGHT." WHAT WOULD YOU DONE? You'd sold up and left church and had your own little place at the house and just you threw and all. What? What do you mean I'm wrong? &gt;&gt; No. You know what brother said? He said he was right and I was wrong. &gt;&gt; But I'll guarantee you he just didn't take it. I'll guarantee you he started going through scriptures and started reading scripture cuz he was a scripture prophet. He was a word prophet. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the angel told him, he said, "Oh, oh no. Oh, wow. This is what I preached before. This was my old notes I was going back to preach on." But contrary, totally. He said, "I see now what that is. That's a w cuz remember, he'll tell you that he preached and and others had preached that the white horse was the Holy Ghost and that he was riding through the church ages shooting his arrows of love into the people. You can't shoot arrows of love if you don't have no arrows. &gt;&gt; That's how that's how deceived we can get. But when he looked down, he said, and I'm sure that angel was I'm sure that angel was standing right there with him. &gt;&gt; Brother Karn, I I believe that &gt;&gt; that angel had been with him the whole time. And I believe he was going read that right there. &gt;&gt; Bow, no arrows. How you gonna shoot with no arrows? &gt;&gt; This guy must be a bluff &gt;&gt; because he's bluffing the people. &gt;&gt; I believe that. That's what I believe cuz it came straight from God. &gt;&gt; It came straight from God. &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered, listen, you see what's been given us in this generation. God came down himself [cough] into [snorts] a prophet &gt;&gt; to tell us the correct interpretation of the whole Bible &gt;&gt; and left us with 1100 sermons of it and kept it where we could read it whenever we wanted to or listen to it. We have no excuse. &gt;&gt; None whatsoever. [snorts] Take heed that no man deceive you. Now this is Jesus telling the disciples the seals in the natural form. All right, is everybody with me? &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered and said unto them, take heed that no man deceive you. For many, not one, not two, not three, TV evangelist, [snorts] &gt;&gt; many shall come in my name, Jesus Christ, saying, I am Christ the anointed one, and shall deceive many. &gt;&gt; Many is going to come in my name and gonna deceive many. All right. So, brother Ry on the sixth seal. Now, watch. This is what he I'll I'll just read his uh commentary on it for the first one. Notice now we're going to read first for the then he answered them. He's going to start answering them. Now, we want to compare it with the seals. Now, watch the first seal. Revelation 6 1-2. Now, we read 6 1-2. And I saw [clears throat] the lamb who had opened one of the seals. And I heard as it was a noise of thunder, one of the four beasts, which was the lion, L I O N, saying, Come and see. And I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow. And a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. Who did we find this fellow was? Antichrist. &gt;&gt; Oh, now what? Jesus told him right here. He told him, "Take heed that no man deceive you." The greatest deceiver in the world is the Antichrist. &gt;&gt; He will deceive 99% of this whole world. &gt;&gt; LISTEN, WHOLE world is deceived at this moment. Right. &gt;&gt; Even though there's a billion Christians in the world, two billion Christians in the world, how many of them really are born again? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, there you can be a Christian and not be born again. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; You can you be foolish virgin or you can be, you know, you can be at a place of justification and and that's all you know. We not putting nobody out. I'd rather just pile them all in, &gt;&gt; but I ain't gonna pile in garbage. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; For many shall come, look in my name, white, white righteous church, white horse, cuz who's the only righteous one? If you go over Revelations 19, who's sitting on a white horse? &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And he has on his thigh the word of God, right? So if if man reads that and goes, "Well, there's Jesus on a white horse. This must be Jesus on a Satan goes, "Huh, John's wrote that. So, I'm gonna take that white horse thing and I'm gonna deceive a bunch of people with it because they going to think I'm him." [snorts] &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; All right. So, you think about these little elementary things as we go through the seals. What was what was sealed up was a mystery of where Satan was and who he was. &gt;&gt; Right? Now remember the seals are the revelation of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; but it exposes the devil. &gt;&gt; Okay? Because remember Satan is not the originator of anything. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. [snorts] &gt;&gt; So you can't be well the seals reveal the antichrist. No, it reveals Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Here stands a lamb with a book in his hand and there goes an impostor. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, it's a revelation of Jesus Christ exposing the Antichrist. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; So, don't think one thing's for sure. You get this great revelation of who Satan was. No, you're going to see. Yeah, you are going to find out who he is, what he's doing, and where he's at. But once but you got to have a re you got to have a revelation of where Jesus is first. Because remember, we're going to read a little bit later on if we can get to it. If we don't, we'll do it next week [clears throat] where he said that many will come in my name. I read that. But remember, you read a little bit later on down through that chapter, he says they'll come and say, uh, Christ is over here. &gt;&gt; Christ is in je Christ is in Lula, [snorts] &gt;&gt; Jeffersonville, &gt;&gt; Ohio. Yes. &gt;&gt; No. If you got him in you, you don't have to go look for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what Jesus was saying. If I be in you, you don't have to go look for it. &gt;&gt; Don't go look for Christ. Christ is here. &gt;&gt; Christ in what? In you, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now watch. He's going to start answering. Now we want to compare. Remember they ask him three questions. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; I watched the first seals, Revelation 6:1. And I saw the lamb when he had opened one of the seals, [cough] excuse me. [clears throat] And I heard as it was the noise of a thunder, and one of the four beasts, saying, "Come and see." I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow, and a crown was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer. Who did we find this fellow was? Because remember, this is in the sixth seal. So, he's already revealed five seals and comes to the sixth seal. All right? &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And Jesus answered, no. Yeah. Matthew 24 now 4:5. And Jesus answered and said unto them, "Take heed that no man deceive you, for many shall come in my name, saying, I am Christ, and shall deceive many." See it, Antichrist. There's your seal. &gt;&gt; Now listen, the seal is not the Antichrist. The seal is the exposing of the Antichrist &gt;&gt; and the revealing of Jesus Christ. Because we're going to see that the first seal shows you one true and living God. Because brother Brown said, he said, "Here stands a lamb and there goes another fella." He said, "Therefore, if you got two, they both can't be God. &gt;&gt; They both could be the devil." But but you know, if he's a lamb standing here and one rides off, brother Dy, who? That's the devil. &gt;&gt; There's only two powers. &gt;&gt; All right. See Antichrist, there's your seal. Now the second one, the red horse. You shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you be not troubled. Now remember, wars are connected to what? There's never been a war that there's not been a death &gt;&gt; or a killing because that's [snorts] what wars do. &gt;&gt; Wars kill. And you shall hear of wars and rumors because remember the red horse is red blood red. All right. See that ye be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. He's saying, "Oh, hang on a minute. You're going to hear many wars, rumors of wars. We hear them right now." Hey, listen. Y'all see yesterday where uh Trump was at the G7 summit. They called him back. He flew back to Washington DC. Did you see what he tweeted this morning? He said, "Theron, you better get your people out of there right now." They kind of figured out that they're still making nuclear bombs. He'll level that place. You wait and see. And then that's going to start. I was telling me, me and somebody was talking in the back, you got to have everything culminating with the Middle East. &gt;&gt; Everything will culminate in the Middle East, right? &gt;&gt; Everything. The Bible tell doesn't tell us that it's going to be over here over here. Battle of Armageddon is going to be in the Valley of Megiddo. Where is that at? &gt;&gt; Middle East. &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So, you got Iran, Iraq, and all these different people that want to kill Israel. [snorts] So, just just watch if he does what he says. Now, that he's a president that'll pretty much do what he say he's going to do. May be right, maybe wrong. But if he told them from the people in Tehran, they need two they got two days, I think, to get out of the city. You know what's coming. Something's going to happen. But when you do that, see, then you got a political you got a political war first, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Jockeying back and forth with words. &gt;&gt; All right. But then there's going to be a natural happening. It's not to scare you, but just be alert. All right? So, [clears throat] red horse and you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. Now, when when Jesus spoke this in the year 8030, there has been tens of thousands of wars since that day he said that. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they'll [clears throat] culminate in one. But he said, "Don't worry. This is not the one, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? This is not the one you got to worry about. There's going to be people fighting all the time, but there's going to be one that you better worry about. There's going to be one way on over here in the sixth seal that you better be not be here, and that's at the tribulation. All right? [clears throat] So, that's the red horse. What is red? Red's killing. Now, the second seal, Matthew 24:6, Revelation 6 3 and 4. Now, watch. Matthew 24:6. Now, let's see what it says. And you shall hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you be not troubled, for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. All right, let's take the second seal. Revelation 6 3:2. Watch what he says now. And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second beast say, "Come and see." And there went forth another horse that was read, and power was given to him that said on there to what? Take peace. &gt;&gt; What is war? War is not peace. &gt;&gt; That's right. to take peace from the earth. So there'll be wars and rumors of wars. Take peace from the earth for the for the second seal. They should kill one another. That's what war. And there was given to him a great sword or a word perfectly. Just exactly. Oh, I like to make the scriptures answer itself. Don't you? The Holy Spirit wrote it all, &gt;&gt; but he's able to reveal it. &gt;&gt; All right. Third seal is what? The black horse. &gt;&gt; [clears throat] &gt;&gt; This is this is continuing to tell us about natural things because nations will rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom, and there shall be famines and pestilence and earthquakes in many places. Now, that's happening right now. All right. All these things are the beginning of sorrows, not the end, the beginning of sorrow. All right. [clears throat] Now, brother Ram said, "Look, and nation shall rise against nation, kingdom against kingdom, famines, pestilence, earthquakes, all these things are the beginning of sorrow. See, you're coming right on up." Revelation 6th chapter. Now, we're going to open the third seal. It's found in Revelation. We just read it. We had opened the third seal. The third beast said, "Come and see." And a black horse went out, and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beast, saying, "A measure of penny, [clears throat] measure of barley for a penny, measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny. See the hurt not the oil and wine." Exact same seal, exact same thing. Now, I want to tell you something. When we get into the seals, [cough and clears throat] there's only one time that that God himself speaks out when the seals break. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; He just did right here. And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, all right, see thou hurt not the oil and wine. Brother R explain it to you. That's God himself saying, do what you need to do, but you be careful and don't hurt the oil and the wine, &gt;&gt; which is a type of stimulation of revelation and the Holy Ghost. So he's telling us, he's saying you're not going to do away with the Holy Ghost. All right? &gt;&gt; But there'll be a famine. Remember the Bible says there'll be a famine for what? Not for not for for food. How many still eating on their Thanksgiving dinner? That's what I thought. So we're we not got that kind of famine. But the Bible says a famine for hearing of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Having all kind of excuses to be here and there and everywhere. I'm going to tell you one more time, just like brother Steven Wilson said, Holy Ghost people go to church. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost fil people go to church. That's just if you don't come all the time, then listen, you can't get the Holy Ghost sometime. &gt;&gt; I just thought of that. You can't You can't just get the Holy Ghost sometime. You can get an anointing. Well, I need to go to church so they'll talk about me. No, you need to go to church so God can talk to you. Forget about me up here, BUT YOU IT'S FOR YOUR SOUL. [applause] &gt;&gt; It's not for your money. It's not for anything. It's for your soul. &gt;&gt; FOR YOUR SOUL TO GET FED, YOU CANNOT SET HOME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Tell me how you can do it. &gt;&gt; Tell me how. &gt;&gt; Somebody tell me how you cannot. Your soul has to be fed by a five-fold ministry. The Bible says for the perfecting of the saints. &gt;&gt; Okay? &gt;&gt; See, if you have a problem with that, you don't have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Cuz the Holy Ghost inside of you wants you to get perfect. &gt;&gt; He's perfect already. Just like I said, but there's [clears throat] imperfection around that, which is called Esther Smallwood. [snorts] I'm using her because if y'all some of y'all the other ones, you get mad. But &gt;&gt; but there's there's there's eternity spinning around. &gt;&gt; Listen, honestly, there's eternity spinning around in your soul if you're born again. &gt;&gt; And it's wanting to catch your spirit &gt;&gt; and show you things by revelation that this is not right or this is right or this. It's trying to catch that. Remember what brother Ram always said? He said, 'I'll bring them up to the platform and he said, 'The reason I talk to them is to what? Catch their spirit. Now also now he will come. Some people walk up. He said, "Oh sister, I see you've got the Holy Ghost." He said, he said, "You have a a warm feeling or you have a kindred feeling between me and you." Right? &gt;&gt; But still, it'd be something wrong with them in the spirit realm. Even could be depression or whatever it is. and he called it out. That's why he said, he said, "If you got something wrong, you better put it under the blood before you get here." &gt;&gt; Cuz if you don't, it's going to be exposed. [snorts] &gt;&gt; There's a lot of spirit realm that we don't that we don't deal with that we should deal with. &gt;&gt; We are spiritual people. &gt;&gt; Remember spiritual. We are spiritual people. Prophetic people. [snorts] Everybody with me? We are spiritual people. &gt;&gt; We are a royal priesthood. &gt;&gt; We are someone that God has wanted to see on this earth since eternity &gt;&gt; before time. &gt;&gt; Us. US. &gt;&gt; NOBODY ELSE. &gt;&gt; US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And every how we take it, [snorts] &gt;&gt; you can let that thing spin around. Your soul won't die, but your spirit will cause. Cuz in your memory, reason, conscious imagination, if you let it run, and like brother Brown said, and I'm glad he said it. He said, you can go crazy and die, commit suicide, or whatever more. And he said, "Still have the Holy Ghost in your soul." Because it is two workings of the of a spirit, two spirits. You have a natural human spirit and then you got the Holy Ghost. But if you don't have the Holy Ghost, that all kind of mashes all together and you don't care. &gt;&gt; When you was out in the world, did you care whether God was in your soul or not? Listen, I'm not even going to say that he it was the last thing on my list. I'm going to say it wasn't even on my list. &gt;&gt; Come on, somebody. He wasn't on my list. &gt;&gt; But one day, God who is rich in mercy, &gt;&gt; he said, "I know when I bring it to them, when it crosses their path, I know they'll accept it because I saw it before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; I saw them accept it." And you know what I did? &gt;&gt; I brought the mom and daddy together. Sometime under circumstances that you'd go, How'd that happen? It was a God thing. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I love what he said. He said, "I don't care if your parents are drunks and prostitutes." &gt;&gt; He said, "You have a chance. God brought you here for a purpose." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; God got you here so you can make a choice. &gt;&gt; And he knew what choice we would make. We're not going to get anywhere. So, we'll just stop right there. We'll be on the fourth seal. Um, don't want to wear you out. But first three seals, Jesus was preaching them. Now watch because what's going to happen is and we'll read it later on. Jesus stops just like brother Ram stopped and had questions and answers. Brother Jesus, I keep want to say brother Jesus stopped right here and he started talking to current Israel right in the middle of all this because this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come when you therefore see the abomination of desolation which was a mosque of Omar they built in over in Israel sitting right on the place where Abraham sacrificed Isaac &gt;&gt; or or you know was going to spoken of Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place. Whosoever readeth, let him understand. Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains. He's telling the people Titus is coming. In AD70, Titus surrounded the city. But the history and brother Ram tells you both there was no believer left inside the city. They listened to what Jesus said. After they got the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost brought back to their remembrance what the Lord told them. &gt;&gt; Then let them which be in Judea flee into the mountains. Let them which be on the housetop not come down and take anything but get out of there. &gt;&gt; NEITHER LET THEM FE DON'T RETURN BACK TO TAKE YOUR COAST. GET OUT OF THERE. &gt;&gt; And all the believers did because remember woe unto them that are with child and them give s. Do you know that they actually eat the bark off the tree? They actually killed their own babies and ate them. &gt;&gt; That's how desperate they got when they turned God down. They thought God was in that temple. God wasn't in that temple. God visited them in a temple of flesh and they turned him down. &gt;&gt; Has God visited you in a temple of flesh and you turned him down? Let's stand to our feet. [applause] &gt;&gt; Cuz see, then shall be great tribulation such as not since the beginning of the world. Listen, this is all temporary stuff. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But God has got to allow us to get out of here &gt;&gt; to go to the Jews. &gt;&gt; That will completely fulfill his plan. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; Cuz it won't be the great tribulation will be after we're gone and after the 144,000 are gone. All right. I hope that helped you some because we'll go back and read continue to read Matthew 24. Just read it all the way through because you're going to see all the seals open up and then you're going to see the very last thing. The very last thing he says, the very last thing. Now learn a parable of the fig tree. That concluded his sermon. When his branch is yet tender and put forth leaves, you know that summer is nigh. Who is the fig tree? Israel. We get out of here. He goes straight to Israel. And then the seals all happen in a natural form. They take place. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. We see it in the spiritual right now. &gt;&gt; We see the wild horse rider. &gt;&gt; Hello. &gt;&gt; We see the pale horse rider. But we see him working in a spiritual form, but he's going to start in a natural form. And we're not going to be here. The bride will not be here to see that. Let's sing a song. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Keep falling [singing] in love with him over and over and over and over again. &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; This was the love letter that God wrote to you today if you'll listen &gt;&gt; over and over and over and over again. [music] He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by. Oh, what a love &gt;&gt; between my Lord. Oh my. And I just keep &gt;&gt; God himself speaking to you over [music] and [singing] over and over and over again. Oh, when I first fell in love with Jesus, what'd you do? I gave him all of my heart and I thought I couldn't love him more &gt;&gt; than I did at the start. &gt;&gt; I did right. &gt;&gt; But now look, but now I look back over all the mountains and valleys &gt;&gt; that we've been through. &gt;&gt; And it makes me know I love him so much more. It makes me know &gt;&gt; than I did then. &gt;&gt; I love him. &gt;&gt; So what are we doing? &gt;&gt; Over and over again. I keep falling in love with him over and over and over [singing] and over again. I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by. Oh, what a love between my Lord and I. [music] &gt;&gt; It's a love affair. &gt;&gt; And it started with you saying yes, &gt;&gt; to the great shepherd, &gt;&gt; the great lamb on each valley and trial. There's a shoulder that I lean upon as I face another mind. There's a love what that I can depend on. It's fresh and new. He say [music and singing] with love in my heart is overflowing. And this is what we're going to say. Sing it to him one more time. Oh, I keep Let's thank him for what he's g us. It's Thanksgiving week. Thanksgiving one day. No, thanksgiving every day. Thank him for everything. Falling in love with him over and over and over [singing] and over again. He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by. Oh, what a love between my Lord [singing] and I. Just keep falling in love with him over and over. Let's sing that one more time. Sing over again. &gt;&gt; Oh, I keep falling in love with him over [singing] and over and over and over again. I keep falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. [music] get sweeter and sweeter as the days go by. Oh, what a love between my Lord and I. [music] Falling in love with him over and over and over and over again. &gt;&gt; Listen, if you honestly don't love your spouse more than you loved him when you first started, you got a problem. So, what about the perfect [music] one that we look to that we know? See, I'll make a mistake. Me and June will get in an argument, but don't get in an argument with Jesus cuz he's right and we're wrong. Whatever he says, that's what we Yeah, you going to lose. Well, you going to lose with him. &gt;&gt; You might you might lose with Janet, too. But you might you going to lose because she's because he's right all the time. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; Not you. Good to have brother Boyd back up here. [music] But ain't that true? Look at Look at um Jeffrey and Amy. I remember when they were first kids and Oh, they were kids. Yeah. And Sterling, too. And all the ones that that that we saw come from children. And now you Amy's over there holding on to Jeffrey like he's going to fall out the window. And uh they got two kids and uh they're getting older. But if a human love can mean that much, [music] what about a love that'll never end? What about a love that'll never end? And listen, with Jesus, there's no there's no we have ups and downs and ins and out. I'm sure that um Amy wins 90% of the argument anyway. So, [music] and Jeffrey just lets her. So, but with but with God like like brother voice, he's right all the time. But do we listen to him? We must listen because listen, being prophetic people, we listen to a prophetic or a spiritual message. Doesn't have to be. Come on, people. It doesn't have to be written in the Bible verbatim, but it's to you. Brother Brown said, "What?" He said, "It's not the line." He said it's what's written between the line is the what? Love letter. He said it's got to compare with the top and the bottom. But he said in between the line is the love letter. And only you and your spouse know what that love letter is all about. Amen. And that's the same way with God. We But listen, we know who our mate is. We're Mrs. Jesus Christ. This is the prescription that he gave us. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Right. And he gave us ordinances to do the communion, the foot washing, water baptism, different things. But the most important thing is is know who you're talking to &gt;&gt; and know who's talking to you because you know what I'm like, brother Dale. Brother Dale said one time, he said, "I don't know if it's the devil talking to me or God." He said, "Sometimes you think, you know, the the God would be just really sweet and nice." And he said, "No." He said, "Most time that was the devil talking to me." He said, "But that one that said, "Hey buddy, get in line." That was God. Cuz I'll promise you one thing, Satan will never point you to the true word of God. Never will he do it. He can't do it. He hates this word. He hates this like a hot poker. He don't even want to touch it. But you know what? You and I are that hot poker. We're not just heated by it. We are it. And God heats us up by the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. We're going to um bow our heads just for a moment, then we'll sing sing one more song as we get ready to go and then we'll be dismissed. Remember, Brother Luis will be speaking for us Wednesday night and then next Sunday, uh we'll have our Christmas dinner. Everybody's invited. Everybody, please come because we're going to have a [clears throat] catered meal and um then we'll have um um our little get together down there at the at the uh at the venue, which is a big place, huge place, so we won't have to leave there for several hours. So, we'll go down there and enjoy ourselves. So, let's bow our heads. Dear heavenly father, thank you for this day. Thank you for the word, Lord, that you've given us. Father, I pray that you'd be with Brother Luis and Brother Aaron, all the different ones, Brother Richard, as they all come back. Lord, give brother Luis, Lord, the words of eternal life to speak to us this coming Wednesday, Lord. Lord, just be with us as we come through this Thanksgiving season. And now, here we are, Lord, a few days past it. But let let it not be that it dwindles, Lord. May we be a a a thanksgiving people that absolutely thanks you every day for the things that you give us, Lord, and the things that are coming. I pray that you'd be with each one that's sick, Lord, that's had to stay home. That you'd touch them, Lord. We've seen you, Lord. Send the word and heal them, Lord, and deliver them from the things that they have, Lord, even sitting in their home, Father. And I pray that you'd be with each one now. [music] May this word not return void, but let it accomplish everything that it's supposed to accomplish. Lord, we ask these things in Jesus name. Amen. Let's sing a song before we go. Sing it. Go ahead. My heart floods of joy or my soul [singing] when the sea builders roast Jesus [singing] came into my heart. Since Jesus came into my heart. [singing] Oh, since Jesus [music] came into my heart. What a joy that's possible [music] wrong since Jesus came into my heart.
