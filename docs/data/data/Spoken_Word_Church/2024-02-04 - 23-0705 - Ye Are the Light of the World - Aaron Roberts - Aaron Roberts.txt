places of scripture we're going to look John chapter 8 and then we're going to go to Matthew Chapter 5 very familiar scriptures this evening and uh I want to take little thought ye are the light of the world that's right and uh kind of what I was going I was looking at U for Sunday school and I just uh was going to say well I'm do my son kind of my Sunday school lesson this this evening but uh U won't try to keep you along tonight but uh just let the Lord speak to us tonight amen so let's just all bow our heads and we'll speak to the author before we read the scripture Heavenly Father we thank you this evening Lord Lord to come in your house God what a wonderful thing it is Lord that that we have a hunger and a desire Lord to be here yeah Lord we get tired in the in the body and mind Lord but Lord there's something on the inside that wants us to be here amen and Lord we just pray that you said that they that hunger and thirst Lord they're blessed and they shall be filled so Lord that's what we look forward to tonight Lord just help us get ourselves out of the way Lord minister to each one father the ones that are listening in the ones that will be listening in later Lord we just pray that you be with them touch them wherever they are and Lord we just commit all things to you Lord you know each need each desire each request Lord father you know what everyone has need of Lord there's so many that I think about that uh Lord that that need a touch from you but Lord we've seen you come on the scene and do do miracles do the Lord what seemingly was impossible Lord but that's what you specialize in as the song says and Lord we just commit all things to you lord lord just have your way with us in Jesus name amen amen uh John chapter 8 verse2 and it says uh I don't therey look there they got it uh it says I appreciate uh us running a skeleton crew in the back Richard and Levi and all of them that filling in usually you got more hands makes lighter work then when you got a few they all having to try to do a whole lot real quick so uh John chapter8 here says then spake Jesus again unto them saying I am the light of the world he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life amen and then going to Matthew 5 Jesus verse 14 Jesus says ye are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven amen God bless you this evening you can have your seats and I want to this is a quote from uh there's a man here that can turn on the light that's right and brother B was talking about Jesus speaking he says he says look at look at him when he stood there said if I do not the works of my father then condemn me see but if you can't believe me believe the works that I do they testify of who I am he says you see that blind darkened hour that they live in they could couldn't see it they just couldn't understand and it's about how could he be the Son of God when he was born right down here in Bethlehem if they only know the word said that he would come that way why his father Joseph is a carpenter his mother why it's actually believed amongst the Brethren that she was that he was born illegitimately see but yet the word said that he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are the very ones that testify who I am they are the ones that testify of me this holy scriptures then what was he God's light no wonder he said I am the light of the world not only did he say I'm the light of the world but he said ye are the light if his word is in you bearing record of itself then you are the light of the world noce we find out light of each age made manifest just the sameen so not only did he say I'm the light of the world but as he said search the scriptures because they identify who I am that I am the light of the world then the scriptures also identify who we are that we are the light of the world Amen we are God's light we are the manifestation of Jesus Christ in our day amen and and I just want to look at a few things tonight um I was uh had the opportunity to talk to a young sister uh pretty recently and and we were we were uh she was discussing some things and you know when you young people and when you when you see people and even even olders older ones we have they have the this same kind of issue this problem that they deal with him and it's you know it's like ye are the light of the world and you know she's like well you know you don't seem like you're reaching out you know I do these certain things I love to sing I sing I I you know I can play instruments and I can you know I I love to cook and I do all these things and she's like I'm not it don't seem like I'm ever reaching anybody you know it's like you know I get ridiculed at school I get ridiculed at work and all these type things and all these different things and I told her I said listen I said if you do one thing for God and you bless five people right that's five people that God called you to bless abolutely it's not the number of people and and you know it's not we're not keeping score no right amen God never called us to be uh great uh singers evangelists all these type things he called us to be faithful to what he called us to do that's the main thing he said you know my good and faithful servant is is the standard that God has for us are we faithful to what he called us to and he says you know ye are the light of the world well you know you are the light to the part of the world that you live in that's it you're that light you don't have you're not to try to as really appreciated what brother tic had to say you know talking about you know because people want to hop on a plane and travel on the other side of the world and and they what they call what they call missions he said really it's not missions they're not really doing a whole lot you know but if you can be the light that the world can see where you are amen you do what God called you to do and I said you know because it's not you know it's not like you know we're here and you know I don't know how many people will listen to this sermon and so you know I'm not I'm not one trying to you know and I don't know anybody else would be but you know every now and then you can go on YouTube and find out how many people listen to your sermon but you know I'm not I'm I'm not calculating how many times people listen to brother Wade's sermon and how many people listen to brother Bob's sermon and you know that I feel bad because uh I don't get the same number you know or or whatever you know it's not I'm not looking at that because you know what if I have one person if I had one person tell me tonight when when I get done if one person tells me they got something out of the sermon if one person's blessed then you know what it counts for all if one person is blessed if one person is edified in the body of Christ then you know what I feel like I've done my job because I I can I can just yield myself and I can do what I can do but I can't try to to do too you know whatever I just got to Guild myself to the Lord and let the Lord Lord work and however he decides to work then praise God I'm not trying to build myself up because the problem is is you know you you get out of the will of God when you try to make something of yourself you know there's a story years ago and uh I was thinking about there was years ago there was these young men that uh they had went through uh OCS or whatever and they got their they got their uh they got their gold bars you know the L Lieutenant bars you know second Lieutenant they get that little gold bar they got them on their on their shoulders and you know what they got so excited because they had them gold bars wherever they was enlisted people they would SK their schedule and they would run out there so when the enlisted people come by they could get people to slot them because they were so excited why because they wanted know wanted everybody to know hey I am a lieutenant I've reached something and you've got to salute me well you know people got really tired of them for their arrogancy and you know there was a an older officer come and he told he took he took one of the officers and he took them to a to a bar and there was a bunch of soldiers in there and and different people in there and he told him he said listen he said those are your people he said you are to lead them right but he said don't ever get to the point where you don't realize that you're going to learn from them just because you got your commission doesn't mean that you're at the Apex there was a lot of soldiers that went to Vietnam and you know they had uh they got their what they call their Buttercup bar they got their Lieutenant bar and you know what they had you know what they got to go with them they wouldn't even let them lead even though they were commissioned to lead you know they would not let them lead people in battle you know what they done they got some old hard rough Gruff sergeant and you know what he had to follow that Sergeant around and that Sergeant was like I'm going to show you the ropes I'm going to teach you what you've got to do if you're going to be a good leader you need to learn these things because you're not going to learn it just out of a book right it took experience and you know when you get to the point where you ever think that you know if we ever get to the point where we're arrogant or we don't think that God can do you know we're not reaching some point we just got to realize God's in control and just yeld our and let God have have his way with us right I you know because we can't think higher or lower than of ourselves than what God has already thought of us and so it's just for us to be faithful to what God is has called us to don't I'm not I'm not trying to to be something greater but I don't but I don't want to be slacking in what God has called me to do that's right amen so brother brand was speaking here and this is from sir we would see Jesus and he's talking about the life and he was talking about Paul and Moses and and he says he said how many knows that the angel that led Moses through the Wilderness was Christ the angel of the Covenant sure it was Jesus said I come from God I go to God that's why he said before Abraham was I am that was God speaking out and when Paul was on the road to Damascus that was what what it was that that struck him what was it that struck him a like put his put his eyes out I come from God I go to God that same that life in the church brings forth the same light that was there same Works same signs same wonders same Miracles same thing Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he said God be blessed forever more so it's the same life that Jesus done the works that I do shall you do also it's the same life the same miracles in John in John chapter 1 it says verse four says in him was life and the life was the light of men amen and the light shineth in darkness and the Darkness comprehended at night that's right and it says that was the True Light which lith every man that cometh into the world so it takes God to bring the light but it also takes God for us to recognize that light and for and he shown the light but they didn't recognize it but he was the light that was promised to come into the world and he come in the world and and brought forth the light for people to see but but to those who were predestined to see the light they saw that light you know and many times people that see in the scripture you know many times the the word the word comes which is the the light it comes and it makes itself known and you know all the way through the scripture we find many people that the light came to and God made himself known you know God came to Cain and told and gave Cain the perfect understanding you know even if he didn't fully understand God told him what to do he didn't have a revelation but God told him he said if you'll do as your brother you'll be accepted you know there's many of them through the scripture that they knew what the truth was and God pointed it out and led them but you know they were the ones that had to make that choice whether they would accept it or not and and here you know the different ones brother random was speaking in the message painted face Jezebel and and brother bram's praying here and he said he said send some more Tish bites Elijah along that's really that'll really stand regardless granted father and preach that they can see the light speaking because it takes it takes a fivefold Ministry for the people to see the light it takes the word has to be brought through somebody the the seed has to come through the body and so the he's speaking here see it h that they can see the light it takes why because Elijah came to make he was the prophet of the day and he brought the light for the people to see and then brother oh yes Jezebel had the light plenty of it she had Mount Carmel like to see that God answered prayer and performed Miracles so here is seeing that what was taking place and we know what took place on in it with Jezebel and on Mount Carell she knew it but she wasn't willing to sacrifice and to walk in the light and so we know that you know different ones as there you know when Elijah came and began to speak to them and tell them what was take place when Ahab and and you know the prophets of of baale you know when when they had the word and he come and made himself known and told and what was going to take place but you know they had gotten away from because they were so influenced by that day by the people and the and the false doctrines that had it permeated their their lives every single day that they had gotten away from what was truth and they began to walk in the things of the people that was around them and we know that when Ahab married Jezebel and she brought in all of her false Doctrine religions and her false gods and all these things in and it corrupted all of Israel and and you know when he come but you know he raised up Elijah to go down there and tell them that this is wrong and you've gotten away from what God has told you what God has brought you to and you know but he began to tell them but you know what she did not believe that because she wanted to hold on to her own things but you know when you know she could not she when all of those prophets were down there and they were on Mount Carmel and they had that Showdown and God killed all of them and accepted Elijah's sacrifice and burned it all up and except you know uh took all the water and everything that was bured up you know there was no way that she couldn't deny that the supernatural took place because it had happened and for and so you know he was saying see that's exactly but she failed to walk in in the light but you know it wasn't that she was uh not without excuse because she had seen the supernatural take place right and there's many people in the same way today you know God has done so much and spoke to people and told them absolutely amen and it's it's amazing how people have come and you know they you've heard people talk and stand there and and absolutely read from the scripture and I mean they can take they can take the the word and lay it out just so perfect and I mean you can't I mean exactly what the scripture says and lay it out perfectly to a te and then turn around and say that's wrong yeah right how in the world can you stand up and believe that God sent a prophet and know the scriptures and I perfectly identify the scriptures the day and the hour in which we live and know that this is the truth and know what what he said even about water baptism of one God whatever and then turn around and say that's nothing but come straight out of the pits of hell that's totally false yeah well how how can you how can you have an excuse how can how can you stand in the day of judgment and not be fully condemned by that when you stand up and you can identify well you know there's there is no uh there's no wiggle room there's no there's absolutely nothing because either you either you walk in it or you don't walk in it because either you've seen the light and even if you don't walk in it you can't deny that you've seen the light and so many people they theyve walked in and when God has spoke to them and told them these things what was truth and they had to see the light whether you walk in it or not you know what you're still responsible for that amen and it's a terrible day that we live in but it's a great day that we live in am yes it is because you know what because you see people and you see people that all of the hardships and all the struggles and everything that people have been through and you know they've been knocked down and they get right back up and they keep going and they get knocked down and they get right back up and they keep going and people say well I don't know how you make it well you know what it's not me that's doing it but it's the one that's inside of me that's doing it but he's the one that's leading me he's the one that's giving me the grace to do that he's the one that's giving me the strength to give to do this he's the one that's given me the desire to do this I couldn't do it in in my own right but you know what then but you know what if we just trust God then he's the one because through him we're Overcomers we're not Overcomers in ourselves but we overcome through him he's the he's the one that's overcome so when when we look at the when we look at our sacrifice it's not it's not whether whether we are accepted it's whether our sacrifice is accepted so we have to look to see what God has done and if we can just see what God's done for us now when when God called the the children of Israel and he began to lead them and you know when he prophesied that he would bring them out as brother tic was talking about you know coming out of Egypt and here they come out of the out of the God made the promise and here they're come God's going to call them out and bring them into the place that God called them to you know God made the promise and he's bringing that he was going to fulfill his word amen you know and and in the process of time and he comes you know he wanted to bring the people into a place where he could fellowship with them and he wanted to reveal himself to them and you know not just not just in the um not just in the prophet and and the and the word but you know he had the Tabernacle set up and you know and each one of those each one of those items each particular thing in the in the making of the Tabernacle each part of it speaks of Christ and each part of it speaks of the Journey of the believer and and the God's fellowship with them and you know as as they came and he began to tell Moses and he took Moses into the mountain and he began to speak to him and he got to see these things and he came down and he began to lay out every aspect of the Tabernacle for them to have fellowship with God because God was to fellowship with them and he began to see them in this in this building of this of this Tabernacle each piece each color everything has has a has a ordinance and everything has a specific uh condition and and all that may has a reason for all that to be there and you know when he when he went through all of that you know it was him making himself known to them now sometimes they were just like well we don't understand why that was a certain color was made a certain way or a certain cubic but you know all those things Express Christ and you know when he when he went through all of that and he raised up and they began to make this Tabernacle and each piece had to be made a certain way and you know as they worked in in in Exodus chter 40 I want to read this and here they go and they're building the Tabernacle and laying it all out and in verse 33 of of chapter 40 of Exodus the scripture says and when he reared up the court round about the Tabernacle and the altar he set up the hanging of the Court gate so Moses finished the work so here's the prophet laying out what had to be done and he finished putting out all the things in place because he was the one that had had the people doing the work and when he finished what God had called him to do he finished the work so everything was set in place it says then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle amen he said and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation because the cloud Abode thereon and the glory of the Lord filled the Tabernacle and when the cloud was taken up from the Tabernacle the children of Israel went onward in their in all their Journeys and then you know in Isaiah here in Isaiah 60 verse 1-3 and it says arise Shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee for behold the the darkness shall cover the Earth and gross Darkness the people but the glory shall but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee and the Gentiles shall come to thy light and Kings to the brightness of thy Rising now what I want to look at tonight is when when you see that here's here's Moses laying the Tabernacle out and when when he was finished with it so when the man had finished their part of it then God come to indwell the the Tabernacle because God come to when God saw that they had done what they were supposed to do then God was uh pleased with what had taken place and then the cloud came down and you know one of the things that when you start to study what was interesting about this is many times you know we think about uh you know we we think of of Cloudy being this gloom and doom and and dark and all this kind of thing but you don't realize but when you actually study this when the glory of the Lord came down into the cloud came down there was actually light there there was actually a light that filled that Tabernacle that's right and it because of the light and because of the glory of the Lord that filled that Tabernacle that God has was pleased with what they had done because that was where he wanted to meet them when all of that took place then the glory of the Lord came down and they were not able to enter in even when when Solomon built the temp built the temple and he set everything in order and and had done all the work that he was supposed to do and everything was said just exactly correct then when exactly the same thing happened with the glory of the Lord the cloud came down and filled that shakina of Glory filled the tabern the Tabernacle the temple and it was so much that the priest could not Minister there because it had done but you know it was God showing that he was pleased with what they had done right and here they are in this Tabernacle they had come down and done exactly what God had wanted them to do and he was filled the the whole Tabernacle and they had this Supernatural happening there and now he filled the whole place and he was there showing that he was before them and that was their place to have fellowship with him and here he is he's filled this this uh Tabernacle and then when the T when the uh anointing went up when the cloud went up and he said then they were able to Journey from there wherever the cloud went and you know and it says here in Isaiah it says you know arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee and so it's showing that this Cloud this Glory that had come down was like to these people am and you know many times people see these great things you know and you see so many people they talk about what happened many years ago and these these great happenings that has taken place and they oh if we can just go back to the great days of of yester year what's taking place or what happened five years ago or what happened here or there and not realizing that God has continued to move on because when he came down in in the in the Tabernacle there and he showed his glory to the people but when he went up that wasn't the only thing that he had for them because when he went beyond that and he went up and the cloud was there to guide them when he went forward they weren't supposed to still stand there and hold their hands up and say well praise God look what God done it was time for them to move on and so many times people are still stuck in the same spot looking back and not realizing that it's time to move on God is calling us to higher places to Heavenly places in Christ Jesus to move on from where you come from because God is moving and he's wanting you to see that when when the glory of the Lord has come down to you now it's time for it's to catch your vision for you to move on there's greater things for you to see because you know what it wasn't just that the Shak kind of Glory came down into the temple but it was for them to come in and go there for that high priest to go Beyond the Veil to come into the place because brother bam said when he went beyond there he said that Shak of Glory was always in there he said he might have been it might have been dark in the outer Court it might have been dark in the inner court but when he went into the holy of holies there was no Darkness why because he stepped into the Shina of glory and when he went stepped in then you know what there was all the brightness why because Christ or God stayed behind there all the time and it's the same way with you and I we can continue on but you know is get behind the holy of holies to get in there where Christ is all the time where we can have fellowship with him all the time see from this is from the hidden life and he says but look he talking about the outside and how dark it was he said but look on the inside he said old brother the man that was in there what did he come in there see every Earthly light every artificial light was shut off from him and the only light that he had under the wings of the cherubims was the shika light a real soft Holy Light that never went out he said I don't care what the sun did what the lamps did what anything else he that lived in that presence walks in the light day and night that's he said that's where we need to be no matter what your experience is he said if it's heartaches if it's troubles if it's upsets if it's this that or the other you're still walking in the light of God you're living in the shik glory living there where Jesus is in his presence that all things work together for good to them that love God and you'll you'll love him and you're walking in that mellow soft sweet humble Christian Life wouldn't you like to walk like that there's not a person here but wants to live in there and friends that's where you should live if you want to know what know the secret of this life if you want to know why the these things is One Day by the grace of God he took me in there that's right that's what does it it's nothing in yourself you don't live for yourself no more you live for others so when you come in there and see that light when it brings it down then it brings you to a place where you see that it's him and you together he brings you into a place that nobody else knows about it's a personal experience amen and see if you come to that place and you know what it's not we don't have to worry about all the heartaches and the troubles and all things we're looking at being in in that shikina Glory see when the when the high priest when he went in behind the veil and he had the blood and he sprinkled The Mercy Seat you know he didn't worry about what was going on in his family he didn't worry about what was going on outside he didn't worry about why because he had stepped into an eternal presence of God he had stepped before the before the Altar and when he was stood there then it was just him and God and what what he was to do was to offer God the the offering for him to for and and it's the same way it's not you know because so many times we get so sidetracked with so many things of the world and what was going all the way around us but you know what it is is when you get behind the veil you know we keep our eyes on him right not to be worried about the things of the world because you know what all things work together for the good whatever God has we praise God we can thank God for it amen and it the same way when when Solomon when he dedicated the temple the glory you know it was so great that he went in there but you know was to come to a place to have fellowship and to see see God right let's have have fellowship with God now I was looking up some things about you know about light in the in the scripture and and and so there's a couple of things that I was looking at one of them was uh the the light there in the in the Tabernacle and the the temple and you know when you look at what light means in the scripture you know light it symbolizes or means you know it refers to God's presence goodness truth Holiness salvation it means hope and provision Salvation And it it's an answer in the darkest times whatever whatever happens you know God is God's light will always bring an answer am even in the dark when it doesn't look like there's a way out God makes a way out he said light is the first thing that God created and it's the source of all life see light serves as a symbol of Life have happiness prosperity and he says even in a wider sense a perfect being yeah and that's what caught my attention when I was reading that it was like it it serves as as a lie and immortality all those things when you look at light in the scripture that's what it's talking about all these different things and what struck me when he was talking about a perfect being and you know brother brand said in the in the message having conferences he says I tell you the truth I lie not there's no no man can take the doctrine that I preach and disprove it amen he said there's no one can do it I have never seen anyone could do it it's the gospel truth the discernments of the spirit is perfect no man can ever say that it's ever not been perfect and I'll tell you now there is a perfect place a perfect heaven a perfect God a perfect savior a perfect blood a perfect atonement a perfect being for you and that's what it struck me when I was looking at that when it said a perfect being because you know what brother R said there's a perfect being for you yes amen and you know many times people what is that you know what does that mean we know people think well you know he's just talking about Jesus Christ no he's not talking about just Jesus Christ but he's talking about you right yeah see when you when you begin to look at it because when you when you begin to study this when you look at this perfect being what is the perfect being it's the statue of a perfect man it's the it's the because what is it it's the light of the God's word is bringing you to that place it takes the light of the word that's going to bring you up the stature of a perfect man why because it's bringing out out of you from you out of the old out of the darkness into the light and it's bringing you up y right and so all the all of the the uh virtues you know coming into Faith that's a light there's a light of the word that brings you to that place there is a light of the word that brings you to Virtue that light because it takes the light of the word to shine that on you but it's not just the light shining on the word but it's the light coming inside of you and indwelling you and and making the life that word live the make and then the light is on the inside of you and it comes dwelling from the inside out because if you're the light then the word is growing and then there's a growing Light Within what is it you're coming up the stature of a perfect man because then as you come from knowledge Temperance patience all of these things are being made known because it's the light of the word being made manifest in you and we can see how that comes from the dark place why because if you have any of the old man there and you know even when you come in to be born again you come into the into the kingdom of God you know what you're still fighting this old man you're still fighting the darkness of this world you're still tied to this earth you're still fighting that but it takes the word it takes the light of the word to bring you to the place that you overcome that so that's what it is it's the light that comes and he's bringing us into that so the world can see us see it's not just as brother said it's not just living for ourselves but we're living for others we're to we're to make him known amen that we can the world can see yes see the see the light that God has given us let your light so shine before men amen that they can see you know we wonder why certain things happen in our lives and you know uh talking talking to brother Richie and you know uh one of the things I was I was thinking about was you know many people just we we kind of get in a in a situation sometimes where we just everything comes get uh normal or just common or whatever and you know one of the things I was thinking about that I had in my notes I was going to mention Sunday was that you know here we are and you know we come and you know how many wants to see a miracle well let me tell you we saw two Miracles here Sunday and the both of them preached when you when you see the things that brother Richie's been through and you know his mom when he was telling us giving us this testimony you know when he had ankle bone yeah and there was no way for him to walk right and you know his and yet his mom carried him through prayer line after prayer line after prayer line and had people everywhere praying for her because you know what she got to the place where you know what there was nothing the doctors were going to do right they didn't know what to do right maybe amputate his foot but you know what God had other ideas and some little tiny woman Sister Christine had Faith to believe and she carried that little boy everywhere and she didn't take no for an answer until one day God honored that lady's Faith amen and put an ankle bone in there where he could walk and you know so many times if if you know we used to go and and see her and she she lived in a little trailer and you know she's never had a whole lot in her life but blessed heart she she had Faith to believe and you know she she seen some and you know she she just got faith like you wouldn't believe but you know she had she had a little little single wide trailer and she had some um little little cabinet and you know different little collectible things you know in there well she found certain things that she wanted and she went out and she took pictures of them she had them in a book and she'd carry them things around and she'd thank the Lord and the car that she had somebody give it to her cuz you know what she needed a car and she believed it and she wanted a blue car and the lord gave her a blue car but she had but she had a picture and she was showing me we was in her house one time she had that little photo album and she was like well I was looking for these these pillows and they're there and and I got I was looking for these pictures and they're over there and I was I was looking for these little collectible not wait knickknack whatever things you know little ceramic looking things and she's oh I love them they're so pretty and she said they're over there see that I had why because she had Faith to believe and so you know like brother B said you know we we're we're sometimes we don't take God at his word you know we don't we don't ask God for big things or you know we think well God's not interested in that you know what if it brings you Joy then God's you know God is interested in your life and what's so amazing was you know she didn't have a lot of the world's wealth but you know what she wanted a little few things here in her house and you know what the lord gave them to her amen you know she went she went in some thrift store one time and found stuff that she was looking for she had people bring stuff to her but you know what she had Faith to believe why because every day she got up and went somewhere she was walking in faith amen and you know it's so amazing when you've seen God work and God do the things that he's done then how can you not get up every day and thank God you know this is a this is an overcoming day this is a glorious day because look what God's done for me amen and you know then I I was thinking about brother tic being here you know you know months ago if you know it didn't look good for him you know and you know as he was speaking of you know going through a heart attack going through a wreck and everything but he was still here and able to preach and say you know we say well you know I wish I I could see a miracle you know and not realizing Miracles walk right past you amen what you're walking in the Mir in the presence of a miracle and not realizing it amen true brother amen and uh I I wanted to share with you also that um I I didn't get to share it Sunday but I I going to share it tonight my buddy Jack the brother Jack uh brother Ryan had mentioned uh about the one that had cancer and you know had went through and had his esophagus removed and everything like that well he showed me the other day he had his latest test scores and so it was like 15 he's down to 3.4 come all the way down from 668 down to 3.4 so just want to thank the Lord for that and you know he's because he said well I'm still waiting on my zero I'm still waiting on my zero like well you know what you know you you got all the way from 668 down to 3.4 you know what then uh zero is just right around the corner you got that far you know because the is the god that brought you this far is the one that'll bring you all the way and I was like you know what the devil tries but you know the devil lost the first time and he's losing the second time we just don't we just don't quit because God is the one that's the Healer and he's already paid for it and it's a finished work of Calvary and you couldn't you couldn't if he was here tonight his brother R said if he was here tonight he couldn't do more for you than what he's already done if you can just believe that's right just take him as a as childlike Faith am see just the childlike Faith you know many times in our lives and we all these different things that happen in our lives and we wonder why things happen that way but you know what it's God working those things to a you know to a purpose for those things to come to a place that God wants us to be and you know one of the things I I was looking at was you know brother was speaking of of the the Lily and you know he was talking about this Lily being down in the ground and he said that seed was down in that mud and all of that muck and all of that stuff the dirt and all that stuff and all that filth down there in that pond down in the bottom and there's that seed and that seed but that seed is to bring forth life that seed is predestinated to do something and God created that seed not to just lay in that mud but it's to bring forth something and you know and he was speaking and in the message birth paines and he was speaking how that how that seed was down there and you know he said what what does it take what was it he said it was the light the S the light of the Sun was shining do you know that seed never could see that light it never could see the light of the Sun but you know what the warmth was there in the water those rays were there but it could never see that but you know what just the sun like shining in all of that it's like where is God in all this there's no way but you know what the sun was was shining on that seed and in all of that fil all of that mck way away from all of that and yet that that seed began to germinate and began to express itself and began to grow right out of all that mud and all of the mud and all the filth and everything that was around it but you know what it never hindered that that Lily it never hindered that seed it what it do it just kept growing because it began to express what was on the inside of it and it continued to grow and grow and grow and grow and began to express exactly what it was until one day he said that thing come right up out of the top of the water and began to bloom and began to express what was on the inside why because that bloom was always there and it had to toll and work and all the way all the way through that but you know what God had called it to do that and when it come time in the right season in the right atmosphere then it brought forth exactly what it was supposed to do it came through it what but the light was always there and the light was calling to them and so it's the same way with you and I when all of the problems and all the things that happen you know what the word is still calling you to that place whether you see it or not or whatever takes place whether they they walk away or whatever when it gets worse than what it was when it goes from bad to worse then you know what it's still God calling amen yes we don't give up we don't quit because God is the one that promised just like we have many young people and loved ones that we have we have claimed y right and wherever they go whatever they do you know what they're still claimed the the blood still applied absolutely we are still enforcing the the contract we're still enforcing the deed because it's been given to us it's ours we're entitled to it then you know what we're still making the claim am right amen and they can go do whatever they want to and and live in in the world or whatever it may be and go around and and do whatever and but you know what they can't get away from that brother why because you know what the word has been been released it has been has been put in motion it has been enforced to do that and many times you know people people wonder about things well you know what if you've seen it one time happen then you know what where where how did you get here how did I get here well you know what I didn't I didn't just wake up one morning to decide to do this right you know what there was people been praying for me my grandmother prayed a lot of prayers for me and Richard to get here and you know what it was still her prayers and I told him you know I always knew growing up you know I go out in the world and do all kinds of stuff but you know what I knew grandma was praying for us she prayed for her grandchildren she kept us under why because she knew what we knew where we were supposed to be right amen but you know what she didn't get discouraged by that well you know and you you look at the the kind of life that she lived you know when when all the things that happened and church splits and different things that happened in her life you know what she never got discouraged she never quit going to church she never got down in the mouth why because she knew where she was at she knew where she was anchored and that that anchor held no matter what took place why she was standing because she had come into the light of the word and you know what she was basking in that light and then you you know so when you get to that place you know when you've seen these things take place when all of this has taken place when you've seen the the the Miracles take place and people's lives then you know what I I don't have to worry about it I don't get I don't get well you know they quit doing they're doing this and they're doing that you know what God is still in charge he's still in control you can do what you want to but you know what if God God has called you and you're one of his you can run but you know what you're only going to be come back tired amen right you can run you can crawl you can clog your way but you know what there's coming a day you're going to have a Day of Reckoning right right because there's coming a day you're coming because you've got to come and answer the call amen amen if you're one of his he said I'm not going to lose one of you praise God it he never gets tired he just lets us do our thing spin our wheels and do all our foolishness but you know what he's never too far away he's still waiting on us see if we just get to that place where we realize God is in control and he's bringing us to that place see God is in God's word is in force and whatever ever we have God God is in his word and whatever the word says you know what that's all you have to look at see the word the word is is light amen and and the the light of the word you know when all of the things that is in the word when you come into this this Kingdom when you come into this family of God then the word is is you you become into this the light of the word but you know what then there's a Contin continuation of that light you know it's just a continuation of the of the growing and you know brother ROM was speaking in the in the church age book and and I I thought was kind of funny but being uh the Fourth of July being yesterday but you know hey brother R speaking of he was talking about the church ages and you know he was talking about how the church Ages was the the the basis for to understand the rest of the word and he was you know he was covering the church ages to understand he said because upon this we're going to build all of the other foundations the other doctrines that are in the word had to come and he was talking about that Roman candle and he said when that Roman Candle was lit and the light went out from that Roman candle and he said then the next one came and the next one came and he's like you know he said we we look at the illumination of the word and as as that Roman candle went out but you know what there's another one coming right behind it because sometimes we catch our eyes on that it's like wow look at that but you know what there's another one there too and we you know sometimes we get wow we get overwhelmed by that you know just like all of those shooting all those Fireworks off you know when you here's a beautiful blast and this you see this marvelous scene well you know what there's another one right behind it and you just continue on because God is bringing you up through the word and as as it begins to unfold and you're like wow you know you you start some days I I can still remember brother Dale preaching on Romans 8 Romans chapter 8 and and I I tell everybody from him preaching on that that one time I said I never can read Romans 8 ever again the same way because I saw it one way but when he got done preaching it I said there's a there's a veil that's come off of the book and I can I'll Never See Romans 8 the same way because I and I can honestly tell you I see myself there I because I understand I see something there that ties me to that why because that is what God has called us to to be the manifestation of the sons of God the word is open unto us there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus why because if you understand because you know we can condemn ourselves and we can live under the condemnation of the devil but let me tell you something God don't see condemnation when it's settled and under the blood you know what there is no condemnation there is no there is no holding you down we hold ourselves down we hold ourselves back but God doesn't see that thank God he's got a sea of forgetfulness and the depths of the sea and it's all covered and it is all settled amen right right sometimes we got to get to the place where we realize that it's settled amen it's a settled inside of us what we've done in the past if God has forgiven us and he's forgotten it then you know what there is no more answering to that you know it's just like when you go to court and you have a court case and they finish that and they settle that and they stamp it it's closed it's finished you know what you can bring that back up why because there is a judgment upon that and it has finished and when you and I have had someone that's come into our the judge and the jury and our attorney has come in and has settled the case and has stamped it that it has settled and it's settled forever then you know what there is no more bringing that up right brother but many times the problem is we got to get to the place where we realize it is settled well maybe sometimes maybe the problem is is that it's not settled that's it maybe maybe we've not got to the place where it's been settled but you know what you get to the place where it's settled in God and God's going to reveal to you that it's settled right then you know what you don't have to worry about what went on in the past God's not bringing that up right but the devil will sit on your shoulder and waste your whole day talking about what what went on in the past right brother amen and you know and many times we don't realize that maybe maybe we think things are okay that's one thing I appreciate brother Wade talking about you know when when some when when he had had talk about that brother when he when he had said whatever and you know you know and if the Lord come and spoke to him and told him said listen you can make this thing right get rid of it you know you know the the how many times has the Lord told you to you know had the same thing and the Lord come and tell you hey you know it's time to say something I've called people up and apologize went and seen people and apologize like listen I just don't want I just don't want there to be any hard feelings brother I don't I don't know I thought about brother sister Harris one time and brother and sister Harris had had surgery you know she had that infection and she couldn't get rid of it and he said he said I went in there he said I went and there sister Harrison was talking to her and he said you know he said I want to make everything right he said cuz I don't know if there's something between you and I or not right sure and he said they made it right and he said you know and then they begin to pray to God that you know if there's something that that's here that's hindering that's between us is hindering her healing sure Now's the Time to let us know what we need to do but he said after they had cleared the air and brought that before God and then they then he prayed over her and they prayed then you know what that infection went away right but you know what it took it took coming to that place and realizing I'm going I I want to stay right here until we get this thing settled whatever it may be and sometimes you know it's like well I you know sometimes you might not do anything wrong sometimes it's somebody takes what you say wrong and sometime sometimes you don't mean it but sometimes it's it's what we hear and then the devil jumps on the bandwagon did you hear that did you hear that he you and he runs it in the ground and sometimes I'm sorry but sometimes we're just sorry enough to let him hit Chik all day right we we just entertain him all day and instead of kicking him off at the at the first stop exactly so we don't need any of that I'm tired of tired of you bothering me amen see this is from the message there is a man they can hear they can turn on the light and brother brand speaking said he is the light the truth the light and there is no darkness in him and he scatters the darkness when he comes in because he is the word the word is the light that's right because he spoke and said let there be light that was the word that became light and he when he speaks this it's the light of that age each time he said now he is here and not in a glare but people are living in a glare but he is the Vindicated word he is absolutely the light in the time of Darkness yes sir all these false glares and things will fade away he said yes sir here he is here don't fear turn on the lights he's Pro his promis word it lives he said he that believeth in me the works that I do shall he do also then it is is the word as the father sent me so send I you right the father sent me come in me the Jesus that sends you comes in you and the works that he did then he does the same thing because why the word is made flesh in human flesh manifests itself as the light of the day there you are there it is it just is showing the way to light in the light he said wise man who are not blinded by Creeds and denominations will walk in that light that's right see don't be he said don't be afraid don't be scared don't don't pay attention to any of these things see if you follow what he's doing if you're if he's in the light because he is light just follow him he said you'll walk in see if you do you're paying attention to other things don't pay any attention to what they're doing ab you do you walk in darkness be wise they do they that do wise Daniel said in these days those that know their God those that walk in light that know their God you'll walk in light he said those are the wise ones he said they that do wise Daniel said in these last days will do exploits for their God see they'll walk in the light as he is in the light he said don't worry and talking about it may be dark all around but don't worry because God is the one that's made the light all the different things that all the proclamations he said oh see God's made all these things don't worry don't it may be dark look like they're going to force us everyone see you see their Proclamation going out all these little churches and things are are got to come in now talk about joining the World Council of churches you got to come in or they're going to close you up they're going to make it going to make it but now I want to hit that real hard tonight when I got I get to this time see they're going to close up you have to be one of them or not you're either in that or you can't be can't do nothing can't even buy or sell that's right you're darome to pray for the sick if you're caught ministering to any sick or any person with any spiritual thing in there you're subject to a federal law to be executed that's exactly right see you know that that's right right it's in their paper see so you cannot do it you've got to belong to the cult brother let me tell you something you better get Christ sure in your heart right now cuz there is a Time coming where you're really going to need it you're you're out then remember when that seal is put on she is there for good see so you don't don't you do it don't you believe that stuff you get right into Christ right right now the word yes sir he said vindicates the word and shows that is the light of the hour that's how we know he is the light because he is the light manifesting itself in flesh how do you know he was God's word made flesh see God's word was showing itself vindicating itself when the Messiah cometh what he'll do so when he began to express these things of what he was supposed to do the first time when everything come against it and they didn't agree with it and they didn't come the way that he they wanted him to or the way they expected him to when he came in but he kept pointing them back to the word and you know just like then they they were going to stomp it out but you know what they couldn't do it but you know they come against it they come against Jesus they come against the early Christians all them to stomp that out to try to get rid of it but they couldn't because you know what that's what was required for their day to bring them to the place that God had for them it brought them to the place that God wanted them to come to and so that's the same thing he vindicates the word why because if you don't have if you don't have any pressure and you don't have anybody coming against you how do you know that it's how do you vindicate the word you know it's just like when you know when you you know the Hebrew children and all the different ones that came you know if they didn't have to face the problems and the power of the government Daniel there having to you know you know you've got to bow down okay whatever you know he wanted to make sure everybody knew which side he was on he went right back to the window opened it up let everybody know he was praying right everybody knows which side he was on because he want he wanted to know that God was God and God was real and that's who he was serving and he wasn't going to change for anybody he had he had his place where he was standing and you know he let it he let his light shine to that whole world and the King's like well you know what Daniel you got you got to go in the lines then that's all right right you know what the the same God that created all this world is the one that created them lines and he's the one that's brought me this far and I'm not worried about it he's he's brought me all the way through and then what was it when Daniel went down in the Lion's Den those hungry Lions hadn't been eaten all hadn't eaten in all that time and he got put down there but what was it the angel of the Lord was down there with him right the angel that liked what brother R say them them lions and stuff you know they don't go around that light that scares them right man they don't like that but that light was down there in that dark dungeon and you know what he just probably went off somewhere and laid down went to sleep didn't worry about it but you know them cats wouldn't get nowhere in nearing they didn't like none of that but you know what God had protected him until the next morning you know it you know it was so amazing the Daniel probably slept okay the king probably didn't sleep too well but you know he didn't you know he had this nice plush bed and everything the the king had a hard time trying to sleep and Daniel's down there with a bunch of dead bones and rotten flesh or whatever else is down there and all the DU you know the uh stanas all the bugs and everything else is down there you know in that dungeon but you know what Daniel went right to sleep it didn't bother him one bit Lord amen see brother ra says here and and turn on the light he said when he talking about the the the seed and he was talking about the ripening of the grain he was talking about he says and from the ripening of the grain from all the way back from Luther all the way down through the age it ought to be the fullness of the Gospel now the power of God to ripen the light that's been shown through justification sanctification the Pentecost the age ought to ripen the bride tree for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ that Christ that Christ could be manifested in his churches one person him and his wife him and his bride amen this is the hour We're living this is the light of the day walk in it be saved all the ends of the Earth he said Church glare this day was very deceiving Jesus said in Matthew 24 he said it would deceive the very elect if possible see not Luther wouldn't receive Luther couldn't deceive a Methodist a Methodist couldn't deceive a Pentecostal that's right see but what what about the bride that's what put the Pentecostals eyes out right all of the why because the light was to them but see they couldn't they couldn't walk in a further light But as God moved on as the light began to began to grow and the light Shone for that day see they put their eyes out because if they stayed back behind there in a different age then their eyes were Blinded By the Light because they couldn't move on to into this our day amen to the day that God has called them to and let's have the have the musicians come let's all stand have the musicians come and I just want to I want to finish with this this one quote here and this from the from the message brother Bram speaking here this is the message there is a man that here that can can turn on the light and brother Bram says remember in every age in time of Darkness God always had his word to divide the light from the dark he had it in the days of Luther when the Catholic church had everything he sent Luther as a Shining Light and Luther divided truth from darkness when the Lutheran got twisted up he made a John Wesley and divided light from darkness and in the days of Pentecost when the Wesley and the Methodist got all gummed up the Baptist and Presbyterian he sent the Pentecostal message to separate light from Darkness the Pentecost went right back out into the darkness again like that in their organization took their Creeds and things he said now the hour has come for this word to be Vindicated he sends the light the word made manifest like he did in the beginning sends the word and it proves itself there is a light and he always separates the same is now it's Eternal little lights in the beginning amen and we are those Eternal lights brother because you know you can't if you're always a part of God you can't get away from that and I thank God that we have received an eternal light and you know what when we have when we have been attached we have we become one with that eternal life then you know that light we can never be separated from that amen and then you say oh I I I wish could walk in the light well you know what you are the light am you know it says you know we'll walk in the light the the beautiful light well you know what we are that light we are the light to the world am are we are walking in that light why because you can't separate yourself from that I am the light of the world right it's not me that's right it's no longer I it's not it's not Aaron Roberts that shines but it's the light that's inside of it amen it's the life that's inside of Meen and I just want I just want to continue to shine shine until Jesus comes I I'm going to let it shine amen you know what because the world's looking for that the whole world song says the whole world's groping in darkness but he gave us light
