years ago it's been many years since we're traveling here and this is being one of the my place where I can say it's the place where I learnt the Word of God but the deal is being a father and a teacher and a great friend to us over the years and the extended family and the church and we certainly thank God for that I mean I'd like to read the scriptures Revelation chapter 3 read verse 14 so that we can take our seats amen my besaid and on to the angel of the church of lettuce here write these things said the Amen the faithful and the true witness the beginning of the creation of God I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would though were cold our art so then because the word lukewarm I will and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because those seis am rich and increasing with goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayst be rich and white raiment that thou mayst be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness doth not do not appear and anoint thy eyes with I saw that thou may see as many as I love I rebuke and chasten is ILA's therefore and repent the old I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and to sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the Spirit says unto the church then in Revelation chapter 14 and verse 9 to verse 11 and the third angel followed them saying with a loud voice if any man worship the Beast and His image and receive his mark in his forehead or in his hand the same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God which is poured out without measure in the cup of ignition and I shall torment be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the Holy Angels and in the presence of the Lamb and the smoke of their torment ascends it up forever and ever and they have no rest day nor night who worship the Beast and His image and also ever received the mark of his name may we bow our heads everywhere or heavenly father Lord God we thank you Lord God for this privilege that you have given to us where Lord God we can turn back the page and read the word but Lord more than ever we thank you because Lord God you are the light of the day that O God has shone upon the world and give us O God spiritual revelation from your word the Lord God words that has been written and is there on the pages dormant for years can no live in the body of the believer bless us God may this word be for us instructional God a guide Lord God remind us of our position Lord we thank you God for who you are to us Oh God and Lord God for the day in which we live and the great message that has been revealed to us in this name bless us now God and hands are the needs of our heart as we give you thanks and praise you in Jesus name we pray amen and amen god bless you you may be seated you know we want to certainly thank God for His mercies and His grace towards us and you know the Bible says that the footsteps of the righteous they are ordered by the Lord you know sometimes you see things happening in your life and you would say you know I don't see no glory in this really but you've got to take side with the word against yourself amen hallelujah because that's what he says you've got to believe it aim and praise God and so you know what we're not trusting in the things that we see we're not trusting in the circumstances around us we're trusting in the unfailing words of Almighty God aim and praise God and you know back home where we've we've had our fair share of of trials of tests of you know there's different things that happen really but in all we say thanks be to God amen you know last year it was just about October you know just before our meeting the Francine's you know at last her sister and it was so devastating to us really you know that morning you know I was ready for church and I came out and I heard her on the phone I I pause I listen and I realized she was talking to her sister and you know I I said I mean what happened to her and she said you know she's sick and she just gave me the phone and I was talking to her you know just joking with her real weird and she was laughing and and so and she said I'm sick and I said well you know because you don't have something in the mornings and you know she said you know the same problem I had 2014 is back and you know I I talked her I said I was saying to friends and I said go get her and you know they made a plan they said well we're going to go to church and if anything's worse she said you know she'll call and and all of that you know we didn't realize that while she was talking to us her body was just shutting down and by the time she had called her dad she called us and she called her daughter and said you know coming sister by the time davia got there really she was even too weak to get dressed for the hospital and by the time she got there she died you know just tremendous so sudden and so but you know when you when you look back at these things you realize that it is as though God was giving you warning of the things that were happening sometimes you you can't really read the signals that are coming to you and and we went through that I think in March you know and I think it was a Friday the 13th you know in the afternoon I got a call that my smallest brother he had called me and he said you know they've got a report that you know Shaun Shaun Reed was hit by a truck and he had died at the hospital and man I tell you so I left and I I was thinking that he had died so I went to the funeral home and you know I speak to the man they know me very well as you know minister in the area and they took me there downstairs and they took the body and you know I look I said no that's not my brother because he's a small fellow and when I look at this person was big I didn't know where they took him out and unreal everything I said my lord and and there he was you know he was hit by the truck he was just walking along the road the driver fell asleep and just didn't take a car Nate came straight hit him you know they took him up they carry him to the hospital and you know before he could call anybody he died and while we were going through that you know in Jamaica you know I know in America somebody died within three days you bury them not in Jamaica really I mean six weeks is a normal time and there's a number of reasons why we do that you've got to understand our culture you know I remember brother Dale was there with lost a sister and you know he went with us to the weekend you must have been wondering what I'm hurt they're doing but it seems that we're rejoicing but it's just our culture really and so you know sometimes it doesn't matter how a debt took place by your British law they've got to do one and our Topsy to still declare the cause of that so you know a cause of that cannot be that a truck hit on somebody it has to be exactly what happens inside that caused the debt and and that is why and so you might have one pathologist for the entire island and so you know there's a lotta are cops is to be done and you've got to wait on that really and so so you know we just get adjusted six weeks a bit of a normal time you know and so so while we you know we were waiting you know for for that I mean one morning I came up we were I was going to work and as we sit at the table we we were getting ready for breakfast and um you know she got a call and she answered the caller and she said Keith brother Dixon is not responding and so I got up from the table I lived just about three OSes down the road from us really and I was just going to go by the house really and as soon as I going through the door she she called she said no they're in the hills around their way to Kingston and so what had happened really they were going to Kingston there was brother Dixon his wife and his son and one of our Deacon was there in the vehicle with them and they were talking along the road really and the Dixon said she recognized that he was moving he was responding and she showed out to him really no brother we'd have driven through the hills it's a drop-off to know where I'm the mountain on the other side really but God was so good yes he was driving the vehicle just came to a stop and stopped there and so and you know they it was stiff so they couldn't move him out of the vehicle or so you know so we're call Monique because she wasn't us Monique lives just at the bottom of the hill there really and we call her they'd call the police and you know they the police come and you know get the body out of the vehicle and they realize that he was gone and so you know man I tell you I had my brother and this no really I went into the room and I I grabbed my Bible out of my bag and I I hope and I was thinking I said Lord give me a word and I hope in my Bible and it opened to Acts chapter one and I read the verse 8 for you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you and immediately with that I drop down on my knees and I said Lord and you know is as though somebody said to me read the next verse and you know that scripture in in Acts chapter 1 very familiar you know but very profound and when I read the second that the next verse verse 9 and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight that's what he said and immediately my heart I said Lord he's gone and you know I I got up and I I was pacing the floor I said Lord not today not another one Lord I said Lord let him come back and share the testimony of what happened to him really but I tell you brethren desperation it brings the promise of God you know I I was thinking what to do and it came to me I call back sister Dixon and she said brother kitties that I said put the phone at his ears and she says I said put the phone at his ears she put the phone in his years really the police was under way carrying the body and I started to pray and as I prayed you know just pouring out before God I said God not another one she responds she said the kid is moving his mouth I said thanks be to God thanks be to God and you know they took him to the hospital the doctors took him they kept him there for about three days I think they kept him there there on all the tests that they could run they said we don't see anything wrong with this man we serve a miracle-working God amen a miracle-working God amen you know brother Dixon he comes back to church and he said brethren heaven is real he said before they even recognize what had happened he was looking at the vehicle moving he was seeing everything there he said but he wasn't in it really he said he went back home and he walked around the house he said the flowers at home was the most beautiful he had ever seen them and he said he was just taken up and he said he remember going away and was thinking that I never even had time to tell everybody that I'm gone but he said that place that he had gone to he said listen I never won he said I was looking down over the city of kings and he said how did I live so long in that wicked world he said where I'd gone to he said I never wanted to come back but he said you call me back amen you know i oughtta your brethren I believe it is real it is real amen and you know I said I thank God I thank God you know brethren that is not a state of absence for the believer we've got a reality that is real one move out of this body you're in another dimension with God amen and you know like a prophet tell us he said and it's more real on the other side that it is on this side amen you know I understand when Paul could have said oh debt where is your sting and grave where is the victory amen praise God you know before that morning brother Dixon we recognized it was sick and it was going about three weeks and that Sunday you know I think that was that happen on the Tuesday that's Sunday we wanted to go pray for him because that was the first time he didn't turn up at church but we had a funeral after a morning service we would have service like you we break for an hour and then we have the second service so the second service was actually a funeral so we couldn't leave so you know remember brother Kevin had gone there to the host really so we knew he was sick you know and we didn't know exactly what happened really what was wrong with him but one thing I can say when God bring him back from the dead what happened to him before the doctors couldn't find any trace of any of that amen and I say thanks be to God thanks be to God amen so brethren I tell you but the brand said divine healing is the earnest of the Resurrection I mean we know we're going to have a resurrection like his Amen and I'll tell you I don't care what the devil does it's going to be more glorious on the other side than it is on this side amen and what he's doing hallelujah is given a glimpse of the other side don't fear little flock it is your father's good will to give to you the kingdom amen praise God so this evening I'd like to speak a little bit on bearing the evidence I said bearing the evidence of who you are who you are you know I said when we look at each other when we look at people you look at the outward frame and you you decide what is on the inside you know I've always that a problem with young people there that they dress a certain way and so you know they might be on the street and the police see them and and immediately they they have a frame of what they think they are because of the way they look and I said why you want to look like that if you're not against the way you want to look like one if you're not a criminal what you want to look like a criminal and then if somebody say you are then you get upset but but even us believers you know people dress a certain way and you can tell what is that long the inside because what's happening on the inside is reflecting on the outside that there is something about the believer though you know we bear the evidence of who we are by what we say what we do you know where somebody lives when you speak to them when you fellowship with them really then whether they have faith in the Word of God are the adult in the Word of God there's people there that the natural characteristic is that they're just of a complex amen and it might be one extreme or the other extreme you know that's the way it is and everybody bear a characteristics really Amen but I believe when we are Christians we reflect the Word of God don't let nobody fool you if Christ live in a house he express himself amen hallelujah no no with a message of the hour and if this we know that not all is going to make it in the rapture amen but the Prophet even tell us he said there's three kind of believer in every Church you know it's not for you to say well well if you're they believe and you're me then I'm no sir that's not it you be the belief amen you just read the believer amen no no to the ladies in church he said and listen you know Leticia is it is a finer church age but yet the bride is caught up in the revelation of the word revelation 4:1 that's for us come up into the open door and a door is a revelation amen but while we are there Leticia is right there with us and it doesn't matter what we do not everybody's gonna take the word Amen but there's going to be people in the church that's just not I'm not the Redeem there's gonna be people in the church that yes they're going to be saved but they've got to go through the tribulation but but listen somebody said then well where should we preach even some says well let us preach to those who haven't heard it I said no I said let us preach the word so high that Eagles will follow and come up to the Word of God amen hallelujah but you know if we look at it really this morning not all that was in Moses Melanie Exodus make it into the land of promise as a matter fact it was saw that they said that - that came out of Egypt merited to the land of promise I trust God it's not like that this evening amen only Joshua and Caleb it was those who are born humbly in the wilderness that went in with them into the promise is it Ron Amen not all that was with Jesus aiming you know you you talk about the church somebody sometimes look at us possible the deal and they said well you know you've got any pocket in your church well I'll tell you how much you've got Jesus not only twelve and one of them was a different hello so don't blame me now it's just the nature of it is it wrong if I'm 12 twelve righteous but Jesus at twelve one was a devil one deny him one said if I don't put my finger in his side homily and touch I won't believe that was Thomas hello but then walk with him for three and a half years and at the end of it that's where they were is awry hallelujah and so what we say about the message of the hour hallelujah amen not all that say they believe brother Branham is a prophet they meant some even said well as long as you love the Prophet that's all right hey man I tell you that sounds real good but that's a lie is that right I'm not a before you've got two other token is awry amen but this we will say Jesus Christ is the message of the hour amen but the Branham of Holland it was over Eleazar him in bringing the bride Rebekah a mentor Issac Jesus Christ hallelujah brother Branham came and stood in the office of John the Baptist he had to decrease that Christ the word must increase are you there with Mary hallelujah glory to God amen hallelujah was a cinnamon revealingly Solomon Jesus Christ hallelujah amen but you asked the question hallelujah is therefore is the foolish virgin out in the church world or is a foolish virgin among the runs of the message of the hour that's a question where are they hallelujah now the foolish virgins they were satisfied with their position Halloween ever got for the oiler never received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and will go into the tribulation they will reject the endtime revelation of the word is awry hallelujah and therefore they're going to miss the rapture amen brethren I tell you you know there in Halloween Revelation chapter 3 the bottle speaks Jesus said I rather you are hot or cold but because you're lukewarm and neither hot nor cold I will spew you out of my mouth he said I'd rather you were cold let us say me cold Haman you're just an unbeliever you're just there in the number let us say be hotter Haman mean you're a true believer with the anointing of the Holy Ghost upon you and let us say be lukewarm you're just a make believer you're not hot you're not cold is that right you're bearing the image of boat is errata hallelujah amen now the unbeliever he said like this no the unbeliever attend church but without the revelation of the word hallelujah II just attend church just as a shore you know people said well if I don't go to church somebody's gonna call and ask me what happened so I'm just going to be a charger so nobody asks me anything amen it's not because you want to be there but I don't want anybody to have to ask me and I've got to find an excuse so I'm going to be in church hallelujah they've got a form of godliness hallelujah but deny the power varies hallelujah a good churchgoer hallelujah it's just a tradition that is in force well my grandmother does it my mother and so I do it hallelujah glory the unbeliever joint Church just to please mama and papa hallelujah just to please your friends that's where we go and I go with them mana but everyone must have an experience must experience the new birds and brethren are Taylor if you have never experienced you nubert you're an unbeliever is Aurra hallelujah amen an unbeliever has no revelation Amon of the message and this blind to actual truth of the horror that we're living in is it rod in other words I say like this back home there are people in the church that if they were out in the Baptist Church there would have been the same way is that wrong they're not here because of the revelation of Jesus Christ they're just here because circumstance in their life calls them to be here so they go to church amen as tradition and this is where they go might be closer to where they live might be closer to the job might be your friends go there so you're just there you're an unbeliever amen wisdom vs. feita the word comes to them the word falls upon them sure it does yes sir hallelujah it falls on them they can hear the word preacher hallelujah did you ever see people Center in the church there never will make a move amen preach the women about Bobby here hallelujah amen for years pasa Haman has still got Bobby here didn't talk to man about smoking women about drinking him in that drink right on just the same hallelujah it's just like pouring water on a duck's back it doesn't penetrate anyhow but there there hallelujah hey manna in the message I live Haman CD hallelujah Haman God being misunderstood 1961 he said that's a reason people cannot believe in miracles today they don't have anything to believe with amen and they'll say to you I don't see nothing happening but even if it's something you wouldn't know because you've got nothing to believe God with amen hallelu Lori they've got to have something in there to believe with and when the Spirit of God is in a man he will say amen to every word of God the unbelievers got nothing to say men about because there's nothing in him reflecting back to the word is awry you see when the word is preached or believer Amen there is something in you that the word in a jazz and you can't help yourself Amen it makes you happy brings joy enthusiasm maybe your heart burn within you because you know that's a word the unbelievers got nothing to believe with Amen hallelujah remember Haman as my mother used to say brother Branham said you can't get blood amen from a turnip amen it might have a red substance because there's no blood in it so that's all the same way you can't get belief out of unbelief because there's nothing there to believe with and I said I don't believe in divine healing no matter what you say certainly it's not for him the only to those who can believe it is arrived amen can you imagine there was people back there staying brother branham's meeting they saw the miracles and the signs and all and I still don't believe amen they still don't believe hallelujah you can't get them to believe because there's nothing in them to believe God's Word is awry let me say this you the only reason you believe is because God plays something there for you to believe his word hallelujah without data taming your carnal understanding your carnal state can take God's Word you don't want it Amen hallelujah Chris Christ 1955 how can you believe when there's nothing in there to believe with how can you get blood from a turnip when there's no blood and turn it you've got to be born again of the Spirit of God oh you'll never be able to come on fellowship them in fellowship ground with God Almighty Himself hallelujah for it's only up on that basis of the shed blood does he receive any believer Amen an unbeliever is just an unbeliever is a rod and you can try all you want even if you preach walking upside down he's still an unbeliever are you there with me amen but you know Jesus said I'd rather you mean that cold and then oh you be hot but he said now that make believer that's where the problem really lies is awry hey Manny he said I'm a believer seemingly have the revelation of the word it seem like they have it because they talk about it they can port pager hallelujah say whether what the word said Raymond they call the scripture they may be right there with it amen he's a disabled a little impersonate signs and wonders and gifts of the Spirit err but stealing a portrait and a borderline believer brethren you know why he said he hate the lukewarm because they're hypocrites to the Word of God and then hypocrite is a pretender diamond only you think that they are in it amen I've never seen people while you're there this week nice about you hello then they show you what we see a good fish but as soon as you turn your back you are nobody Amen they're just an e-book RIT amen hallelujah glory can I go on and then he said just like Judas and Balaam Oh hallelujah there weren't unbeliever they were made believer Amen they will betray the word for money we'll always find fault with the pasta is it wrong amen remember one time in our church one woman maybe she was upset with me for something and so after church he comes up her and she looketh you know we've got the picture of the pyramid with an eagle over it and she look at the printer and she said you know that eagle is wrong because it's looking down for food I said on your tongue too long that's your problem amen just any Procrit try to find fault with something the mapley will betray the word and it will always find fault with their pasta and find fault with the church oh you know the church is this the church is that amen I don't like this Rosetta like that so they never furniture that they like have you ever seen people that come into the church and when they come they said oh I find what I want all my life I was looking for a church like this this is where the word is as a greatest church give them a little time are you feeling me and the same church that they said I mean this is it this is what I want tomorrow they find fault with it Oh hallelujah oh you just take me down I'm not from around here amen if given the chance payment on the opportunity to be famous or they make a big timer he will betray anyone else' for personal gain I make believer cannot be trusted can I sell a lukewarm believer cannot be trusted hallelujah Amen he said now that make believer hands around and AXA just as poised as he can I don't know but down in his heart he's trying to find a amen something Oh hallelujah in the countries and full of that kind of hypocrite is around just a Judas amen hands around become part of the group he was the treasurer see he stands around he's always got his answer hold for money he can tell the the one thing he's always fishing for money they meant God his hands out for payment for it for this is a make believer he acts like a believer they make believer acts like a believer he's got trades off believer in him but down in his heart you remember he wasn't he wasn't fooling Jesus haven't I told you twelve and one of you is a devil Jesus you mean you chose endeavor to Jesus tell meaning you choose the devil yes he did I've chosen you twelve and one a years a devil man I tell you I need to look at that again because brother I wouldn't choose a devil knowing he was a devil but there had to

he had this testimony that he pleased God brother Brennan said email please God with rapturing Fiat Ezra he pleased God with rupturing Fiat he didn't look at the circumstance around him he didn't let that limit him he looked at the Word of God that God said and God is able to bring his word to pass the problem with us today is a you know don't God say - we're wondering well you know God say but I'm not gonna go to the limb no it's not your business hello he's any sick among you let him call for the elders of the church let them anoint them with oil and the Perot fate shall save the sick is that God's Word brethren I'm resting on that hello he don't mean a certain person he don't need no interpretation they don't need the gifted in only need to call when God call you invest in his word in you a man for whom is called then he justified and will be justified then he also glorified Ezra it's not my business that the Bible said when when God hallelujah place Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden he plays them on a hallelujah and a conditional covenant how dumb you know if you do this I'm gonna do this I'm if you do that that's not a type of the bride but when God called Abraham he

she will be beside herself there's our ah but that's what Abraham had to deal with bird Aeneid past the age and she had passed the age but God gave it to him they know when he received it into his heart by affirming he staggered not at the promise of God to one believer but he was faithful to the promise this arrived god save and I believe it I don't care what you say your passage and Sarah women's day I don't care what you say God said and I believe that's what it's gonna be for the rapture he said because you can't make it in these bodies it's gotta be a change what God is obligated to

gonna live I got Devils you know I was going through my whole notes and brother weed I find a page where I sit there in the office and I was preparing to preach and I was writing a letter to God to take some of these unbeliever from me because I'm tired I'm just tired to fight amen but when God put them in the promised land hallelujah he said every spot of ground that the Solia for touch you're gonna have to fight for it he could give them a floor amenities but he let them fight for it and love him that's what you're gonna do it to me Lord do it to me because at that time when I was reading I was remembering them thank God when you go amen but I'm telling the truth I'm just telling you the truth there's some people I'd rather love from way off in the distance and there's some people you want to fellowship with every day of your life there's some people that were just heard like a canker Paulette them awful miss I'm innocent villagers he said believe in begin to preach the resurrection is pass and over true the fate of many is awry they are direct opposite of the world of the revelation of Jesus Christ for the hour but they are still be Jesus could you give us a church without them oh my hallelujah but but you know that's what perfect love in you really I love them anyhow and I wish the best for you remember I tell you that I by now I'm running the rapture wish you all the best hmm the hour that we're living in you know some believers even get so political it's the worst I've seen that believers now begin to turn against believers because of politics or profits and the politics of every nation is of the devil even if you're the greatest nation on earth Ezra you are not on this wall we are going to another one in Israel and I tell you if you think that the politics of today is gonna make life better or you're living in pimpest paradise man because it will never be better until Shiloh comes there's never a Superman is gonna rise but God will put it in their heart to fulfill as well is that right although you're a royal priest Lord you're a holy nation you are a peculiar people is awry brethren don't look further on the side this is all corrupted and cover-ups that has got a burn but there is another city that's where I'm going hallelujah I'm glad this world is not my home I'm just a possum true my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue amen hallelujah hallelujah yes sir because I'll tell you immediately after the bride is taken away in the rapture hallelujah the mark of the beast will come in and they'll have to seal their testimony with their blood but I'm not worried about that amen because we will never go into the judgment the true believer because we are already judged amen and so the unbeliever is here to judge you and they make believers here to judge you but but you know the thing that we want to say is that you know sometimes if you're not careful some are really true believers have not come into the redemption of the word you think that they are unbelievable hello somebody Paul say you have travail in pain until Christ may form within you now that's sometimes there's some real good believers when they haven't come into the revelation of the word yet they have not meet that day in that day yet and so they're a little shaky and a little that's why you got to give grace to everybody if we're not careful we start a separator and to saying you know damn my brother Keenan in your talk you know you're not from Lula by your Sirona the kannada and that's what the unbeliever there forgive me amen
