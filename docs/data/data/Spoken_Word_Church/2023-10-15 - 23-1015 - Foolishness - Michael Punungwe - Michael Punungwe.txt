========================================

it's good to be here amen you have your Bibles we'll turn to 1 Corinthians chap 1: 10 Brothers pull that up [Music] amen let's power to Bow our heads dear father Lord we thank you for this day Lord thank you for allowing us to come here Lord and congregate Lord and and be in your house Lord and just open your word up to us Lord thank you for allowing us to come here Lord and pray for those who aren't able to be here Lord pray for those who struggling right now with different afflictions Lord and just pray that you put your spirit over them and guide them Lord and give them the strength they need to pursue on Lord and just pray that in this service today Lord you reveal yourself unto us Lord and and we get closer to you Lord and get a better understanding of what you're trying to tell us and how what you're trying to guide us in our lives Lord pray for the service Lord pray for the song service and the preaching to come Lord and thank you for all things and lead us and guide us forgive us of all things and purify us in your presence Lord in your pres name of Jesus Christ I pray amen amen 1 2 3 1 Corinthians 1 2 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 10 now I beseech you Brethren by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you all speak the same thing and that there be no division among you but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment amen excuse me in the same judgment for it hath been declared unto me of you my brethren by them which are of the House of Khloe that there are no contentions among you now I say now this I say that every one of you saith I am of Paul I am of Apollos I am of sephus and I am of Christ but is Christ divided with is Paul crucified for you or were you baptized in the name of Paul I thank God that I baptized none of you but Crispus and gas lest any should say that I had baptized in my known name and I baptize also in the household of stefanus besides I know not whether I baptize any other for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel with wisdom with not with wisdom of words lest the Christ lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect so here Paul is talking to the church and he's saying why why is there so much division in the church why is you know people having their own denomination say I was baptized with this man of this man of this man but really it's not the men it's not the preachers it's not it's not the the people in the deacons and the people who are in the offices but it's really God working through them so it's not about us following a man or or following somebody or that's a really nice brother or I go to this church because you know this I like that preacher and then you know that preacher leaves and then they kind of Follow That preacher it it's really about if you see the the work of God moving in the church if you see the spirit of God and the power of God in the church so it's not about your favorite Minister your your top five list whatever it is but it's about who's number one on that top five list which is God so that's what we need to focus on is and if he's number one then everyone else you know the pastor the preachers the deacons they'll all just fall right under him and it'll be perfect harmonization and Union so it's not about you know they're trying to say I I was baptized with this person baptized of this person Apollo Seas but it's it's about Christ it's about him so if you're baptized of of Christ of him if he was in your baptism not if you know brother so and so baptized me or brother this and this baptized me but if Christ baptized you that's what you need to worry about and so if if he if he's baptized you then you're set amen and once again you know Paul's talking here not to preach the gospel you know with wisdom of words lest the Cross of Christ be made of none effect so it's not what we're here to just you know be an emotional emotional message or you know we could hire a great motivational speaker we could hire someone who is really smart and intelligent and could then just fly words all over you and just sprinkle things and you know kind of like Janice and jambus they said we have the same magician tricks that you know you have but it's not the magician tricks it's not just a bunch of fancy words it's not just trying to make you feel a certain way but but it's the power of Christ coming through you know flesh coming through life coming through a microphone to get to you and to to guide you and your life and we think that um we we think sometimes that we want you know to to come to church and have this some type of experience but but it needs to be the right experience it's not just about you know that all all the flashing lights and smoke machines you see in some church these days but it's about if God is here am and it's really about if God is speaking to you now even brother brandom talks about his first sermon and he he tried to make he got everyone so emotional he got them crying he got them you know feeling amazing or whatever they felt they just they felt something in their heart that just you know made them want to cry and then he gets back to the pastor and he says that was the worst sermon ever heard cuz what were you talking about where was God in that you know so it wasn't about you know that everyone was crying or everyone was just shouting and speaking in tongues but but but the god enter into their hearts and minister to them in a personal way so you might it may be quiet everyone might just be sitting down and and everyone's just you know has a look on their face but and and it might not look like something's going on but it's what's going on under the surface you know same with when you when you plant a garden when you put a seed in the ground on the surface you might not see anything going on but give it a month give it six months give it a year and you'll see the fruits of what was what was what what was in the ground start to sprout up and you then you'll see the life you know but if if you just you you could you could you know whatever you want to do to the ground you could Shout at the ground you could stomp on it you could you could scream at it but if there's not a seed of life in there nothing's going to come out so there there's no point in in trying to make a show there's no point in trying to get a mo motivational speaker there's no point in trying to get lights and the smoked machine but it's just a point of of whatever's here I'm just giving it out to you in the way that God revealed it to me so it's not it's not about a show but it's about what's happening in your heart and there may never be may never be a noise there may never be an amen there may never be a shout or a scream but if God is changing a heart then that that's what matters you know it's not about how much money is the church is drawing in it's not about you know how many famous people come here if the mayor comes here if if uh the president comes here whatever happens I didn't mean it like that I didn't mean it like that but but it doesn't it doesn't M it doesn't matter how how high profile the person is it doesn't matter uh you know whoever would come here it doesn't matter if a famous athlete would come here it doesn't matter who it is but it's it's about it's God in the church you know it's God here it's not about all that other stuff so and if we if we lean to those things in our Humanity we we'll make the Cross of Christ of n effect as the Bible is saying as Paul is saying so we have to be careful of what we're listening to and what we allow ourselves to listen to and be yielded to and to always you know check the spirit inside of us to make sure that that same spirit is is in what's being brought forth that's right so not not just oh well that's a good Minister and and he's he's been preaching for a long time so he knows what he's talking about but you need to know what you're talking what you what you know and what you're what he's talking about in order to know if what he's talking about is Right CU it's going to come out the word it has to or else Cross of Christ will be made of none effect as the scripture says and continues Verse 18 for the preaching of the Cross is to them that perish foolishness but unto us which are saved is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and will bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this this world and there's so much so many things that maybe we do as Believers that people believe are foolish and they don't understand it it's like why you know why is it in in 100 degree weather in Georgia that you're still wearing pants or why you wearing that skirt or what why why do you do these things why why do you spend so much time you know why do you drive so far to go to a church and then sit there for two hours for two sermons and you that that's your day off work you just stay at home and relax and what are you doing here why why do you always and there's so many things that they just see foolish but really in God it's wisdom so the foolishness of the world is the wisdom of God so the things that they see as foolish we understand that it's edifying to our souls and that it's not it's not just foolishness it's not just you know something we're making up but it's really God in the church and that's why we come so far that's why we come from these different places and that's why you know we just accept everyone who comes the way they are because we know that God can do a work in their life so it's not that we're wasting our day off of work it's not that we're we could be doing something better with our time there's nothing nothing better we could be doing but to be in the house of God and and and you know receiving his promises and and opening his word and having it unveiled to us and and and all his people and being just around the people of God being around good influences and and and to be edifying to each other as the scriptures opening up to everyone's heart individually amen so yes what's seen as foolishness is actually the power of God working working in every one of us on verse 21 for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom know not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe for the Jews require a sign and the Greeks seek after wisdom but we preach Christ crucified unto the Jews a stumbling block and unto the Greeks foolishness but unto them which are called both Jews and Greeks Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men so even through the foolishness of of having a man come up here and just do his best to try try and get something to you and the foolishness of you know even if you know the Bible even if the dumb donkey talk to you if it's the truth you have to listen to it you know cuz that that same Spirit of Truth should be in you so e no matter how it comes forth or where it comes from or who says it it's still true and even sometimes you know sometimes we hear the same message we feel like we're we're coming to the church and we're hearing the same thing every week but it's not any less true yesterday than it is today you know the same that 1 plus 1 is two and a thousand years of later 1 plus one will still be two and and the promise of Christ and the sacrifice that he made is never less true it's never should never you know be less effective to you it should never lose it its spark in your heart whether today whether we keep preaching for a thousand years it doesn't matter matter because it's it's it's true so it's always true no matter how long it's been it's true no matter how far ago it was it was true right so it'll always be true it's an eternal truth and you know verse 25 again because the foolishness of God is wiser than men and the weakness of God is stronger than men so even the best that we can do isn't isn't half as good as as the as the worst that God hyp hypothetically the worst that God could do you know even even even our the best that we could do if we just live the best life we could and we try to do all these works and it just still be filthy rags so it doesn't even matter how much we try to work and how much we try to pump up and put all this effort into it it's just filthy rags you know and imagine maybe it was your birthday and it's a great day everyone with you happy birthday it's a wonderful everyone's giving you presents and then you open one present and it's just some filthy rags there and it's just some dirty it smells it as soon as you open the box you smell how filthy it is you want to throw up and that that's our righteousness that's all we can amount to that's all we can do it's just some filthy rags and and to offer that before God as a gift is that's foolishness but if we just lean to what God wants then it'll be open to us CU then you know the best we can do is not the smallest God can do is better than anything that we could ever produce the whole of humanity could ever produce and to think of of greatness our our conceptualization of greatness you know we would think of someone who's great maybe we think of someone who has a lot of money maybe we think of someone who's really tall or really strong or is a great can fight anybody and does what they want and when we think of greatness we really think of Goliath we really think of a a great tall man who can do whatever and he he can just no one messes with him and he goes where he wants and does what he wants but when God was bringing forth his word he brought it through David just a small run the run of the litter just a a shepherd's boy you know his H father wouldn't even consider him isn't that something his own father was like oh him like like here are all my sons all of them are these all your sons oh well I mean there's someone else but his own father would wasn't even he's like oh it couldn't be David I mean David's just but God saw saw David's heart and that was a man after God's Own Heart it was David so it doesn't matter what the world thinks you know the world may look at you and just see something weird and strange but God sees you God SE your heart so it's not even we don't have to worry about what everyone else thinks cuz David wasn't worried about what everyone else thought cuz everyone else thought oh we're not going to fight Goliath that's crazy I mean look at him he's killed how many people now and he's just this great ferocious man and he's a giant and and it it' just be impossible but God David wasn't thinking about what everyone else thought David knew that God made him a promise David knew that he was going to be king and David took that promise and slew Goliath because because he knew he knew something that no one else knew and even today we know something we know things that no one else knows that they're not aware of so we need to come forth with that that same boldness to the throne and and throughout our lives and knowing that God is in us trying to do a work through us you know no matter who we are in our lives in our daily lives just trying to be an example of Christ and and not not you know falling back on your on your beliefs or changing for the crowd that you're in or or whatever the case may be but we need to stand firm on what what we believe amen amen and verse 26 for you see your calling Brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are called but God ha chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are Mighty now that word confound it just it just throws a wrench in people's plans you know when they think that you know the world is so obsessed with the education and and bringing things forth through education and and the intellectualization of everything that everything has to be know through the book or by the book and brother B talks about this all the time where you know people can lose God you know through pursuing education and he he of course never said that he promoted ignorance that you should always of course get your get your degree or not get your degree but you go to school and be educated you don't have to get a degree but be educated he's not promoting ignorance he's not promoting that you you know don't be smart or or not that you can't you know be scientific minded but when it comes to the word you have to completely surrender all those other parts of you to the word even if you are you know someone who's educated who likes to you know look at things rationally a lot of times but when it comes to the word you just have to believe what he said and then that's how you accept the promise it's not through any you know rational understanding or or logic or or we're trying to put God through the scientific method so we can prove him but God will prove himself through his word it's not he's not going to prove himself to according to man's laws you know and a lot of times when people you know who don't believe they talk about you know God doesn't show himself God doesn't prove himself but often times the the problem with them is not that it's proof or evidence the problem is that they have really have a heart issue it's that they don't want to surrender their heart so now they they've made things up so that they they have an excuse not to know because there's many people uh like many you know famous atheists will say oh there's no proof and there's no this and then someone will say well if God was real and he he did come you like that and and they would say they still wouldn't follow him so what's the point of him revealing himself if you're still not going to follow him so really there's no he he has no obligation to prove himself to someone where he already knows their heart and that they won't accept him so it's not it's not that oh there's not proof for God there's not evidence but it's really that we have a heart issue and that we're trying to you know have an excuse as to why we have this heart issue and instead of looking into ourselves we we look at God and blame God for our heart issue amen so if we look inside and if we we get right with God and we we study our heart and if we honestly examine ourselves we come to God humbly and with humility then he will reveal himself he reveals himself according to his word and not through the intellectualization of the world so it's not it's not going to be through you know being the smartest guy the smartest guy who who has the highest IQ and we'll get him up to preach because he clearly is going to know something more than we do but you know it's it's just the humility and the humbleness and it's not about your degrees or how smart you are or how how well studied you are but it's just about if if you were humble enough to allow God to dwell in you if you were humble enough to surrender completely to God and let him dwell in you and let him govern your life and and get rid of those things that you know you shouldn't be doing or that you know you shouldn't be there that that Grudge you're holding against somebody the attitude you have towards somebody just let that all go and if you're humble enough to accept that then God will show himself and prove himself in your life and and he he'll show you many works and that always it'll it'll confound the wise as the Bible says and a founding variable in science is something that just it just ruins the whole plan they just can't understand it it's this thing that you know if if you if you carry out a a scientific study with a confounding variable in it that study just it can't be it can't be recorded it can't be uh considered reliable but God puts those things in there and to confound the wise so that they don't understand it they think oh it just can't be done well if it's not the scientific method if it's not this if it's not that but God puts that in there and and to confound the wise but for the simple and the humble to understand it so he you conf confound things of the mighty you know people think someone who's Mighty is once again like Goliath is a great warrior and just very aggressive you can do what they want they don't have to listen to anybody but but what's mighty about God is that he's humble and even when he came he was so humble and even when people you know they were like oh the Messiah is going to come and he's going to come on like a chariot and he's going to lead us into battle and we're going to take the Holy Land back and he comes and he does doesn't he have a place to lay his head he comes as a you know his his uh Earthly you know father I guess was a Carpenter and he's just isn't that the son of Joseph like how is who was this guy and and they expect him to come in his Priestly robes and in his kingly robes and with a sword in hand ready to you know slice up the Romans but that's not how he came he just came humbly he just came so that anyone he could talk to anyone just came gently he came so that you know he could talk to a boy and mult and multiply that food for for you know a large amount of people he could do these simple Works in people's lives he could say get up and walk he didn't come so high and mighty that he couldn't just come down and talk to people and and people who were Sinners and and the way the Pharisees were they wouldn't even talk to those Sinners they like how how could you talk to these people and Jesus is like I'm I'm here for the sick people you know a doctor is here to for the sick people the doctor you're not going to see a doctor talking to only healthy people that's not what a doctor is for so in the way that you know we we try to interpret God's word sometimes but he interprets it by manifesting it so when those things are manifested that's how we know what God's will is it's not it's not for him to be H Mighty and boasty but it's for him to be humble and to come here and and to minister to us so that everyone can get it so that even people who aren't educated even people who who don't know the word completely even people who don't fully understand you know um I think uh brother Brown talks about how he didn't know how to pray so he just got the alphabet and just put it up and they said God you just make the words and and that type of and the fact and that God wouldn't look down upon that God wouldn't be so high above that and say well no you need to go to school and you need to get education so you can really know the big words and then you can write it down and then you can pray to me but God could just go to a child who just only knew the alphabet and can then just answer his prayer because he didn't know how to pray that God could just come down to us and where we were in all our lives and and where we were and and how how downtrodden and and and Unholy the things we did but he could just come to us and he wasn't he wasn't too proud he wasn't too Mighty he wasn't too high and above us to come to us so we need to walk and we need walk with that same humility so God bless you let the musicians [Applause] come
