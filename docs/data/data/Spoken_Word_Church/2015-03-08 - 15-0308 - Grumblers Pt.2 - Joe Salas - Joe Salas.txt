========================================

good morning good morning morning uh before we do anything let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for stay just help me today as I do the Sunday school class I'm like Moses I can't speak Lord but you you can speak through me and we pray for all the ones that are sick sister BL sick this morning and uh we pray for brother W and all he in other country so send the garden angel before him to clear any danger that's in his path and bring him home safe we ask all these things in Jesus name amen amen last time we were talking about um the grumblers complaining and um I'm not saying I hate to say but somebody complained that when they put the the DVD on on the car was crackling we were having problem with the the mic but the the camera was okay so we're going to kind of do a little bit of it so if I say something that I did last time maybe it didn't come in I I did listen to the C and it was crackling and they said it was cracking too so let's go to Exodus 2 we're going to do 13 to 14 Exodus 213- 14 and when he went out of the out the second day behold two men of the Hebrews stro together and he said to him that did the wrong where wherefor smile thou Thy Thy fellow and he said who made thee a prince and a judge over us and tend us to kill me as thou killest the Egyptian and Moses feared and said surely this thing is known I didn't talk about this last time but I think there was the first time that uh that uh the children Israel complained to Moses and uh brother BR said uh Moses tried to do it on his own but he was a complete failure right MH okay in the message uh why Christ speak brother said God had called Moses special call and when God calls a man and anoints him for a certain Duty he expects that man to carry that out to the L God doesn't want to give a man a commission and him he h around about it he wants him to go straight forward and do just exactly what his commissioned to do he said don't look to the right or to the left just move forward and the children of Israel had been in bondage for some 400 years but God had promised that he would visit them and God keeps every promise that he made he cannot lie he's God and the time had come for this visitation he said now Moses was being called for this purpose he was a man God trained him 80 years before he ever was able to use him 40 years in the palace and 40 years in the wilderness said God trained a man might a taken a 100 years for 40 minutes work God knows how to train what the schools had put in Moses 40 years it taken 40 years to get it out but one time in the presence of the anoint anointed one time the presence of the Bor birst he know know more about God than he had learned in the books in the 80 years of his life said God trained his man then anoints them gives them experience takes them through the riged training down through the Sands of burning punishment trying test it not only does he do that to His prophets but he does it to his children every son that cometh to God must be chasen and tried tested by his word see when the PIN came to the strong time when he faces dead are you able to stand there on the word of God say God said so that settles it and God called such a man and that man was Moses but Moses a great deal like us every time it come a place to something had to be done Moses called out oh Lord what must I do in this place now isn't that just like we do God blessed him and anointed him about his brother gave him a message and a Ministry that had not been on the earth since that day until that day and yet every time something taking place Moses run off to God with it Lord what must I do what must I do in this case God got kind of tired of it I believe said why are you crying to me speak to the people and go forward my if any time ever looked like they ought to retreat was then but God has no Retreat there's no place to retreating God go forward the doctor says it's cancer go forward if he says it's TV go forward if the devil says you can't give this up go forward your home say that you're going to be a fanatic go forward the church turns you out go forward there's no retreating back go forward speak and go forward speak what his word and go forward thou said the Lord and move on but the people then rebell said it had been better that we died in Egypt had been better that we had our Grace Mark than from the hyenas and vultures to pick our bones in the wilderness what did you bring us out here after they seen that God has approved Moses to be his servant and Moses Fred the people and the people FR to Moses and he said what would we do what must must we do and go forward was the answer now they said we are in the wilderness and armies of pharaohs approaching us their Camp just behind us but Moses knew to obey God Moses was called he and God then after Moses received his call he went out to Egypt then he's got to get the people to believe believe him now he was an anointed prophet of the Lord but the people didn't believe him though he he got proved it by signs and wonder that he did and because they didn't believe Moses as servant of the Lord then they fell in the wilderness and every one of them died that left Egypt not one of them was saved everyone died and perished besides Joshua and Caleb they started out because they murmur and complained against the Vindicated message of God had spoke in the Bible Moses was a signed post of the Deliverance of Israel according to God's word that TR that time Drew n God s Moses he was God like for that day I let this it was a great general of stone Stonewall Jackson who had been my favorite General since Joshua Stonewall Jackson was asked one time how can you stand with just a handful of men when the opposition is so great that's how he got his name stone wall he would not budge he knew not he knew no retreat what could we accredit a man like that to a man when the Yankees came down by the thousands and he stood there in a minority but they never moved him he stood like a ston wall all the rest of the rebels Army had retreated back Ryan come along and said what's the matter with Jackson why isn't he going he said he stands like a stone wall that's where he got his title the other GS asked him said Mr Jackson a little Bey fellow blackheaded and blue eye only was about 5 ft maybe like me I don't know five five point 2 Ines tall very modest mild speaky little fellow said Mr Jackson how can you stand in such a position bashful like he kicked his boot on the ground he said I never take a drink of water unless I thank the Lord for it do we do that that's where it is there's no retreating God speak and go forward that's right that's God's commission to his church we have no time to slap let's go to numbers 11 let's say 1 2 three I said that one last week I don't want to repeat too much 11 and when the people complain it displeased the Lord and said and the Lord heard it and his anger was kindled and the fire of the Lord burned among them and consumed them that were in the uttermost part of the camp and the people Cried unto Moses and when Moses prayed unto the Lord the fire was quenched and he called the name of the place T because the fire of the Lord burned among them in uh numbers uh 12 uh 1 to 15 uh we read the this this last week uh Aaron and Maran complain uh complain the most because of the E woman he married but I'm going read that cuz we that last last time let's go to numbers 20 1- 12 this one one of my favorite scriptures then came the children of Israel even the whole congregation into the desert of Canan in the first month and the people in Cades and Mar and died there and was buried there there was no water for for the congregation and they gathered themselves together against Moses and against Aaron and the people CH with Moses and spec saying when God that we had died when our Brethren died before the Lord and why have you brought us the congregation of the Lord into this Wilderness that we and our cattle should die there and where have you made us to come out of Egypt to bring us into this evil place it is no place of seed or figs or mines or pomegranates neither is there any water to drink and Moses and Aron went from the prison of the assembly unto the door of the Tabernacle the congregation they fell upon their faces and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them and the Lord spake unto Moses saying take the rod and gather the assembly together thou and Aaron th brother and speak ye unto the rock before the eyes and he shall give forth his water and I shall bring forth to them speak unto the rock not SM you know which the rock is Christ what are the rocks that thou shalt give the congregation their be drink and Moses took the rod from the before the Lord and as he commanded him and Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the Rock and he said unto them here now ye Rebels must we f you fet you water out of this rock and Moses lifted up his hand and with his Rod he smoke the rock twice he can only crucify Christ once so Moses broke the scriptures right there which caus them to going to the promis land and the water came out abundantly and the congregation drank and their Beast also and the the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron because you believe me not to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel therefore you shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given thee and the message as I was with Moses brother says uh no matter what Moses done it was Moses office that God respected he was a prophet he was above all the prophets he was really more than any Prophet they had he said when his own sister left at him for Mar and E theop girl he he called him to that he said don't you fear God said there be one among you who is spiritual or a prophet I will speak to him in a vision and make myself known to him in dreams but it's not so with Moses I speak le Li to ear with him don't you fear God see that's not a good thing to upon God's people you heard him when you do so God had commissioned Moses his failures meant nothing God know KNN his heart so even though whatever Moses did that was till God respected the office let's do uh Exodus 16 2230 Exodus 16:22 to30 and it came to pass that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread two arms for one man and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses and he said unto them this is that that which the Lord had said tomorrow is the rest of the holy Sabbath unto the Lord they that which you will beg today and seek that you should will s and that which remained overlay up for you to keep until the morning and they laid it upon they laid it till the morning as Moses bit and it did not stink neither was there any warm therein and Moses said eat to they for the today is the Sabbath unto the Lord today you should not find it in the field six days You Shall Gather but on the seventh day which is be seven and there be shall be none and it came to pass that there went out some people on the seventh day for together and they found none they still don't obey God they still didn't say what Moses says and the Lord said unto Moses how long refuse you to keep my Commandments see for the Lord had given you the Sabbath therefore he give it you on the sixth day the bread of two days let no man go out of his place on the seventh day so the people rested on the seventh day Exodus 17 1 one two seven and all the congregation of the children of Israel Journey from the Wilderness of s after their Journey according to the Commandment of the Lord and pitching what put all the hard names I can't pronounce and there was no water for the people to drink wherefore the people child with Moses and said give us water that we may drink and Moses said unto them why sh with me sh with me wherefore do you tempt the Lord and they people thirsted there for water and the people murmur against Moses and and said wherefore is this that thou has brought us up out of the Egypt to kill us and our children our cattle with thirst and Moses cried onto the Lord no wonder brother made that message why Christ speak c c and Moses Cried unto the Lord saying what shall I do unto these people they be almost ready to Stone me and the Lord said unto Moses go on before the people and take with thee of the Elders of Israel and thy rod where wherefore thou smartest the river take that in thy hand and go behold I will stand before thee there upon the rock in her and thou shal Smite The Rock and there shall come water out of it that the people may drink and Moses did show in the sight of the Elders of Israel and he called the name of the place Messiah and Mara because of the CH of the children of Israel and because they tempted the Lord saying is the Lord among us or not now this a scripture this is in The Spar book I'm going to read the whole thing so maybe
