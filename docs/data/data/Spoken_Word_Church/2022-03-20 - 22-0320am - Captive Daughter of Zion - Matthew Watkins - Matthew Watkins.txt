amen love how brother perry green says that if god was just going to die for one person and go to calvary he would have went just for me you believe that it's real faith amen god has shown his love that while we were yet sinners that means when we were at our worst and lowest he loved us so much at that moment he died for us you know what that tells me then that no that tells me that no matter where i've went from then no matter how low i could ever get his love is his is never changing as paul said nothing can separate me from that love hallelujah glory give him a handclap of praise hallelujah amen praise the lord isaiah chapter 52 if you have your bible we'll have you turn amen just to the word this morning isaiah chapter 52 want to say again thank you amen and brother samuel brother wade for having me here amen certainly just been a privilege to come and i trust that the lord spoke to you last night and i just believe that uh he has something for us this morning i'd like to just carry over from where we were last night we're just going to pick right up from where we left off we spoke a lot uh about samson and where sampson was and so we're just going to pick fred it from there i'd like to speak to you on the captive daughter of zion you're going to understand the title here in a moment the captive daughter of zion let's begin reading the first verse of isaiah chapter 52 awake awake put on thy strength o zion put on thy beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion for thus saith the lord you have sold yourselves for naught means nothing and you shall be redeemed without money amen let's just read that last one more time verse three for thus saith the lord you have sold yourself for nothing and you shall be redeemed without money amen if you have a need something upon your heart you just want to raise a hand to the lord and ask god to remember that need amen let's just bow our heads lord jesus we humble ourselves just now lord just bowing before you lord we've worshipped you we've we've sang these songs the musicians have played the people have gathered lord and we've just tried to create an atmosphere where that you could be welcome lord you said that you inhabit the praises of your people so lord i pray god that you would just continue in the worship lord as this part of ministering of your word is just part of the worship lord it's a continuation now god i pray that you'd come and take your word lord and may it divide us under both body soul and spirit may it cut lord beyond our emotions beyond our intellectual realm where we can reason and understand and rationalize lord let your word this morning move beyond that realm may it contact that realm lord where there's real faith lord to accept it so that it can produce what you've intended for it to produce in our life lord we ask for each need that's been raised before you i raise both my hands up lord with everyone here this morning asking god for your grace and your mercy lord to be a need meter lord i pray bless this church father as they continue to be a lighthouse lord in this part of your country lord in this nation lord we need churches that are alive filled with the spirit of god that where you can come and dwell and tabernacle lord and spread yourself lord through the lives of people lord i pray god that you would continue to bless the ministry hear lord god their prayers may they be answered may the sick be healed lord may captives be set free lord i pray god that you bless us here now this morning as we've just gathered here to hear from you now i pray god you'd come and speak to us lord we pray in jesus name amen you can be seated it's amazing when you read brother branham's sermons the series that he takes on just once more lord and he uses samson and the story of samson that we spoke on last night and we talked a lot about his life and the the condition of the choices that he had made for those of you that weren't here we went through some parts of his story there that we find in the book of judges and we showed how that his decisions and choices had led him to a condition where he's blind and he can't see and his eyes are put out and he's bound with fetters of brass and and he's being led by a child and now he's the scorn in the mockery of the philistines and it's incredible because the very thing that god anointed him and ordained him to destroy was now now he was held captive to and he had been completely destroyed by it's incredible though when you sort of take that and you put the lens of of the message on it and brother brandon preaches that from the perspective of samson being a type of the modern church and he speaks about how that blindness that had came upon samson had came upon the church world and how that we said last night that samson was blind long before they put his eyes out uh his decisions that he had made you could tell that he had no spiritual he'd lost all spiritual discernment he not only forgot who god was but he forgot who he was he forgot his place in the word and what his purpose was to serve and the prophet of god begins to say that these just like the modern church today uh that that once stood in its glory and was commissioned to be a lighthouse and it was commissioned to uh to to destroy the kingdom of the enemy but now brother branham says now that church is laying the lap of delilah has flirted with with sin and and and she stands there blind and she's lost her eyesight and we know that eyesight is a type of a prophet an eyesight is that the seven eyes of god in the book of revelations that go to and fro uh in the entire earth uh is a is a is a as an exact meaning of what a prophet messenger brings it brings eyesight so that you can look at the same things that churches have looked at for uh hundreds of years and you you you look at the same book and the same words and the same bible that they look at but you have prophetic vision and you can look beyond what the paper what the ink on the paper says and you understand the mind of the writer and you understand the spirit of the author uh that's why this message is not just letter it's not intellect and it's not just it didn't come just to give us greater understanding or theology than the baptist church it didn't come to give us greater understanding of the mysteries we know the mysteries we understand the mysteries thank god thank the lord for eyesight in this generation thank god i know what the who the beast is thank god i know who the false prophet is thank the lord i'm not deceived and i'm not going to be a deceived church by the world thank god i know what happened in the in the beginning that it wasn't an apple that evade thank god i know who the white horse writer that it wasn't christ thank the lord for the mysteries that god has revealed but let me just stop and say for a minute the the the understanding of the mysteries was not the purpose or the intent of god sending a message but brother burnham says that it would be those divinely revealed truths that would literally turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers not welch and not daddy seymour not azusa street not 1907 but 1906 but uh but but the first church after the bible says as peter gave the inaugural message repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost the prophet says that's the original message that's what we're fighting for but samson had had had lost his eyesight and the prophet says very much like that the church is now on the lap of delilah and he says she's lost her vision she's bound by fetters of brass isaiah chapter 52 just hold your place there it's incredible because very much like this daughter of zionist speaking of literal a literal israel and and literally it speaks of israel not just past but present and future and what god's going to do but it also zion speaks of also not just natural but spiritual israel the church and we believe that we are that spiritual church you believe that this morning i want you to notice some of the words here and just read it with me in isaiah chapter 52 as a minister and on the captive daughter of zion let's just read here in isaiah 52 and let's start at verse 1 awake awake he repeats this here put on thy strength o zion put on your beautiful garments o jerusalem the holy city father you're uncircumcised and unclean shall no longer come to you shake yourself so here's what isaiah begins to say is this is this this this sad condition that she finds herself in of what the church had become and you can type this to the life of a believer you can type it to an individual you could type it to the nation of israel but notice here that it's the daughter of zion who was once a pure beautiful woman she wasn't defiled she wasn't she wasn't uh polluted but she was she she was a pure daughter of zion who gave birth to sons and and now she's laying like a slave she's laying like a slave bound you know that you can become a slave after you can become bound after christ sets you free what did paul say and i think it's in galatians 5 when he says stand fast in the liberty wherewith christ has made you free and be not entangled again with the yoke of bondage you see it's never the lord that rebinds you and puts change but we are quick to find the change that god has set us free from in our life and just like that this daughter that was once free and once clean and once beautiful and now she's laying in the dust she's groveling in the dirt like a slave and she's she's filthy her garment is not a beautiful garment now it's torn and she's she's she's laying there in the dust and and and she's she's clutching and howling and and and she's praying for for deliverance she's praying for freedom she's praying that god would come and change her circumstances and the bible says she's got a chain around her neck and she's clutching at this chain that's choking her and she wants free and she doesn't want to die like this in a sleigh as a slave and and and bound and and she's she's in isaiah 51 18 the bible speaks of this that she wants to be free she doesn't want to die that way and now even worse her enemies the philistines are mocking her and laughing at her and blaspheming jehovah taunting her that god had no power to set her free and so now now what happens for her is that now she's the bible says she's fainted she's she's collapsed she's laying there and and she's in this terrible condition let's just pick it up here in isaiah 52 and let's read it here in verse 2 shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down o jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck o captive daughter of zion for thus saith the lord you have sold yourself you cannot sell god cannot sell what he has purchased but you can sell self and some people sell themselves to a career and that's all that inundates them and that intoxicates them like a drug alcohol does the same thing but i'm going to tell you money has the same power that alcohol does and they become chasing a dream chasing a a trace chasing a story chasing the hype but as we spoke on last night you have a vision that you have an ambitions that you have in dreams that you have but then there's the blueprints that god has already drawn before you ever step foot on the earth and your life will be made up of the struggle between self-will of wanting what you want and chasing what you want and then surrendering to what the lord really wants and some people have given up that struggle a long time ago others are still fighting that same battle and that same struggle and it's incredible because you see here this condition she's in but i want you to notice here as the bible says you've sown yourself you've sown yourself for nothing no no no this didn't just happen to you in other words this isn't this isn't like joseph where he's tricked by his brothers and he's sold into slavery this isn't this isn't like uh you know a man who's been entrapped by the devil and and he's just fallen into bad circumstances but the but the the isaiah makes it clear he says no this is you've done this yourself you've given yourself to this you've given yourself you've became a slave uh you've now you now you're now you're laying there and you're you're groveling in the dirt you've sold yourself for not verse three says which means nothing you've sown yourself for nothing and so you see here what is what is isaiah really speaking about here and i want you to notice this because to me it's so powerful what the lord uh says to her as as we go through some of this i just want you to listen as i'm as i'm gonna quote you some scriptures you could turn there in isaiah 49 actually let's let's turn there as isaiah 49 and we'll just read a very familiar verse in chapter 49 verse 14 of isaiah notice he says awake awake put on your strength now these are the loving words of a heavenly father i want you to remember something as you read this this is not the daughter of jezebel this is the daughter of zion and now you have not this not you don't now you have here the kind words of how the father speaks to his daughter and he says awake put on your strength awake awake she's laying there she's in the dust she's groveling she doesn't know she's there and the and the bible says she's laying there clutching this chain and here's the words of the lord awake in other words wake up wake up child wake up wake up i i gotta get you to wake up right now you gotta you gotta wake up awake shake yourself this is what the lord does through the preaching of the word because god knows whether you know what's inside of you god knows what he put there and you may feel like you're a million miles from the lord this morning but god knows the seed he put inside of there and so what does he do he doesn't speak to your failures and your faults and your mistakes he speaks to the seed that's laying down inside of you because the potential is inside of the seed and so the word the preaching of the word comes and it starts to say wake up wake up you're not a child of the devil you're a child of god wake up don't be a slave you god has set you free and so god comes with encouragement he's speaking to the potential down inside of that girl and he says wake up put on your strength there's no rebuke now she sold herself she's enslaved she sold herself to this but you notice there's no rebuke from the lord i love this so much because it tells you so much about your heavenly father awake put on your strength no rebuke and there's also no retraction of promises there's no well the object is going to give up on you and you've just you've sinned it away and i'm just going to find someone else there's no no the lord's still there his mercy is still there he's not forgotten you know one thing people might abandon you but the lord will never abandon you never abandon you i want to take that thought just here for a moment notice isaiah chapter 49 verse 14 very familiar let's read it can a woman forget her suckling child isaiah 49 verse 14 that she should not have compassion on the son of her womb yay yes can a woman you say my goodness can a woman forget yeah mother can forget thank god for good mothers thank god for loving mothers but a mother a human mother in bad circumstance wrong circumstance gibbs could give up that child can a woman forget this is jehovah speaking and he says yeah they may forget yet will i not forget thee behold i have graven thee upon the palms of my hands and he says thy walls are continually before me this is the lord speaking here they may forget i'll never forget and he says behold i've graven you on the palm of my hands thy walls are continually before me it's amazing how quickly we isolate ourselves through besetting sins or sins in our life and we isolate ourselves from the family of god from the house of god from the lord himself and god god says they're so amazing because he says he says he says thy walls are continually before me thy walls this word in the hebrew is the word shoma and i wish i had it for the screen to show you the meaning of what this word it literally means when he says thy walls are continually before me it means to be joined to a wall to be joined to a wall like a brick mason would lay a wall a block mason would lay a wall and he takes one block and then he lays it on another and puts grout over that and then he lays that and puts grout over then he lays another and it's the blocks are interlocking one block on the other upon the other upon the other upon the other and god is saying this is how this is how this is how joined how intricately intricately woven i am into the fabric of your heart thy walls are continually before me like being joined to a wall what wall is he speaking of a prison wall you see you see that when the lord of what the lord is saying is that when you're bound i'm bound when you're hurt i'm hurt when you're sick i'm sick let me give you the words of new testament language he's a high priest who can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities thy walls are continually god is telling this is what this is what the lord said it's going to become so important in a minute when you realize the covenant or the promise that god gives his children he can be touched by the feelings of your infirmities i want you to look at the life of this man as we turn a corner here in genesis 28 turn quickly there to genesis 28 look at this man jacob you love him don't you love his word it's real it's real to me my goodness genesis chapter 28 and i just want you to look and i'm going to just be choosing what i read and what i skip just to save time but i want you to notice here the life of this man as we just read here in isaiah god is saying i can't forget you and and your walls are continually before me and and and and and we we realize that means to be joined together that means i'm intricately intricately laced i'm i'm woven in your walls are always before me i can't forget that's why god says i can't forget you i'll never forget you and notice this man jacob here as we look at his life just for a moment we spoke about samson now let's look at another character here and i want you just to begin reading at verse 15. he says here in verse 15 actually let's back up from there let me just make sure i find my make sure i'm catching the right thing here as the bible says here and god gives him a promise let's read this promise uh first let's start with verse 11. and he lighted upon a certain place and teared there all night because the sun was set and he took off the st took off of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and laid down in his place to sleep in that place to sleep and he dreamed and behold a ladder set upon the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of god ascending and descending on it and behold the lord stood above it and said i am the lord god of abraham thy father and the god of isaac the land wherein thou liest notice this here to thee will i give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and shall spread abroad to the west let's move on down to verse 15. and behold i am with thee that's a powerful thing when you read that it's a powerful thing when god joins himself to a life and i want you to understand how powerful because this is going to be something that's going to mean something to you this morning i want you to understand how powerful of a word that god a promise that god dismay joke jacob behold i am with thee and will keep thee in all the right turns all the left turns all the u-turns all the wrong ways i'll be with you in all of the places jacob you're going to go a lot of places i didn't tell you to go you're going to take a lot of turns i never told you to take you're going to make a lot of wrong choices but jacob i want you to know how sure my promise is when i say go left and you go right i'm going right too i'll be with you this is the promise of the covenant that god makes i'll be with you in all the places whether thou goest and will bring thee again into this land for i will not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken to thee of notice how powerful of a promise this is that he gives him i'll be with thee no matter where you go jacob wherever thou goest i'm gonna go i'll not leave thee until i have done that which i have spoken so what was god doing i want you to catch this god was joining himself he was attaching himself to this son god was joining himself and he makes he makes a pledge and says he says i'm going to make a promise to you jacob i'm never going to leave you i'm never going to forsake you i'm going to stay right beside you and the bible says jacob woke up out of his sleep and he says oh the lord how how how awesome let's read it here the bible says and he woke out of his sleep and said surely the lord verse 16 is in this place and i knew it not and he was afraid and said how dreadful that word dreadful actually means awesome in our english word how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of god and this is the gate of heaven and jacob rose up early in the morning and he takes the stone that he had put for his pillows and he set it up for a pillar and he pours oil over the top of it jacob just doesn't know what to do he's beside himself he wakes up out of this dream and here's the lord and there's a ladder going up and down that man there's angels descending and ascending and god is over the top of it and what's god showing jacob i'm always busy at work jacob whether you see me or you feel me or you hear me or you feel that i'm moving just know this jacob in your life i've made a promise and there's angels that are descending and ascending on your behalf when you're struggling and you're praying and you're thinking did god just forgive me and what about my children and i'm continuing to pray let me give you let me break your eyes open to a vision if you're discouraged there's angels that are ascending and descending over your life and god is always busy at work in your life whether you feel him or see him he never stops it's a promise and jacob wakes up and he's he's beside himself and he's he's just trying to do anything he doesn't know what to do and surely the lord was in this place and i knew it not and and so he takes the stone and he's laid on the stone and he takes the stone and he picks it up and he's he's putting stone over stone he says okay this is this is where my head was this is where i was sleeping him and i want and i'm going to take the stone and then jacob says i got i got to consecrate this place this is a special place the lord met me and so he takes the oil and he doesn't know he's not being told to do this by the lord he's not been given and kind of the lord didn't say this in the dream but jacob is trying to do something in a human way to represent what happened in a spiritual way and oftentimes friends we do things physically and we wonder why because a lot of times what you do physically naturally god recognizes and notices in another dimension somewhere because little does jacob know when he's taking those stones and he's building that altar and he's pouring oil over the top of it god is watching and we're going to find out in a minute god notices what jacob does right there and jacob's pouring oil and he's saying oh the lord was in this place and i didn't even know it and oh my i just gotta i gotta make a memorial out of this and and the lord is watching and jacob takes the stone and he pours the oil and and he says this is he was afraid and said how dreadful and and verse 19 and he called the name of the place bethel he called the name of the place so he names it he gives it oil he he marks that spot he marks that spot and says the lord had done something for me right here how awesome is this place this is none other than the house of god and he names it bethel you think my what a powerful experience now my the lord is just with him he's made this powerful promise and he's got this consecration and what a miraculous thing do you know what happens directly you know you know you say what happens after that brother matt what have what what is his life story surely it starts taking a course towards the lord no no somehow some way 20 long years the bible calls it 20 years you know it's amazing the bible speaks in time because we relate to things literally like in a time line and we understand our life by where we were yesterday where we're going to be in 10 years and where we were look at pictures and you look at your family when their children were small and it brings an emotion upon you then you think of where life and you look at the you look at your parents and they're getting older and you understand all of this because we're creatures of time and that's how we relate to everything you know the lord relates to time also he looks at time completely different than the way that you look at time but 20 long years passing jacob's life after this experience and he creates this altar and he calls it bethel and he's lo he's pouring anointing oil on it 20 long years years of a lot of sorrow years of a lot of trial years of a lot of turbulence years of a lot of disobedience but you know what the lord was with him every year every month every hour every moment because he made a promise i'm joining myself to you jacob after bethel after that experience he leaves and he settles down and and he's and he's a quickly it's amazing how quickly he forgets the glory and the all and the wonder as the prophet says about the ephesian age he says eventually the glory left the wonder of their message left and they had forgotten that's why god brother branham says remember and recall you remember that in ephesian church age remember and recall your former your former experience and how quickly we go from one mountaintop and one glorified glory filled experience and how quickly we move from that then we descend down and back into our own carnal ways and carnal nature and jacob goes from there and he settles down and and he and he leaves bethel and he forgets about all that he becomes lustful and cold and backslidden and carnal and he's away from the lord and and so god speaks to him again i want you to notice after 20 years the lord speaks in verse chapter 31 let's look at chapter 31 here just just quickly turn there god speaks to jacob again and he comes back to him after all of these years of of backsliding notice what god says to jacob chapter 31 verse 13 i am the god of bethel where thou anointest the pillar aha so what jacob thought he was just doing and everybody might have said oh he was just being emotional oh he just got worked up and he got all emotional well you know sometimes when you get all worked up and you get emotional you might get criticized but god takes notice and he watches and he says you know jacob remember where you anointed the pillar and where you poured oil over top of it i'm that god i'm the god of that experience i'm not the god of all of this carnality i'm not the god of this coldness in this lukewarmness i'm the god of bethel jacob where you vow to vow now here's the message of the lord now arise like he said to that daughter of zion awake arise put on your strength what are you doing arise get thee out from this land and return unto the land of thy kindred this is my promise to you jacob he's in the apathy he's completely settled and he's backslidden and the lord appears and says i'm the god of bethel jacob come back to bethel you've got to go back to where you were i you vowed a vow you anointed a pillar it was a powerful experience jacob and god had made a promise this is what god was saying remember how i touched you remember how i spoke to you i came to you in a dream and i gave you a vision remember jacob go back to bethel the word of the lord hadn't changed in jacob's life god was saying i'm going to be with you no matter where you go jacob no matter where you go i'm going to be right beside you all the time jacob i'm never going to depart my promise is still going to be the same i'm not going to change it jacob i'm going to still tell you the same exact thing i'm going to keep repeating it jacob because i've made a promise to you i'll never leave you i'm joined unto you i'll be with you in all the places where you go you may not go where i tell you to go your life may have took a wrong turn somewhere you may have made a u-turn and god didn't tell you to make that u-turn and you made choices and you made decisions and now you're looking around going oh i got myself into a mess but here's the promise of god i'm still right there my promise is still just the same i'll never leave you i never i want you to get this through your mind to know how sure the promise of god is i'll never give up on you you might give up on yourself people might give up on you and count you off and count you out but here's how sure my promise is i'm never gonna leave jacob i'm never gonna stop preaching to you jacob i'm never going to stop telling you jacob i'm going to say the same thing and the same thing you say lord what about i took the wrong turn i made the wrong choice my life is a mess i'm going to keep preaching to you i'm going to keep encouraging you i'm going to keep lifting your faith up you say lord but i'm so far away i've taken so many wrong turns my promise i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i'll bring you back to the place that i promised you oh friends you ought to get that through your mind you may give up on god he'll never give up on you you say is he going to quit he'll never quit on you he's not going to quit on your children he's going to keep preaching he's going to keep telling you he's going to keep sending an anointing upon you to say wake up awake shake yourself from the dust because i know what i put inside of you jacob and i'm going to keep preaching to that life that i put down and it may have been covered over by all kinds of years of complexes that may have been covered over and it may be built over with layers upon layers upon layers of of sorrow and layers of trials and layers of reasons but i'm just going to keep on and i'm gonna keep on you know that's one thing about the lord he's steady he never stops he's consistent he just keeps on and he keeps on and he keeps on jacob come back to bethel you think lord finally you got a hold of jacob finally he got his attention surely jacob's going to shake himself no what happens after genesis 31 13 when god says come back to bethel god says go left jacob says yes lord yeah not yet lord and the bible says he goes instead to a land of shechem genesis 33 turn there if you could he goes instead to sheck him and the bible says i want you just to follow along with me i'll wait for you to get to it here he settles down in a place called shechem in hebrew the city has a meaning the name meaning the meaning of shechem means going back not going back to bethel backsliding it also means a place of burden a place of burden do you know that any time you disobey what the lord tells you i can tell you where you're headed you're headed to a place of burdens heavy burdens and jacob you're going to find out shechem is not the checkup is not the the the the hollywood picture that you think it is the hollywood painting and it's so pleasurable and so wonderful and there's just so much joy there no you're gonna find out when you get there jacob the world has nothing to offer you its temporary pleasures will leave you busted broke depressed complexed empty and full of burdens why didn't you go back to bethel jacob where are you going jacob the lord told you to go back he's revealed he's appeared to you he hears his word go back to bethel jacob and some something inside of him you know the problem is is that jacob is being jacob and until jacob receives a name change and stops being jacob he's going to continue to be jacob he's going to continue to be jacob he's going to continue to fill out to fulfill out what jacob wants it's incredible because you notice people so often want free of problems that sin causes speaking and counseling to a man here just the other day and his wife was ready to leave him and he was he was he was caught in a sin that he just continually goes back to and his wife is ready he's not not even a believer of the message and i'm counseling him he's the he's the son of a pastor in our local city of a a denominational church and and he's here he's 38 years old he's married has children and and he's why his life is just broke he's ready just he's tried everything and he came into the office he said i've tried everything i've i've tried everything the church told me i tried a psychologist i i looked i i've tried i've tried every kind of thing that i can and i just can't be free of this and he says it's destroying me it's destroying my life and and and he says it's destroying my marriage and now there's already separation my wife's a christian woman and here this man's been in church his entire life heard the word heard his dad preach his entire life heard the pastor preach his entire life and and he knows the bible and he's saying i've tried everything i've i've i've i've tried he said here you're the last resort his mother had contacted us because i prayed for the man the associate pastor at stage four hopkins lymphoma and we prayed we prayed for that man laid it laid our hands upon him and prayed for that and spent time two or three hours in his living room just witnessing to him and talking to him and speaking to him and testifying about cancer and sister elena butts in mind in louisiana showed the pet scan of sister elena as just they had just showed me his pet scan and he's full of cancer and the doctors have given up on him and given him any hope and and pretty much told him you know it's there's really nothing we can do and he shows the ped skin his wife shows me the pet scan i said let me show you a pet scam i showed him sister elena's pet's gonna look just like he's full of cancer i said you know what but what what the lord did to that sister i said there's a woman that i family that i know in louisiana and i said and and and you know she was diagnosed with stage four hopkins lymphoma just like you were beginning to tetanus testified a human witness to him and you could just feel the atmosphere in his living room change and i began to speak to him about what cancer is really i was just going through what brother branham taught us and what is cancer and healing if you have that book and i started to tell him you know doctors treat the that tumor that's on your neck is just a body what you have to understand is that there's a life that's living behind that tumor it's a spirit of cancer diseases that names cancer is just a name that science has given to a spirit but there's a life behind that cancer and the prophet says there's a life living off your life sucking the life sucking like a bloodsucker sucking the life out of you and the prophet says now when i pray for you and i told this man i said when i pray for you i said i'm not gonna speak to the physical cancer that we see visibly that's what the doctor's for thank god for doctors thank god for surgeons thank god thank god for medicine i said that's what the doctor does the doctor has a bag and inside that bag are tools that he uses and if he brother brandon said if he could take that knife and scrape out all that cancer then good i said but i've got a different tool bag i've got a bag but there's different tools inside of it and and i said when i pray for you i'm not going to speak to the physical i said but i'm going to speak as jesus spoke in mark chapter 9 a deaf man came to and dumb man came to jesus and the bible says that jesus spoke to the foul spirit and jesus said thou deaf and dumb spirit he didn't say deaf and dumb disease he said deaf and dumb spirit he spoke to the life that was hiding behind the name and then brother adam says what is he going to do so i said when i pray for you i'm going to speak to the spirit that's living there i just testified we witnessed had a wonderful time had a wonderful time in prayer believing the lord's touched this man and they were so moved by the things that that we said there his mom the the the wife contacted and said i've got a son is at the end of his marriage and he's got a spirit they actually got on sunday morning and i was preaching on demon demonic spirits and the and the how that we're commissioned and with the churches ordained to cast out demon spirits and i was preaching on that and they actually streamed our entire service and said i've got a son can he come to you i want you to pray so here i am sitting with this man and he's he's at the end and he's saying i can't i've tried everything i've i've tried self-help i've tried i've tried tried to get rid of it and i just keep coming back to this and he said and i heard a voice speak to me and say oh you thought you had me but i've got you and he said and so i begin to just to deal with this man and i said you know i said it's repentance is so amazing because true repentance is not a prayer that you can pray right now true repentance is not oh i'm sorry true repentance is not i got called i'm sorry true repentance is not i'm sick of this what sin is causing that's not repentance and i said you have to be so careful because as jesus came to the man at the pull of bethesda and the bible says he's an invalid for 38 years he's laying there in his mat and jesus walks right up to him and you notice i said it was sin that had put him there how do you know because after jesus prays he says go in sin no more so sin had created bad circumstances in his life sin had created back pain sin had created neck pain joint pain sin had created a life that was laying on a mat at a bed on a bed in front of a pool and here this man is groveling in his pain and groveling in his torment and jesus comes right up to him and i said you notice jesus doesn't kneel down and say man buddy wow oh oh you got to be in so much pain oh my goodness it's got to hurt you so bad maybe i can help that you won't you want help does that hurt you as your back hurt you i said jesus never did any of that he never came to the man and said oh man your life man it's just it just i know it's got to be painful your wife's leaving you and your home's a wreck and and you've lost your job and you know he never comes the alcoholic i said i said listen josh i said the alcoholic he hates he hates what alcohol does to his life he hates that it destroys his marriage he hates that it destroys his job he loses his license he's driving a moped he hates it he hates it and i said this man hated what sin had caused but there's a very big difference between hating what sin causes and hating sin and true repentance is not when you say i just want free of all that sin has caused me no true repentance is when you say i hate the sin and i want holiness and i want righteousness and i want the spirit and the life of god to take the place of this carnal nature and i said here you are at the end of your rope and your house is on fire of course you want help i said but really where's your real repentance are you sick and tired do you hate the sin or you just hate the results of what sin is bringing because sin will wreck your life disobedience will wreck and ruin your children and your family and your atmosphere and your relationships it'll lead you to places of great burdens jesus is here to set you free if you want to be free of those burdens i said he said to the man he did he says will you be made whole the man starts all well every year you know the angel comes and i try to have no man to pick me up and to carry me in and to put me into the water and every single year and and jesus just listens and you know what it's amazing is after the man repeat tells his entire sob story jesus just ignores what he said and then he just repeats himself will you be made whole in other words i want to know you got to be you could never be honest with the lord until you're honest with yourself will you be made whole do you want to be free not of problems because problems aren't going to go away in fact your trouble begins when you come to serve the lord that's when real trials start that's when the real struggle begins but i want to know do you hate the sin will you be made whole and jacob learns through all this disobedience he comes to a place of burdens because he's jacob and shechem he's going to get into all kinds of trouble you notice he settles down and check him and and it's just a place of burden come back to bethel he hears the word of the lord come back to bethel jacob go back to your your altar where you anointed the stones go back jacob jacob decides i'm just going to settle over here and you know what happens his entire house is defiled his daughter's raped his son commits murder to save his sister you say my goodness that's horrible yeah a lot of collateral damage you know what carnage carnage is what the devil wants for your life carnage just complete utter destruction and he'll sell it in the most prettiest package he can to you but he wants to destroy you say well i'm all right i'm i'm still okay i'm not a drug addict and i'm not i'm i don't do drugs and i don't you know i don't i don't even drink alcohol and i don't smoke i'm a healthy person i run every day and you know what you know what the devil if can't get you there the devil will destroy your mind he'll give you such a perverted spirit and a perverted mind to where you don't even desire the things of god you have no desire for it but the lord says i come that you might have life and that you might have it more abundantly i desire that you prosper and be in health even as your soul prospereth what a horrible story jacob all because of disobedience to the lord you know what's so amazing to me about the story is that if i was the father and this was my son and i'm looking at this from a natural perspective how quickly each one of us how quickly if we were to play the role of god if we were to sit jacob down and we read his story we read now his daughter's raped and his son's a murderer and there's this carnage you know what we would do we would say oh my goodness jacob you sorry rascal my goodness look at what you've caused god should have given up on you a long time ago how he ever even seen anything in you i have no idea you've made a mess you've made a mess it's so amazing how different the lord treats people and how god's children treat each other oh man it's the truth anyways so incredible how quickly we are to judge and to cast judgment and cast stones and destroy people who are already struggling and we think our christian duty is just to stomp them down when they're already down it's so amazing how differently the lord handles disobedient children and how we handle disobedient help us lord so amazing if you could say to jacob jacob what are you doing you've had chance after chance after chance you become impatient and i'm so impatient with you jacob what's it going to take you know what's so amazing about jacob's heavenly father notice here jacob the lord says in genesis 35 turn there with me genesis 35 i want you to notice what the lord says to jacob and god said unto jacob what a mess you've made look at you jacob you destroyed and ruined everything look at your kids look at your family jacob no no the lord doesn't say any of that in fact the lord doesn't even mention it you know what the lord gives jacob the word the same thing he's been saying over and over and over and over and over and over arise go up to bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto god that appeared unto thee when thou fled us from the face of esau thy brother arise go back to bethel jacob lord but i made such a go back to bethel jacob but i could never go back to bethel jacob but look at the mess jacob just go back go back to bethel jacob i'm not even going to mention it you already have enough guilt you know where you're at you know what you've done now i'm speaking to that seed arise arise oh daughter of zion notice there's no rebuke there's no rebuke to this daughter there's no word of chastisement here she is laying there groveling in the dust choking choking and grabbing the the the the chain that was about her neck and notice he says here he says awake arise isaiah 52 arrives put on your beautiful garment daughter shake yourself no chastisement no rebuke no condemnation just the message just the word get up jacob get up daughter that's not you that's not who you are that's not who i'm in you know that deep down inside as we spoke last night you know you're not a creature of satan's eden you could never fit in you could never be satisfied by what the world has to offer you wake up jacob wake up daughter wake up oh captive daughter awake and he says shake and put on your strength you know what that word strength isaiah 52 you know what this word means let's look at it here in verse 2 shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down on jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck oh captive daughter of zion this word strength put on your this is isaiah i'm sorry brother isaiah chapter 52. put on your strength put it on he speaks of it like it's a garment he speaks like it's a cloak like it's like it's a robe because it is what's god saying he says but take away your your dirty garments verse 2 he says shake thyself from the dust arise and sit down on jerusalem loose thyself from the bands of thy neck oh captive daughter of zion awake put on your strength do you know what this word means for strength when he says this look at there in verse three go to the next verse my brother for that said lord you have sowed yourself for not you shall be redeemed without money put on your strength oh daughter of zion put on your i love this put on your beautiful garment do you know what that word strength means in the bible it's the hebrew word oe if i'm saying that correctly it's the hebrew word oe and it means self boldness it means self boldness put on your strength put on your verse one put on your beautiful garment he says awake awake put on your strength you're only put on your self i love this what is god saying here this is this is the same as he would say like a lion that is laying down god is literally saying shake your mane shake your line you may feel weak but down inside of you i put a strength i deposited something inside of you oh captive daughter put on your strength your inner strength that that you may not feel like it's there oh but it's there i deposited it down inside of you put on your strength put on your beautiful garments rise wait lord i need deliverance i i need you to come and sit no the god says loose yourself is that what verse 2 says loose yourself wait a minute you mean no one's coming to rescue me you mean no one's coming to pick me up you know so many times we wait and say oh you know i'll serve the lord when this happens and you know when this thing over here and you know sometimes people can get in such a rut and they can get in such a ditch spiritually and they're waiting for some fantastic they're waiting for some miraculous they're waiting for some meeting or some great preacher or some great prayer and then some feeling something that they feel i know when i found out just break me in god says loose yourself from the band that you put upon your neck it's inside of you child whether you feel it or not i put it there you mean no one's coming brother mad and you know sometimes we make things so so ethereal and unreachable and untouchable as sons and daughters of god when god says it's as easy as you standing up and saying i'm free i want free and so i'm free and i'm walking away from it oh i gotta have some kind of prayer and i gotta be in some kind of parallel well maybe maybe god's maybe maybe the lord's gonna do that for you but you know what the lord is saying to you just shake yourself from the dust stand up get up get out of the dust wait i'm down and she's down and she's groveling and she's laying there clutching about there closing about her neck and god says stand up child get up stand up child stand up wait lord i i gotta have some kind of miracle and the man in bethesda every year there's a man who never picks me up god's saying well if you want to be made whole you're whole right now remember brother man i'm in the prayer line when the woman's there and she's crying for her and she's saying lord uh i just think she's really confessing oh i'm just so far away from the lord i've just sinned so much and she's she's telling brother man in her entire life and and she comes up through the prayer line and you can hear her and she's crying and she's oh oh my life is just so far brother brandon i've just i've drifted just so i've just drifted so far and i'm so far away and she says now he says now sister now he says you want to come back to the lord yes brother bran am i i just want to come on now you just want your life to be restored and you want to come back to the lord yes brother bran and mary there and says okay sister you're back and you can hear i'm at your back right there all it was was a desire the enemy was exposed and there's freedom here right now all you got to do is stand up and accept it say i'm loosing myself from the bonds that i put myself under hallelujah ain't got to make it some long drawn out dragged out knocked down fight you want it it's here say brother matt what is it take true repentance true repentance awaken shake put on your strength jacob you know what jacob does after that genesis chapter 35 god said arise go up to bethel notice here in genesis 35 if you could put it on the screen brother verse 1 god said unto jacob arise go up to bethel go back to the first place and dwell live there settle there don't leave there because i'm the god of bethel i'll never leave you jacob i'll never i'll never depart from you i've joined myself to you and just like god joined himself to sampson and he said i'm going to make him a promise it's going to last from his birth all the way to his death all the way till he breathes his last breath my promise is still right beside you my promise is how far away is it it's right beside you sampson all you ever had to do was surrender to what god wanted to do in your life but what if samson did make the wrong choice the bad decision wrong choice bad decision wrong choice bad decision heard the voice of the lord kept going the other way heard the voice of god you say brother man did god ever finally one day just give up on him say you know what you know what sampson i'm just you know i'm just i'm retracting everything just forget it forget i even ask you samson he said that to jacob oh just you know what jacob i'm i've given you so many opportunities i've given you so many chances here you are again you know what jacob just man just never mind sorry i even asked you jacob sorry i even asked you just i've told you time and time again but you know what if that's how you're gonna if that if that's what you're gonna oh no the lord never says that to him you see the lord will never give up i know i've said it i'm going to say it again he'll never quit he'll never stop he'll never give up he'll keep chasing you you might keep running but he'll keep following he'll stay right beside you just like you did think of thomas here thomas was down and here there's the risen lord and then there's all the disciples and they're rejoicing and they're shouting thomas says no unless i touch his hands what did thomas need any physical proof unless i touch his hands i won't even believe and in walks the lord jesus and you know what jesus is hugging peter and hugging all of his brothers hugging all his brethren all oh lord oh lord you know the bible doesn't say that as he's hugging you know peter he he sort of peers over thomas thomas i couldn't believe you couldn't believe unless you seen me huh you know the lord never does that to doubting thomas and the lord never does that to doubting people he never gives up you know what jesus does jesus walks over to thomas and he reaches out his hand and he says here you go thomas you want to touch my hands you want to feel that they're real you know why because brother branham said it this way when the woman asked he said brother brother branham the book of james says if they lay their hand upon the sick they will recover but you know the real genuine real gentile faith is just to accept it and believe it brother branham says but now remember remember he says yes that's true sister he says but remember i love this god will meet you at whatever level of faith you give him he'll come no matter how low he's got to go hallelujah he'll meet you at whatever little bit of faith that you can give him he didn't give up on thomas he didn't push thomas to the side he said you down thomas that's okay you know why it's okay because you're still my son and i made you that way thomas and so i'm going to give you physical literal proof because you need it for yourself people might have gave up on you thomas everyone else might have just pushed you to the side but here's my hands thomas reach out and touch them you know you say brother matt why because god is a kind loving heavenly father no matter how he's been portrayed and pictured to you maybe through a false understanding or maybe through a dad who didn't love you or a mother who didn't love you and you know sometimes children understand god's love by their parents love and sometimes that's a good thing other times it's not a good thing but let me just say he's a father to the fatherless he's a mother to the motherless he'll love you and never walk out on you he'll never abandon you he'll never stop chasing you he'll steep still coming out keep coming after you he says jacob until i've brought you into the place that i have seen before the foundation of the world jacob i'm going to keep working in your life say brother matt well i feel i may have just send my day grace away but the prophet of god answers that question too and says just the fact that you have a desire to ask that question proves that god still has mercy for you wake up child put on your strength put on your beautiful garment that's not who you are world might have told you you're enslaved and imprisoned that's not who you are that doesn't change anything you're still my child you're still my daughter what do i got to do lord wake up wake up you know that's what the preaching of the word does sometimes it has to wake people up physically other times it has to wake him up spiritually say wake him up it has to wake that gene seed of god that gene seed that he put down inside of you before the world and brother adam says when the word comes and it flashes across that seed you know but it's up to you it's your choice samson it's your choice it's your decision are you gonna live jacob continue to live like jacob you're gonna continue to live and go down and be in the same exact ditch you've been in and go down the same patterns and the same trails you've always been to that'll lead you to the same exact things they've been leading you to you're going to keep going that way are you going to surrender you're going to surrender to the path and the blueprint that god has laid for your life stand stand to your feet genesis 35 verse 2. then jacob said unto his household as we spoke last night it starts with the man it starts with the man jacob said notice read it with me verse 2 jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you just going to take a moment get settled jacob said unto his household and to all that were with him this is where deliverance begins this is where change begins how do i start brother matt i've won it so bad i know i know that i need it so bad but where do i even begin it begins right here you start where you're standing at right now and jacob said put away the strange gods from among you and be clean and change your garments and here's a father who finally gets a revelation of what true restoration how does true healing begin with my family let us verse 3 arise and go up to bethel and i will make there an altar unto god who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which i went and they gave unto jacob all their strange gods that's what i said last night a family will fall in order when a father falls in line you say they just need to follow they just need to they just need to they just need to leave you they just need to listen that if i could just change my situation if i could just change this about my children if i could just change this about this stop stop looking at everybody everything and everybody around you if i could just change the church i could just change this and change that the change has to start right here if you'll change everything else around you will change he says take he says take away put away your strange garments put put away your strange gods and the bible says they gave unto jacob verse 4 the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and jacob hid them under the oak which was by shechem and they journeyed and the terror of god was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue the sons of jacob what happens when the family when the son of god comes back and realigns himself with the purpose of god god fights for that son and god surrounds that family with a promise you say i want the shelter of god i want to be sheltered i want the protection of god stay in tune and in line with the voice of god for your life and stay in sync and stay in time friends now more than ever before now more than ever before we need families and lives and fathers and mothers and teenagers that are in sync the mind of god lord jesus we just bow our heads together lord i just feel to stop right there i feel that you've said what you wanted to say lord i'm just going
