========================================

I'm ready let's pray everybody father we thank you for let's together days and Hank great list of services today board and overdose official speaking Irish to hear upgrade let's go wait Minister in North Carolina brother beliefs but of all white ministry in Florida ready just what's all your little bride around the world just to not mention such as big an Irish to hear give us understanding that works comes forth with Greg and thank you for you learn all the sickening for touching all those who have any today and prior to the blessings of Jesus I want to teach you a little lesson about the positive power of prayer so that's our objective today is to understand the importance and everybody see that okay to understand the importance of offering our fervent sincere prayers to God 1st Thessalonians 5 now we exhort you brethren warn them that are unrolling cumference of people minded support the weak be patient toward all men and see the done remember to use for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing and everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ concerning you when it's not the spirit the spots not brought the signs prove all things hold fast that which is good and I've heard it said a lot I believe it frame without ceasing nothing necessarily mean going round eyes blow to head value hands in your prayer position all the time it dissipates a prayerful attitude always be in communication with the Lord in turning for Christ every moment of every day and be mindful about the Lord and leading of the Lord just be consoling a fair-weather and keep your mind on God the prophet Elijah that's the sermon title post realize it sometimes we go off on a tangent somewhere and not think about God not pray over it ask them or whether we should do it or not and we find out that our sub lesson is cut off then we wonder sometimes well wonder why can't have them your blessings you don't want you let down your prayer life you say well I'm a Christian well that's the more sign you should pray more than ever being at the Bible every day pray every day don't like any decision too harshly or too quickly without first seeing God that asking should I do this father asked you makes it your will for me to do this and then see what the Holy Spirit will speak to you you might not give you a vision but he will speak in some way to you to let you know if you'll be sincere and ask we tend to look some kind of big flashy billboard you know especially big decisions you know in life we want God to make a real obvious and sometimes it's real so and we just have to be watching and prayerfully be attending this is from Charles Spurgeon I got this off the internet in February 10th 1867 the Metropolitan Tabernacle Newington appointment where that's at the time was this time when the title was the dawn of revival or prayer speedily answered and is what this was his little text he preached from that morning at the beginning of your supplications that commandment came forth and I come to show you where you are greatly beloved Daniel 9 works a thought further way because he started into this Daniel 70 weeks series and mrs. Hart had - we should have going into this thing like that is prayer prayer cool attitude prayer is used in the thousand ways and especially what the old physician sought after naturally mainland telephone thank you guys now Catholicism it's pathetic on a remedy of universal application there is no case of me the stress or dilemma in which prayer will not be found to be a very present help in the case before us Daniel had been studying the Book of Jeremiah and had learned that God that a comfort accomplished seventy weeks in the best selection of Jerusalem they felt that there was still more to be learned and instead his face to learning his was the noble and acute mind and with all this energies he sought to pry into the prophetic meaning but he did not rely upon his own judgment he betook himself at once to prayer prayer is that great key which opens miss open up warrior over there's about four or five slides of this it's not the whole journey he's just just introduction to a sermon to whom shall we go for an explanation if we can understand the riding but today all through the book Daniel appealed at once to the great author and whose hand Jeremiah had been the pen so Jeremiah was the rider but really they offered the book of jeremiah zola go slowly spirit and lonely retirement the president knelt upon sneeze and crying to God that he would open up to him the mystery of the policy that he might know the full meaning of the 70 weeks and what God intended to do in their home and how it would have people to behave himself to obtain deliverance from their captivity Daniel made his suit to the Lord to unloose the seals and open the body of the book and he was heard and favored with the knowledge which you might have sought for in vain by any other means so it looked in maybe other people's writings it might have been in vain because you know people's ideas but he looked to prophet Jeremiah and to the Holy Ghost for billy the particular point in the text to which I would director attention this morning is the gangs prayer was answered at once while he was yet speaking I and at the beginning of his supplication not always so prayer sometimes Terry's like a petitioner at the gate until the King comes forth the filler bosom with the blessings which he sees the Lord when he has given great faith has been known to try about long delays he has suffered his sermons forces to echo in their ears as from a bronze sky now where sometimes let's just go a while the answer our prayers it seems like hey patience if you will bless the book of inspiration before your identify and that's the Lord to open up its meaning to you the exercise of prayer itself shall be blessed by God to put your soul to the best thing which to get at the hidden meaning which lies concealed from the eye of the worldly wise for which is clearly manifested to make him lower Souls when they revel in seek the guidance of their having fathered this this brother branham from Gabriel's instructions to Daniel if Dan of the pulpit of the Lord could consult Jeremiah's books and bring him to such a place that even Israel coming out all them alive what's coming out of that one to go back to the homeland what caused him to faster sackcloth and ashes how much more audience did to the Church of the Living God to know that time is fading out and shall be no more in the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ and the great palainian ready to sit in Hockley spin waste this time gambling swimming hold on Sunday no time for Lord I know we don't that the gambling is coming hold we didn't economical or just run down pastor speak some something of your life get up and go out dissatisfied look at our condition so why do we need to pray Matthew 26 watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation of the Spirit is willing but the flesh is weak that's one thing jesus said while we need to pray for their flesh between another reason why we need to pray mark 13 heaven on earth shall pass away but my words shall not pass away but on that day and that hour knoweth no man no not the angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father taking heed watch and pray do you know not when the time is for the son of man it says a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and every man his work and commanded the porter to watch watching therefore for you know not when the master of the house comes and even we're midnight recovering the more less time sudden they find you sleeping maybe not naturally but spiritually sleeping they're not seeing your day in your house and what I say unto you I say unto all watch another reason why we need to pray brother Brown from the message who is this but there will be a remnant there will be those who know God and who are watching and are charged and they'll see him for he'll come as a thief in the night will be caught up to meet Lord in heir secret going away to the church so I tell you knowing all this beforehand by the word of the Lord we should pray and study every hour of our life making it ready for that great event and while they Hertz charmed with his presence and while we are believing in the anointed ministers of the gospel are sending out the Thunderbolts in the morning we should be prepared for any man for that blessed event and we shall see all that has died in Christ of the ages when we will see Jesus coming to get his church will the car when we come in the air so prayer is a part of worship that's just obvious we know that prayer is very necessary for us to become one with the Lord as he desires us to all right so John 17 that they all make they want as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou sent me this is I got this whole prayer of John 17 of Jesus's Prayer at the very end of the lesson public get to it Joe no I said the whole chapter is the prayer of Jesus basically praying that he and father would be one that we would be one and that Jesus and that that would be because there's not Jesus than us it's it's God in his pride so that's the whole prayer it basically summed up in that why do we need to pray prayer is also necessary for our character development through prayer we learned to love and forgive our enemies in prayer we also can tell they confess our love to the Lord thanking him praising him reminded them of what it means to us and about that I'll say about praying for our enemies how can you still hate someone or or not love something really if you're praying for them constantly even though they make the spies users people I work with that I have no idea why they're always mad at me or why they dislike me so much but I don't worry about it I just pray for them and I really can't help but fill up for them because I'm constantly praying for them and thinking about it when asked the Lord to save their soul so it really it kind of takes away that element that's human part of us so wanting to draw back at somebody or any kind of feel feelings towards someone if you're praying for them so do you said love your enemies pray for them responsibly use you but this is similar even to our natural love we have for our spouse but continually express our love to them there are many ways we must stay in constant communion with Christ reminding it now what you think of him along to serve from Hebei there's a little thing on this note about Gaby this little thing that I think constantly is I write a love letter stirred and I know she knows I love her but I like to be constantly telling her what about how much I love her and I found that as I've been doing it for some time now I didn't creases my love for her and her love for me it just makes relationship even stronger and so you through that your relationship with Christ constant remind him of what he means to you and how much you love him and that's one thing you do is through prayer is something you can do any time anything anywhere it's just a free thing that you you know he hears you and sometimes maybe you don't feel like he does maybe you don't get a fairly her sensation like he's heard your prayer but you know the future and he loves to hear from so Butterball's been on this recently about the tabernacle and the wilderness so until he talked about this reason I didn't really understand the extent of all those little all the pieces of furniture it's on the outer court inner court nobody's home holy of holies I didn't understand really how that pertained to us so very glad he went over that and I'll kind of review some of that because when you get down to the inside here that incense altar that's what we're talking about today's prayer that's how we offer a bargain sense to God is prayer don't think about the father in front of that element basically I think you said something about that every one of these you should be able to relate to your experience at the brass and altar you identify with some Christ dying or you've been crucified for your sin and every one of these pieces of furniture you should be able to identify your own experience with there's something very significant about each one of those in our lives all right so let's see here I was thinking about it this morning that's reflecting a little bit on some of this and since brother Aaron's here what's the old saying goes I'd rather give him a rose bouquet rose down than a bouquet later or something like that America is far different brother never preached the start of my sanctification and has always been on my mind that because I didn't I don't think of every poem this but I didn't know my sanctification was a Baptist I was here is in that outer core of justification that's all I knew it's coming in and getting saved that's all I noticed past stands being chopped off well I still had a desire for the things in the world there were some very wrong things I was doing that I knew was wrong but I had a December form and I was literally taught in the Baptist Church you can't help what you do you just plead the blood that's all you can do so in other words the guy that told me that I have to know his brother several of us know that his brother was sleeping with his girlfriend boy was sleeping with his girlfriend they weren't married and we all gather round ladies I'm afraid I snorted forgiven and he told me that's all you can do was played the blood nothing Wow it's pretty sad that going to help us a better Catholic get a man get her saved and I stayed here for several years on 12 when I came home to the Lord and for the next 2-3 years I still did some things that were very wrong that I knew what's wrong I felt condemned and convicted for it and I even prayed the sinner's prayer again you know it's something in the Baptist Church every sermon to a Baptist minister preaches he gives an altar call at the end and Isis if you want to pray the prayer of salvation about the Lord to your heart I prayed again there is none anything well I didn't get last time daddy I would sincere enough I guess because I went out there on this week again so I pray that sinner's prayer every Sunday sincerely for a long time and yet remain down here in this outer court but along about 14 years old I started reading the Bible a little bit and began to be sanctified at least on this outer court of sanctification I guess you could call it a washing your hands and the priest would wash their hands on I believe their feet before they go into that Airport so it's like our actions and our deeds and where we go and the things we do you start to be purged of those things to some degree because reading the Bible every day they'll be a spirit of conviction come on you'll say you'll read something that you know you're not lining up to so you can't help it's inevitable that some of those things start to go out and the other corner well then I went on when I can message a lot of good think this is silly I was still holding on to Christian Romero music and brother Aaron priests Christian rock is a frog who I guess it was when I started going here I'm real mad at him I loved it and not only listen to it but I plated in my band and that was my form of ministry we was in a little Christian rock band and we were having playing places trying to get people say to Christian rock music and then he stepped all over my toes but what happened is with that preaching the keep there came a spirit of conviction and it convicted my heart heavily and I took noumenal play that music because that I think was that very night a band went to play at a place in Gainesville Annis and it was the unplugged session who will know electric guitars just me playing my bongos and even that caused the spirit Commission to come home and I had to walk backstage and I quit the band that never played it again but where their priests started my same profession it was kind of that because that had to go before I could grow spiritually I couldn't grow spiritually holding on to something like that and rock music of any form is wrong but that's where I can identify with this inner core and I kept growing much more after that the band the guys I explained it to him and the didn't understand I guess don't understand this day why I had to quit all of a sudden but you know the Lord convicted my heart very heavily and I didn't understand why I was wrong I just moved he convicted me - brother Eric's preaching and I had to stop but now starting this greater sanctification there's the table of shewbread work but before that actually I was reading the Bible every day somewhere in here I started reading the Bible every day we'll then that's where they shoot ready focus in him able to read they're eating the Word of God every day making your prayers to God at that instant Psalter and then the menorah you know has to be constantly the wick has to be trimmed in the light and everything the light of God comes into your heart and all those things and then of course the Holy of Holies the one we're talking about today I'm staying so dear is that incense altar so Exodus 30 and thou shalt make an altar to burn incense upon of shittim wood so don't make it a cubit shalt be the length thereof and a cubit the breadth thereof Foursquare shall it be and secure it still be the hot there on the horns thereof should be the same and thou so overlay it with pure gold the top there open the sides there over and about and the horns throw up and also make unto it a crown of gold roundabout and two golden rings shalt thou make it under the Tron bit by the two corners that are over on the two sides what they'll make it and they still make replacement stage to bear below and thou shalt make the space of shittim wood and overlaid with gold seemed like it was brother Matthew or another pub somebody recently talked about that being wood overlaid with gold which represents humanity would overlaid with deity of Christ so it's a lot of shadows and types than there are symbols and thou shalt put it before the veil that is by the Ark of the testimony before the mercy seat that is over the testimony where I will meet with people and Aaron shall burned there on sweet innocence every morning when he dressed at the lamps occasional burn incense upon it I was thinking about him brother Branham talked about doing your devotional time the quiet time and the wee hours early morning before the kids start to stir and before everything starts to get chaotic if you see God at the very first sense every day that seems to work best for me it's kind of like giving all the tenth of your money given you know a tenth off the top of your mind before you do anything else when you get your get your paycheck you give him the firstfruits same thing with your time at the start of every day read your Bible and pray and when Aaron lighted the lamps and even you should burn incense upon it a perpetual incense before the Lord throughout your generations you show off an Australian since there are no burns sacrifice Breck sacrifice were made offering me to show you pour drink often though and there is to make an atonement upon the horns of it once in a year with the blood of the sin offering of Atomics once in the air so they make a ton and a pint throughout the generations there's no scolding to the Lord now this is talking about our our instincts how that incidence ties into our prayers thank somebody preached about these beautiful scriptures I'm going to share somebody recently talked about it I don't remember there was a certain man accessory called Parnassus insuring of the band called the italian banded about man who want to fear God with all his house which gave much homes the people and pray to God all the way he saw vision had been about the ninth hour of the day an angel of God coming to him the saving in Cornelius I mean looked on him he was afraid and so what is the Lord he said to him by prayers and the arms are come up for memorial or God okay and these are the basically the furniture pieces again the outer corner Court Holy of Holies and y'all know what all those are the revelation of hate and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour and I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came up stood at the altar having a golden censer those given unto Him much incense that he should offer it with the prayers of All Saints so our prayers are associated with the incense offering upon the golden altar which was before the throne and the smoke dance and she came up with the prayers of the Saints tent before got out of annual town also I suppose this was David in Psalm 141 let my prayer be set before thee as incense and the lifting of my hands as the evening sacrifice now if you look up any sense you'll find a brother branham talking a lot about this instance where Zechariah was praying an angel appeared to him and it was what he was doing his duty as a priest offering incense that was in the days of Herod Herod the king of Judea a certain priest named Zacharias of the course of the vial and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron and her name was Elizabeth and they were both righteous before God welcoming all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blamelessly and they had no child the post that Elizabeth was parent and they both were now on well stricken in years I came to pass that while they executed the priests office before God and the order of his force the court of the customer priests office his law was to burn incense when he went to the temple of Lord and the whole multitude of the people were without praying at the time of incense there again prayers associated with the incense offering and there appeared intimidation Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense and when Zechariah saw him he was troubled in fear : but the angel said of them fear not Zechariah that prayers heard a Nawaf Elizabeth shall bear thee his son master Colin so now we're going to get into how to frame we know a few instances in the scripture what we're told how to pray be careful for nothing Philippians 4 but everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests may not come to God so don't just thank god that's God for this asking for that but with Thanksgiving that's your prayer lean on God and the peace of God which passes all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus ok Luke 11 and he said unto them when you pray say our Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done as in heaven so in earth give us day by day our daily bread and forgive us our sins for we forgive everyone that isn't dead to us and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil and if you skip on down on that same scripture trying to save time a little bit I say to you that we will not rise given because he is thy friend yet because of his importunity or annoyance what that means he will rise and give him as many as needed and I stand even azmuth shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened in you for everyone that seek asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and him anon shall be opened and then the very last verse he says if you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children how much more shall your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask this prayer of the Lord's Prayer were always quoting if you think about it really it boils down to asking who the kingdom of God asking for the Holy Ghost for the new birth essentially but when you pray our Father in heaven Hallowed on name thy kingdom come his word is this kingdom scheme where the wheel which is his work they've done as in heaven which heaven consists of the work so on earth so order basically what we're saying is give us the bow a little portion we're going to read the study and you give us our little portion for today and also forgive us 2/3 of those who sin against us but essentially we're asking for more of God how to pray Romans 8 likewise the spirit also helpeth our memories but we know not what we should pray as with off sometimes the original Noah would ask in a certain in a certain situation but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searcheth the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints support the will of God and we know that all things work together for good and love God those who are called according to his purpose now who do we pray for I'm gonna have to cut off some of it Matthew 5 but I said to you love your enemies bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be under your father which is in heaven so who do we pray for again 1st Timothy 2 I'm sorting their form that first of all supplications prayers intercessions and giving of thanks be made for all men this is where I pray for even Donald Trump for our president are saving prayers and I pray for the leaders of our company I work for and for the leaders in our kids school and so forth for kings and all that authority that we may lead a quiet peaceful life and all godliness and honesty but it's acceptable on the side of daughter I was there for them in everywhere that left hand pulling hands without wrath and down code we pray for James v there's any among you afflicted letter praising him Mary let him sing songs and sending a sick among you let him call for the elders of the church let them pray over him and want to give a goal in the name of the Lord and the prayer of faith will save the sick the Lord shall raise him up and if you have committed sins they shall be forgiven you confess your faults one rather afraid one for them that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much okay does anybody remember who say that this here God started church the way he wanted it now he wants it the way started inside Joe green I want to say further Joe green said that no brother in degree Henry okay is that better so the mom church got started first Elaine wanted and I once it the way started so acts to go back to acts 2:38 then Peter said and they repent be baptized there one of you the name of Jesus Christ for the mission of sins you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the process is huge here shouldn't think that our Father David Ismael Oregon's took home and skip on down they glad to receive order to baptize the same there at about 3,000 souls they continued steadfastly and pulsed with our control center breaking the bread and prayers and fear came upon every soul and many signs and wonders were done by the apostles that's John 17 I want to close it off their question for the breaches I mean when they sprang for somebody had a bad spirit that close your eyes from the spirits out that person approaching oh yeah right have to be reverent but John Donne 1701 just read that your own time is the moment so thank you all [Music] [Music] yeah [Music]
