Amen if you want to say hallelujah you say hallelujah you want to raise your hand you raise your hand there enough Believers in here but there ought to be these walls ought to be on fire amen amen we're going to have a time we got our good musicians here we're going to have some good song see some smiling faces thank all of you for coming wow all the way from Minnesota and all the way from Ohio this man had an impact on all over the world they're watching in now from the Philippines Jamaica Ireland to a little man that lived in a place with 300 people in it a little town had a little church in Lula had a few more hundred people in it but from that it grew and only God can make that happen only God can make that happen but you know I promise you the devil don't want that to happen but I want to thank you all for coming we're going to have our service here then we're going to have the barrel but I'll talk to you about that later but we got some singing We got some Fine Brothers to speak and we sure appreciate you love you with the love of the Lord thank you for all the cards and letters and flowers thank you to the funeral home for for taking care of everything they've took care of the whole thing for us the whole two or three days we've been here and we appreciate you remember one thing God don't ever make a mistake right if God's in it he's never going to make a mistake that's We can question whatever we want to but God never ever makes a mistake one more time God say it with me God never makes mistakes so he orchestrated this whole thing the devil didn't God took him home he wanted him there more than he wanted him here we love you and thank you we'll have a song now and then we'll we'll continue on but thank you all for coming am [Music] [Music] got the call this morning [Music] he' be [Music] here more time Prov me it a ago call [Music] hello again [Music] of [Music] gone table now [Music] children still have Chow one more chance to let them [Music] [Music] that's [Music] and matters all [Music] that God [Music] amen job said we're just a vapor just here for a moment Jesus said one time he said I come from God and I go back to God I think brother Dale did that oh yeah this the shell that we got laying here that we call Dad pop Pastor that just held everything together let his soul live out through his body but now that Soul's over in another dimension we believe that I tell you say Amen he's in another dimension now and he's waiting cuz God said I I I'm done with this one but I'm not done yet we still got stuff to do we still got things to do I want us to remember dad as being a very unselfish man and I was looking at the scripture I Marshall his brother sitting here and um he's U not able to speak today but we sure appreciate him and his surviving brother John sitting back there to I don't know which one's my favorite uncle now I tell them one of them is and then the other one is when the other one walks out so I got them both in here you're both my favorite Uncle John's not thrilled at all so but but remember him he was he was he was a a brother to these and and Marshall couldn't speak so I'm going to I was trying last night to to kind of look at something and I want to take a a little just about four scriptures in 2 Timothy 4 verse1 God told us through Paul he said I charge thee therefore before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who shall judge the Quicken the dead that is appearing in his kingdom preach the word be instant in season and out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and you got to have a Doctrine right and the doctrine is what you live by he had a Doctrine some people may thought it was strange but it came straight from the Bible so why would you make it strange if it came straight from the Bible amen well the time will come when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears they shall turn away their ears from truth like brother collie was saying many people heard the voice but they didn't do anything about it and shall be turned into fables here one right here just for a second but watch thou in all things endure affliction do the work of an evangelist now my dad was not an evangelist he was a pastor but he did go to Jamaica 10 times and the Philippines and all these different places but the work of evangelist is uh where's brother Joe Green brother Joe Green where you at if you can't go send somebody so he he sent people all over the world preach this message and souls were saved There Was An established churches in different places places a lot of people and you'll hear now that that like brother Richard's going to tell you and I promise you brother juel too we wouldn't be standing here without brother Dale that's right we would not through his ministry and through his service to the and brother Joe does a lot of work in the in the mission fields and he knows that Dad just poured out all kind of money that that he could have kept but he he gave it to the missionary field and we sit missionaries so to me he doesn't have he did the work of an evangelist he wasn't an evangelist but he did the work of evangelist he wanted this message he loved this message and Jesus Christ more than anything in the world and he wanted people to know it and he wasn't ashamed of it so Paul's Talent say look make full proof of thy Ministry I think he's made full proof of that for I am now ready to be offered Paul's coming down to the end of his ministry for I'm now ready to be offered the time of my departure hand that word departure means loosing so let me read it like this in the time of my loosing is at hand amen I have fought the good fight I have finished that word finished in the Greek means carried out my command he did it he carried out his command so perfect God said you're done I'm going to take you home praise the Lord I finished my course course means in this life is something carried through life he lived his whole life for his family but he put God first he put the ministry first but he loved us all then Paul doesn't finish there he says look henceforth there's laid up for me a what a crown not a crown with gold and jewels and all those things that would look good but the Bible tells us the Greek of that word means a mark of royalty I'm glad to be the child of the King today aren't you glad to be the child of a king today we got Royal Blood but that means Mark of royalty a crown of not just a regular Crown a crown of righteousness righteousness means Integrity virtue purity of Life rightness correctness of thinking right wow that was my dad that was Brother D you knew him long enough you knew he was who he was and that was it you've got what you got he wasn't twoo faced he told me one time he said son if they all love you you're a hypocrite I'm lowering a little bit here but that's the truth he stood for what he believed and believed for what he stood and listen like I said before the Lord Jesus orchestrated this this is not something the devil had anything to do with do you believe that you go to a funeral and you oh the devil the devil didn't do this there was something set in motion before in the fall that this had to happen there had to be we had to come the way you're looking at me and I'm looking at you now through this flesh body right but he came to give us a hope to get to another place if we have to leave this one here brother shes that's okay we leave this one here but guess what job stood wayed day and he said what I know I don't doubt I don't think I know my redeemer liveth and in the last days I stand on my feet in My Flesh and with my eyes I see God we saw God Walk Among Us a man name Samuel and we appreciate being part of it him being my natural brother he's my brother now told you another D I lost the father but I gained the brother a Heavenly brother CU we're all we're brothers over there brothers and sisters and and I asked June I said I'm going to ask him when we all get over there why I said when we bring him here I'm going to say who met you at the river first oh y'all don't believe that oh yeah we believe that we believe there's an afterlife we believe there's another dimension he's more real now than he ever has been you can say Amen [Applause] you let me say this before I we have another song brother Terry's going to sing for us his his nephew and we love the family and everything that that the Dale family we we just a wonderful group of people but on Tuesday at 5:00 there was a command initiated in another dimension somebody's fixing to need you death angel you need to go over there in the room in Hall County and we're fixing to bring somebody here but there was another command one out from heaven where there is no death it was not initiated in death headquarters it was initiated in heaven it was initiated in eternity when that Death Angel Hey listen Jesus told us he said you have what passed from death into life pass you know if you don't like McDonald you pass right by right right if you don't like death you pass right by Jesus said we passed from Death under life so no death angel came and got my dad no according to John 5:24 he pass that that Death Angel got moved over brother jel Michael stepped in the room Michael come got him no no Death Angel Christians don't die they just fall asleep so Michael walked in the room and said hey come on you going with me the that that Ang said that's mine he said no you can't even go where I'm going come on somebody you can't even go where I'm going you don't even know where I'm going to take him I'm going to hide him away in a pavilion that you the devil and all his amps are never going to know brother Jonathan they're never going to be there that's right he passed from death into life what God we serve that's my pastor that's my dad that's my friend we appreciate you it was unusual that day the death angel just had to stand there and watch cuz there was a Christian went to a place where you dad always told me he said if you get a crowd together in a funeral he said I've never seen anybody walk out of one he said you tell them they need ation pretty captive audience but you need the Lord you know what it wasn't because this man himself as a human it was because this man received the Holy Ghost in his soul he had a new birth and that's what took him the old birth put him here the new birth took him in the other dimension but there's no sorrow no grief no pain and we'll gather with him one day yes sir I'll promise you if you don't know the Lord Jesus today I hope you don't sleep tonight until you find someone to help you to the Lord God bless forunate I've been fortunate to sing at many funerals across the United States for several years this particular one here is very special you talk about a life that was really live this this life was live for the Lord Jesus Christ amen when you can come and have uncles and aunts and grandmothers and all that that we know one day we'll meet again this is not the end it's just the beginning amen amen I've sung this song many many times but I don't think it'll be any truer to me today than right now because one of these days when all of God's people gather together what a grand reunion that will be and what a day that will be [Music] there is coming a day when no heartache shall come no more clouds in the sky amen no more tears to dim the eye all is peace forever more on that happy Golden Shore what a day glorious day that will be there'll be no sorrow there no more bird to bear no more sickness no more pain no more part over there and forever I will be with the one who die for me for a day Glory day that will be and what a day that will be when my Jesus I shall see and I look upon his face the one who save me by his grace when he takes me by the hand and leads me through the promised land what a day glorious day that will be [Music] somewhere beyond the grave there is a land where Jesus went to prepare by his own hand and for the sa by Grace there is a resting place and in a few more days it will be [Music] mine some call it heav I call it home some call it dreaming well let me dream [Music] home some call it [Music] Paradise somewhere beyond the [Music] sky some call it Heaven I call it

brother Dale touched and brother D he never thought of himself he touch a lot of lies the El points you to one man Christ Jesus God ain't one like your finger neither is he three he's one in person amen he's many forms but he's one in person amen he has attributes amen I me brother Dale preaching years ago he says he condescends down yes he don't gain any attribute he dwell alone with his attribute he never gained any so if you are the attribute in him you're going to express him amen well he's the only one there is amen that's he said I'm the way I'm the truth I'm the li no man comes to the father his father was the Holy Ghost amen am same way your father you have the same father because through him so I read I read a scriptures here and just I just pay close attention if you can and if you agree you can say Amen if you say say oh me and just amen we're here to celebrate a great Victory not a defeat but a brand never brother brother Dale never went down in defeat he went up in Victory this was a victory day Tuesday afternoon about 5:00 for brother L exactly right I want to read in Job 14 a few verses there and P a few comments and I just want to tell you what's on my heart and I wrote a few notes down with brother W called that ask me if I would do the service and I I'd be honored to do it because I've always when I met brother Dale probably 50 years this summer and we grew together and I he was a great he was a great man the father that brother way said and I've said it before and I've said it many times at home that brother Dale put a foundation in me yes and I always I never mentioned this to Soul have door on the face of the Earth till tonight this afternoon I regarded brother BR brother Dale as my big brother amen so he took cure on me yes he did that's right praise the Lord he's always there I've never told this either one I'd have something come up that I was facing some health problems or something I had to make a decision on and I'd always ask brother Dale to pray about it just pray every time many many many times sometimes he wouldn't answer me we keep talking I'd keep talking to him till I got out of him what I wanted to everything's going to be all right brother Rich that's God's honest truth that's how I trusted Brother D how I loved him how close we was we absolutely Brothers amen he was my friend yes just my brother and like I said he buil a foundation in me that I can walk when he's gone not way he was talking you sitting here this afternoon you got a great responsibility right this is the last Church age amen there's no more God to come there's no more message to come no this is it live the day Noah we're living the days of L everything is just polluted and perverted and turn upside down what you want to see and God's going to burn this thing but he gave us a sign there in the mountain with Abraham in the end time yep when he was fixing the burn Solomon gor he gave Abraham Our Father a sign end at the end time God Almighty is be in flesh in your fles am in a new birth that's the sign he given that's the sign of the son of man amen he won Son of God won't work now no it won't work n son of man amen because this is the only day that you have us as we're taught through the the promis message this is the only day of adoption you don't adopt the spirit of God no you can't Crown a spirit they couldn't Crown they couldn't Crown the pope he became a became a man the doctor became a man they put on gave him a sword all was thing that's right but anyway let me read this here and I don't want to take too much time but anyway and pass a few comments here I'll take my watch off so I can see it man is born of a woman is two days in full of trouble that's your trouble you come wrong you come through the woman that's right is that right or not that's right I mean testify of that if you didn't why you die that's right you bring the child right one it's down here happens right no other time it was predestinated to the seventh angel when this things Break Forth right that child won't die for this is the day for the Rapture amen right and don't be afraid on me cuz I'm not I wouldn't hurt you going to tell you the truth it may sound strange to somebody that's right I want to tell you be real quick in tell you what the scripture says and we're talking about brother Dale amen okay this is a celebration him this is his victory day amen he come forth like a flower and is cut down he wouldn't have done that but come right the only way that Jesus come why did he come contrary to where you come he wouldn't have been cut out because of that one thing you and I was our sins took him to C that's the reason he was cut out right brother no other way he fleeth also as a shadow and continueth not look at Brother D 84 years he's gone do th open th Eyes Upon such a one bringeth me into judgment with thee who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean not one amen that's why he had to die right we wasn't too clean right is that right see that his days determined in the number of his months are with the as apped his bounds that he cannot pass turn from him that he may rest till he accomplish har his day for there is hope of the tree if it cut down it will Sprout again and bring forth tender B but will not cease though th the re root thereof wax old in the Earth the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the sin of water it will bud and bring forth bows like a plant at the sin of water the water is the life the water is the word the sin of the word that man will come for amen he has to he hear he'll call all amen at the bottom of sea burning up there one the Spoonful lashes or God will call that man will come forth our God's a Creator God absolutely but man die and waste away he may give up the go is he as the waters fell sea as floods Decay and Dr up so man Li down and D not till the heavens be no more shall they not awake or rise out of their sleep all thou would hi be in the grave and thou will keep me secret till thy wrath be passed that would put me a time and remember if a man die shall he live again do you believe that if he died if a man died now he's talking about not in spirit for him not his soul form he's talking about in flesh form if he dies shall he live again he gives you the answer in chapter 19 he do way to go man Liv all the days of my appointed time will I wait till I change come okay now let me get started this few notes tonight and and and listen try and see see if I tell you the truth or not see if the holy spirit will cuz this is what brother brother believe amen so he buil me a foundation of me I can walk yes and and I got I got say is stronger in the word in in the new birth and when God took brother they PR us he never took God from us no there's a message here amen yeah see brother Dale he used death as a door death didn't use him he used death just changed his dwelling place that's all it did that's the only thing changed about brother Dell with his Dwelling Place all right he's the same person he was down here this Earth with a family on Earth but now he's the family in heaven amen but he's the same person he's got his senses don't get quiet on that I can prove it to you out of the Bible if you prove anything out of the Bible amen then you know it's right but he has his senses he's probably talking right now amen he may be looking over the ban God may let him look down to see service today but I know one thing they made I know sure there was some saints of God there at the River Jordan but there's one thing for sure when brother Dale left this Earth he knew where to [Applause] go he come from you hear he knew exactly where to go yeah he that's all it changed was his Dwelling Place someone would say brother did you hear that brother Samuel Dale died I said brother Samuel Dell can't die he's blessed with eternal life and how can he die all right that's not true he was blessed with eternal life yeah his his Earthly body which is laying here in this casket that's the house he lived in for 84 years it's it's it's just a house he lived in that's not the real brother Dale now in one sense it's not the real brother Dale right amen right get a deeper understanding of the word is right brother that is the real brother d am now now don't you think about this sister P list me a minute if you could have seen if that 5:00 Tuesday afternoon when God took him home if his family was standing there if they could have seen and God would allow it he could if he wanted to if he could think of the brother Dale Lee they would have saw the young man that she married 66 years ago that's who you to see you hear me amen that's the absolute truth amen he's KNN on the other side now think on the other side they call him brother Dale that's right that's his name that's his theophany name his soul amen that's his name on Mount Transfiguration remember Jesus there when he was adopted right Moses and Elijah appeared now they was not in flesh body Moses body had roted hundred 100 years late before that but they was there in their theophany that's right that's how what we taught that's what the word says yes amen but their theop name was mes and there Transfiguration right that's what I believe that's what the word of God said right exactly right okay let me go on just a minute I got this is the first scripture that come to me when when brother Wade called and talk a minute and I want to I want to turn to the to First Corinthians I'm sorry I'm going to turn to 2 Corinthians 5 the fth chapter of 2 Corinthians I want to go real real fast on this but I want I want you to get see see the point what I'm talking about second Corinthians 5 verse1 for we know that if now that if there is a big big big word if this our Earthly house want to land here in this C be dissolved that means if brother Terence and I had a business we dissolve our business he'd go one way i' go the other that's what happened to brother amen his house was dissolved if I if now if your house is dissolved you have a building amen now that building eternally in heaven is that from your new birth that God gives you amen that births a body inside you a word body Jesus Jesus said himself I'll be with you even in you apost Paul taught Christ in you not with you I don't want god with me I want to be iness that's the only hope of glory there is is Christ and Christ is the word amen Christ in youen is the hope of glory nothing else so there's got to be a son and daughter of God that's buil in you from your new birth around your Born Again experience that that's this thing it this this is absolutely TR he said in the very image of you outside man here when did that's your best that one inside you the one inside me right now looks like me when not about 19 year old now amen now if the B if your house is dissolved you'll spot here it's Earthly you have what we have a building of of God and a house made with hands in turtled in the heav why when he was dissolved brother brother Dale there Tuesday afternoon yeah the body will take in a few minutes and planted in the Earth right but the war inside that body hallelujah what did the sixth Dimension under the alar like I said he knew exactly where to go because it was the word I that myself amen you know what happen when the Rapture takes place some morning about 8 6 or 9:00 amen there'll be one person go Jesus Christ the word if you're not the word you won't go if I'm not the word I won't go it's exactly right absolutely because the body of Christ is the bride now think of this if your house is dissolved you this body you have one amen but if it's not dissolved you don't have one that that's right right don't I one that fa call I make you got two I don't believe in two I believe in one put two Gods on me I don't want that one God for in this we grown I got to hurry earnestly desire to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven that thing that left brother Dale 5:00 Tuesday afternoon was that house from Aben that's right he went back to where he come from exactly right amen [Applause] hallelujah I'm not you know I get at home I said well I'm I'm haven't had a lot of birthday you can look at me and tell that some you you think you get to thinking about the young PR Pastor in here this person in you he can't now look here God's not in my soul God is my soul my soul is God God never sent something in Soul for you he gave his soul for you that's exactly right amen if so be we be clothed we shall not be found naked now listen at the change of the body you better know where you stand your house from Heaven be inside you because we're taught that by God's Propet amen the thing that change you from as a twinkling and eyes as Paul says that thing change you is inside you praise God forever for we that we are in this in this Tabernacle this body do grown yes come on if you have the first fruits of the spirit you're groaning what but did it be delivered you have a life inside you come from another Another World they come from God's world he come from a word or for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality amen so we've got the word down you're as sure as I stand and you ministers know it you it's ORD of God Amen we've got the word in this end time that'll bring you on for the new birth to bring you to the place that you should have come in the garden of Eve if Adam and Eve had brought that what that child right that's would have never got in would done it it would have happen no hallah right brother but now we have the part of the tree of life think of it we have the part if ad eat that tree this is the word amen you can eat every tree God told him not the tree of godar is good and evil you can eat the tree if he eat that part of the tree that God's G us through the prophet of God at end time if he'd eat that he'll never die so he already called him to replenish Bly replenish you right this old Earth is a grown the entire Earth is a grown why for Sons and Daughters of God that W polluted amen hallelujah amen true be clothed up on that mortality might be swallowed up of life now what's going to what's going to that will swallow out mortality me amen it's Eternal person it's a word person now think of this I had another scripture I was going to read and and I'm w't take too much time I don't want to do that but we just doing this one time with this is Brother Dale we don't want we don't want us maybe run over real quickly I believe I'm going telling you some things that brother want you to see yes if I had met a man absolutely if I had met a man that reverenced and feared the word of God it was Brother David amen he tried to teach you and get to the word of God and teach the same thing he didn't he he right over his office there remember really touched me right in his church his study he had to said he said live me a sermon Don't Preach me a son anyone believe that brother Dale it had to he had to live amen the word has to okay now now this is Romans 8 the spirit say be witness our spirit we are the children of God verse 16 if Children HS of God join as with Christ so be it we suffer with him we may be glorified together am for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that's revealed in US amen that what was revealed to brother Dale what happened that Tuesday afternoon he didn't go down in De feat no sir the only thing he did was change Dwelling Places then what was revealed he had an eternal body take him to Glory it knew exactly like I said it knew exactly where to go amen for the earnest expectation of the crisan wait for the manifestation of the sons of God so the sufferings of his present time so I want you to look at something the thing that brother Dale went through was the way that God had for him to take him from this life to Glory the way he went through what he went through was what God's way of taking him out of this Earth that's right we say why do you have to go through this I ask you a question when they come in the garden of GS they got our Lord amen all they had to done was take him to Calvary but he only he pronounced his own judgment yes he did he had to go through the wine PR of the wrath of God amen amen he had to suffer and be beaten Beyond human recognition why do he have to do that they could just took they go but he didn't Brother D been up behind his house and he just had a heart attack wait some found him and he over with but God had a way of taking him from this life and that's the way he went am God don't make any mistakes he don't make any decisions God could have stopped the whole thing amen he never am right to see what Jesus went through because Isaiah the prophet prophesied his judgment yes amen he he his vision you could look at him and he couldn't look he don't even look human amen yeah amen I'm going to close out let Le s it out I'm going to close out with this one thing the young man that left brother Dell Tuesday

please I'm all come get you if you don't stand up thank you all for coming God bless you I know some of you this may be strange that PA it in the way is called heresy we worship God righten we worship God like other people do because some people don't know who God is that's right if you know who God is you know how to worship saw Brother Richard 80 something year old man barely get up here and you see about to fly off that's what'll happen when the word of God gets a hold of you yes amen it'll uh it'll change us one day sir we're going to head down now to the to the U funeral down at the gravide we want to there's a lot of you here and we're going to have to go through town so if you don't mind as soon as we're over with here don't get in the funeral procession just just some the family maybe but some of you go ahead and go on down if you don't know where it's at I think it's on the wall back there that you can see the address it's down in gillville and it'll be back in the back uh leave the leave the U driveway open so that you we can get the hearse down it if you get there before we do you'll see the road that goes through there but just leave a gap there but go on down there so we can get through town and um and not have to hold a lot of things up we again I appreciate the uh brother Austin and and Terry my cousin and brother Ben over there we appreciate you baby we appreciate all of you thank you for what you do if it would was for you guys we wouldn't have a place here this is something with it that we didn't like Mom said you I didn't expect this well sometimes God has a lot of surprises amen but when when God has a surprise he's got a purpose behind it he's not frivolous he's not like the devil and try to trick you into something like I said before I heard brother Tim C God bless you buddy this was orchestrated by the almighty the devil didn't have nothing to do with it that's right but won't it be a time we're going to sing a congregational song my dad always sing this after he did a funeral it's called I'll Fly Away we'll have brother Joel brother George Canada's son brother Joel I mean Joel where Joel Joel's in the back their dad was our song leader long time ago and this is the baby and Brother Joseph is Our Song leader now and that's his sister on the piano so we appreciate the Canada the family they've always been a good part of our family but he's going to lead us in the congregation and then we will then we will get out of here so like I said before we're going to the grave site and we're going to have a service there just for a few moments and then we'll uh eat in the got the place over there but you going to go go on now not right now but go on now you make him feel bad if you did we get finished we'll sing a couple of songs here of course uh brother D's favorite song one of his favorite songs was I Fly Away Now growing up and listening to I Fly Away there's a a verse in there it says when I die by and by but we're going to change that verse we're going to say I can't die Hallelujah by you've heard so many uh statements of faith that when you're in Christ you can't die you're alive in him in fact in John chap 11 it says Jesus said he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever believeth and believeth in me shall never die amen it's so contrary to the way we think amen but you can't die when you're a real Christian a true Christian and I like to say this and I hope it's not out of order but you know I was thinking just reflecting on our brother the mean things he's taught us he's he was a good teacher he was a very detailed teacher and I've been his neighbor for 15 plus years it's just I tell people it's easy to love your neighbor and the Lord said when he's your neighbor and there's me times that things would happen around the house um uh Plumbing would break electricity and he would come over there and just teach you know how to fix it and was just so patient but I was thinking you know is it that Brother D has really taught me something very personal and I want to teach you what he taught me he taught me three words in another language he spoke another language a lot of people don't know that amen it's a special language and he spoke this through a sign a sign language I want each of us to learn these three words somebody back there has already showed it and I want each of us to learn if there's something you can take away from today I want I want you to learn these three words I want everybody to raise their right hand with their pinky up and then sign language this is the word I I want you to close your pinky and lift up your index finger and open your thumb and this is the word love for l i want you to close your index finger I want you to open that pinky back up and keep the thumb open and that is you and if you open them all up let's say it together I love you amen if there's anything his foress it was the love they had for you for people and I remember many times when we would call him out to the pull pit he would he would hold up his his hands like this and he said the reason I do that is because I want God to know that I love him so when there's a time in life if if there's anything that you can encapsulate from birth to death everything the UPS the Downs it's love amen it's the love of God that has ConEd us here and when you can't speak you can still do this amen say I love you let's sing this song I'll Fly Away amen are you here to worship let's just Worship the Lord oh glad to our celestial [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] in the [Music] [Applause] shadows [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] oh away [Applause] Glory Hallelujah [Music] [Applause] [Music]
