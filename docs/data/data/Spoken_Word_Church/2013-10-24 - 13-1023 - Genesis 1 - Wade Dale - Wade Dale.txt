continue on on our thought with our Genesis 126 and 27 and tonight we're going to subtitle it the DNA of God told you I was going to preach on it about a year ago but uh this is going to start we're surely not going to get get through it but I want you to remember my my two friends brother Sano and brother Jackie Benton I did get a an update on him um the therapists are able to work with him now

of people so and he's uh up there close to about 80 years old so let's just keep him in your prayers plus brother Sano a young man and U we just pray that the Lord will uh he does these things for a reason uh he said he would put no more on you than you can stand that's right boy sometimes we get to the border of it but he said he would not do it and that's something we got to trust that as much as we got to trust Matthew 28:19 and acts 238 we got to trust that just as much as we trust the rest of it all right so let's just remember that Brother D brother Dale announced brother juel will be here next Wednesday he's coming down Monday to hunt with us a few days and preach for us Wednesday night and my buddy Claude said to tell you hey I talked to him today and he's excited about coming uh he'll be here on November the 10th and also uh brother Tom Ernest and his wife are traveling tonight and they're going to be at my house tomorrow just for just for uh to spend the night as they're going on to Baltimore so just keep him in your prayers also uh everybody enjoy Bob and Aon service W Sunday that was good that was really good but I told I told B I told Bob I said you know Bob's young in the in the gospel you know and uh in the ministry and I told him I said now if you want to make he said he asked me one time he saidwell what do you like and don't like I said you know what makes me mad is a preacher will walk up in front of a congregation and he'll say start saying I'm not worthy to be here and and I shouldn't be the one preaching well I want to raise my hand like Terence you know did with Tom Ernest I want to raise my hand and say well sit down then if you're not worthy to preach sit down let somebody else preach this was ordained for this to happen tonight and you're going to you're going to hear from God from me or you're not going to hear anything at all right sorry it's just the way it is all right but we don't make no big eyes or little use it's just that we're put in a spot that uh you know uh brother Dale many times is uh sure he likes to go hunting but a lot of times his hunting out in the woods is thinking about you many times I've told you out in the world when I was out in the world not going to church daddy would come to my house he'd have to church after dealing with y'all now he's got to deal with me and y'all but after dealing with y'all he'd say put on a hunting video or you got a good Western to watch just to get you know to get the Mind get your mind away from from all the uh All the Troubles he said one time he said if you got 20 people you got 20 problems you got 100 people you got 100 problems so but we're just all one in the body of Christ though and there's little things that we have to go through and and little trials and tests so if you got your Bibles let's turn to Genesis 1 and we'll start there and I um I'm beginning a saying tonight I've always it it's all that's another thing that that strikes me is is people say well we'll take what brother Brown said from 63 to 65 but from 47 to 63 it was Progressive and he didn't know what he all he was talking about and then they'll say well the great third pole had not come or the son of man Ministry had not shown up yet he was born a prophet amen uh he answered to nobody but God so if you got to answer for his problems then you must be God okay so I told them Sunday it just struck me somebody was talking about it and and everybody there's a lot of people that won't take 47 to 63 I mean they say well he was this of course a lot of in the ministers meeting they did that because it seems that brother Brown says this here and then after 63 he says this but if you put them together by Revelation he's saying the same thing all right we know that but but I told him downstairs I said I want to know what he said after 65 right you go home tonight and sit down and that'll strike you I want to know what he says after 65 yeah cuz what he said before 65 can be argued and it is being argued he preached two souls he preached this he preached that but the five-fold ministry after 1965 yeah is supposed to take that message and perfect the people am so I want to know what he said after 65 through a five-fold Ministry amen not changing what he said not adding to what he said but telling us what he said amen all right so that's what I believe that that we've got a five-fold Ministry that perfected the Saints I don't think people were perfected before 65 now brother brandham could come to adoption we know that but it wasn't for them so I want to know what he said after 65 Brother Gary through a group of people through the bride that's supposed to bring us to rapturing Faith all right from the message of the hour so so if anybody ever says anything to you tell them we believe in this church we believe everything he says after 65 yeah right that's right that's the truth right everything he says after 65 you know why because brother de it's got to be a revelation if it's not a revelation they'll preach Two Souls out of that message they'll preach seven th virtue they'll preach per they'll preach no Holy Ghost Doctrine where do you think all of them came from from 47 to 65 that's where the doctrines came from so I want to know what the spirit says to the church that's here in the end time so let's bow our heads before we get started dear heavenly father we pray tonight that you'll come Lord as a active participant in the service and not just a record of our thoughts and our ideas that it not be our thoughts and our ideas that'll be you doing the speaking Lord you doing the hearing cuz you said faith comes by hearing and hearing of the word of God and how can they hear un L they hear a preacher and unless he be sent it's just vain words father we pray that you'd be with us tonight take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit May the words be pleasing to you Lord may you forgive us of our sins and our many human stupid mistakes that we make Lord in life that you'll clear those out Lord and that you'll bring us to words Lord that we need to hear father be with the ones that are sick brother Sano brother Benton these things happen for a reason Lord but we still know that you are Jehovah Gyra we still know you are the provider you're the one that that heals and you're the one that that will raise them out of that situation thank you we pray that you'd bless the ones in the congregation Lord thank you for being with each one be the ones that are not here take care of us and lead us guide us by your Holy Spirit in Jesus name we pray amen Genesis 1:26 and 27 and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air now look he's given us something to do all right watch and over the calal over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so God created and we're going to look at these words in a minute when I let you sit down so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them all right and God blessed them so they're already blessed right amen that group of people is already blessed God blessed them the Creator blessed them and God blessed him and said unto them he said right straight to them not through a second person right God spoke directly to this group of people and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth and subdue it look at all these ANS and he's piling things on and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the foul of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen H you say okay what are we going to do in the Millennium what are we going to do in the future home right we'll have dominion over every right living creature amen that's right animal and man you may be seated H you say oh that's too strong no I don't think we've I don't think we found what we're looking for yet in this Genesis 126 and 27 man I think we're just hitting the surface we're just scratching the part that we're supposed to see because remember whoever these people are they're sinless yeah right whoever these people are they're sinless God's already blessed them amen God's given them a Dominion God's told him what to do he's told him to replenish the Earth what a group of people right now let's look and see in Genesis 1:27 it says so God created now we're we're looking at that word and I was uh speaking to the ones in in Calhoun past weekend we look at that as created as there was nothing and then there was something created okay but now watch remember the thoughts in the mind of God is eternal amen okay it just developed when he spoke it right now remember we have thoughts in our mind about building a building buying a car choosing a spouse whatever but we can make mistakes States because we're born on the earthy side we'll get into that in a minute but God was not built on the Earthly side right God was built on the heavenly side am so he can't make a mistake whatever thought comes into his mind it has to be expressed right or he's not God right and see now we don't understand that to a degree because we're human we decide to do this and deci God said see it says God said Genesis 1:26 God said so it's going to happen Okay God said it so God created let's look up that word create in the Hebrew because I want us to look we're talking about the DNA of God now I want you to kind of bear with me because later on you're going to have to shove this a little while and then and then I'll bring it out later on Look up the word or the phrase gene expression because DNA is what is that big long word deoxy ribonucleic acid it's the strands of life ain't that right Aaron he G me a yay buddy well hey I said something about you preaching and you wasn't back there so you back there now so you did a good job wonderful job but DNA is the very strands of life and gene expression is if you if your genetic makeup was to have black hair there's nothing you're going to do about it to change it right that's your expression if my genetic makeup was to walk like my grandfather which mother says I do I can't change that yeah why because it's a gene being expressed that I have in me that I have no control over right now we getting somewhere because the DNA of God has to be the same way right not the earthy we're going to read here not the earthy but the Heavenly amen all right the earthy one is the one you see now it's the one that did come from Samuel and Peggy Dale that made me walk and talk and act and do like I am aale gene expression right so that Gene has to express itself amen so we're looking at this Genesis 126 and 27 you know I got something against you guys listen let me ask let me ask you a question if we agree on something or if we're as a church and I don't think we'll too be too fanatical to do this but when we have new ones here and they just come into church and Daddy's trying to back up a little bit and he goes through water baptism and he goes through no eternal hell and we just sit there you know if I was new you know what I would do I'd say these people don't believe what he's saying yeah he's the only one that believes what he's talking about how about a little hearty amen every once in a while and that's not put on that's right that's not put on you should say amen amen well I know about water baptism I've been water baptized for 40 years well you know what that person hadn't right and when you first heard it you know what if you sitting in a dried High church and they never nobody said amen you'd probably go I don't know if they believe what they even say right just an amen you don't have to shout youin got to run the aisles just say Amen in unison amen let's do it one time amen now doesn't that sound good see that means you agreed with what I said now if we had somebody new here they'd go boy them people believe what he say so you know just try to do that we've got a lot of new people coming in and out something's something's got to strike somewhere because they're coming close I mean we're looking for the last one everybody is and then the last one walks in and we don't amen if that's the one we're looking for that's the one that's got to be born again before we get out of here I don't care what we do all right we can still sit here all day and go to funerals which I hate to go to funerals amen cuz if time goes on I'm going be coming to y'alls y'alls amen just say amen amen amen but look but look watch now let's get back but really when somebody comes it's not a show we should amen all the time but at least give a good hearty amen when brother Dale you know he was saying something the other day and and uh I said amen but nobody did and we had like four new ones well when they're new they're they're real they're real soft they're very impressionable they're very impressionable you were very impressionable when you walked into a church church and you're trying you're like a sponge you're trying to soak all this up you know that brother that brother West I don't know if you don't mind me calling his name but he was sitting back there on the edge of his seat Sunday listening to what brother Bob had to say on the edge of his seat not asleep he was on the edge of his seat he was setting up just like this had his up here on the I mean he was back there but he was up here he was right sitting on the edge of the seat and he was soaking it in amen well hey man what greater opportunity to let your light shine you don't have to go downstairs and testify to him just say amen amen amen means so be it so we got we need to so be it a little bit more but remember that comes from your DNA makeup of God yeah you got to overcome the one that Mom and Daddy gave you because that Genesis 126 and 27 group ain't quiet right right amen they ain't quiet they going to shout when we get to Glory they're going to shout right cuz they had a birth but now watch the word created when God created see look what he did he says to create obviously but look to shape or form to fashion right so what did he do he fashioned a group of people just like him exactly he fashioned a group of people just like him not different cuz remember we were made in his what image and if his image is thus that's why I said Gene gene expression if you'll look it up it'll strike your heart because the reason I look the way I do is because of them two right their Gene is expressed in me naturally now what about when we're born from above right amen doesn't matter like like Bob said Sunday doesn't matter if you're ugly that McCarthy guy whoever he's talking about I think he would May talking about himself he just using another name an alias but you know it it doesn't matter it's like Bob said he said you look somebody said how in the world that guy God use that guy well that ain't none of your business right and he can't help the way he looks because of his mom and daddy right but the character brother brandham always said look at their character he said I don't care if the guy smells like a horse right he went through a whole whole list I don't care he said but if the man has character GL okay well that's what God's looking for you know what he's not not looking for your character he's looking for his character right shape and form right fashion of Heaven and Earth obviously and of individual man and of new conditions right he knew we would be born humans that wasn't that wasn't a surprise to God he knew we were going to be humans that's why the the the the great teaching now that we're hearing on for knowledge is probably one of the greatest things that's helped me in the whole message not just one item not just predestination but the whole message to me is based on a revelation of for knowledge because a revelation of for knowledge will take a quote that seems Seems you hear me seems off with a quote that others want to use and you know what with for knowledge and the revelation of for knowledge and how for knowledge has been placed in the word they come together right they come together right that's where you get good teaching good teaching does that you know what teaching places you in the body what it puts you in a place to where you rest right you see people they're tossed to and fro why no good teaching they just get good preaching amen right preaching saves people I has no no doubt brother J for tell you he's an evangelist period he don't want to be nothing else you know what he gets people to the altar he gets people saved he gets results with prayer you know what that's his job right and you know what he doesn't step out of that that's why I know that that's a true gift that he's got he doesn't step out of that gift you know why that's the gene expression right that God saw a black man that has been off offered several churches he's been offered several churches to be a pastor and could have done it just like that and he's turned them down every one of them right and he goes out on the field 88 different churches he preached at a couple years ago different churches now there's only 52 weeks in a year so figure that out he preached a lot I didn't say 88 sermons I said 88 different churches he preached in so you know what he's getting the gospel out though and he's getting the people he's an evangelist so he's doing his job he is expressing what God saw before the foundation of the world that that man juel forny would do he is definitely not expressing the genes of his mom and daddy that brought him here sure he does in body form as he walks and talks and looks at himself in the mirror but God has transformed him right he's really only 18 or 20 years old so are you if you're born again all right but remember God created we got to get finished here God created so God fashioned man in his own image so we can take that word created it's like brother Joe and I were talking you have you ever done this I want to show you something Have you ever clicked on this here uh in some of the other ones it says click here to view all verses that use this Hebrew word have you ever done that before amen click them all it may not be the same word but it has the same meaning and boy it will actually open your eyes to uh to you know what the Lord has because it's in the original it's in the Hebrew and the and the Greek all right so there's the word created I want us to see this this expression now let's go to God said to be fruitful and multiply now let's go to multiply first and then we'll go to fruitful multiply means Roba now you say multiply means oh that means if you got one then you do something you got two and then you do something you got three you got four gene expression right to B become great B become many in other words to be CU Genesis 1 was to it was that be you are then become become much become numerous right to become many I love that to grow grow great it doesn't say it's always put that word great in there right so that's what God did he said be fruitful and multiply we always say oh well he and it is it is spiritual multipication but God becomes greater now remember it's not God becoming greater it's our revelation of God Amen becoming greater God knows he's great I'm sorry I mean God does he knows he's great he's the only one there's nobody besides him he's jealous he said that's God you know what the reason we are what we are is because God's what he is right now take out all the sin and look what you got a pretty picture all right we just say well we're not like God we're ERS to be like Jesus right to be like Jesus become great right become many become numerous all right so look at that word now let's go to fruitful or actually we can go to replenish if you want to we can go to replenish all right the word it said multiply and replenish everybody wants to say well what does replenish mean fill right you multiply and replenish the Earth what fill it up with who you no him right fullness abundance to be full be accomplished be ended right the end of us is the beginning of him right Amen to consecrate look at all these to be armed to be Sav Saied that's what the word replenish so when he says be fruitful and multiply and replenish the Earth doesn't just mean what I'm trying to say is everybody's in the angle we took it a lot of times is that it means we're going to repopulate the world and that's true Christians we're going to repopulate the world all right but he's not exactly telling us to just go multiply oursel he's telling us what we are right you see anything negative in any of that no I didn't think so all right now look at the last one fruitful be fruitful means to bear fruit right whose fruit love joy peace longsuffering all those things see Paul picks that up from the Old Testament amen didn't Paul read the Old Testament and wrote the new out of it God give him a revelation of what he was talking about Paul read Genesis 1:26 just like we're reading it tonight right but he read it in the Hebrew and man he's telling us say look this this man is bear fruit be fruitful to cause to bear fruit to make fruitful to show fruitfulness right so there are some of the characteristics of this Genesis 1 26 and 27 man and it's it's wonderful to look back do that go click on these words if they're underlined in your in your folio views if they're underlined you there's a meaning behind it so you just click on it and it'll show you the meaning and it'll take you to other to other links are other words so God said be fruitful multiply and replenish the Earth all right now who did he give this quality to first he gave it to Adam right right he give this quality to Adam first and then Adam was supposed to take what God give him under condition remember it was a conditional it was a conditional Covenant right Abraham had the unconditional Covenant actually Genesis 3:15 is an unconditional Covenant I'll do it but before that he said if you'll eat of this cuz see it says here it says Genesis 2 verse 16 you don't have to put it up there the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat right but just one tree not two right exactly you see that but of the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it now he didn't say nothing about the tree of life right did he didn't say you couldn't eat from that they couldn't eat from after they had already eat from the Tree of knowledge of Good and Evil right all right so Adam here we go with Adam and I want to read you some quotes because Adam did what God Said up to a point and when that uncond when that conditional Covenant was broken Adam broke it exactly Adam broke it all right Eve didn't know what she was doing Adam knew full well right he was selling us out when he took Eve but you got to see that Genesis 1 there's another DNA attribute of God is that he wasn't going to let that wife die right just like he's not going to let the bride die right same thing all right but now he could literally look at Eve and go that is Flesh of My Flesh and bone of my bone I mean dick Gail's been married for 50 58 years and youd ask you 58 years 58 years now there one and listen in God's eyes they're one right but now they're definitely not one come from the same body you understand that but Adam and Eve literally were one right when he said bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh he wasn't telling a lie she was literally his DNA made manifest right amen right so he couldn't he wasn't going to let her die right but now listen as we've said it before cuz we're going to read these quotes but remember Adam was not I don't know how to say this he wasn't a SP a sperm donor yeah everybody's preaching that he planted his seed in Eve to save her can't do that right literal seed has nothing to do with God right nothing he permitted all this to happen to get you here listen there's no other way he could get you here that's what we'll talk about in just a minute according to God's plan the only way you could get here after the fall was to a a woman and a man right cuz remember right by man you live brother Brown said by man you live by a woman you die right right exactly but now remember you can't haul that all over and say well Adam well no the Bible says in Adam all die but Adam was of the earthy man right Jesus Christ was not like thaten he was born a baby all right but Adam watch I want you to watch this let me read this quote and then we'll we'll kind of look at Adam's I was thinking about this today and it really struck me and and and I hope it blesses your heart because it really blessed mine if it doesn't bless yours it bless mine anyway I've already been blessed I'm just giving you my blessing right all right so in the Messiah 1961 brother Bram says now I'm going to read the whole quote all right so we can get the essence of what he's talking about now Isaiah 9:6 we just won't read it but he was to be the Everlasting father the Mighty God now I want you to think in your mind while we're reading this quote about Gan expression think about this all right the expression what was given to Adam to express all right listen God made man Genesis 126 it shows if you put in that scripture down Genesis 126 it shows that God made man to be a God to begin with not a big G right a little G exactly there's only one big G amen right right man was made to be a god a Lesser God right he was made in the image and likeness of God he had hands like God he had feet like God eyes ears and intelligence now he's talking about the Genesis 1 126 man that is the intelligence of God right that is the mind of Christ Paul's talking about okay you see how all this is this Genesis 1 that's why I love this scripture it just to me it just unfolds everything the whole plan that God had he had a group of people sure that was predestined to make it Destiny was determined before the foundation of the world but not that he put you in this glass and said oh I'm going to take you out no you had a choice right and him knowing that choice could have this all waiting for you right when you got here what a great God what a greater thing to know that I was lost I was headed in the wrong direction I was telling somebody this the other day I I was telling them up in in U at brother Duchess let me just ask you this just stop right here just a second what would it be what greater Brother Gary would it be that if God came down when you were a baby and gave you eternal life and your life was just going to be that way and that's just the way it was going to be and then I'm going to take you um when you die I'm going to take your soul to heaven and you're going to live with me eternally or know that you were lost born in sin shapen in iniquity have all these problems troubles and trials and tribulations and God kn on your door right and you accepted it Glory then after that you had nothing to do with it absolutely I know the quotes but what greater you take savior away from him you take all these other attributes away from him if he just put you in a tube and pulled you through and said you're mine and you're going to be it and that's just the way it's going to be what greater for somebody to find me lost than for me to be sitting at home I know where I'm at when I'm at home but what about when I'm lost somewhere and somebody finds you oh what a great God I'm I'm telling you people take away from from the very essence of the they think they they think they got these quotes and you know what I'm telling you that's before 65 yeah pretty good Aaron wasn't it that's before 65 you you hear false Doctrine that's pr65 that's not after 65 all right praise God do you know what he gave you a five-fold Ministry for the perfecting of the Saints not a onefold a five amen all right this was one man bringing us a message sure but it wasn't this man bringing us the message right it was that same one from that Genesis one man right look at for his kids right I was lost sure he knew I was going to be saved sure eternal life always was sure this gen we'll talk about in just a minute the the characteristics of this Genesis one man is just awesome awesome cuz they never did anything wrong right not even a speck right let's finish this God he had feet like God eyes ears and intelligence like God right his whole fiber H so that goes back to the Genesis 1 126 man that goes back to the gene expression fiber every fiber of your being right all right because he was a Son of God and Jesus referred to him as God right Jesus said how can you condemn me saying I'm the Son of God isn't it written on your law that you're Gods right they must have had a brain lapse or something cuz I'm sure they read that a million times you're gods you're gods and if they call those Gods who the word of God come to how can you condemn me when I say I'm the Son of God he was referring to the prophets the anointed ones lesser anointed Jesus was so anointed that he was more than a prophet Jesus was so anointed till he was the fullness of the godhead bodily he was God the prophets had the same kind of anointing only in a lesser condition right and it was just an anointing right it wasn't an indwelling right it wasn't a filling right it was anointing you want to just be plain Isaiah wasn't part of Genesis 126 nope Genesis 126 is God's kids by the new birth Amen period Glory Genesis 126 is his children by the new birth no other way foolish virgin is not in Genesis 126 when God made this man in His image he made him just like his glory just like hisself yes sir we act the way we do amen and in Genesis 1:26 when God made man he made him a God because he gave him a Dominion he had rulership he had power over the birds of the air the cattle the wind the waves fishes of the sea everything he had dominion over everything he was a ruler right anointed a ruler because he was in the likeness in the image of God with an Earthly Dominion right that's why the Bible says the Earth is groaning crying waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God Amen the world is waiting for the man to come back into his right estate glory amen now he has made in the image of likeness of God that makes his when God made him God gave him some of his spirit part of his life and he's in the likeness and the image of God right therefore like here in the man in his natural condition the way we are now you can see that he's much more than an animal as they try to say we are because man in his Fallen estate yet being a fallen Son of God he still can better himself he has an intelligence he builds himself a better house in living conditions all right let's go to number two excuse me fundamental foundations of Faith 1955 all right man was made as a secondary God on Earth he was given the power to control all things you know I told somebody the other day everybody thinks we're in the Millennium you know we got these people that that thinks we're in the Millennium you know what I've always said let's take him to the zoo we'll find out but you know what I know for a fact because we were down looking for a place to put a deer stand the other day and I thought buddy if that tree was right over there yeah if I could just get that tree to go right brother D how many times have we looked around and go I wish that tree was right over here well you know what if we was in the Millennium that tree would have been over there all right you say well that's too much well listen we're going to get into Adam just for a few minutes and then will quit because Adam had full control of this Earth full control it said every creature right cuz we're going to read it right here man was made as a second God on Earth he was given the power to control all things all elements of the earth that was Adam Adam was given these great Powers but then the power that he was given to make himself is where he fell all right and Adam could speak to the wind and it would stop he could speak to the trees and they would obey him he could speak to the wildlife it would obey him he could speak to the waters every what it is everything obeyed Adam now that is the beginning of man that's what God gave him power over everything on earth now though the fall he lost that power then he becomes unconscious of the fact yeah exactly see if we were if it had not been a fall Adam would have brought us forth and we would have a had a conscience of what we were but being the way we are brother Brown I read you the quote the last time preach that part was blackened that part was blackened away from us all right that he becomes unconscious of the fact after losing his relationship and friendship fellowship with the father then he lost that and all of his great channels became clogged up and he couldn't get through now look and what Adam was in God Christ has redeemed us back to that amen right God has redeemed us back to that right amen Christ come as a redeemer no in what he lost in the fall Christ come as a redeemer did you ever stop to think what Christ redeemed us for he gave us etern everlasting life right he brought us back to the Eternal fellowship and relationship to God to be his sons and daughters again to restore back all that Adam lost in the fall exactly he didn't say some right he said all glory all right now look now let's look for a second we know that Adam before the fall what he had control over we're not going to go through that again had control over everything in other words God was one of the greatest CEOs in the world he said Adam you my right-hand man down here on Earth I'm going to take care of what goes in heaven goes on in heaven you take care of what goes on on Earth and he didn't come down every day and say Adam now you are you are you watching no he knew that Adam was equipped for the job now knowing they would fall knowing that would happen but watch because if you'll reading long enough in the in the in the message I'm I'm not read any more quote so I'm just going to read another scripture in First Corinthians but not right this second but if you'll look that's what I was thinking about today everybody thinks and I'm telling you everybody thinks that when when Adam was formed and God breathed into his nostrils that that was his eternal life now that's not true daddy read the quotes the other day not this na natural he said life he said because remember you say well well I have a question about that too well Adam was made a human man right right and then God put that Genesis 1:26 in that man amen Adam all right let's prove it today I got the proof let's prove it now if Adam was born not born but came into the World created with eternal life he could have had had the quality could have had you hear me the quality of a redeemer cuz he'd be the Big G yeah Adam's problem was he was the little G right the Redeemer attribute was not in Adam right the Savior attribute was not an Adam right right if so he could have saved right he didn't save Eve he protected her right God honored Adam just like God honored Abraham right exactly brother BR said God would have killed Sarah right but he had to go through Abraham you know what God would have killed Eve right but he had to go through Adam right Adam still had that God quality amen that's right yes sir right even in Fallen condition we got a god quality amen all right you know I was we were talking about the other day everybody says boy you had that you know everybody said boy you had that seed in there and that was the Deep calling to the deep and that was that eternal life calling to well brother bandam said everybody had the ability to worship God right brother everybody I've got a quote back there in the back that says every man is a creation of God and has a longing to serve God Amen you just have the choice whether to let the god do it or let the worldly God do it there's your choice so you do have a deep call everybody does listen folks for God to be just listen on the internet wherever you are if if somebody tells you that you've got eternal life when you was a baby they're a liar they're a liar right when are we going to say it right that's a lie but there was a day that I received that eternal life I wasn't born with it right but there was a longing look for God to be just he had to put that longing in every seven billion people that's alive right now on Earth there's a longing to serve God if not he cannot put you at judgment and say you go to hell right that's right to be just that's the first thing it came to my mind when I heard that being preached the first I said God you you said you're a just God and a and he is the just God he's not just just like we're just in our court system cuzz we can fail he's just Glory he knows those who he's Justified he's already glorified that's cuz when he justifies something it's all the way through but see to be a just God he can't say well you know Mark walks up to the white Throne judgment and he says well God you didn't you didn't call me and God said no I didn't you're going to hell well now look is that just no it's just for every a person to walk up and God said I called you when you were 12 14 25 85 95 I called you right here don't you remember that time I called and you took the god of the world over me there's the choice I told him before brother bham never took the words choice and free moral agency out of his sermons never he always preached free choice free moral agency Free Will right cuz then you can walk up and if you said hey you know God you you didn't ever call me he said yeah and you know what that'll come back to your mind right exactly that makes him just that makes him he they know that they're judged right there so you keep that in your mind God is a just God right everybody has an opportunity even Cain the man that come from the the U act between a woman and a and a animal had a choice right my if he did we're okay right cuz that's the brother Brown said that's the epitome of evil Cain was the epitome of evil right why he made a choice he had a longing to serve God you know why he made sacrifices oh yeah didn't he went to church every Sunday right hey probably might have missed a few taking care of his sheep the devil never misses when you're not g when you're not here you love the Lord but here's Adam's dilemma Adam's dilemma was like I said now you you can take and you can see well now why didn't Adam well he didn't have that attribute he didn't have an attribute of healer of Savior Adam couldn't heal anybody God proved he was a Healer by closing up the wound Amen in his own side right amen and remember brother Brown said Adam tried to go out and get Eve and bring her back and what happened he couldn't right cuz he was Adam right 1 Corinthians 15:45 let's turn and read that so as it is written the first first man Adam was made a living Soul the last Adam was made a quickening spirit all right how be it that was not first which is spiritual he was Earthly then the spiritual was put into him right but that which is natural and afterward that which is spiritual so you come here natural then if you're born again you get the spiritual right pretty self-explanatory the first man is of the earth earthy the second man is the Lord From Heaven amen all right Jesus said you must be born from above I cannot understand the first sermon Jesus preached you must be born again and people want to say you already got he should have like Daddy said he should have talk to Nicodemus said Nicodemus all you got to do is believe that I'm I'm the U you know the great one I'm the Christ you all you got to do is believe that no he didn't tell him that you know what Nicodemus had a knowledge that he was something special right or he wouldn't have come to him like I said he was he was risking his life from talking to that man but he wanted to know what was going on with this man that was different but the second man is the Lord From Heaven as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy human and as is the Heavenly such are they also that are Heavenly as we have been born the image of the earthy what I'm looking at now right we shall also bear the image God created us in his what image so we're right back to Genesis 1 we also shall bear the image of the Heavenly now this I say Brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God neither does corruption inherit incorruption all right so in other words we're not going to take listen now we're not going to take the same body listen you know how we believe it here but this body has to be changed but it won't lose its characteristics exactly but it's going to be changed to match what's inside amen cuz we are definitely over 20 most of us so we're heading back in that direction right so this is flesh and blood this is not going to inherit the Kingdom what is our inheritance our inheritance is Genesis 1 126 amen right that's our inheritance and Jesus we Adam lost it listen how simple this is Adam lost it right how simple Adam lost it he lost the ability to bring a Son of God into the Earth right remember brother Bram said what happened in the garden was is Satan stopped a Son of God from being born cuz when Eve's womb was polluted remember when Eve's womb was polluted God said I can't come through that no more all right so in other words Adam couldn't produce he produced his own DNA he produced his own gene expression in Abel and Seth and all down the line in the natural genetics but he couldn't produce another spiritual person amen everybody understand what I'm saying he couldn't produce another born again or another Genesis 126 man CU brother Ram said Adam lost the book there's Theo see that's why you when you say book I go back to Genesis 1 126 right that's the Lamb's Book of Life amen that's why it was written before the foundation of the world exactly that's my inheritance and Adam stopped me from coming the way I should have come right but what happened to the second Adam he was the Lord from Glory right he was able to produce what he said because remember when Jesus Christ was born in that manger a little baby God Almighty entered that body okay and all the attributes of God entered that body right that didn't do away with God right you understand what I'm saying do away with God but if he was the fullness of the godhead bodily what was inside of Jesus right Genesis 1 26 and 27 that's why he wasn't just called Jesus he was called Jesus Christ there was many Jesus's people millions of them brother R said I know millions of jesuses jesuses but there was only one Jesus Christ GL see Jesus Christ created all things amen right exactly that's why that this Genesis 126 man that's why Adam he portrayed Christ but he wasn't Christ right if he was Christ he could have saved Eve is that okay so that so that makes it to where Adam is a is a person and then just like me and you we're a person and then that had eternal life when we accept it now remember Adam didn't have a choice he just he got it right but see God was going to get God had already told him what to do so he couldn't back off of Adam he told him what to do replenish the Earth subdue it do all these things he told them before they even got in flesh so he'd already told them what he wanted them to do and God can't change his mind right but it was messed up because of Adam his dilemma was is he wasn't the Christ now he portrayed Christ you understand what I mean brother Brown never said he said he portrayed Christ when he took Eve right he portrayed Christ what he showed a characteristic that's why in the Old Testament you can see the characteristics of God but that's not God in human flesh right one more time amen means so be it amen that's why in the Old Testament you couldn't have any Genesis 1 126 and 27 people right because Adam from Adam on down he couldn't produce but now watch now when the great one come Jesus Christ came with that Genesis 126 and 27 in him amen cuz brother Brown said if if I'm in Christ I walk the shores of Galilee right what in that soul of that individual called Jesus Christ he had me in him right just like my father had him had me in him right I wasn't in my daddy when I was born right oh I'm sorry my daddy wasn't in me when I was born I was in my I come from my father okay I had to be birthed right to get here everybody understand what I'm talking about you couldn't find like I was telling them up there you you couldn't find and like Daddy said they did all these great things with the circles and all this stuff you couldn't find me as a as me you looking at me right now right you couldn't find me and my daddy right there's no way you can say that cell was way Dale and here it comes and his s daddy you know he eats and uh you know the sperm comes from blood and it's highly congealed blood and then you understand what I'm saying my name wasn't written on one of those little germs right I'm trying to be carnal but I'm trying to make an illustration here but I but when I was developed or when I was born what happened I became a gene expression right of my father amen so in his genetic makeup I was there exactly so in Jesus Christ in his genetic makeup Brother Gary when he said let us create man or in other words let us fashion or in other words let us develop not create Brother Richard as nothing and then no you always was if that Genesis 126 was with God way before amen there was ever a world that's but remember what's happening now and this struck me the other day what's happening now brother B always says you don't remember you know when I was born the only thing I remember I was telling Jacob today I remember the first thing I remember as a child was when we were building the house up on the hill there in Gillsville which means that was 1964 65 I was 5 years old there was a it's funny how things stick in your mind but there was um a man putting up sheetrock and at that time there was no there was no of none of those razor blade knives everybody remember the old Hulk Bell yeah M that they use old Hal halt Bill and they kept this sharpen and that's what they cut the that's what they cut the sheetrock with he had it stuck in his back pocket Brother Martin he was bent down like this doing something well it was sticking out just like that I ran by and slid a big old place in my leg and it's still numb now good thing didn't hit me in the head be numb to this day don't say nothing ter nothing at all but you know I remember that yeah because it was a traumatic time in my life you know I mean it that hurt m but see remember before that I don't you know Jim's always saying that her sister remembers when she was in the womb cuz she's got this extravagant you know memory or let's say imagination let's don't say memory let's say imagination but remember brother B said that was blackened from us that we don't so we don't remember and we weren't as people before anything right but remember when we become a a baby we become a living Soul amen God can only give you a soul Satan can't give you a soul so God gives you a permitted life MH it's permitted by God see then you now you're on you're equal you've got a choice cuz inside that me or inside that you there was an ability to serve God yeah that's right an ability cuz we were all Made In His Image but not created formed like this in Genesis 1 you got it right when we receive that at our new birth we become That Glory but now God knows that true he knows exactly you're going to come to that and he could write your name in the book but Daddy couldn't write my name in the book of The Family Bible until I became who I you know a baby right but God what I'm trying to say is you couldn't find me and Daddy well you couldn't find me in God but if I'm born again tonight whatever attribute that Genesis 126 was is in me right it's like I me and dad was talking the other day coming home from from hunting now I can look back see now I my eyes been opened right I can look back and see yes I was back there in my father in an attribute that he wanted and was going to express amen he wasn't half Hazard see mom and dad didn't know how many this going to have but God knew exactly how many children he's going to have but now remember once the once Jesus came and we'll get finished right here once Jesus came I preached 45 minutes at brother Dutch's Church the other day 45 minutes that's from start to finish somebody said praise the Lord and he sent April must have sent him a text afterwards cuz he text me back and he said are you trying to take over my church he said pastors only preached 45 minutes in this church so I preached an hour and a half the second service yeah I text him back I said I don't want your church I'm proving it but hopefully we'll get a lot said here I just lost my whole thought there and I forgot what I was talking about but we come to this Genesis 126 and 27 man that is an attribute of God right so an attribute of God is God made manifest in another form amen okay right so now as we are that oh I got it back now we can look back because we have the mind of Christ well where was the mind of Christ right where was it it was in daddy right yeah and then Paul says we must have it in order to understand where we came from right now that I understand brother Chris where I did come from I don't flip out when the when the Bible says in Job that that the sons of God shouted for joy and all these things what we were an attribute we weren't people but you know what I can look back today and I can look at that and say hey God was shouting right because he saw me and you that's why he was shouting he saw me and you yeah is that okay right because let me tell you something God had one purpose when he came on Earth was to get that Genesis 126 and 27 back on the Earth again right exactly right you said well no he was H healing and all that's fine Brother BR said that's temporary right mhm you can be healed today and die the same thing you can be healed by God today of cancer and die of cancer tomorrow a that what he said because of this human element got it but if you ever save a soul get a soul saved that's it he said a million worlds a million worlds I wouldn't if I could know that that I could that I could sell you know all of this world to have my kill children saved I do it do it in heartbeat wouldn't even think a thing about it if I had to sell everything on but Mama prove that she's prayed for us she you know laid before God and cried and begged for us and plead that that don't it does do it good you understand but until my time's ready you it's I mean you can we try to save our kids is what I'm trying to say you can't save your children God's got to save them but he does hear the fervent prayer of a righteous man why you know why he knew you were going to pray that prayer to start with exactly and I want to know and I know I got Godly Parents but brother Brown said some old grandma four generations back right you know none of your none some of you come maybe I brother Chris maybe some of your parents never were Christians you say why'd God drop down and you know why am I here I I didn't have nothing my parents I had no up bringing of Christianity some old grandma four generations back brother Brown said got on her knees and and fervently said God save all my children my grandchildren and my great grandchildren and God heard that prayer you know why cuz she had the mind of God she was a Christian woman God had to react to his own self right that's right cuz when he put that Genesis 126 and 27 seven on display that was his self on display that wasn't all the people of the world right that's the people he come to get you know why cuz you and I were in him when he went to Calvary we were there amen when he went to hell right we went with him exactly cuz that Genesis 126 and 27 let's just break it down real simple that's the soul of God right amen because the soul is the real you amen and that is the real God right that Genesis 126 and 27 man is just the real God Amen that's what he wanted all this other stuff all this superficial stuff yeah sure he'll he'll have foolish virgins and he'll have this and he'll have that but he come to get that Genesis 126 man cuz you know what he already said that we were supposed to multiply replenish and subdue the Earth right in that form amen right in that form but when Adam did what he did and he couldn't save us you know why cuz you're not our brother he wasn't born like us right he was created full grown right right but you and I come as a baby Jesus came as a baby that made us join a that's why he brought us up that's why brother brandham said he said Jesus didn't come to bring us an inheritance exactly the problem was we couldn't get to it right right we couldn't get to it right it was barred we become the earthy man and we did earthy things right we couldn't get back that's what a fall means you fall but what does redeem mean bring back right amen all right so what happened was that when Jesus came he had that in him still no way to get it out sister Maggie while he was alive right CU he was the very essence of God right he was the very attributes of God love joy peace longsuffering all those things that's what we talking about the Statue of a perfect man that's God that's God Amen that's the statue of a perfect man so so what Jesus had he had all that inside of him he had what Adam lost right right right he had what Adam lost amen the book remember he was the lamb he was the Redeemer what do you see in in Revelations 5 you see a lamb taking a book right from the hands of the owner God he took it from Adam Adam couldn't do it but somebody had to be worthy amen but what was that worthiness sure it was in one single man called Jesus Christ Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world right but here's the point what we coming to brother bro said that the seed life comes through the body right Adam's problem was he couldn't produce any spiritual seed anymore he could only produce natural seed right that's right exactly is that okay right he couldn't produce natural I mean spiritual seed anymore so it couldn't come through Adam it couldn't come through Isaiah it couldn't come through it come through what they said but it couldn't come through them but when Jesus comes on Earth the seed Galatians 3:16 that seed which is Christ was in that man amen all right everybody got that it was in that man okay the Genesis 126 had had come to Earth but it was in one man amen now he said multiply and replenish Jesus never had babies natural seed right got it so let's take that away so it had to be something on the spiritual side right cuz you had Adam was the earthy man Christ was The Lord Of Glory all right so you got Christ here with all these little sons and daughters in him right and there's no way he's not going to bring them sexually anymore cuz that's what started the brewha to start with right right so you can't you can't redeem and take it to the same thing that made it fall right you got to take it back before that multiply and replenish the Earth before they were in flesh but now we're in flesh cuz without being in flesh he can't be a savior amen nothing to save you can't save Genesis 126 exactly you can't you can't save Genesis 1:26 come on think up you can't Genesis 1 126 is eternal before the foundation of the world now if it comes into you now you can read the scripture in there in in first John where was says the seed remains in you and you cannot sin cuz Genesis 126 and 27 never sinned amen I never done it in the first place Justified we can sing at all we want to but once we realize that what we got inside of us was what was back there in Genesis 1:26 when we realize that Brad realizes who she is and what she's doing here here that man that walked up and took that book had seven horns and seven eyes he was able to spiritually reproduce himself where Adam couldn't do that anymore cuz the seed had to come through the body Jesus said a corn of wheat goes in the ground die bu alone right but if it comes up you plant one grain of corn how many grains you get thousands then you plant them and get millions they everything everything you see come from one seed right everything you see come what every blade of grass in the world came from one seed right that's it that's it that's it right goes right back to Eden again right go back to that's where it's why brother R said Satan hates Genesis and Revelations Revelations to me Revelations tells us us what happened in Genesis right exactly and Genesis is the beginning that's what Genesis means the beginning so there is your beginning right there in Genesis 126 right there at the very first of it Genesis 126 and 27 is Colossians Christ in you right the hope of glory amen on the day of Pentecost when when when God when Jesus died that eternal life came out of that body and it went to hell Amen in his mind he knew what he was doing right he had to come back resurrect pick up or pick up that body and resurrect and then more like him Bible says amen we'll see more like him that's right cuz see what how we going to see him as he is if we don't know who he is start with right I know I'm his child because I'm connected to him I live with him he he raised me but I look like him I look like Mama okay I can't deny that that's my gene expression that's what I'm telling you tonight that Genesis 126 and 27 is the gene expression of what God is cuz you're the gene expression of what your parents were so down through the church ages once 120 started in that Upper Room there was Genesis 1 right back on the Earth right there's where it started again the beginning of the creation of God right back to where brother Dale has been preaching at the beginning of at in Revelations 3:14 the beginning of the creation of God are what did we read the shaping or fashioning right 120 in the upper room started acting like Christ remember is that what they said that's why the Christians were called Christians because they what they acted like their daddy right right they acted like Christ so that's what you and I seven horns and seven eyes there's your spiritual multiplication right right and when that person that represented all of us took that book there's your Redemption redemption's over right not in 1963 three right when that Genesis 126 and 27 comes to you redemption's over when you're born again those who is Justified he's already glorified Glory that's right those who is Justified he's already carried you through your journey cuz he's with you even in you let's stand even in you to the end of the world Amen Genesis 1:26 and 27 is the gene expression of God himself right right no other not we're not the devil's kids we're God's kids and don't let the devil tell you any different but what our problem is is like brother Brown said we've walked in Blackness so much so much Darkness yeah what did Satan do he just pulled wool over Eve's eyes right he tricked her just like preachers in the pull pit right they'll trick you into believing stuff but what happens is everybody goes oh that seed well you know what since I'm born again you know what happens that seed rings out when something's not right that's right now before that when I was doing something wrong that was me ringing out that right that was me ringing out that wasn't God ringing out that was me and you and our human nature that's why the Bible says changed Paul said follow me into what read genation right when you're regenerated You're reged My Generation comes from Samuel and Peggy Dale right but when I'm reged it comes from God right so there're that part of me always was eternal never had a beginning never had an end and you know what never said a bad word never had a bad thought right that's why I said you can't save Genesis 126 and 27 it always was God they don't need saving does it but us being here needed salvation right we heard from that God knowing we would want it more than the beer we were drinking or whatever we were doing put XYZ in there he knew we'd want it more so you know what he had it there amen and you know what I don't have a problem like me and dad was talking I don't have a problem with with God sending giving you an angel at your birth right cuz God knows you're coming to it you just don't know it right but he gives you an angel to lead and guide you cuz you know what you're not if you're a son and daughter of God you're not going to die to you get you birth right don't go stand on the railroad tracks and provoke it right but right you're so you're so protected cuz he's going to have his expression amen see he's not haphazard just going to have a few kids here in no he's got so many he's going to have and that's it he's going to have so many children and that's it it's your choice whether to be in that or not amen remember Genesis 1126 is predestinated determined by God and it's going to happen right by for knowledge but we have to realize that that's where we came from we heard from what our theophany which is Genesis 1:26 and 27 is the theophany of God remember we put it on the board the other day that's the theophany of God right who can lay one charge to God's elect one if you can find one we're Bound for hell right but if you can find one and I'm born again God's Bound for hell right that's right but no no he's the one he's the Big G he's the Big G we're the Little G's right but the DNA of God just think about these things he abides he abides 139 spiral book 139 in the spiral book and listen but W hold a minute don't sing that song yet the comforter don't abide with me anymore now listen in the Revelation that this person wrote it I'm not making light of that was their Revelation
