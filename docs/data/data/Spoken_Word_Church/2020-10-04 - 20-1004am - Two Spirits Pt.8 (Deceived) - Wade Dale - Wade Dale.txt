to nothing else to hang on to around here are they so glad to be a christian to where we know where we come from know what we're doing here we know where we're going we're not like the world and you look at the world we had a festival down in uh maysville yesterday and you look around at the people and you see some that don't care and you see something that's scared to death so you got all kinds you know but the ones that are scared to death don't know the lord and the ones that don't seem to care they don't know the lord either so you know we know the lord because we have him inside of us and we know one thing's for sure i was talking to a minister yesterday he said you know it's just a time of pressure even though nothing uh in in his town they've been hit but um we were discussing where brother brown told us when he preached the countdown he said we were the ones that were pressurized for this age so we he had to equip us when when john f kennedy told nasa in 1963 or 62 we're going to the moon before the end of this decade and they did it in april of 1969 all right what did they have to do they had to equip a group of people that had to do something that they'd never done before they had never been to the moon they had never been in two or three different capsules where one's got to pull apart from the other one and all these things what am i saying if man if if that tree of knowledge of good and evil can send a man to the moon and now they're talking about going to mars then why can't we offer the tree of life realize that we're pressurized for this age and that god had to equip us so he sent us a prophet to equip us on how to navigate through this world that we're living in god bless you um continue to pray for brother dale as as terrence said sister ruth is down there now um assessing the situation so we we thank god for nurses this is there's a special place um people like her and sister amy and that's good man you can't beat that antibiotics and ice cream he'll be at church wednesday night but we need to just keep praying we need you know she she agreed to go down and check on him and uh pray for mom too she's she's a little bit nervous about the whole thing so would we all i mean that's her husband of 60 some odd years so we are praying for supernatural strength for both of them and let the body work its course you know god give us an ability to fight off infection and even if we got infection to get rid of it and then he gave us some wonderful doctors to give us medication we we agree with all that okay we agree with all that uh not denying anything but we know one thing's for sure when brother dale walks back in this room it was god that did the healing man gave him something just to kind of it's what we're going to talk about today you know that's because this is the effects of the fall this is the effects of what happened when we're what we're talking about between adam and eve brother brown said every graveyard every hospital every he named off several things happened because of that one word off in the garden of eden so but he did equip us to make it through this and that's what i'm holding on to is that he quit he said for me to that i was going to be an astronaut i'm going to get out of here so he's got to equip me just like the united states of america equip their astronauts with the best equipment even though something went wrong there with apollo 13 guess what they worked it out listen god's already got this thing worked out he knows every up and down every in and out and he is god on the mountain and god in the valley so um brother louise will be speaking it is your turn because bob brother aaron bro louise we'll be speaking wednesday night lord willing we'll have our regular service on wednesday just like this but now next sunday for sure just like this sunday we're only going to have one service start at 10 o'clock we're doing just like we're doing today anyone can come the downstairs is pretty full up here full too so we're just praying that um brother dale will get a good report and we get him back in getting back in the saddle so um we thank the lord for the things that he's given us he's given us an opportunity to serve him and that's what exactly what we need to do do it to our best all right so also today um it's kind of funny there were some more questions came in it's really not funny but today if you'll pull up the screen we're not going to talk about twins we got to kind of leave that alone we got to go back to this word deceived because the questions that were asked are good questions and and today i want to caution you that i'm going to have to say some things that may be a little i don't want you to take it rough listen because people thought brother branham was a woman hater people thought elijah was a woman hater but now look god doesn't hate women brother branham didn't hate women but a woman is a type of the church and eve was a female type of the church but remember uh you uh we've heard sermons all of us just been here a long time we've heard sermons with preachers get up here and they brow beat the sisters well i thought the bible said that you treat your wife as christ treats you we forget as men that we are all female in the body of christ so whatever is being said if there's a sorry woman a or a dog or a like brother i'm talking about do you know that we all were in our mind we were born between satan and eve born bastard children so don't get all upset when we start talking about females and what eve did and what adam did because one of the questions is and i don't the the the what's the it's not funny it's just that all the questions were asked by women in the church here every one of them not a man didn't ask one question all by the females so quit laughing there you'll who told ask the question back there but there's a recurring question that keeps coming and i don't realize i don't think you realize how deceived eve was remember the bible says she was deceived adam was not that's right right so eve as the church today whatever's happening in the garden of eden is still a deception going on today in the female church even the bride yes that's what we got to get back to that one word off that's why god sent us a prophet to put the perfect word in front of us to see what we do about it so today when we mention things about being deceived and a woman being a million times you just realize one thing's for sure you think about it sisters then you think about it brothers in the in some of the false doctrine that we've come through some of the father-son holy ghost baptism that we swallowed that's just as deceived as your sweet little wife because we're the sweet little wife of jesus christ and remember she was deceived first time in the garden she was deceived at nicaea and she's still being deceived now so that deception is what we need to cover and i want you to realize that deception is still here okay so that's what we're going to talk about but we will have to say a few things i'm going to quote brother branham in a lot of things but i'm going to talk to you just for a few minutes because listen the deception is why we're still here in the female part of jesus christ which is the bride if she was deceived at nigel because remember we end up in this church age with blind wretched and miserable and what naked and don't know it now that's what happened in the garden of eden here we come to last church age and we go right back to the garden of eden to see that eve was deceived in what she did adam was not all right now that's a bible and that's the prophet's message so let's get started here with the two spirits and look at deception or deceived and we'll look at that word but i want to um background just a few minutes so first john 4 verse 1 let's bow our heads the heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that you sanctify us for this journey that we're on lord truly this is your day but not just your day you've included your bride in this day lord that we're supposed to stand in this end time regardless of what comes what may regardless of the judas's and all the different things the diff the other spirit that's that's contacting us and trying to make us go wrong trying to give us false doctrine false word false seed lord you said there would be a bride that would be virtuous that would be white that would not have her skirts wrinkled that everything would be pure father we're depending on your word to develop as we were talking about nasa developing a crew and a ship lord you've equipped us for this but it's right here in the word we don't have to go anywhere to get it it's right here in your word father we just got to be able to look at it and not be deceived and see what god's already give to us lord in the word father we ask you just be with brother dale and sister dale be with all the bride around the world many people we talked to yesterday several pastors and several people telling them about brother dale lord they've got some of the same situations in their church so we're not alone we're not alone because we got you but satan is raging in our body he's trying to get us this way but he can't do anything unless you're finished with us father we pray that you'll be with us now and take care of us and further in this service in jesus name we pray amen first john 4 verse 1 beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits were they of god because many false prophets are gone out into the world hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesses that jesus christ has come in the flesh is of god and every spirit that confesses not that jesus christ has come in the flesh it's not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world all right now that spirit of antichrist was in the garden it was right here with john and it's right here now all right but now the second adam came to destroy the effects of that we just got to believe it remember it's pardoned not a part until accepted as a pardon we must accept that pardon you say oh i accepted it yeah you may have accepted part of it when you got your new birth you accepted the part that jesus christ paid your debt and made your soul eternal by the baptism of the holy ghost but he not only died for that he died for this thing too amen he died to turn this back to the garden of eden where it should have been that's why brother branham and christ the mystery of god revealed what'd he say all god was deported to christ all christ he poured into the church take her back to the garden of eden all right so we know that you're god little children you're of god little children you have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that's in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth them we are of god he that knoweth god heareth us and he that is not of god here if not us hereby know we now look how confident john was hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error you may be seated in the lord as blessing but now remember and brother brown tells us he talks about the children of disobedience he said he said now a child cannot deceive you as much as an adult an adult can deceive you now a little child's pretty good at it did you eat that cookie no no cookie all over that's being a liar but an adult we're dealing with an adult like i said before we we're dealing now with the apex we're dealing but now as we're dealing with the apex of sin and the apex of satan we're also dealing with the apex of almighty god amen we are the bride of jesus christ there is no second wife there is no divorce in this end time we are the bride of christ and he's going to collect us and take us to a wedding supper is that all right amen i hope you believe that because i sure do because he's not anywhere sure he is there i was thinking today you know we always and and god is a segregationist okay he told israel not to marry intermingle and they did he tells us not to enter not to marry you know three or four wives and all that thing but anyway he's only married to one spouse but he did have a divorced wife he does have what i was thinking about today was that we always we always look at the lamb's book of life and the eternal section in the genesis 1 26 man but listen folks god knows every child that as soon as this rapture takes place a child is going to heaven i'm not talking about bride now i'm talking about out in the world in india africa wherever there's a child below the age of accountability god's got a place for that person even though they're not in the plan of god as far as the salvation plan think about that sometimes we get kind of a narrow and i do like the for for god to talk about me you know because we're family but my he's got all these other names written down too all these foolish virgins all a cup of watermelon he's already got a place for them to live he made this world big enough just for enough people that what's going to be in the future home he's not going to have to make the world bigger that's right everybody's going to fit yes so why don't worry about that you just worry about being the one i want to be the one that lives in that city i want to be the one who lives in that city where the lamb is light and i don't have to i don't have to go outside and and sleep out there i stay inside and don't have to sleep amen so the lord's blessed us by giving us that information but what are we doing with that information are we just saying well that's just good information are we really taking it to heart and saying papa god thank you for building me a house thank you for getting something ready for me so that i can live eternally not just you know 70 or 80 or 90 years down here on earth eternal yeah we can't fathom that you know why because we're time creatures we got to remem we got to think about what we're doing tomorrow and what we got to do to plan our time to do all these things tomorrow don't worry about it church when the bible says i has not seen i've been trying to to dwell on that a little bit just just to see if we can go further into the mind of god not further than brother branham please help me but to go further into the mind of god than we've ever been before to be able to see through his eyes to see we know we see the plan of redemption but are we deceived like the first eve was and don't know it and we're looking at something that we shouldn't be looking at or we go down this road that we're not supposed to go down we're supposed to be on our gps god's predestinated seed or god's positioning system not man's because god don't ever say recalculating or he never says you've missed your turn no no no he's right on time every time so let's keep that in your mind eve was totally deceived she thought what she did ever how hideous we think it was she thought she was doing the exact thing god wanted her to do see if you'll remember that then there won't be so many questions of well why was this and why she was deceived period whatever satan fed her was just one word but you know he worked in that a little bit it wasn't just the one sermon thing uh somebody was talking the other day and i believe it too that that their mother always told them that um that the the uh trying to think who was that the beast was kind of adam and eve's housekeeper and that would be true because he can converse with adam and eve and he can converse with the animals so they were just kind of hanging around with the beast well here satan just jumps right in and he goes to talking it's not a one day thing listen he's worked been working for every how many thousands of years he's been working in his deception process sure he got her to believe but now remember like i said before genesis 3 14 says in the end time she'll be blind wretched and miserable naked and won't know it okay so now let's read number one we've always read it we're going to read it again listen we don't have a second service i know y'all eat a little extra so at 12 o'clock you won't be going you'll be going hey man because one service we got we there's just no stress now brother and there's no stress now remember this christ in the true church is the con continuation of the book of acts now what was the book of acts that was when god's eve was born no way man said that because that's what he always wanted he wanted spoken word children so on the day of pentecost not 1906 80 30. when on the day of pentecost at the book of acts it was when god's bride come into view now remember she's going to be deceived again later on because satan's going to work right back in there because look christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how that the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it make it lukewarm formal and powerless in other words blind wretched miserable naked and don't know it all right it exposes satan revealing his works attempt the destruction of god's people and the discrediting of god's word now look what's happening now listen satan never presented eve and said you're god's fault right he never walked up to and said look you don't even need to listen to what that guy says he's just not even telling you the truth huh no he walked up and he said you'll not surely die from the day you eat thereof you'll be his gods well see that makes the female part the feelings feel good he didn't contact adam with that adam already knew he was a god he was the son of god he controlled this whole world we'll get into that in a minute he was the ruler of this earth he wasn't a blundering idiot okay so he knew what he was doing when he did what he did christ knew what he was doing by taking on our sin adam knew what he was going to do by taking on the sin of eve right down to the time he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she's the last eve she's the eve that's going to go to the wedding supper all right we're going to take a body change on this earth and we're going to destroy death on this earth amen what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater works now not greater but more brother brahma explains that she will be an invincible army if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church listen the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life stood just like this in the garden which was who we know it was jesus christ and we know it was satan and in one place brother brown said it was eve because that's where it all came from but it had to be satan there's only two spirits god's spirit and the spirit of satan all right because remember he was cast out of heaven and came up down into the garden of eden if you'll read satan's eden which i've got some quotes here read satan's eating that's what the whole thing was satan came down here to build his kingdom he can't build one in heaven anymore because he got cast out so he's building it down here by what knowledge intelligence my revelation is better than yours i fished with him i hunted with him i don't have to go to church i've just listened to tape if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be what i like that word when it comes to the devil powerless before her amen so now let's read the second one this is the one i was going to try to get to with the twins but since all these questions popped up which is great because we need to we need to answer these questions and then move on but listen folks if we're deceived you don't know it until somebody tells you if you're deceived i'm going to tell you i'm going to show you the definition of deceived you'll do these people done a lot of things in deception thinking that they were absolutely correct amen did you get it now these are those twins again there are those two trees again growing side by side in the same earth partaking of the same nourishment drinking in the same rain and benefited by the same sun but they come from different seeds one tree is for the word of god exactly as god gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of god and changes it where it wants to now we see that even happening in the message how can you deny ephesians how can you deny not forsaking us assembling yourself together and how that you need apostles prophets pastors and teachers and evangelists for the perfecting the saints god don't change his word but the devil does one tree is for the word of god exactly as god gave it and loves and obeys it the other tree is from the seed that is anti the word of god and changes it where it wants to now we're talking about the denominational system also it substitutes its own creeds and dogmas for the living true word exactly as did cain who ended up killing abel but thank god for a prophet he says but fear not little flock stay with the word keep that word between you and the devil eve did not do that and she failed and watch this even and when the church lets down on the word she goes into the depths of the darkness of satan that's pretty powerful all right so now the next thing we want to highlight here is the law of reproduction remember genesis 1 verse 11 this is where satan gets his idea satan doesn't have a seed he can't create a seed but he can take him pervert a seed all right so now god's word is seed god has no other kind of seed amen his seed is his word and so is all these now if you plant that's what you're going to harvest the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind whose seed is in itself now remember adam at the beginning before the fall had the ability to speak the word right remember brother brown said move cloud move tree move he was he was designing the the whole that's why i said he he was god of the earth and he had god intelligence not serpent intelligence he had god intelligence all right everybody got that yes because every seed bring forth of his kind he came from god so did he but a byproduct though coming out of to help reproduce him but there was nowhere in the original um i'm trying to say this because the whole plan of god is is we came the way we did because he knew that but when he set up that genesis 1 26 man he wanted man to bring forth male and female created he them multiply and replenish the earth that was not by natural seed that was not by a woman and man in copulation or whatever you want to call it coming together sexually that was not in the original plan of god there is no sex in the plan of god but this had to be injected into the plan of god right to show his attribute of healer redeemer savior and all the different things god had to allow it because brother brown told us he said he said god knew when he put them in flesh they'd fall because they can't flesh in spirit because you can't procreate as a spirit sexually but you can spoken word amen is that all right spoken word because remember spoken word is the original seed everybody got that well i said we we may have to say some things and you might have to explain something to your kids but maybe about time you do whose seed is in itself after it's kind josh was in me sister astro was not that's why esther is not the same feature form as josh why because my dna through the bedding ground produced josh well now what the original plan of of god was remember adam had the book of life adam had the book to what reproduce god bring his children through the spoken word not through the other part everybody got that then when hell then when all the fall happened god took the book from adam because now you have to go and you have a natural polluted wound but eve's mind was polluted first you got to keep remembering that adam's mind i mean eve's mind was so polluted first she believed she was doing the right thing yes she still does that's right go over there to listen i i'm not belittling any denomination but going to baptist church today they believe they're worshiping jesus christ when they're really worshiping the system of the devil amen that's how deceived it is right could it happen here too because the framework of the christian church is where satan is at now so he's just he's trying to deceive this bride he's already got them but that's how bad it is see so that's that's the deception eve thought she and the beast were doing what god told them to do or she wouldn't have done it but she was so deceived by his what by his speaking to her by his preaching to her by his soft speaking to eve and eve just thought man this is the way it's supposed to be i'll read it to you in a few minutes where brother brown said she lifted the holy ghost veil to take a lust veil she did it all right because remember we're all free moral agents she knew they were going to fall i mean god knew they were going to fall he knew what she would do but he couldn't stop her from doing it he put everything he could out there he told him don't eat of that tree one thing he told him not to do one thing and she broke that vow of chastity to her husband here first and then the act was just what developed after you get it up here all right we'll talk about that in a minute because there was a question on that all right so the law of reproduction is every seed brings forth of its kind so you and i were born by our mom and daddy bisexual birth and we have a dna that connects us to our parents but when we got born again it's like brother brown said he i'm not the son of charles and elle branham he said i'm a son of god why because his gene had been changed on the inside guy his genetic makeup paul tells us that through regeneration or regening our inside is being changed what into the image of that genesis 1 26 man that before there was a fall that's the way we were supposed to come spoken word seed if not how else are you going to make it because there was no sex involved in the human being in the plan of god in the perfect plan of god you know why because what we're doing we're going right back to the garden of eden where brother brown said a man and a woman can hug their self hug each other and it not be a sensation he just proved that by what he was talking to about here on on the tape when he went across the curtain of time they were brothers and sisters all right so that's what but what's got to happen is that's what i was thinking were you thinking this you and i are involved in what he went over there and saw because they're because he's over there now he's over there in that sixth dimension now and you and i are involved in getting him back into this dimension amen if we don't pass away we're going to be right here and we're being right here we're going to call them through that dimension back into this dimension but death has got to be destroyed first right here all right all right so let's go to genesis 1 26 and god said let us make man in our own image and after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image and the image of god created in him male and female created he them and god blessed them so he didn't just bless one he blessed both and god blessed them and said be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth that's god's children that's the progeny or the genetics of god that's not man that's god man that's god's children and look god had to wait because because adam was the son of god we read it we read it in the in the uh in the genealogy adam was the son of god eve was a daughter of god but then when god had to take that book away from adam so that he couldn't couldn't bring the children forth because what minds got polluted first so he had to wait till the day of pentecost when he come back as jesus christ and lived those three and a half year message and gave it to paul and i mean to peter and james and john and he kept telling them go to jerusalem and wait till you be endued with power from on high because i'll be with you even in you he couldn't say that to abraham he couldn't say that to isaac jacob joseph and all those old testament saints he had to wait all that time 2 000 years so he could bring the bride that he always wanted what born by the breath of god born by the spoken word of god because remember before jesus left the earth he breathed on them and said receive ye the holy ghost now they didn't receive it right then you know that brother brown tells us that was showing what was going to happen on the day of pentecost what a rushing mighty wind was going to come and it was going to what go into the believer not on the believer but inside the believer and see that's what satan can't do that's right satan can anoint you he can get on in your memories and constant effects and imagination but if you're born again he cannot get in your soul your soul is that genesis 1 26 man that's going to reproduce god absolutely not natural children everybody okay with that those of you there to sleep didn't know what i just said genesis 5 verse 1 this is the book of the generations of adam and the day that god created man in the likeness of god made him him you know god went i i just brother bob you just gotta go go with me here god's walking through the garden of eden and he finds adam and eve and they're not afraid at this point in time and he says hey son and i believe oh eve just kind of he just kind of looks over and says he looks like you god said yeah he's my son okay that's my son they kind of looked they it was the same genealogy where did adam come come straight from god amen male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name adam remember her name was not evil after the fall in the day when they were created remember adam called her woman the man with the womb all right to reproduce adam so now let's go to number three now i believe that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever and i believe that in the beginning god made man in his own image and god is a spirit and god made man spirit man then he made him in the dust of the earth we'll get into genesis 2 7. now believe that man in the beginning well led the animals of the earth like the holy spirit ought to be leaving or leading the church today so let's go to genesis 2 7. we've been through this but this is where god puts man on earth and someone was asking about what how did that creation happen brother madam explains it he said it looks just like adam is standing with roots like tree roots into the ground because he brought him up i mean he's a master potter have you ever not have you ever went to a potter who's doing pottery now somebody these these these uh children of brother bob and sister monica the young ones the smart ones they're uh they're doing pottery and what do you do girls you take something that looks like nothing but a but just a round piece of clay i grew up working in a pottery place so i know they built thousands of them things and i had to put them in the kill and bring them out but they slap that thing on the wheel and what does the master potter do he makes whatever is in his mind he can make that pot right there or whatever he he makes well what about almighty god same thing with adam he threw some potash and 8 16 elements of the earth and he just formed adam out of the dust of the earth that's what the bible says and the lord god formed what do you form it around he formed it around that genesis 1 26 man because adam didn't look different when he was a spirit man when he was a flesh man and he wasn't old he didn't start getting old after the fall hello what are we going back to young men and women and the lord god for a man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul all right then remember he put that genesis 1 26 man inside of adam and give him eternal life according to blasphemous names and the lord god planted a garden eastward of eden and there he put the man whom he informed and out of the ground made he the lord to grow every tree what that is pleasants of sight good for food there's that colon the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil now god didn't plant those two trees he was one of them he was the tree of life but he knew that that other guy was down there with him because he kicked him out of heaven so he knew where satan was satan was right there in the garden with him tree of knowledge was good and evil is everybody right with that genesis 2 15 and the lord took the man and put him in the garden of eden to dress and then to keep it and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it or what partake of it for in the day now there's a question that we need to answer right here one of the sister another sister asked this question good question because we were talking about god creating light everybody with me even those of you with your eyes closed are you with me i know you're just resting your eyes just don't choke it says thou shalt not eat of it for in the day now the question was is the bible says the evening in the morning was the first day when he created light but not the sun and the moon well now you've got to remember brother branham stops right here for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now eve didn't die the day she did what she did the 24-hour day because there wasn't that but where did she sin she sinned in the day of the lord because remember brother brown said a thousand years is a day in a day a thousand years several times in the in in the the message brother brown talks about creation was six thousand years not just six days but remember john goes to the isle of patmos and he's on what the lord's day now brother brown said that was not a 24-hour day that wasn't sunday it was the lord's day you know jesus tells us to pray give us this day our daily bread and i don't think of a 24-hour day i think of the day of the lord you and i are in the day of the lord amen all right so that for the day that thou shalt eat thou shalt surely die now what happened why do we have to have a millennium to prove that day thousand year day has been taken up because a day is a thousand years and thousand years a day so to me god when he said the evening in the morning was the first day that could have been a thousand years that's what brother brown said i've been reading it several times he said it could've been a thousand years each day was a thousand years but it set in motion to where you and i well kind of strange the way it happens you know you and i go from morning to night right that's our day from morning you got it from morning tonight and the evening time it shall be light israel takes the evening and the morning as their first day when god gets finished with his day of the gentiles in the evening time about six o'clock in the afternoon he's going to take us out of here and then he's going to be the day with israel the three and a half year day that they're going to get from the evening in the morning is going to be the first day maybe you'll understand that a little bit later but you see how perfect god is he brings the gentiles up and gives us morning and evening gives them evening and morning we have light in the evening time we get ready to get out of here when we do the first thing he does the first day he goes over to israel in their day and what does he do to them he raptures them out from the evening and the morning being the first day so to me that would be god is sho he's setting up days but when and the the question was true there was no moon and stars and sun to divide it but remember he did divide the darkness from the light when he created that light we were talking about that wasn't just a creation it was just a it was just creation happening it was the light of the world it was god almighty creating and atoms bursting and all these different things so the lord god said it's not good that man should be alone i'll make him a help meat for him now the ground the lord god formed every beast of the field and never found the air and brought unto him adam to see what he would call them now remember where's eve where's woman she's right there she's inside of adam everybody got that say amen if this is boring y'all need to go find your ball game and you'll be left here when we get out of here you can stay in that stadium all you want to and out of the ground the lord lord formed every beast of the field never found the air and brought them unto adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever adam called him he never had to correct adam god never had to create correct jesus christ because that's who he was but adam was so close to god he had the mind of god that's why i'm telling you he wasn't deceived he knew and had to do what he did to preserve life just like jesus christ did what he had to do he realized in his journey here that he was going to have to die so that his second bride could come out so he took what sin with his eyes wide open listen he knew the whole plan he said before abraham was i am everybody okay with that he knew he had to die to get that eve out of him now this adam didn't have to die god knew he needed to help me so he took her out so adam named all the creatures and adam gave names all the cattle foul the air every beast of the field but for adam there was not found and helped me for him in other words he made male cat female cat he made male elephant female elephant he made male and female to reproduce sexually but they don't have a carnal mind brother brown explains all that marriage in divorce he tells you that you know we call a dog a for doing what she does and he says she's got more morals than most women because you know what they don't know any better they're doing what nature intended for them to do okay that's why brother brown said a woman can be worse because she can take any time we'll talk about that in a minute because that's the deception part that come with eve and the lord god caused a deep sleep to fall upon adam and he slapped and took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the lord god had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and adam said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man now look if we by the new birth are heirs of god and joint heirs with christ according to romans 8 she was an heir and a joint heir with adam coequal before the fall she was not a or a whatever you want to call it she she was pure she had she had what she needed to be the wife of of adam the man she was to help meet to be the wife of adam she had everything she needed she had she had love because we're going to talk about in a minute because remember brother brown watch what he says and you have to put these pieces together brother mom tells us he said there's agape love which is the love of god that has no sex involved no lust involved but then he said you start rolling down he said you go what to that to lust to this to that all the way down to just rottenness all right see that's what satan got eve to do if she would have stayed in her place why you and i we get in our place you and i are being females in the bride of christ we have a lover we have a mate we have a husband it's jesus christ so let's don't talk about the females being some low form because then god can talk about you about being you being a low form us males right because as you treat your wife is how god's going to treat you that ought to shake your bones and adam said this is now bone of my bone and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not ashamed brother brown said they had a holy ghost veil over them covering them now what it wasn't a veil you understand what i mean where did that holy ghost veil come from right here not a veil because remember they substituted that with their own veils when they did what they did they went and sold fig leaves and here they go they start covering everything up right right they didn't have to before and they could touch they could hug i'm sure adam and didn't set over and today if you stay over there because no holy ghost veil they were won amen they were both naked the man and his wife and were not all right genesis 3 1 here we're going through here now we know this is the fall now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field what the lord god had made so remember this was an upright walking creature this was not a snake he was made a snake after the fall to do what to cover it up because there is no snake bone that looks like a man there are different ones like brother brad said a bear and a different one you skin a bear looks like a little young child but a snake there is nothing in a snake that looks like a man's bone that's why god hid that and made him crawl on the ground now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto woman yeah god said you shall not even ever tree of the garden he's asking her a question and the woman said unto the serpent let me go get my husband and i'll have him explain it to you no he trapped her right there he trapped her right there she answered and interpreted the word for herself you know what gets us in trouble and now what gets the woman the church in trouble now instead of going to our head ship brother brown said she had to come out from under headship to do what she did same way with you and me and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said to the woman ye shall not surely die for god hath now he didn't stop right there because she's going to throw him another question but he brings god into the deal he says for god doth no now how does satan know that god knows because satan's standing there watching god through the whole plan amen and he knows the knowledge of the principles of life he know that god he knew that god set in motion that every seed was to bring forth of its kind and if two if a female dog and a and a male dog gets together and six months later there's a six or eight puppies and then they get together and there's six or eight more puppies and you do all he knew that don't you think adam knew that adam and eve both knew that they were watching it but they had a holy ghost veil up here to keep them from going from what agape love to lust all right because brother brown said when she took that holy ghost veil off she took on a lust veil and that's what's covering us today folks that's why we're all we got kids sorry we're made to procreate but we were not made to procreate sexually we're made to pro procreate just like what i'm saying brother dale preaches you catch the seed word of god here first drops down to here and god births you by that seed spoken word seed and you become that genesis 1 26 man satan just didn't realize he thought he had stopped the whole plan when he did what he did with eve but god's like i knew you were going to do that so here i got a little provision over here called grace i got a provision here called the lamb and satan believe it or not i'm going to go die for them people you won't but i will i'll go die for him and satan's like i ain't dying for him and that what he said when he come up to the at to be the the near kinsman and the boaz and ruth and he's oh yeah i'll do it and then boaz said well you got to take all this other and he said no i don't want to do that in other words you got to go to calvary satan you got to give your life he's like nah ain't going to do it what a beautiful picture though what god did it's a perfect plan it was an almighty god that's only one that could come up with that plan is perfect it can't be changed it's like i said before this 66 books of the bible and those 1100 sermons that we listen to is god speaking to us perfect it cannot be changed man has changed it is what's got us in this trouble for god doesn't know that in the day you eat thereof or partake then you're what she can see she can see already she's seeing him standing there the beast talking to her then your eyes what eyes this eye not these eyes this eye we sing open the eyes of my heart lord are we blind yes spiritually we could be blind so what happened is when he said you should not surely die and when she started partaking of that remember what i'll read you you meant she pulled that holy ghost veil off stepped into a lust veil and she thought she was doing exactly what god told her to do still brother brown says she still thinks she's doing the right thing after 6 000 or more years she still thinks she's doing the right thing that other eve i'll read it to you a minute then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as gods knowing good and evil and when the woman saw that the tree and boy you can get into this because i even brother branham in marriage and divorce if you're a man and a woman today that's been married you understand what all these symbols are a snake is a phallic symbol a tree is the same thing you understand what i'm saying so this is why moses is when he's writing this he's not going to write this in a form to where everybody's going to understand it he's got to write it in the form so that me and you can understand it the spiritual application of it but we know what happened literally yes and listen i want to stop right here just real quick because remember she was deceived listen this and and i hope i don't offend no sister in this church but when you start asking questions and you ask them like it's kind of like you think that the the beast and eve it was some kind of and i don't want to say it like the world would say it a romp in the hay you understand what i'm saying it was not some sensual um no she thought she was doing what god said to do and then it just happened sure it was a sexual affair sure it was something that threw us all into chaos but it wasn't some lustful now we know it worked its way into that but she thought she was doing the right thing like i said it wasn't some dirty something and that's what i hope we all as brothers and sisters when she was deceived that meant she thought she was doing the right thing having relations with a animal look how deceiving that is with an animal and then she's so deceived she goes to adam and says i got this new revelation and it wasn't some like i said before it's not it wasn't some lust-filled encounter he thought she was doing what god said to do so she laid down and did exactly what she's been watching the animals do thinking that that would produce what god said you know what the denominations are doing and what anybody that's deceived is doing they're trying to do the right thing because we're going to read it right here in a minute now look when the woman saw the tree was good for food i hope you understand what i'm saying that it was pleasant to the eye now look that word up pleasant that pleasant word pleasant means lustful because remember she's getting red she's taking that veil off all right because i'm going to tell you something when she approached adam and told adam what she did most of us would have never touched our wife ever again amen you understand what i'm saying adults but why did he do it he still had agape love it couldn't have been lustful love that told him to do what he did no because remember he wasn't deceived he knew what he was doing see jesus christ didn't come down here with a lustful veil he came down here with a holy ghost vow which kept him pure he knew though that brother brown says that jesus christ was so human he could have had children amen but that's not why he came he came to destroy that yes amen and to bring a bride by the spoken word of god go to jerusalem and i'm going to give you the holy ghost [Music] she took of the fruit thereof in other words she did the act and did eat what did partake and also gay and also unto her husband with her and he did eat and here was one of the questions one of the questions is is when the woman partook with the beast why wasn't her eyes open first she was deceived her eyes were not open i don't believe until she took it to adam and adam said what did you do this is what you done and then i believe adam had to step out with her what brother brown said i'll prove it to you right here in just a second i'll read it and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and brother brown tells us in this end time now look at brother branham here he is in the 60s women wear shorts to here down maybe they enter them little knickerbocker things or whatever pedal pushers he calls them and their bikinis had enough clothes on them to be halfway modest look at today but brother brown said it's a lush spirit that tells them women to put on shorts and she can go out there and cut grass in her shorts and her tank top or whatever it was and she thinks she's okay so what's the same thing it's the same devil what do you do in the beginning he said eve you're fine this is producing the plan of god he told you to multiply and replenish the earth i heard him if they're doing it in the animal kingdom why not you oh and by the way i'm here to help and that's what the devil is he shows up and he says i'm here to help i'll help you yeah right you better stay away from that slicker brother i'm saying but it's that lush veil that's on us again showing us it's like what brother brown said he said you think you've got the holy ghost and you can take off more clothes he said getting the baptism of the holy ghost shows that you are were naked and that you need to put on clothes amen the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons let's go to first timothy 2 verse 12 to prove our point but i suffered not a woman to teach nor worship authority over the man to be in silence now why that was set up because in genesis 3 god had to put it where man was the head over the woman before the fall remember they were equal but because of what she did because of her transgression but i suffered not a woman to teach worship authority over the man but to be in silence for adam was first formed then eve and adam was not deceived brother brown said he went into it i'll read it that went into it white with his eyes wide open and adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression now let's look at that word to see the word deceived means look watch this to cause to accept now what did eve accept she accepted a seed from the serpent before they did the natural act she accepted a seed in here that she was right so then the other part just happened behind it and this is where i want you sisters and brothers i want you to realize this those of you that are adults where does everything begin right here right here even in your husband and wife relationship it starts right here amen right here is where it all begins right here all right to cause to accept as true or valid what is false or invalid so she accepted as truth what the b said when in originality it was false or invalid so that's what deception or deceive means and remember she had to accept it so to me and you god's not listen i love and and i keep bringing it out i want you to realize this brother brown said the holy ghost is a timid spirit remember i've said many times before you know if it was me if i was the holy spirit and you had a door closed you know i'd be over there kicking the thing down you know why because that's my human i want to know what's behind behind what you're hiding but brother brown said he'll walk into your house remember the doors and doors and this is after the new birth this is after you get the new birth he you let him in your house but you got this door closed you got this door closed and he's not going to go over there and even snoop he's just going to politely say can i go in that door and you can say that's what that statue of a perfect man is folks that's that's the doors that we have to work on and god's not going to kick the door down god didn't kick the door down in the garden of eden right first thing you've done he come down there looking for adam he can come down there and just wipe the whole thing off and start again did he no he knew what they were going to do to cause to accept as true or valid what is false are invalid so eve in everything she had she totally denied whatever that wasn't deep down inside of her and produced what she did with the beast everybody got that pretty deceiving isn't it so that was the question when the woman partook with the beast why was her eyes open then when she gave to adam both were open she as soon when she walked up and told adam what she did and this was her new revelation i'll read it to you in a minute where brother brown says she brought a new revelation to adam well see adam looked at her and said what have you done because see god asked adam what he done so he asked his wife what have you done he said oh i got i'm i'm i'm going to produce what you're supposed to be producing i'm trying to get i'm trying to get this genesis 1 26 thing started here uh that beast preached me a sermon and i and he said oh my lord oh my lord what have you done listen to this number four position of a believer in christ but the misunderstanding was they thought that i said that adam never sinned but adam did sin because remember eve was deceived adam knew what he was doing but he did it with his eyes wide open and instead in timothy 3 it is said that adam was not deceived but the woman being deceived was in the transgression see eve actually thought she was right but satan deceived her but he didn't deceive adam he knew it was wrong but because of the love for his wife that's not filial love that's agape love knowing that that woman that even though she did what she did because you know what jesus christ didn't he saved us he didn't destroy us he saved us let us come this way but he saved us same way that's why he couldn't destroy eve he knew it was wrong but because of the love for his wife what that way back that agape love christ remember first adam is what the first christ or the first first person first adam the bible says but he was earthy why because he had to come down here and put him in flesh but he didn't deceive adam he knew it was wrong but because of the love for his wife he represented himself with that sin that she did and was condemned by the same and cast out of the garden of eden my thoughts on that is is adam literally thought he could save eve like christ saved the bride because he had that same he had that same thought process as god did but remember he was a human being he was an almighty god he couldn't transfer his life to save his wife jesus christ can transfer his life because he's god almighty he is that genesis 1 26 man okay we're just a part of that so he could fulfill it but adam couldn't that's why brother brown said adam went out with leave but couldn't come back he had to partake of the sin of eve but he couldn't take her back in the garden of eden but christ can and he wasn't deceived either amen so watch and cast out of the garden of eden listen i wrote myself a note we'll read that leave it right there but remember adam was not a common man he was a ruler of the earth he had god-like qualities i believe he knew that what is put into motion [Music] he couldn't reverse because god said whatever seed was planted that seed would bring forth of its kind right he knew that she was pregnanted by the beast and he couldn't reverse that and that's why he went ahead and did what he did with her to make sure that his genealogy was con would continue down the line because he was son of god he knew if he didn't do something that it would just be a beast and he'd have to destroy her but he what he took her but remember it wasn't never never never was adam's natural seed ever to come out of his body sorry to be plain but that wasn't the original plan it was spoken word but when he did what he did he knew the same principles of life as the same thing as as satan did he knew what he had that he could use but look what's the thing brother branham god is looking and trying and moving and begging and persuading to find a little heart that he can come into and coo and make love to remember how he took adam and eve before the world before sin came into the world look at adam what a beautiful type adam and eve was the type of christ in the church have i got that now remember eve did not sin adam sinned adam's one that sold us out folks that's why the second adam had to bring us back now remember eve did not sin adam's sin that's right not eve adam's sin not eve she was the one who did the act but adam done the sinning whew i'm reading quotes the woman was deceived keep going the bible said she was deceived she thought she was right now keep that in your mind sisters brothers she thought she was doing exactly what god told him to do and i'll read you a quote in a minute where he says she still is now it's not in this one i don't think she thought she was right but adam knowed it was wrong and now look when adam saw eve had sinned and had done wrong adam walked right out not deceived but with both eyes open but he so loved eve agape love not filial though because what happened when they take the holy ghost bell off it comes into filial love agape love is what come into you at the new birth inside you adam walks right out but he so loved eve that he took her place in death with her and walked out with her you know that number six here it is right here now women must bring forth this germ of life hurry man together by connection we won't go into that because you certainly disagree with me it's talking about what happened in the garden but it wasn't apples they taken in the garden of eden so then when when they did let it be what it made bless brother brown's heart he knew that he was discerning people thinking it was still apples you know he said you believe whatever you want to but it wasn't apples they'd taken in the garden so then when the when they did let it be what it may woman's sin man never sinned and then he corrects himself i mean man sin woman never sinned the woman was actually deceived adam was not deceived he knowed what he was doing eve actually thought she was right how many times we got to say that she was getting some new light because remember satan is an angel of light transformed into an agent agent or an angel of life that satan was giving her he's still giving her new light he's still giving her new light stay with the bible that's it the same i wrote myself a note it's the same sermons that's preached in the garden is being preached today by the devil and god puts his word out there and he said believe what i said amen kind of simple to believe that but it's kind of profound look at number seven here it's kind of long but i'm going to read it i was only 11 39. we're good lord i thought this would take a while notice she pulled off the holy veil to see what sex really was now this is satan's eating 1965. compare that what lust really would do she pulled the veil from off her eyes the holy thing that god had put over her eyes she wanted knowledge to know what it was all about so she pulled the veil off to see what it was all about that's why a woman can be deceived more than the man her feelings takes her toward that sorry she listened to the devil and noticed what a place it put her in they had done the same thing in each age thereafter boy he's coming up now in the church ages they have done the same thing in each age thereafter always taken the intellectual side and has now built a kingdom of satan knowledge his seed that he sowed and has taken the world to be an eden of death keep going now notice now look at revelations 3 the loudest in church age you think it in your mind now notice she eve is satan's queen see satan the serpent got to eve before adam got to her see that's right so he beguiled her see so satan the serpent was the husband of eve before adam ever knew everybody understand that see he beguiled her the bible said he did and she knowed that she was naked then now look at the the layout of seeing church age she eve is sitting as satan's queen what the whole world's being deceived i'm talking about the whole church world i'm not talking about the drunks and i'm talking about the church world it's being deceived by that same lie she is rich worldly goods blind naked again and don't know it just like it was in god's eden but now not because the holy veil is over her face but the lust veil that she took off god's holy veil and put on a veil of knowledge for lust and now she has a lust veil that she is blind to it being sin she's blind to it being sin because listen if you get the truth told to you of water baptism of the trinitarian doc all these different things if you're told that and you deny it then what are you you're blind to that sin that you're in that's why we're all blinded we were blinded by what satan's lie she is naked on the street and don't know it see naked and don't know it now look at genesis 4 verse 1. look how deceived eve was even after all this and adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the lord she still thought that plan was going to work somehow she still thought and we know that god had to give cain life because of what because of what he said in genesis 1 verse 4 or 5 and there where said every seed has to bring forth of its kind all right so let's stop right there and i've got some more quotes that you don't have but i want to read them to you and this will help because as many people in this message of pull-up number a now you don't have them in yours but you just have to read them off of here watch what happened now look there's a lot of people in this message believe that adam had to have sex with eve to save her now it's it's well known everybody most of the ministers are shaking their head we know who preaches it but to me that's not right adam's natural seed is what destroyed this world not made it better he couldn't save eve that was the problem adam saved no one adam couldn't save himself they still needed a lamb abel needed a lamb even righteous abel the bible says in genesis i mean in hebrews 11 abel's righteousness though was that lamb that he took for a sacrifice amen let's read this right here just couldn't wait so the sperm of eve never happened hybrid to satan's lie his lovely bride become polluted and so has crossbride the bride what made her become polluted adam's bride now question because she never stayed with god's word god's word was not to create sexually it was to create by the spoken word of god okay has everybody got that i asked now if it's not so don't say it but if it's so say it the reason that god's the reason that adam's bride there's the three adam christ god the reason that adam's bride never did bear right the life child it's because she disbelieved god's word she took in other words she didn't take on a spiritual atmosphere she took on a natural atmosphere and took on a natural seed everybody got that right but now what did what was that natural seed one was from the beast and one was from adam they both were born dead okay is that right say amen congregation says amen the reason that jehovah's wife was put away what in the old testament god had a bride called israel all right the reason that jehovah's wife put was put away what she went out what not prostituting so much her body children of israel didn't just become a bunch of natural it was what they did spiritually they went after idols they went after all these different things that god told them not to do they went after him and what did he do he put her away the reason that jehovah's wife was put away or his bride was because that she rejected god's word the prophet that right tell amen the reason that christ's bride is put away in divorcement nicaea this is getting up to us now it's because that she rejected the word of god what took on a trinity took on a water baptism that was false like eve did like the rest of them did amen exactly now i'm just reading all all polluted their husband couldn't get to them they was already pregnanted before their husband got to them oh god if that ain't a pitiful sight think of a young man coming to a woman and find her with seed of some other man in her what a thing that's what god has done that's what adam done that's what christ has done so let's read number b this is in the breach now if if adam's seed was just some of this wonderful thing let's read what the prophet said because remember nowhere in adam's experience was he supposed to have uh natural relations with eve right i mean isn't that true because that's what got him in trouble you got to do the reverse now couldn't we stop here just a minute and get our real sermon oh then if the blood has cleansed it back what about now look what that son of god the second adam did said the works that i do shall you do also see adam lost his inheritance the earth now it passed from his hand to the one he sold it out to satan because remember this is the god of the evil age the siblings he sold his faith in god to satan's reasoning therefore his eternal life his right to the tree of life his right to the earth belonged to him and he forfeited it every bit to the hands of satan now i want to explain something right here he didn't lose the eternal life that was in his soul he was the son of god he comes straight from god he was part of that genesis 1 26 man it was just that his now his body had to die and just think how strong though that body is you read how many they live 900 can you imagine living sister cletus 91 2 1 8 no 7 35 but could you imagine living 900 years 900 years that's how strong their body was that god give them in the garden give them good food to eat even though he cursed the ground 969 years can you go back 900 years you'd be back in what good grief you'd be back in the 1400 you'd be back in 1100 a.d could you imagine living from there till today i mean even my dad at 80 years old he's seen go from a horse in a buggy to a to an astronaut in his life just in his short lifetime what do you think about that but they eventually died yes why because they denied what was in the garden of eden they denied the tree of life look therefore his eternal life his right to the tree of life his right to the earth belonged to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of satan he passed it from his hand to satan and we're going to read that next sunday in genesis 3. we'll actually start with genesis 3 again where god condemned all this but i had to cover this because of the deception that i want us to be aware that you know what you and i are still deceived until we get to the body change there's a small part of deception there's a part of us in us right now sorry that's being worked out out of us that we're just gonna have to die we can't make it we can't do this i'm getting old abraham never had that in his vocabulary abraham said god you promised it you're going to have to make it come to pass that's what we got to depend on we can't depend on yeah we depend on doctors we depend on taking vitamins we depend on losing weight we depend on doing these things but you know what you can lose in one second but you can't lose your eternal life if you get it inside here you're just as eternal as god is therefore now it has been watch this it returned and has been polluted now look the seed of adam natural the natural the seed of adam has destroyed the inheritance that adam should have had when he did what he did with eve to take on her sin he destroyed brother brown see he destroyed everything that adam should have had that's the earth that's right the seed of adam let's go to number c and then we'll be done prophet god this is still in the breach this is paragraph 111 now what happened the polluted seed of adam natural has polluted and absolutely destroyed this land so we put all of that on eve oh at least if i eat was this eve with this big well you know what eve was deceived she thought she was doing the exact thing god said and the prophet of god says she's still deceived today look how strong that deception is but it was the polluted seed of adam when he did what he wasn't supposed to do to bring children forth sure adam was i mean eve was a part of it because remember they were one that's why i believe that agape love took over adam so he couldn't kill her he loved her so much i just read you the quote he loved her so much he couldn't see or destroyed so he had to keep going in the plan of god to keep his seed line going because there was going to be a natural bee seed and we'll talk about that next sunday there's a natural bee seed that went out and then there was a natural seed of adam that went out in the beginning no doubt cain was not from adam cain was from the wicked one abel was from adam seth was from adam and everything else cain was basically by himself he didn't have a daddy he didn't look like adam he looked like his daddy that god had destroyed before he was even born you ever thought about that so he was born a bigger guy a hairy guy or maybe something like that now what happened the polluted seed of adam has polluted and absolutely destroyed the land so see there's nothing righteous in that adam except what he did to top christ by taking the bride and saying god what did what did brother ryan say adam did i mean abraham did god couldn't kill abraham i couldn't kill sarah when sarah laughed at god and lied to god what did brother brown say he said god would have destroyed sarah if it hadn't been for abraham why because she was a part of him and god honored that well guess what same thing eve was a part of adam and god honored that and because that he has did this the polluted seed of adam god will destroy them what the natural polluted seed of adam god's going to destroy you want to read this let's see i got it wrote down here turn to revelations 11 and we'll find out get over in revelation 11th chapter we'll see that god said about them who's destroying the earth which is there in revelation 11. but we put a lot on on eve and but you know if you're if you're standing in the garden of eden and especially with moses watching what's going on then you got a prophet in the end time the prophet in the end time tells us says eve was deceived the bible says evil is the see and deception i told you i read you the i read you the definition of deception or deceived it's doing something thinking you're right so she did that she never in any part of that what she did satan so deceived her she walked right into it walked right to it through it and to adam before i believe her eyes were opened when adam said what have you done and she explained it and he's like oh because what did he do he had questioned her but what did god do when god came down in the garden of eden he walks to the garden of eden he said adam who art adam said i was afraid god said what have you done remember the bible says what have you done there's something there's something going on here you me and you used to be able to talk while you back in there in the bushes with them fig leaves over your over who told you you were naked what the bible said who told you you were naked we'll read that next week who told you you were naked he said the woman you gave me that revelation that she brought to adam god said what have you done right she said the serpent beguiled me and i did eat and partake so what did god do he didn't destroy his look how awful that was think about it folks me and you all the awful stupid stuff we do there's adam and eve standing there and god knows there's going to be a fall afterwards he knows well he knew what was going to happen but what did he do never cursed them sure he cursed eve's womb we know about that but he never cursed at him he what he cursed uh he cursed the beast first then he cursed eve's womb then he cursed the ground he come right up the way it went down he came right up because the beast started it with eve eve took it to adam then he said all right wait a minute i got to destroy this god said off goes your feet on your belly you'll go dust you'll eat for the rest of your life and in other words kind of funny yesterday i've been thinking about all this and yesterday my daughter hannah come let's stand the musicians come we were i was inside the house and i just got off from work and i come in and hannah was walking her dog she come in screaming like a child and i thought that the dog maybe got run over but we've got a little friend that hangs around with us he's about almost six feet long he's as long as i am at least and he's about that big around and it's a black snake and richard's seen one down at the this is not the one that stays down at the at the barn but we keep them around because they eat um poisonous snakes and keeps poisoning the snakes out of the way but it was just the fear that was instilled in my daughter to see the fear in her eyes when she walked outside to take the dog out and there laid stretched out underneath my plum tree was that snake well see that's a fear now that snake's not going to bother you but it's just the fear that's instilled how many times have you walked up on a snake now you walk up on a little a little bunny rabbit or you walk up on a little maybe a little squirrel or something that don't scare you but you walk up on a snake i don't care folks i've seen a man melt at a little green snake about that long why it's what happened in the garden and god said i'm going to throw it every bit in that right there i'm going to throw it in that snake and there's going to be fear and there's going to be nothing pleasant about that thing right there these people handle these snakes but remember my whole point today we are all in some sort of deception until god takes us out of it until our second adam comes to us and says darling look what you're about to do how many times have god done that to us but how many times have we went ahead and done it and how much trouble have we been in right but if we'll listen to our husband that's why that they had to be set up headship between christ and the bride adam and eve christ in the bride when she got out from under her headship she thought she was doing what brother brown said look what i got this new revelation that i've got if we get revelation from the bible connected it to our spirit man that was not born of man or woman that's what makes it perfect all right but our problem is is we look at eye with eyes denominational eyes trinitarian eyes whatever eyes you don't need to go to church just listen to tape eyes that's just as bad because you can't deny the bible folks i'm saying it i i don't care who hears it the bible can't be changed brother brown did not come to change his bible he came to make us look into it more than we ever have before and we being the second eve he said she won't be deceived like the first one why because we've got the second adam not somewhere in the garden we got the second adam right here in the midst of me and you he's not just around us he's in us folks and being in us he's going to cause us if we'll yield to him the second eve is going to cause us to be the spoken word children of god just like had there not been a fall so we brother louise we're this is our mandate to destroy the effects of that fall right here we're going to a second eden no doubt we're actually going to go to a millennium that's not even ours it's just going to prove that the sin curse has been lifted because a man lives a thousand years over a thousand years but that's not ours either we're going to go walk walk out into the out in the realms of the of wherever you want to stay you say well how can you do that in a glorified body you can do whatever you want we're going to go out upon the breath of the earth and god's just going to take his hand and he's just going to wipe every bit of this off with a holy fire and you know what's gonna happen let there be light let there be trees let there be animals let there be a city and you and i are going to live in that city we're going back to where it all started amen do you believe that yes but there's bumps in the way there's bruises in the way there's toils and trials and tribulations in the way but you know what that didn't bother abraham abram got changed to abraham and he just kept getting older and older and older and older but he said god you promised it god does not mind folks if you get up or if you're having trouble you get up in the morning all the things you say god you promised you promised that we could go boldly before the throne of grace and whatever we ask for you give it to us if we ask the right way brother brown said we've got to ask the right way are we doing that like i said before we got the slate clean have we got the road clean in our life everything out of there and let god move in because you know what he wants to he's standing there at the door he said brother i'm already born again i've been born again 30 years he's still standing at some door because there's doors indoors he's knocking at a door saying can i get in there please i'll help you if you'll let me in all you gotta do is open the door you don't have to tear it down you don't have to rebuild another one just open it and let god in let's sing a song god bless you but deception remember we're all in deception until our eyes are open and true salvation oh there's honey in the rock for you say it to him oh there's honey in the rock my brother there is honey in the rock for you leave your sin for the blood to cover oh there's honey in the rock for you sing it to him have you tasted that the lord is gracious that he is oh there's honey in the rock for you singing to him oh there's honey in the rock my brother there is honey in the rock for you leave your sin for the blood to cover there's honey in the [Music] today oh lord that our eyes will be open you say i'm not deceived you're deceived there's honey in the rock for you because that's what you got to do you just say god i'm deceived when you get in some kind of trouble you are deceived you you've walked into a deception and there's only one deceiver god will never deceive you god is a receiver not a deceiver satan just wants you to be as messed up as eve was in the garden because that same devil that was doing that is right here today he said well it worked one time it's actually worked in jehovah's bride i got into israel and made them do what they did i got into the real bride and i see and i changed their whole attitude i made them i made them baptized in something that ain't him in the bible i mean i made them believe in a trinitarian doctrine that has no truth at all [Music] and he said i can do it again but no god sent us a prophet to say now the son of man's here just like he was 2 000 years ago he's god in human flesh and me and you [Music] if you have a problem just go to your husband that one just go to your husband say god i don't want to be in deception i want to be right and if you're sincere god will give you what is right whether it be your healing whether it be anything in the scripture whether it be a question in your mind whether it even be how to how to you know take your kids and and make them you know not make them but teach them to do things all that god's in all that folks listen god is in his children he's in all of us just as he was in jesus christ he's in us he was jesus christ and there's not a separate spirit in us [Music] but see has satan said no you're kind of like god see that's what he wants you to believe that's what he got eve to believe oh you'll be you'll be a god she should have told him and said look if you were back there in genesis 1 when i was i think god called me a god because i'm part of god amen is that too strong no we got to realize that what god put us on this earth for if the second adam was put here to bring us back where is that second adam he's right here he's right there he's inside of you it's the problem is is satan is deceiving us in our memory reason conscious affection and imagination look at that all those five words satan can play with as many times as you let him play so get out of that there's no reasoning in that middle man you're either faith or doubt right there so go to god pray for your pastor pray for everybody and around the country pray for your president that's okay brother brown did i don't care how bad you hate him or some of you but he's a human being that's got a job to do and guess what you need to pray for him you need to pray for each other though that god will deliver every one of us from this and we'll get it out of here and we can come back it's good to see every most of you back downstairs is pretty much full so god bless you thank you for everything with no second service so god go with you we'll be here wednesday night brother louise will be preaching we'll keep you updated about brother dale um we were talking to me and brother bob or somebody was talking about that or brother joe that seventh or eighth day is going to be rough and this is his seventh or eighth day so listen it's his body realize this your body can only get rid of something now god can take it away but your body naturally gets rid of it by fever and it either has to come out here or you understand so it's got to get out if it got in it's got to get out so we're going to pray that that thing gets out same way all of you yeah we all got health issues that we're looking at but it's the same god he don't have a a list up here that that's tough for god and a list that's not so tough no no it's not tough at all because god is the healer and we have not come this far in this journey for god to walk away from us and leave us alone he'll stay he's closer now than he was back then because he knows the devil's closer believe folks believe hebrews 11 go back and read hebrews 11. faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen oh i don't see it maybe your eyes are blinded like these have god pull them scales off of your eyes and just look down at the word of god and say god you said it i believe it and that's it you love the lord all mine's clear pray for brother dale we'll keep you updated on him he's fine he'll be okay so let's buy our hands heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us thank you lord we know one thing's for sure we cannot make it without you we cannot make it without that holy ghost fail that you have now put in our heart lord we still have to deal and live under that lust veil on the outside because of the fall but lord you knew that and you gave us provision you gave us the word of god to keep us in the things that we're supposed to do right and wrong but that inside man lord jesus it was not born of a sexual birth it was not born of a carnal mind that inside man by the new birth was born from the breath of god back in genesis 1 26 before the foundation of the world so it cannot fail it has already won and lord we just pray that we'll believe that and that you'll now send the healing angels down there to guildsville georgia lord our father and mother lord and you'll touch them lord touch the ones out in jason brother jason jackson's church lord that we've talked about father the ones brother donnie reagan's one of the different ones the different churches brother tim pruitt we we
