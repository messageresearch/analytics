had that one this morning you have to remark markers I put them in the wrong there it is and you hid it in there somewhere yeah goodness the everybody just pray that you'd keep praying for us and that we would try our best to try to keep bringing the word of the Lord you know only because that's what we're here for and today in the hour that we're living we really cherish it and thanks and you know think about the growth development that has been in the hearts and the minds of mankind over the past you know 50 60 years or the opening of the message and bringing it to us and we thank God for that and that's really something they remember now the announcements you have all of the announcements made so remember them you have a paper showing what service is and what we're doing remember that remember brother fawni will be with us not this coming Wednesday with the next Wednesday ministering for us okay father we thank you that this day Lord we can stand and proclaim that the word of the Lord has been declared among us through the ways of the Prophet and bringing it down to us and opening your understanding that we may see you because that's our desire Lord minister thoughts in our mind all of our meditations everything is based upon that one thing we know for him just delivered into our hands and give us the types of books and I what a wonderful situation but we believe it must be revealed into the hearts and minds of your little bride so we asked you to do that and got each one direct assault in your love bless those that are travelling this afternoon and just give everybody a safe journey we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen John 1 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was a lot of men and the light shine us in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not that's something then there's no way that darkness can understand the Word of God let's go to 1st Thessalonians 5 we begin but verse 15 and our thought says quints not the spirit this tries not prophesy and prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very God of your God of peace sanctify you wholly and I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless under the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord had his blessing to the reading of the word to try to pick up our thought you carry on from this morning and then the Lord within Wednesday we'll get on into the creation part and start with just want to hold your mind and your thoughts to what we're trying to get to now the purpose in the past couple of messages and we used in you know the scriptures there were that Paul was worried that Satan through his subtilty would see the minds of the people all right and you say well that can't be done it was done the church went into darkness in the Dark Ages now I know you take your vain philosophies because I've been around long enough as a human to think about what people think you take your vain philosophies of your thoughts and then you'll say well what it was the people just died and that's what went with the words you know was just the death of people well why did the church have to come out of it who was that if it was it was still and I believe and it can be proven that there is a fine line of true truth that did come down through the ages to hold to a lot of things that were good and you've got to full-on adulterated word coming up to at least the fourth Church age we're Martin than them you know and and the dead raised to sit healed all kind of things in Martin's ministry Ron said to Grady since the Lord Jesus all right now there's a line down through there in your thoughts but it won't line up because it was the bride see your prophet is the one that said the bride fell it and I see yeah let's see we want to say oh go we didn't the real bride didn't go see that's your thoughts of trying to prop up your ideas instead of saying what the Prophet said so now what's the difference in that didn't what the devil was telling Eve in the garden he was telling her tonight 9.99 5.9% truth and for us to go with the philosophies you know because I've tried to preach to people and then say well you know like I remember when I preached it on the CEOs in them feel CEO came up and we're talking about the Jews that God blinded him I had a couple of mr.brother and that differed with me and said they didn't believe God blinded him I said well the Bible says it the Prophet says it he blinded him to bring us in so I'm going to stay with that thing alright see the other things is your thoughts to try to make some reasoning factor that can do and we're supposed to cast down those things and listen to the words of the Prophet and let him describe it because he was the one to bring the message alright and in doing that that's why I vent aside so much that when that they were told in Genesis to multiply and replenish the Prophet we gave them that I wouldn't own coming promise well I just don't see how that could be did that change the Prophet saying it was no that's where I stand with that way on the work I've got to do you say well well I don't think he's you don't think that we don't have no rights to think so we read it over and over gave it to you that the Prophet said it would have finally that even Isaiah was to come to the wound of Eve and we're not talking about necessarily wound as a physical sex act as we want to call him God it wouldn't have been that anyway had it been that prophet said what the spoken word would have brought it forth all right so forget it now okay we see the spoken word would have brought through the wound of merit of Eve Isaiah into existence she would have finally brought forth that child and he's so much a Christ child see we wonder we I can't figure that out you can't figure out the Word of God quickest you get it about halfway lined up the devil of running in and there you go sailing out across the yard trying to find you another liam to land oh right the best thing to do is just settle down think about it Adam and Eve was told multiply and replenish the earth it would have happened had he not been a fall all right but there was a fall what's the difference he's happening now God is bringing forth his children right so it's not something that we that it went off because of that it's Satan helping God fulfill his whole plan all right how much did Adam understand I kind of had a little questions given to me knowing I can cover it a little bit how much Adam understood of the story I don't have any thoughts or you know knowing from brother branham and listening I remember some things too that I remember the Bible standing wasn't deceived you know like that I know the Prophet said that he sold out the human race we believe all that well then he had to have some knowledge of things but how much that was before the fall to even things produced I don't know what I'm not really that concerned but I do believe that probably he had a knowledge of the tree of life because I mean the tree of you know he would had the knowledge of the tree of life and what that would have been Christ and I believe he had a knowledge of the tree you know a knowledge of the knowledge of the tree you know now remember you're not talking about a tree anyway you're talking about a person the tree of knowledge of good and evil Jesus Christ excuse me the tree of knowledge of good and evil would have been Satan on that the tree of life true knowledge would have been Jesus Christ but the knowledge of good and evil you to run that over to Satan then Satan through that beast using him to talk I must Adam understood I don't always tried to be honest I don't think he was just dumbfounded and didn't know nothing about what was going on I mean he said well he didn't know this he didn't know that well whatever it was got kept him from knowing it but he could probably look and put together a lot of things gonna remember he had a pretty good knowledge he named all the animals yet all the time but the point that I'm getting at I don't know how much he would understood of how things would have been working right I have no problems with him having some knowledge because surely he could see the reproductive life of the animals and follow that and he could see him and her and all of the things that were there but remember it was a tree of knowledge of good and evil so that's the point I've tried to drive to you that Eve took that tree first not a physical act the physical act was with the beast right the physical act was with the Beast read around said on greatest battle ever fought I believe this one will read maybe in a minute where he said it was the intercourse of her mind there was the fall the act was just a manifestation it had to have a party to take part of it huh so that's why Satan used the Beast we see we just put it beast we put it that line we don't look at it that Eve accepted Satan's lie there is the tree of knowledge of good and evil there was no ability of Satan to have any act creative or any form with Eve so he had to use the beast to try to bring forth all right so then how much he was understood in what was going on I don't know I do know that was a they had all as they looked at everything it was dire I don't believe Adam was so blinded you know I don't believe he was just totally blinded to everything there's no need of him being that way but just remember the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not the beast the tree of knowledge of good and evil was Satan right and there wasn't two physical trees standing there that was probably different one tree to the other one the garden was full of trees if the tree of life was Jesus Christ he wasn't down there with him walking around right even though he could have been if he wanted to but he wasn't dire right so the tree of knowledge of good and evil was not the beast so you're taking the secondary part to making it all the fall was her spiritual being to be perverted and being that perverted then it would come forth with the natural act well so then I hope that that's that we follow it he all right Satan you brother Branham says that that was the only way for him to be able to in inner what in any way enter the human race was through the Beast because remember it was the Beast the Bible tells you and even Scofield and his riding said he went some other way he said to fall made him go to the ground as the snake reads you Bible read you footnotes from some of these riders alright now once that beast came into being Satan could use him to try to enter the human race but just remember his inter rode into the human race was through the spirit the mind the conscious the beings of Eve what would happen you say seeds you say well this can't be but what if it happened to have been no act it wouldn't make no difference Eve was just as polluted before the act as she would actually act the act was just physical her mind was polluted to God's Word no she surely was polluted see for him to explain to her and looked like she should have known it was wrong for her that animal that is the attributes but we think we know the message because we've come to the basis of understanding what took place in the garden was a sex act and see we think we've got it all figured out that's not the polluting of the human race the polluting of the human race physically yes sure yes spiritually speaking the intercourse of his mind started the pollution in the human race okay and you and I are today are facing that same devil not do it what I don't know her brother Dale are you trying to say that some of us physically speaking are from the Beast they are people in the water all are you gonna try to figure out it you're not ain't gonna worry about it that's what I've always said I don't care you run my DNA all the way back into the garden and lay me straight with the Beast that ain't doing nothing to me that don't change nothing in my thinking that enhances my thinking that God could save me right nor to make you happy if it went that way see we want to figure out you know I'm just playing I talk blinded I'm sorry a lot of people believe the beast was the black people but see we we believe a prophet he said well if that be so he said it would have ended it flood that sounds a problem right it's a flood you only had ham Shem and Japheth to reproduce after then and knowing as why see your prophet gives you the answer and it shows our stupidity to try to look at him we go look a big old Giants in the land look at them seven-foot basketball player I mean they they stand up do this you know they don't have to jump to dunk they just lay the ball down what I take that back boy look well what if you're one of them that's always gets me you know what gets me is people humanely okay they've got these bright ideas say like that this is an illustration they did having their mind thinking you know with him judge them Giants now that's the seat of the beast and all at once they have a child and he winds up seven or eight foot tall boy they go haywire then right don't worry about it look here if I 4 foot 3 or what I am I don't know how to do with it but see the fall was in the garden before the act took place that's the emphasis I'm making because the fall is still here we're not dealing with sex acts today what I'm talking about the fall being here in the Satan being is not sex acts its intercourse of the human mind that Satan is polluting our minds what was the difference in Cain and Abel cocaine was of the beast and Abel wasn't had him do you mean that makes a difference you know which side well why did both of them offer an offer available was so good why did he offer an offering he's so good he didn't need one he looks over Kane said go make your an offering how did nothing but you see that's the reason I get into trouble because I lay it out like that and what are you gonna do with it I ain't gonna believe it it's exactly right it ain't gonna change your thinking unless God changed and when he changes it you'll see what truth is but did you do you see what I'm trying to get the fall was already in that garden before the act took place the fall is still here now you don't have to worry about natural acts it is here now in you and me through our spiritual being and you know I've always tried to explain that me the Bible the Prophet says in the Prophet City this way a Christian is the only one that can sin code everything else condemned on a higher level all that's done is finished it already of sin but I don't see them bless God I didn't write the book they're Christian the only one who can sin but word is a Christian sin they don't matter about the body cause I ain't gonna do it that's a secondary because that has to be motivated by something else so you got two factors to deal with soul and spirit so now which one when you have a wrong call or idea or a concept or anything or whatever you do something wrong who is it doesn't happen which old the devil made me do it but what part of you as a Christian can do enough wrong till the Bible would call it sin is this your by I'm an immature soul or your spirit which one is it it does it remember the Bible says the soul that sinneth it shall die but remember one other thing I thought in your mind do you say brother deal you shouldn't put it out that way cause you give us too much to think about the word in the New Testament of soul and spirit is a totally interchangeable word Schofield understands that you get a change sometimes read silk Scofield's account of Genesis in his footnotes which you know how he explains it exactly the way brother Branham explained it in his early ministry may be ready to run read a lot in it read your Scofield footnotes he explains the fall of mankind he explains it just that it was an upright creature and then it was might of snake he explained all of those things and even wording that brother Branham will speak you'll find Scofield was the words he copied from so then where are we going can we read it that Salone ends that it says that's your whole spirit soul and body so the Bible knows of spirit soul and body like I told you there was a doctrine I run into it for running of the message that believes you didn't have a soul until a law came because you didn't have a right to choose until the law put it in your path well that's what I asked the man I said how about reading to me there in Genesis we read into that or nostril and he become a living soul he said I never thought about that because you see I've always believed the word but I know by reading and trying to get a relate you heard run around talk about the before and the after right you know before and after explain something stand on board step on this board and board this ship cuz I'm bored with you all spell to son how do you define what is being saying simple come on board that means come on board standing on this board that means this board because I'm bored with you the before and the after explains it so you go into Bible and you're reading about the spirit read the before and read the after and get the text that's in and it will explain whether it's speaking of the Spirit of God or the soul or what it's explaining read the prophets message listen to what he's talking about it's self-explanatory he explains herself as you say you've always though said that he did he I didn't say he was wrong in his early ministry I've never said he was wrong in his early ministry you showed me that the run was wrong in his early ministry other than the things he was wrong on then he corrected he said well he didn't correct body spirit and so he didn't have to because he always had a crown being of Menka he always had a crown being but the way you know what he's talking about his read the text he's bringing it in because he knew the Bible said it's your body spirit and soul he never had to change because he always gave the body five senses he always gave the second room no matter what he called it memory reason conscious affections etc he always gave the sinner room the controlling factor of mankind one thing which is either faith or doubt it's the same thing he said in 65 up when he was saying back there he was saying body soul spirit 65 he says body spirit and soul he still give him the same senses he still given the same three in the three sense the thing that has each one of the same it's not saying he's wrong in no way because I'll remind you of one thing the way I believe a prophet you and I were so far gone until there was no human being in any form could have brought the word to get us straight outside of a prophet coming that God himself would come down and I don't mind saying it that brother branham a lot of time was speaking in the first person I don't trouble with that you know cause I go back with David I can go back Solomon they said they pierce my hands my faith he's speaking in the first person no trouble was saying this message is the Word of God but I'm straightened plain enough to know that the things the man caught that he was wrong them he corrected him but he didn't help to correct the senses of the the body in the senses of the second realist isn't it he did explain it in the anointed one Nicole that's the truth he said how would you understood Matthew 24:24 unless you understood at rotten being will read that in a minute now would you understand false christs brother I said brother round never person the only ones in down until after the opening of the seals I'm not saying he didn't understand mankind in his being but I'm saying the truth that you knows the truth I invite you to follow it and find it and I've tried to explain that to people to get me water we did go that far I asked you a question this morning there where are you born again you do believe in the new birth don't you I mean is it you know or are you so south down until you can't say Amen I mean you do believe you need to be born again don't you well where did that body spirit show and why do you believe it's in the soul or why would you believe it's in the spirit I told you Church you don't listen that's not sarcastic the old to soul doctrine they laid so heavily on that you get a new soul and there's a doctrine come on later of closer related to it was calling a change of the soul that you get a new soul and some of you know the people personally the priest them what the Bible don't speak of getting a new soul but it does speak of getting a new spirit he killed 2036 you see friend of random wouldn't show mixed up that's what will show he a lot of times in his speaking he would relate and he would bring that center realm down and he'd bring the scriptures and he'd bring it in to be right and he say so then another message later something he says center around his spirit he said but we don't need to know that we need to know about salvation okay were you born again in body spirit so explain to me then watch the soul when I can show you the Prophet says it's the spirit see you gotta get it right alright so let's think about it let's back up a little bit to where we were this morning though let's get something in this bring down the thoughts but what I'm doing is using notes for two messages okay forgive us if we get wrong back there because I'm trying to get a point let's go ahead with the greatest battle ever followed brother Joe we handed on a point and listing it we're gonna go from paragraph 104 through 110 of the greatest battle ever fought all right and let's let him say it about what happened in the garden and then throughout this point he will not be saying this is soul this is fear he's explaining the senses and that's why I chose it for that for us to read it so listen to it greatest battle ever fought 1962 paragraph 104 what was the matter you had to open the channel first you got to get the soldier the Holy Spirit place at the Battlefront they taste God's Word he is the word honoring that we know that we know that's what happened in the greatest battle ever fought he's explaining how that we fight the battle within he explains what happened so come on down and you get into the point that you blows things out what's the matter with us we're we're blowed up Christians is because they don't clean the channels out they don't get down to the inside you got to clean it well you got a clean conscience memory thoughts lay outside everything and coming from the inside out with that unadulterated Word of God that's the truth no matter $10,000 on one side trusting today trusting 10,000 on the other side tomorrow trusting that has nothing to do with it cuts it down a reasonings I'm the one that's trusting can open up the channels that's what we're supposed to be doing now when we get to the statue of a perfect man you see us using blowing out these flus that are stopped up the reason God can't work because that's what he done with Eve he blocked up these channels through her original memory all right come on the devil will try to come right back if he can get in there at all he's got your army routed right then if you got you sense to see touch feel smell in here they're all right but don't trust them unless they agree with the word they're all right but if they disagree with the word don't you listen to them now imagination conscious memory reasonings and affections they're all right if they agree with the word but if your affection doesn't agree with the word get rid of it you blow flew not quit if you reason disagree with the word get away from it that's right and if your memory if your imaginations if your countenance anything differs with what's on that inside get rid of it okay come on up cause he's explaining the system of mankind and what's holding that bullet to nine we'll start here and then read on that your conscious has ever gone little words if you blower to clean it out and get it all out you holler hallelujah cause you got it all blow it out but what if you don't get it all blow down the door is your battleground now your battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul now watch him we're thinner back in your mind it opens and the mind is a gate to the soul the gate to the Spirit rather your mind opens up and accept the Spirit or rejects the Spirit you can have little consciousness of the feelings and little sensation all these things that has nothing to do with it that's just a smooth sensation and thing well when it comes to reality your mind opens up your mind either accept it or rejects it one or the other okay look at your next paragraph 115 the battle raged going to one gun the next the battle raged when Eve opened up her mind to listen to her reasoning does it a lot he's just explaining the mind and done that's the fluid come in that's the channel that run down her reasoning she and her soul she reasoned then you can't reason in yourself if you're born again a Christian don't reasoning so if you do you're not born again see he's just calling us old a second rim right the reasoning factor the first thing she did she opened up her mind and when she did human reason caught it why would that be a thrill what's he explaining he's explaining the memory reason conscious no matter what he calls it that is the rim Eve was deceived in that's what's bothering you and I today I said it and I mean it it don't matter if you're born again been born again fifty years you're still subject to the devil in your memory reason conscious of factions reasonings etc DARS were sin is in a Christian is in that room that he later called spirit but in the early ministry called it soul what does it matter what he was doing not even killing this one he said on anointed one at the end time the same Holy Spirit that anoints the church that gives them desire to save souls they give them power to perform miracles it falls on the unjust the same as the just the very same spirit now you can't make it another way and understand Mathew 24:24 he said thou shall be false Christ Valter anointed anointed with a genuine thing genuine thing would be false prophets of it false teachers false teachers what was the matter with Balaam was the matter was by them the word we get he's written in the word these prophecies endured mines not yours ain't what are you saying I'm saying Balaam was closer than we are when it comes to that realm like that because he was so anointed I like the way brother Gary Acton used to say he brother Dale if you and I are anointed we sure a lot of knowing it very much are we I said how greatly what about the devil being closer to the truth than you are now I didn't say you've lost I didn't have nothing in mine and no thoughts of telling the truth those prophets never had the new birth we'll get to that but yet they had the Word of God even the first person but me and you listen I didn't give him this one either we've spoken words a regional seed paragraph 182 183 that's how adult for his committed spiritually when you knowing better by the Word of God by the end of course of the mind taking a lie of the devil against the Word of God that's exactly what he had done with a spiritual intercourse first that come by disbelieving Satan's lie into the wound of her mind and polluted her soul set death in the soul then the natural act took place that's the only way a woman could ever commit adultery after has let some slicker talk him into it well he calls it solo life at 62 remember up to that point he was covering soul as being the second rim with mankind memory reason conscious in affections church on this way I know I'm human I'm sorry sometimes it makes you feel like just folding your arms and walk away and say 40 years I've tried to get you to see the truth that's your prophet was not Almighty God he said things and done things that was not right yet he was God's prophet as I said well ago that spoken the first person to bring us the Word of God and nobody else could have been chosen to have done it I don't care spiritual you think you are or I think I am it would have not worked they yet to know and realize I can take brother runs message and preach a line to you that you're born again in your spirit show it from quotes show it from the scripture I can take the prophets message and show you're born again in your soul and show it from the scriptures and the quotes but people don't want to know they think you're an intellect they think you're too deep too deep for what trying to learn the difference between soul and spirit to try to find a place where we were born to get out and like I said you go back and check and see you'll find all of your denominations preach teach their doctrinal point in its body so in spirit Scofield says that do you want to go with that or you want to go with the truth that a prophet went along with that what brother branham don't go along with brother Dale yeah well I remember when he told one time that love was the evidence of the Holy Ghost and he said that was a good point and said I went along with it so don't quote to me see but think about it was Eve deceived in her soul or deceived in her spirit if she did have eternal life as I proclaimed away with Adam having eternal life breathed into his nostrils she got breathed into somewhere and she got eternal life in her soul then how could it be her soul that went wrong you said but I just don't see how you can I don't see how you can have eternal life you tell me how the church fell it and I see yeah you tell me how the true bride of Christ wound up and I see you you tell me how the true Bride of Christ fault the truth the winner Zeus's streak came out it was Trinitarians about somewhere around 1912 but in there the one that's developed bringing truth back you know what the originators from Azusa Street done someone went along with it some of them throw Rotten Tomatoes and those who believe the change ain't never said none of them's going to hell that's where you put it in there and you're wrong and say until this message come along we were all deceived and still are until this message listen it's revealed not because brother Brown said it but when it's revealed what he said and why said it that away then we're still deceived I mean hurry all right let's go to number one this would have been an afternoon message called the inside we'll pick it up later call this we're just apart to read the message called ensign 1962 the outside is the body there's five gates to that body and that's the five senses of course he takes filled smelling here the inside like the seed that's planted the inside of that is the pulp lack of the seed which is the sole the rim there's five gates to that you enter into conscious and memory so forth but then send inside of that little compartment is the third compartment which is the spirit now what's the explaining body so spirit but what's he giving five senses to the body five senses to the second realm one sense for the sinner right okay read all you want to okay go ahead paragraph fifty-eight dispute there's only one Avenue a little bit 434 is it and that's what controls the rest of it there's only one having you through that that's self wheel there were self will she soul or the sinner the sender let's call it the center rim to where you hold to the point the center realm of mankind is the Ceph wheel and because that's where you make your choice oh no I made my choice of a spirit that's what went wrong did you get that one there's only one having you through that and that's that wheel you can accept or turn away and that's the only Avenue that if you accept the will of God through that spirit said oh really told me God spirit takes his place in your heart and controls the rest of you if you do not accept that then the enemy takes that spot and controls the rest of you so it lays in there a man being made up in that fashion then he gives him the something inside of him that makes him want to achieve something by himself he's trying to do something to save himself he wants to get out of it but he wants to do it himself are you listening he wants to make his own way about it about it what about it what about the next one of Lexington's Jesus Christ the first throne is in heaven judgment see the second throne was in Christ the third throne is in man now he's explaining it he drops down so come on up and then he gets now what is a man he's a triune being body soul and spirit this is 61 how many knows that God's approach what is his heart you remember my message God chose a man's heart for his control power the devil chose his head for his control tower and he makes him see things look through his eyes but if God in his heart makes him believe things that he cannot see did he see God his own that is in the heart in the heart of a man is a trial is the throne of God you get it man God made his throne in the heart of man now what's the heart of man center of man right what do you want call it spirit or do you want to call it so it's the center am the heart will read that in just a minute in case you won't do later all right he makes him the throne all right now watch watch the first part of the man the first part of the man is body the next part is his soul which is the nature his spirit that makes him what he is he approaches that now Raul no no okay thanks your spirit that makes him what he is he approaches that now the third part of the man is his spirit and his spirit is the center of his heart okay in the center of the heart is where God comes for the throne okay what do you want to call the spirit what you want to call it so it's the center its yard as a man believed within his art so easy that scripture was he just showing you what he taught in one part then we'll get to the last part I hope going to the next one the greatest battle ever fought this is not the one want to go now all right he's talking about looking at my notes and things that he's rolled out and remember he drawled human being a seed physical seed he talks about the eggs the blood you read it off we'll come on down to about here in the child any seed has a sale on the outside the inside is Pope the inside of the Pope is their journey of life right see the pulp is not the seed the shell of an egg puff insider or you Connor - we don't - and then there's a germ of life okay so we're yet Jeremiah well that's the way we're made we're body soul and spirit the outside the body the cell the inside of that the conscious and so forth is the soul and inside the soul is the spirit and the spirit governs all the other so he's still teaching a lot body so spirit now if you sit down and you draw these little reigns you'll find out outside body has five senses it's contacted by that cj's fields melon ear that's the five senses that control the human body inside the body is a soul and that's console is controlled by imaginations conscious memory reason and affection that's the thing that controls the soul so now watch they teach body so spirit but the spirit is only has one sense you're truly a Christian or anybody has one sense you're either believer an unbeliever you're either born again or you're not one again well I'm in the stages don't philosophy me don't throw things back you say I'm in the stages of being born again that doesn't mean you're born again I don't care how long you stay in justification that don't let you and the born-again experience be a good person with the spirit only has one sense the spirit well let's get it the spirit has one sin and that sense is either dominates it is faith or doubt that's it exactly and there's only one attitude to it that's very moral agency you tell me you don't believe free moral agency for the Bride of Christ you remember that the other day you think I'm hollering at people the greatest doctrines of the peoples this message they don't believe in free moral agency go ask them they said they bribed don't have a choice God chose her now he just said there was the only Avenue in come true because you can't accept doubt no you can't accept out or you can accept faith either one you want to work on now for Satan begin at the principle part the cause the spirit of man to doubt God's Word once you God begin it to press them apart to lay his word in that spirit there you are and that's what does it yeah and watching by just brought this 156 brother branham's preached a lot of things and he had it right it was just his wording sometimes but remember it was right body five senses second trim five senses third room one sense he was always right look how he is here in 1956 now on the Intervale you talking about an intellectual faith and he said then there's a faith that comes from the heart we're gonna get onto that on salvation okay this man was telling him years ago as a man thanking his heart he's that's crazy cuz they ain't nothing in there look right down in the heart in the center of the heart there's a little compartment where there's not even a blood sale in it it's not in the animal heart only in the human heart they say it's the occupation are the occupant of the soul the soul lives in the heart then after all God was right when he said a man thinketh in his heart now he's saying he stole is the heart in these reindeer honor huh miss Leavey I don't go to was fixin to use it but see as the word begin to unfold to the Prophet God began to reveal the word to him you agree he began to reveal the things and even likewise writer that he himself priest wrong now I invite you to do one thing I invite you in the church book we tell me I invite you to do one thing you ever heard the prophets say God can't like ain't do wrong how about going sometime and run this in your computer to see about one time put your account in your computer if you need some way I'll happy to it then when a prophet says something and God comes behind and vindicates it you better believe it is that scripture why because God is using him okay go look it up sometimes like this and see if brother Branham wouldn't say some things and say it's thus saith the Lord Oh any time he says that you better go check your quotes you're gonna find some places in there when he was teaching the white horse rider as the Holy Spirit then he tells you that that's thus saith the Lord he said well I won't that quote alright he's telling you it's the truth maybe not used the word thus saith the Lord but he's telling you the truth and watch this one if you ever noticed thing when he would be teaching and he'd say if I've talked to you the truth tonight let the Holy Spirit come down and vindicate it and the Holy Spirit come down and vindicate was he vindicating it wrong that the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit oh you're you're I agree with you but I read I wish you would and survived listening that like I said one time there's a certain church and I said something this brother he said he didn't say that I said he's no gettin I just listened to the tape I can't help it this is what he said he didn't say that you know what I had the next time the book you know what I done I filled it open and said with brother would you mind reading that and he read it he said I listened to the type and didn't get it so you say well I don't if that you just go check it out under the years he was saying the white horse rider was the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit was coming down to indicating in to be teaching the truth you ought to wake up especially you preachers and start reading and listening bless God I don't have to listen to you brother Dale hey man but if it's the truth you're gonna be judged by it same for me listening to you just check and say that woody would be a little alpha what he would be saying but yet the Holy Spirit would come and indicated what's he done he wasn't vindicating the era he was vindicating the man then you want this quote right around sitting and doing that vindicated in the man you want isn't he said that's why when that prophet cursed them Hebrew children and the buyers killed 42 of them he said that was not the Holy Spirit we said it was the power of the Prophet come on are we still in the message or are we playing Pat it around with little you know ideas and doctrines what about it I know I'm running late ain't gonna be able to get through I'll finish this Wednesday no problem with me but I do want to get down to this I do want it made plain and public cut all the way down for 40 or something years they brought around in his early ministry basically tall body so scary sixty-five uh he talked body spirit and soul and that was the only way you can understand anointing ones come on body oldest part of me so spirit where would be the anointing you think there's not a wrong in that part where would be the anointing come on wake up body soul spirit the new anointing would be in the soul or the center center of man but if you place it body spirit and soul then the soul can be truly born again and the anointing can be on your spirit realm now you got the truth he says now you can understand Matthew 24:24 now you can understand this is me quoting now you can understand the new birth and notice you're born again in your center room that's the soul of mankind and the spirit can anoint your spirit now here's one you ain't gonna like okay so wake it up is there any difference in their knowing it comes on you and your knowing it comes on ninety-one and we put the devil out of the way okay you leave him out of this okay don't claim to tell my know anyone's isn't known to the devil but around us and we're gonna read it if you're knowing it with a genuine baptism of the Holy Spirit so what is the new birth body has nothing to do other than it goes along and see face it hears things the Spirit of God now everybody born-again believers talking to you the Spirit comes and anoint your spirit and takes you through the stages of cleansing the soul of justification and sanctification and inputs the life in it is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit it's a different act from the new birth I'm quoting brother Branham but you don't want it that way what are you saying there's no difference in a true born-again Christian the anointing is up on their spirit a person that is an anointed one you know false on the inside the same Holy Spirit is anointing their spirit the only difference is what's on the inside that's the only difference is what's the controlling from the inside factor now you better get your senses right because then brother Branham never changed he always put five cents to the body five cents to the second trim one cents to this inner realm no matter what he called it it's always the same that way you can understand anointed ones that is the genuine anointing come on let's say just a few and then we'll go all right go ahead to number five brother which is the god of this evil age priest in 1965 801 the outside man is a physical being which is controlled by six senses our five senses brother the inside man is a spirit man which is controlled by five senses conscience the love and so forth the outside man see taste feels melting here but the inside of that spirit another spirits got the five senses man we're either gone but the inside of that spirit is the soul and it's controlled by one thing you remember a while ago the one that even he was giving us in a room and making it to spirit he still say it you see their faith or doubt so his doctrine is right I'll tell you what you can take this as something for me I believe God done this purposely to blind most of the people and it's done a good job now listen but the inside of that spirit is a soul it's controlled by one thing your freewill you can accept what the devil says or accept what God says and that'll determine what spirit is in there now he's coming back talking about the spirit image the Spirit of God it'll feed on the things of God it won't feed on anything in the world any talking about the inside of you so if you love the world and things of the world because the love of God has not entered into this inner part Satan has deceived you and men shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God he said Satan has deceived you go ahead number six rapture paragraph 144 looky here you're a triune being you're inside this little fella here is the soul the next is the spirit and the next is the body what's he coming inside outside okay now you got five senses in this body to contact your earthly home you don't contact the rest of it the rest of it you got five senses of the Spirit here love and conscience and so forth of that but in here is where you live that's what you are let me get the one who won't yeah okay continue on with the rapture because it's spring that just bring it up when you read it in between but bring it about he's talking about the cocklebur how they can be anointed now bringing on the in 47 paragraph 147 known the Bible say in the last days that there shall be false Christ's congregation says Amen not false Jesus is now false Christ anointed ones falsely anointed to the word denominational anointed but not to the word and the world will by record of itself they don't need nothing else it'll by record of itself and that will fall come fall so knowing did once you got my tape on that and the if you call one of them say oh you are Jesus certainly not they wouldn't stand for that come on up save reading Missy stop 140 very minute stopping 148 yeah but when it comes to an O Lord I got to anointing listen and it's a genuine anointing remember Caiaphas had it - and prophesy so did Balaam have it and promised that but that don't have nothing to do with this inside there's nothing to do with instra unless that was God's seed his gene from the beginning predestinated you're finished I don't care how much you shout speak with tongue run shout that has nothing to do it a Coco Birkin count just as much as any of the rest of them I've seen heaters race out and speaking tongues and drink blood out of a human's go and call on the devil so you don't any of them sensations and they forget it it's your heart in that word and that's Christ bring in Dar and watch it make itself known just as it opens up like any other seed and the part itself for the age that you're living okay number seven and North it not the inside of that spirit inside that is a spirit which you become when you're born into the earth and breathed the breath of life into him off his breathing in that spirit of a world in nature is of aura because it watch that was not given from God who get to this on the redemptive part look that nature wasn't given of God in the wrong way read what he's saying that spirit is of a world in nature because it was not given him God from God but it was given permitted by God now you got that every child that's born in the world is born in sin saving iniquity in the world speaking live that's right that so that person inside there is a sinner to begin with that's where we're all now it's got five intimates and five endless I don't know whether I can call them right off now when the person though is still conscious and loving choice no conscience loves reason there's five inlets to the Spirit you can't think with your body you have to think with your spirit you can't have conscience in your body it has no mental faculties of all your body does so you have to think with your spirit you have to reason you can't reason with your physical being called reason does we'll see touch feel smell in here reason is what you can make in your mind now listen to this if you're asleep or you're out your body is lying there dead now not not you died listen to it it just means lifeless it's not working but your spirit can still reason twenty how dreams it's put it's that much money out dreams and then he says your spirit can still reason he's going to sleep there's five senses that control that inside man now to the last man which is so there's only one sense that controls that and that is free moral agency free agency free will to choose are to reject any modern events make clear what prophecy I'm gonna give you one they'll choke you the baptism of the Holy Ghost don't mean you're going in not at all not only that don't have anything to do with your soul here's the inside soul in here that has to come from God but then on the outside you have five senses and fie inlets to your contact your earthly home the inside you have a spirit and there you have five outlets your conscience and love and so forth five outlets to that spirit remember in that spirit remember in that spirit reasoning conscious affections he just explained it right remember in that spirit you can be baptized with a genuine spirit of God and still be lost it's the soul that lives that was ordained of God didn't Jesus say many will come to me in that day and say Lord having I cast out Devils none great and mighty works prophesied the great gifts of God he said depart from me you worker of iniquity and never knew you okay gonna remember what he said though in that spirit so now we know the truth you realize when we first heard these things in 1970 when I first heard at 68 69 and they say you can have the baptism with Holy Ghost everyday that I'm dying or L lost hope for anybody till somebody found the point because until they found the point it was just statements well I think it's this well I think he's that I think he's dead I was dire and one day a man come up and he found that one that we just read what was it modern events made clear by prophecy that we just read he's in that spirit you can be anointed now listen you can say I got the baptism with Holy Ghost I'm going to heaven that don't one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Spirit every day of your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says now he's explaining it where's the baptism following anointing on your spirit cuz he's gonna look here you're an outside person your five senses of contact outside body God gave you five senses not to contact him directly home she takes the smell in here then you have a spirit on the inside of that and it has five outlets conscious and love and so forth five outlets and lets you contact the spirit world with that but with your spirit your physical contacts of physical your spiritual contacts are spiritual but inside of that you got a soul and that soul is that gene that comes from God keep on going thinking man's filter it's brain only up until we get to the point this is thinking man's filter as I spoke this morning like Sunday morning on that wheel in the middle of the wheel or that little inside sole on the inside of the spirit have that spirit on the outside between the soul in the body now that spirit then we got two times we can pull that up let you see it everybody whatever look have that spirit on the outside not out where did that between the soul and the body okay can be absolutely anointed with the Holy Ghost did you understand that now the father of that in your continuity to the message the god of this world didn't only once in the last day that outside that middle circle first circle is the human senses second sixth circle is the spirit senses will save will desire and so forth but the inside is the soul and that soul was predestined so they can anoint this spirit to make the outside body come in subjection what you know they want preachers done but the soul that sinneth that soldier that the soul that rejects an unbelief the Word of God which is the part of it that's so silly eternally go ahead what we got you got another one anointed ones it's in ten we're on number 11 okay now someone might say to me do you believe that that anointing on those people means and it's the anointing of the Holy Spirit yes sir the genuine the Holy Spirit of God upon a person and yet they're false listen close and see what he said and they share so signs and wonders in so much than it would to see their very elect if it were possible and they are anointed with the genuine Holy Spirit trying to do God a service trying to get to it it's impossible a man or woman without sincerity and listen read isint carefully check it is it possible a man woman with all sincerity trying their best to do God a service and stirred it in the wrong way listen with a genuine anointing of the Holy Spirit upon them but sturdy contrary the God's plan for the age and chaos the whole thing he's not going no body out because they don't believe the word he's putting it in right over there okay well we got thirteen come on back to the rapture but when it comes to our own glory I got the anointing that we read that did we read that one okay when it comes to an older I got the anointing and it's the genuine anointing remember Caiaphas headed to and prophesied so did Balaam avidin prophesy but that don't have nothing to do with this inside unless that was God's seed he's James from the beginning predestinated you're finished I don't care how much you shall speak with tongue run shout that has nothing to do with it we're coming back - okay we're on number 14 I think that's the last one we find that this evil ages to prove to Satan she's not like Eve and she is not that type of a woman and she will be tried by his word the bride is Adams bride was tried by the word and Adams bride believed every bit of the world over confused on one promise that he's the same yesterday today and forever today see but failed on one promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she used to come in contact again by the same thing not by just denominational truth or something but every word what is the last one nice when is the scripture from Deuteronomy if there rise among you a prophet or a dreamer of dreams and give you a sign go under and the sign of the wonder come to pass you realize what that means I'm gonna come in here and said now they're going so it's gonna happen this is gonna happen that's going out and you know whatever you could think detected okay and it happens what are you gonna do right then what are you gonna do somebody comes in here and says I've come to tell you all the truth and to prove that what I believe about William Branham being wrong God's gonna come and raise the dead it's a glory hallelujah you say what do you mean that far oh we gonna get somebody raised in the day somebody that was dead zone bit right you say you're stupid I'll agree with you want but I love it you know why say I'm the guy what are you gonna do if they come in here one day and walk up with a box and say if you believe what you believe take your snake out what are you gonna do when I tell you what now I'll take it up with a hoe you're making stupid mistakes that it's not in the will of God I've got if nothing else to put my life on the line to do it you said will you do it when he comes we'll see I didn't say where I said when it counted we'll say but I ain't gonna be stupid enough to tell him I'll take it up with a hoe oh that's no he's tempting the devil then remember if he's tempting the devil he's challenging you are you willing to put your life on the line for what you believe okay what if he gives you a sign that come device now here's what we got to know the word he gives you a sign it comes to bite I'll give you another scripture I'll give you a scripture Oh from right there up that tells you the same thing it tells you or if a prophet comes and preaches the truth you kind of believe that prophet think of it in a minute but it's starting the scripture maybe somebody can help me but they send this creature you've got to believe him because it's God's prophet but here what does it say and the signer wonder come to Pais were of the spike under the saying let us go after other gods which thou has not known and let us serve to him thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams we won't get down there far enough to read it but that dreamer of Dreams is supposed to be put to death it's the same scripture that's not not hearken unto the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams listen for the Lord prove it you to do what to know whether you love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul what about Abraham as I said this morning take your only son how it'll kill him how about it what would you say he said he let them things come among us to prove it we just read from the Prophet that this bride is going to stand on the word he said I don't understand him maybe new ones and things and saying I don't understand God I always thought that the baptism of the Holy Ghost was the new birth it is yes it is it is the baptism of the Holy Spirit can't just anoint your spirit because that's what it does what is the new birth the new birth is not your shouting your doings in all is a rock the new birth is the word made alive in your soul the anointing is the same anointing on you as it is on the others Karthus student prophesied and said two things his weight was bringing out the other day and John looked at him and seen the anointing come on him but he seen him going off but one day he saw it come down you say oh that's later that's not just oh you ain't getting the point when he's seen that anointing come and stay on the Lord Jesus he proclaimed him to be the Lamb of God he didn't matter how much it come on he went off there's no problem it was whether or not that man would stay with the word well brother so-and-so is preaching that there's really two Lords and he's got great signs and wonders fathering him praise the Lord seek her getting healed today to being right praise the Lord God's doing it the devil can't do it so the gods using it so we praise the Lord people are getting sick they only getting healed in a sec thank you lord yeah but he says brother Brandon was wrong right just say forget it I'm too far up the road to say that the man has brought me this far like brother dick says we talk a lot about if they told me that brother Branham was married 10 times I'll quote it for me he said 14 I thought if they told me run around and was married 10 times and could prove it by papers I just like and you know what even if it was identically true you know what I'd say thank you Lord for using a man to give me the message that I've got I've got salvation in my heart from that now would you come on some more things come we've enjoyed this what is sister Johnny say she said I stayed with brother so-and-so until brother so-and-so brought me ain't name into brother til brother so-and-so brought me to so-and-so and said I stayed with him until I got to Lula and said I believe the word do you believe the word that strong to put everything you got if you don't you're not a Christian let's stand get ready for the communion they've got it ready back there anyway so much I hope you understand and I hope you go home and and think on these times that you'll think about anointings and what I've tried to explain instead of my ways and doings but just just take it and believe it that even God he said what God tries What did he say to Abraham what did you say to me Brian now I know you love me he's gonna say to a bride one of these days what the Bible says enter you into the joys of the Lord that was prepared for you before the foundation of the world why you stood the test you stayed with the word you hadn't run off after everything else you've stayed with the word you see one church you can think what you want to I don't care but what about a man that will stand and tell you the first sermon that he preached in 1969 was that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man the Word made flesh in the life stage somebody asked me one time said what does that make you to think about you said it I said not a sign God I didn't say it somebody else did that's why I can stand on it today and believe what God told me 50 years ago can you do that what about it church this reader scripture is 1st Corinthians 11 I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he brake it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this is doing remembrance of me now for the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do ye as oft as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shew of the Lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body with this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep but we would judge ourselves we should not be judged I love this but when were judged we're chasing to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come out together on the condemnation and the rest I said in order when I come let's just have a few moments of silent prayer before we're going into the community others just bless each one of us meet with us as we partake that we may be all together it's one in you Lord that we may be what you
