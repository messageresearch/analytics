let's bow our heads doing this study on the six-fold purpose we want to be we want to be focused the heavenly father we pray tonight Lord that you would come Among Us in a special way Lord we know that your Prophet told us that these things are important and they must be understood and even in the in the book lord sister media was concerned that the group of people that he was preaching to were simple and may not understand this and the prophets that God will make away if God wrote it and the prophet spoke it I believe Lord that you're here to make it manifest you're here to reveal it to babe such it would learn we pray now Lord that you would just be with us Lord take care of us be with a special request that we've heard Lord be with Mom and Dad bless them Lord as they're taking vacation and Richard and Abby and sister Lisa Lord we pray now that you just bless them give them rest and let them come back lord rejuvenated and ready to go father we pray that you'd be with us tonight be with us along the way father you do the speaking tonight let each one Lord the hearers hear and Lord let us understand what you've given us you've given it to us clear you've given us understanding and Lord now we want to break it down to the people so that they can understand Lord and get more out of you father more of you that's what we want Lord be with us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit may your word not return void will accomplish what is said in Jesus name we pray amen Daniel 9 24 and I'm going to read it I I told brother Mark and then we got this out of a car that that we um that we took back in and it is a Tyndale Bible I don't know if anybody's ever read but William Kendale was one of the first writers of the Bible in English actually the Catholic Church put him to death yes for writing the Bible in such a simple form so that people could understand it they strangled them and burned him at the stake because of what he wrote this Bible and made it simple for the people but William Tyndale was uh he was during the Martin Luther era back in the 1500s and if you want to look him up you can go Google William Tyndale t-y-n-d-a-l-e and he wrote this Bible out of the Latin Vulgate but he brought it down so that that's why the Catholic Church wanted to kill him because they wanted it to be taken away from the people that they couldn't understand it that the Catholic Church could tell them what the Bible says but when William Tyndale come in and give it to the common people they got mad at him and killed him all right so I'm going to read out of this and you read it off of your off of your screen because I really like this and let me let me let you understand something here remember now this is I'm reading this out of his Bible in the 1500s all right the Lord has commanded 490 years of further punishment upon Jerusalem and your people so brother Brandon's not the only one that knew 70 weeks that there was one week equals seven years he says 490 years in this Bible okay brother Brown said it was all in Scripture he just had to bring it out and bring it to light it was already there he's brought it to light so that we could see it because we always read it and others read it 70 weeks are determined but here brother Tyndale the Lord has commanded 490 years of further punishment upon Jerusalem and your people then at last they will learn to stay away from sin pretty good idea and their guilt will be cleansed then the kingdom of everlasting righteousness will begin and the most holy place in the temple will be rededicated not reanointed but it'd be rededicated as the prophets have declared now listen it will be 49 years plus 434 years boy did he have a revelation from the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until the anointed one comes Jerusalem streets and walls will be rebuilt despite the perilous times after this period of 434 years the anointed one will be killed Jesus Christ his kingdom will his kingdom still unrealized and a king will arise whose armies will destroy the city and the temple that was Titus they will be overwhelmed with as with a flood and War and its miseries are decreed from that time to the very end this King will make a seven year treaty with the people but after half that time he will break his pledge and stop the Jews from all their sacrifices and their offerings then as I climb I ask to all his terrible Deeds the enemy shall utterly defile the sanctuary of God that's exactly what the prophet said was going to happen right but in God's time and plan his judgment will be poured out upon this evil one he had a revelation he had a revelation of Daniel 70 weeks in the 1500s what's our problem now you may be seated in the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word not saying not saying that we could get without brother random but but this is 1500s that a man got a revelation it was 490 years 49 years 434 years a man had a revelation it had been hidden and buried and now God brought it to life through the prophet and the end time but if you ever want to uh to look at a Bible that that's read real simple this Tyndale Bible I'm going to keep this one you go get your own but I'm going to keep this one and and brother Mark was reading some things out of it today that would really thrill you that he he's very correct in what he's putting down so I believe it was the Holy Spirit that did it I don't believe it was just a man all right now let's go ahead and put the chart on the board I'm gonna show you we're going to look at the three periods all right because remember there is a 49-year period of 434 year period and a seven year period all right remember when we when we started you got 70 weeks are determined all right seven new weeks 490 years right right right okay thank you 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and the holy city to do six things we're going to talk about that six-fold purpose they happen over here but this is a building up to it here because you got a 49-year period which is seven weeks seven seven brother Brian said one week equals seven years right right so seven seven is 490 right all right 490 years but now seven times seven not seventy seven times seven is 49. they rebuilt the temple in 49 years even the wall remember they built the temple on 46 took them three more years to finish the wall all right then there's a 62-week period read it in your Bible all right 62 and 7 is what Dixie nine 69 times 7 is 483. brother Brown never said and the Bible never says that they're 69 and a half weeks left because all the people in the message and I say all all but a few preach that there's three and a half years of Jesus's ministry here and three and a half over there but they've got it way out over here that is not correct they're not saying what the prophet's saying that's right they're not right but but they're not saying what the Bible said brother Carly 62 and 7 is 69 that's what the Bible says after 62 weeks and my size cut off but not for himself he paid all the debt right here amen right Corey Israel and for us but a pardon is not a pardon until it's accepted as a pardon we accepted it because we were the bride that he came after but remember when he started his ministry back here and all I found some things and I'll show them to Dad we may we may do it again but but I found some things in history where it proves that Jesus was killed in 80 30 and that his ministry started in about 80 26 which we already proved that but even by I had uh pulled up a few dates on the computer and uh thank God for that that you can search things right and and shows at 80 27 he was born in 4 BC and then we come up here to 80 30 but now let me just tell you something you're going to see in the book and you're going to see through the message brother Brown talks about 80 33. all right well don't get all flustered because I don't know the man's name but he's got a name about this long he changed the calendar they don't even know why he changed it four years Troy cook from bc4 he put Jesus's birth at 81. and from 81 they'd make it 8033 according to their calendar but not according to the prophetic calendar that brother Branham used he was killed in 80 30. and for those people that think that he was wrong before the seals and he was right after the seals on The Sixth Seal he said Jesus was killed in 80 30. the prophet is not confused if we have confusion it's our confusion not his and he cannot preach anything outside of what the Bible says or he's not a word Prophet amen all right so the Bible says there's seven weeks 62 weeks and one week brother Brown says there's three distinct periods everybody understand that can everybody see that she means to understand oh man there's the Bible says right 70 weeks are determined to do six things we're going to talk about the sixth full purpose but we got a bill to that so six things happens inside of this Daniel 70 weeks right here six things happen right here not right here see because most people in the message believe that Jesus preached three and a half year three and a half here in the 70th week ends right here and that's not according to the prophet that is not according to the Bible and that's not according to what prophet saying the chart what he said in the Bible is all correct right right I know some of you know this but some of you may not and we went through it real fast the other day I thought I'd come back and just work on a section at a time all right but it can't be that the 70th week cannot end here and I'll prove it tonight because of that six-fold purpose because it says 70 weeks are determined that word determined means I'm going to do it God can't change his mind God can't come down since 1963 and change his mind so he didn't change a prophet's mind the prophet caught the mind of God and gave us a revelation all right but we just don't understand what the prophet said I believe I believe he's right but I have to base everything I go on by the scripture the scripture says there's a seven week period read it in your Bible they built the walls 49 years 62 weeks and my size cut off after 62 weeks after 62 weeks and my size cut off 62 plus 7 is 69 right not 69 and a half brother Brown never never never never never said they were 69 and a half years finished right he said they're 69 years finished and there's one week left for the Jews now there's only 1260 days of Jesus's Ministry left he's got three and a half years to redeem Israel amen that's the Bible 1260 days but what are you going to do about bringing in Everlasting righteousness sail up the vision and prophecy and anoint the most holy you can't do that in 1260 days because after 1260 days these two guys are killed they take a rapture and battle of Armageddon starts you can't bring in Everlasting righteousness right here you can't seal up Division and prophecy here you can't anoint the most holy here because brother round said that was when we come back into Millennium well the millennium's not here we're heading into the Millennium right here there's a blending or a lap over see these Church ages even for those of you that are new brother Branham said and I believe God doesn't just abruptly stop one thing because he knows we're human one age blended into the next age to be really correct you would take and put this so close till it would laugh over but brother Ram talks with a lamp over so there there's not a there's not a time in here when God doesn't deal with anybody you understand right right God dealt with Paul Paul come in and preached the people took his message through and started around said they start going down God sent another messenger irenus in the lamp over to preach his message and then the people because I read a lot of these people a lot of these Church days Messengers did not live all the way during the time coach Columbus is like a thousand and something years well he only preached a certain amount of time right so who carried the message the people did the people caught the revelation of what was going on in that age and They carried it on but then as the church age kept going it started being eat down again by Creeds and denominations and false Doctrine so God had to send another man Luther on the scene preach a message right here then here comes a message then here's Wesley comes on the scene then you got a Pentecostal age in here with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then you got brother Brown coming at the End of the Age he coming in he's coming at the end to carry us into the rapture not eight Messengers there are seven churches Messengers but his real message started at the end in the seals right right his real message started in a seal now not that 47-63 was not any good no 47-63 to restore us to restore everything back that they had died that had been eat down over here in Paul's age one God water baptism no eternal hell all those things had to be brought back into the church for what to get us out of here you can't be raptured on part word somebody's got to take a body chain Amen to call the ones that do have part work right out of the ground oh oh they without us they without us cannot be made perfect you think something's on your shoulders tonight every Christian that went to church followed their messenger and died are waiting on me and you that's right to call them out of the ground that's right man you think we're going to take it with one word off you gonna think we take it with well Daniel 70 weeks is not important because it's to the Jews yeah it is the spiritual part we get the revelation of what's going to happen what is what was what is and what is to come right talking about the seals right that which was which is and that is to come all right everybody understand that God had to break in here he was cut off read your scripture Jesus was cut off but not for himself amen right he was cut off for me and you man me and you didn't stand here and say let his blood be on us and our children no when it come on today of Pentecost it the baptism of the Holy Ghost came into a group of people and they accepted what Christ said amen but you stood there and said let his blood be on us and our children they were cut off right right God didn't deal with the Jews no more now I'm talking about the the Jews over there I'm not talking about the Jews these Jews that come in these ages right here everybody understand that when we say Jew don't think of the whole nation of Jerusalem right because some of the people there's Jews that receive the Holy Ghost and in the message now right right that's not the 144 000. God's dealing with a gentile church until here now brother Brandon put this little lap over because the Jews were returning right right in the 40s the Jews began to return and become a nation in 1949 brother Brown gave him a little laugh over there right because this Stone right here that comes down we don't talk about it but remember in Daniel 234 it costs about that stone not made by hands rolling down the mountain and what does it do it comes in it Smits this image in the feet ten toes those are Gentile kingdoms Gentile ages he's got to strike them in the feet and get rid of them because he's fixing to deal with the Jews and the Jews only he deals with the Gentiles as individuals he deals with the Jews right here he's going to be 144 000 not 144 and one or 139 and 9. there's 12 there's 12 tribes right twelve thousand in each tribe that's 144 000 people God's going to call by these two Prophets by the word of the Lord and they're going to receive the Holy Ghost and then they're going to take a rapture that's what we were trying to show you the other day daddy kind of just put the he put the dates in excuse me but I'm trying to show that that this is more than just then just um uh on a piece of paper with 80 30 and 80 70 and all this which is good brother Brown grew this chart the chart's right sure right the chart's perfect all right but we got to understand what he's talking about but I you got to see Redemption 70 weeks are determined remember what I read in tyndale's Bible to bring Israel back God's got to do these six things but what he done he come at Calvary and paid the price for everybody everybody's Redemption everybody's sin everybody's iniquity was finished at Calvary right we just took it in and he applied it to a gentile bride that's the Rachel he was looking for when he was working those seven years right but he's not gonna forget Israel but it's not Israel as a nation as far as the nation of Israel it's a hundred and forty four thousand so when we're talking about Redemption it's not of all Israel they're going to die just like the rest of them sure there's a fifth seal Jew and there's people that's going to be giving eternal life but this is two prophets bringing out 144 000 people no more no less they preached 1260 days and they bring out a group of people called 144 000. we take a Rapture by what Jesus did at Calvary and they rejected it but God comes back finish is dealing with us when when when the Gentiles reject it we go into chaos then God comes and starts dealing with the Jews but he's not just dealing with the Jews himself he's got to get the city involved that Temple has got to be built amen right and it's not being built inside here right right this is the Redemption of the 144 000. all right so now let's go through some quotes and I'll give I'll get over here where you can see you see that okay there's three distinct periods not four not one two three four there's one where they built the city way back in in BC 538 in there all right then during this time God is dealing with the Jews but he's working to the time to write here Calvary 70 weeks are determined so there's 483 years which is 69 weeks so 69 weeks is history we can read that in the Bible all right and there's one week left for the Redemption of the 144 000 and that City to lap us over into the millennium all right but remember one thing let's go get hung up with tribulation and Great Tribulation we're going to talk about this next Sunday so I'm going to try to stay here this is the Tribulation period right here for the Gentiles and Jacob's trouble but we'll read all that next Sunday but I just want to make sure you see those three distinct periods according to scripture I do not care and I want you to look at me I do not care what you think about it I don't want what you think about it the Bible says 69 weeks are finished 7 and 62 is 69 not 69 and a half because you know what it is brothers that's misinterpreted theology just like my brother around talk about marriage and divorce misinterpreted theology people hear somebody preach something it's famous in the message right come on somebody we've been sitting there listening too and you just take it and suck it down like it's true and never go check it out the Bible says there's only three periods a seven a 62 and a seven to make 490 years of the Redemption of Israel and the city 70 weeks are determined upon thy people Jews 144 000 and the holy city which is what Jerusalem where do you think that Temple is going to be built Omar up commercial Omar setting over where the city spoke or where the Temple's going to be built read Matthew 24. Jesus told them as long as this thing sits here it's going to be an abomination but watch brother Brown said they're gonna put a bomb right down in the middle of that thing and blow it to Pieces why get it out of the way so God can come down in that 144 000 can come down and build that Temple the real Temple that God wants to be built but you know what he's already built that temple in me and you sacrificing offerings I would it's not but a body thou has prepared me he wants us to be a sacrifice we'll talk about Sunday about purging brother Ram talks about purging us that's what happens in the seven in the Seven Seals the Seven Seals is the purging of me and you six seal is a purging that is a six cell is a tribulation period right we'll get into that Sunday I'm not going to be on the seals tonight I actually might not get finished with what I got but we thank God we got Sunday but the sixth see Revelation 6 1-19 happens right in here seals break to the Natural Jew s plagues Lowe's woman in the sun red dragon we'll read it in a man where brother Brown calls all that is going to take place in the Redemption of Israel because what happens when the red dragon is standing there waiting for that woman Church to give birth what happens when she gives birth remember two Wings carry her into the into the uh forest for three and a half years I wanted to work three and a half years no problem the Redemption of Israel what are we going to do we're giving birth to Jesus Christ and we're going to hand what we're talking about tonight right to those two prophets all right not physically right but as the word breaks to me and you like dad's been preaching about Satan Satan just know does not know how to Incarnate a man let God incarnates you and I but he's a copier after when you and I stand here and take a body change without death Satan's going to be standing right there and he's going to know how it's done so when we go up he's going to not physically come down we know he's down here but I believe he will be right here because he's not going to be in heaven accusing us because they won't be nothing to accuse us for right so he's got effort and when he incarnates that fault that uh beef he starts as a little saying you know today Israel did somebody get the email yeah Israel recognized the pope right as being you know a good guy the the right person or calling to Christ right come on people this thing's closer than we think right because we're not here when that contract is signed between the uh I won't call him the Antichrist but when it's when it's signed between Rome because it says when he breaks when he'll make a covenant with many for one week who's he going to make covenant with natural Jew 144 000 is going to be in there all right so now that we got that basis let's look at now quote number one get everybody see that now I'm not in anybody's way all right so now now this is in the 17th week of Daniel now now let's outline Daniel 70 of weeks now I might repeat here again Ministers of the Gospel if you disagree with this all right they're divided in three periods as we find out in Daniel 9 three periods first a seven week period then a three score and two which three score is three times two is six that's sixty and then two make sixty two all right everybody got that then a three scoring two which is 62. uh he did it for me and then a one week period they're divided in three different periods he didn't say four and he didn't say those periods were divided up there's three distinct periods now I've got a divided here on the board the first period second period now watch this and to my understanding by the gospel by the Holy Spirit and they think brother Brown was wrong when he was preaching the damn 70 weeks then they're calling the Holy Spirit wrong God forbid by the holy spirit that the end that the end time God returns again to the Jew all right let's go to number two it's the sixth full purpose 70 weeks are determined now this is what we're going to talk about tonight the 70 weeks are determined upon thy people for what purpose for what whose people was it determined upon Daniel's people the Jews and what was it determined for upon not only Daniel but upon Daniel's Holy City so he's telling you there's two parts to that this people and the city it's Bible the Bible says this people and the city all right and upon Daniels public city see Daniel's holy city now class what was Daniel's Holy City Jerusalem amen all right now I want you to know friends that striking on these things I'm certainly leaving out weeks of teaching but just kind of hitting it so that when the weather cooled off for a little later when we get into those Seven Seals seven balls seven trumpets all these things that I can refer back and say do you remember on the 70 weeks of Daniel do you remember the church age when it went up and what takes place in these 70 weeks of Daniel colors listen these 70 weeks covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church that space is what it covers now now not all 70 weeks of Daniel part of it because remember the 62 and the Seven was bringing it up to Calvary all right everybody got that okay all right 70 weeks are determined now there was a six-fold purpose in his visit telling him what was going to come to pass now there was a six-fold purpose of his coming so does everybody understand in that 70 weeks there's got to be that six full purpose well that shows the Redemption of them in the city 70 weeks are determined I want to grill out in your head there's a whole key 70 weeks are determined upon my people and the holy city to do 16. succeed whatever you want to call it same thing at 70 weeks are determined upon thy people now remember that is all that the Journey of the Israelites will have in this earth right they are determined 70 weeks is just determined that's all that's slotted to the Jews upon thy people and upon thy holy city therefore this seventy weeks now don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem blown off the map so they can come back and build the temple right until there'll be a new City built my people and the city has to be redeemed that means they had to fall somewhere to be brought back Israel turned God down at Calvary and was put away right in Jeremiah adulterous Israel was divorced so he could take us he can't be married to two he married us all right then the Jews come back as servants but I listen now don't miss this it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and also to the end of Jerusalem until there'll be a new City built now oh I hope we get into it real good and deep tonight are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city what too then he starts going with to finish the transgression now let's go back to Daniel 9 24. 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon that Holy City to do six things one finish the transgression two make an end of sins agree to make reconciliation for iniquity four to bring in Everlasting righteousness five to seal of division and prophecy and six to anoint the most holy everybody understand that's got to happen in 70 weeks not 69 and a half 70 weeks the 70 weeks of Daniel those six things are going to happen all right now the six-fold purpose what does it do it redeems 144 thousand and gets the city back to where it's supposed to be because when we come right into the city it's not going to be a half-built city it's going to be built right all right but I want you to listen to One Thing I'm going to tell you in a minute but let's just let's just drop it in right now for a second these things happen not for us when we think a Rapture we're done amen when we take a rapture we take a body change right when we go up we're done that's right we're eternal the wedding supper is where we go and meet and greet each person sit down at the marriage supper with Abraham Isaac and Jacob wherever how you want to say that he'll wipe the tears from your eyes we'll get to meet and greet each one of us he slips out the prophet's head and goes down to the 144 000 reveals itself to them right amen then they're killed they go in a Rapture and I believe I'll I'll try to prove it Sunday they turn around and come right back down here and start building the city it they got to build the temple we don't know how to do that we're gentiles we lived in caves they built temples they need more about temples than anybody so I believe they're going to build a temple brother Brown said God wouldn't help why would you want to when Donnie and Susan got married Donnie brought her back and said honey if you want to live in the house with me you got to build one he'd be sitting alone tonight so why would you take your bride and bring her back and make her build something no the Temple's going to be there for us to come in because we're just in a honeymoon it's not to us the 70 weeks are not to us we're done we're finished there's no more Redemption for us when we come back into Millennium that's not to us brother Ram said we're there on a honeymoon are you gonna work on your honeymoon too not public labor anyway all right so we're not there to do that we're there when we come riding back in Revelations 19 we come back and we're the anointing to the temple and I believe that 144 000 are going to be there I have servants right see our grand finale or whatever you want to call it it's going to be when that future home comes which that's nothing to do with a millennium everybody understand that two different places the Millennium is after the atomic fire blows this place off we walk back on the ashes of the wicked we're not going to walk back on ashes waiting for the future home dog and Magog is going to be the fire of God is going to consume not just burn it's going to consume everything all them little Devils is talking to you right now they're going to be burning up and only God can do that man's fire can't do it but man's fire is going to burn at the Battle alarm again we're going to walk out on the ashes of the wicked live here A Thousand Years but that's not to us so don't worry we have some of the ministers that work well what were we going to be when they do this and do this I don't care somebody asked brother Brown said brother what's this about the Millennium he said maybe babies can be born maybe they can he said I don't know and he never answered it so it doesn't matter get born again get the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you got a free ride right to the Future home right all right right very simple you get a free ride so what if we have to come up do you think it's gonna matter if we come back right in the middle of the battle of Armageddon if you took a body change and you're just as Eternal as God is you think atomic bomb is going to bother you it's just about what it is a bunch of preachers I'll say it on the internet a bunch of preachers that got their doctrines burnt up oh and they got mad about it that's all right listen I was I was thinking today in the shower this morning I thought Lord there are degrees of ministry but when Jesus said eat my flesh and drink my blood he didn't explain it right that's right now listen let me ask you a question have you ever thought of this he explained it in the upper room with the 12 disciples right right but why didn't Peter write about it Peter was there Peter heard him say eat my flesh and drink my blood right because Jesus turned to them afterwards after the 70 left he's turned he said where are you going Peterson's word we ain't got no hurry up you only have the words to eternal life well when they were in the upper room Jesus said this is my body which is broken for you take eat this is my blood and and represents of the New Testament in my blood drink it who had the revelation of that Paul I wasn't there but he said I have received of the Lord that's what he's commanded for me to do the night in which he was betrayed do you understand what I'm saying I'm giving you a parable Paul was a wonderful priest I mean Peter was a wonderful preacher but he didn't have a revelation like Paul had right and but you know what Peter never huffed up and puffed up no he just said Paul said some things hard to be understood he didn't say he didn't agree with him he just said he said some things wasn't hard to be understood so if we say some things that are to be understood I'll pray to God because we've got the same Holy Ghost right but but we can't we can't disallow that that part of this is no good our part of this is to the Jews and we don't need it no I believe we got to have an understanding before we get out of here of what we need to get out here with right brother Brown said wrapping faith lies in the books on the tapes right all right so that's my that's what I'm going to rely on what's in the books and what's on the tapes all right but God doesn't deal with Israel he doesn't do any of this until we leave right not sure he's building up I just believe that the two prophets are already over there there they are because when that message comes from us and I'm going to give you a challenge because what you have goes over there to them right right amen so your revelation better be like Daniel 9 24. or you give them a different Revelation amen right right that's right your revelation better be the same as what the Bible says and what that Prophet preaches or it don't go to Israel because they're not going up they're not gonna we're not going to introduce error to the the children of Israel right there's been enough air over there now right amen so we're not going to introduce era but but explaining this helps me see how they're going to receive it what's going to happen to them but also it shows what God's doing to me amen God's doing the same thing to me amen all right that's my bro that's my brother Dale said it's a parable it's a parable with an underlying meaning when we get the underlying meaning that God's dealing with us now and then he's going to take this same message not chopped up and saying well brother man what's wrong here and right here and he didn't know what he's saying here and he got his numbers wrong here that's going to go to Israel they're going to go same old stuff we had before bring a false doctrine of water baptism and or or even you know three gods or trinitarian doctrine you're not gonna feed a geotranitarian Doctrine that's one thing they do have straight there's only one God that's right they just don't know that Jesus is him but when we when we take this message over there it's going to be what one God and Jesus is his name all right so now let's see quote number three but I don't remember our Redemption has to be finished first all right so now making signs with Jesus now I want to show you I Want to Break Down The Book of Revelations just so you can understand maybe for the new ones maybe for some that that don't really understand us and now I would like to think would be this Brethren that like in the church here my Minister my Ministry has the best of my thinking four things that can be done and it might not be either four but that's the only Outlook I can think of if that one has spoke to me down there in the river if this is all that was left for the Gentile Church which we realize in Revelations it's just one two three chapters to the church Revelations one through three is to the Gentile Church the church goes up in the fourth chapter it does not return anymore till the 19th Chapter that's after the tribulation period when God calls out the Jews does everybody understand that say Amen amen all right but now let's go take four to 19 and take it out of the bottle and throw it away oh that's just to the Jews we don't need it no we got to take the revelation of what it is to them that's right right it's been here for them all right so now let's break it down just a minute I wanna I hope they put this together right I know they did yeah that's right that's among that's my guys all right we're gonna break Revelations down Revelations chapter one two three he speaks of the Bride in the church ages is that correct Say Amen all right Revelations one to three now Revelation is 4 1 it says come up hither right that's the Rapture of the church the bride all right now chapter four shows the bride and Glory brother Dale's been through this that's the Heavenly scene a round about The Throne the four elders and and the four beasts wherever the four B Stars Where We Are right wherever those four beasts are that's where we are because that's the Holy Ghost so wherever the Holy Ghost is that's where we are better be or you got another Holy Ghost chapter five shows how we are redeemed lamb takes the book well when that lamb takes the book what is it seven horns and seven eyes he's redeeming through the church ages and when he gets the book and I thought about this this morning have you ever thought about this they're in there somewhere they're in that book right they got to be redeemed so they're in the book of redemption right so they're in there it's not that they're going to show up somewhere later no this shows our Redemption because we got to be redeemed first amen then what we got goes to them for Redemption so Revelations chapter 6 through 18 is the Redemption of the 144 000 in the purging of the Earth see what tells you that all right then Revelation chapter 19 we come riding into the Millennium with the 144 000 for the Millennium the white throne and then the future home does everybody see that lineup that's how the Book of Revelations is lined up everybody see that same minutes amen amen you see that that's how the Book of Revelation that's why we have to have it straight but now I'm just like brother Claude but Claude said that one you know the brother said well we don't need uh the Rev we don't need Revelations 6 1-19 because that's to the Jews well if you do you got a big old Gap right here because this is for our Redemption brother Brandon preached us to this right here so he must have brought all this right or God wouldn't have let him preach on this right here he brought that future home where I love it I love the future home book I love that book because it tells you everything tells you about justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost he tells you the difference in the Millennium and the future home because of Millennium people do build houses and have it but in that future home that's all built by God right that's built the prophet said by your desire he's already got it built and it's going to sit right there on top of that mountain that's going to push up over there in Jerusalem that city is going to sit right down on top of it that pyramid city is going to sit down right on top of that mountain and we're going to walk in there and we're going to be the light 144 000 is going to be there as servants and the rest of the world is going to come in and out but they can't stay they got to go out all right what a wonderful wonderful wonderful thing to have a prophet to bring us this and show now see I can see where I'm placed at and where Israel is placed at but I got to see through that Revelation 6 through 18 shows my Redemption also right right but it's going to be a natural happening to the Jews because see the book is still closed in chapter five right actually like Dad said the other day he said Revelation 6 1 to 6 1 does not say the book's open but we know it is because he begins to reveal but if you take six one to 18 and you say it's not to us then we're still talking about a closed book right but opens during that time of Revelation 6 to 19. the book opens so that we can see what's going on same thing with Hey look God blinded Israel so we could come in right right God blinded Israel so we could come in Creeds and dogmas blinded us so we couldn't go in but God had to come the same way and open our eyes just like he's going to Open the Eyes of the 144 thousand for their Redemption is the same way you and I we walked in darkness when we were alive right what kill God opened our eyes and showed us the truth same thing with 144 000 it's just that we get it first because we're the bride he loves us amen he loves us he loves to tell us secrets then we can reveal that secret as it's given out to the laity out to the 144 000 and even to the world I see you got a Redemption of 144 000 in the purging of the earth Revelation 6 through 18 because 19 is when we come back into this city we're going to talk about next Sunday all right so everybody see that lineup is that okay all right I would write that down or ask if you can get it it's online you can get it online but I would hang on to that because that's your lineup that tells everything that's going on in the Book of Revelation all right so now placing of these events are important Revelation 6 1-19 has to be revealed to you and I before it goes to Israel amen has to be revealed to us before it goes to Israel all right and now rolling in here I wrote not important question mark let's go to number four Gabriel's instructions to Daniel now look if you want to throw the Daniel 70 weeks book out if you want to throw all of Daniel 70 weeks away here's what a prophet said this is the one most important scripture in the book that's right now brother Brown said Revelations 5 was the most Sublime scripture in the book right right why because it shows our Redemption but this is the one most important scripture in the book what does it do it tells the closing of the Jewish Nation the Jewish people this scripture the 70 of weeks it discloses and tells exactly from the time that Daniel started there until the end of the consummation it's one of the greatest timepieces there's God's calendar taken from right here it has nothing to do with the Gentiles these Seven Seals seven plagues seven woes seven trumpets has not one thing to do the Gentile church will be in glory at that time don't have nothing to do with us the Gentile Church it only deals with Israel Daniel thy people and Jerusalem you notice he keeps saying in Jerusalem and the city all right so let's go to what happens after we leave now we can get into what I want to talk about yeah been an hour the six-fold purpose all right in the 70th week of Daniel where are we at right here he's pulling to that chart where we're at where are we at right here where did the Messiah get cut off exactly where the word said what 80 30 when he died he was cut off he was killed we're going to read it in Isaiah 53 he was cut out cut off from among the living right where will that 70th Week begin exactly after this church is cut off then God returns to the Jew all right can you bring that chart up where did a messiah get cut off we know that church ages started Church age is in exactly after this church us is cut off then God returns to the Jews where would that 70th week begin he's cut off here when will that 70th Week begin after we're cut off because he's not going to deal with the Gentiles no more we get bad bad tribulation right because we turned God down not we not us but the church The Remnant the nominal people the people's going to be hunted down like dogs because you know what we're going to be in glory while all this happens all right so now number six let's go back to number six quote that wind's going to start when's God going to start their last week when it may be today it may be before the sun sets God would declare it when it is I don't know because he don't know when the Rapture is going to take place all right now go number seven all right 70th week and in the middle of this week now here's the 70 and now these exactly was seven years each one of the weeks one week equals seven years okay and we've already 69 weeks so we've already had 69 weeks then we have the Gentile age he don't put no three and a half years over here right he was he preached that he preached that Messiah Doctrine Messiah message before that 69th week was cut off right all right there more than that now we're at the end of the Gentile age then there's one more week left for the Jew is that right and that's exactly seven years if this was seven years that's seven years because he said there's 70 weeks determined upon thy people so we know we got seven years for the Jews is that right is that true excuse me now look at it if there's a question I want to know it and in the middle of the week the middle of this Jewish week Jewish remember that Jewish week that's three and a half years the Antichrist the prince the prince that is to come and remember he comes out of Rome so we know who's going to make a covenant for that last week right right the Antichrist the Pope he's gonna make it with natural Israel all of Israel the whole nation 144 000 is going to be in that group because they're going to have to be called out because because in Revelation that says come out of her my people right same thing with you and I we came out a denomination but the 144 000 is going to come out of that Covenant that old Jewish Orthodox Covenant that that Rome's going to make with the Jews they're going to come out and come out of her my people all right next three and a half years the Antichrist the prince the prince it is to come and remember he comes out of Rome I press it is to come what is he a Poe a prince amongst a people that is to come that rise up a pharaoh who doesn't know Joseph amen and that's what it is remember a pharaoh rose up that didn't know Joseph so he sent him right into captivity all right so now there's one lit there so now we understand that there's one week left for the Redemption of the people in the city right one week left for the Redemption of the people and the city amen all right because we got to break that down because there's only 1260 days left for the Redemption of the people what the Bible says 160 days three and a half years all right so now 69 weeks are complete the bride is gone let's go down let's go to Daniel 9 27. and he shall confirm that was that guy he's talking about he the Antichrist right he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week I said last part not last week and in the midst of the week which is what the middle of seven is three and a half all right he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation deceased and for the overspreading of abomination he shall make it best of what's he doing he's letting them have their Temple worship for three and a half years but he gets so mad at those two prophets and those 144 000 for coming against that he breaks that thing and when he breaks in and walks into that Temple and he says I'm God worship me 144 000 are going to be gone and what what's Israel going to do they're going to know that they've transgressed they're going to know that all these things are are to them and they're going to punch a button and then this country's gonna punch a button and then this country is going to punch a button it's gonna be Armageddon all right does everybody understand that you got it he makes a covenant with all the Jews he the Antichrist all right let's go to number eight the seventh week now you promised and say well now that's it the Federation of churches an image to the Beast and go right with them and we find out here that the Jews are called in on this confederation what a contract or or something like that yes sir and they agree and the Bible said they would or did it and he makes a covenant with them and in the midst of the 70th week for the Jews may I I'm not adding I'm telling you what he's saying all right that's 70th week in the midst of that week he breaks the Bible says he breaks the Covenant right after three and a half years or in the middle of the week he breaks the Covenant the Antichrist breaks his Covenant with the Jews thy people why now when you read in Revelations 11 says I'm sin that's 11 you're coming over towards 19 now that he will send his two prophets and they'll prophesy in that time and when they'll get angry with those prophets and actually kill them right right is that right and their dead body shall lay in the spiritual street called Sodom and Gomorrah where our Lord was crucified Jerusalem is that right and they'll lay there for three days and nights actually it's three and a half days three three and a half days and after three days and nights the spirit of life will come into them and they'll be raised up and going to Glory a Kent part of the city fell at that time is that right see what is it in the middle of this last 70 years and he put 70 years but we know it's 70 weeks in the middle of this last 70 years so let's go to Revelations 11 and let's read what the Bible says it's going to happen in that 1260 days 11-3 and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and three score days which in a prophetic calendar is exactly three and a half years right and these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if in man will hurt them their mouth and devour their enemy and if any man will hurt them he must be in this manner he must in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven brother Brown says what did Elijah do three and a half years he walked out and said hey they won't even do you fall on the ground for three and a half years he said they know how to do it because it's the same Spirit of Moses and Elijah going over here to do these to do bring these plagues down now what they're doing is they're not just bringing plagues what they're preaching what their preachings bring into place sure they they literally call for these things I believe but they're preaching they're preaching's what condemns the world right brother Branham when he come and he condemned the United States that condemned the United States there's nothing nobody can do about it he's condemned us so we're ready I mean we're ready to be burnt these have power to shut Heaven that it rain not in the days of their prophecy and that power over Waters to turn into Blood Brother Brown said Moses knows how to do that he's done it one done before and it's mighty Earth with all plagues as often as they will and when they shall have finished their testimony so after 1260 days three and a half years all right that's a continuation of the Messiah Ministry or the Messiah Doctrine brother Branham calls it but if you ever realized this it's a Ministry of the son of man the son of man preached his own message when he was here the Son of Man shows up now right here today we're standing in the son of man ministry right now amen and then that son of man Ministry why do you think well how do you know that well if you go to the scripture where it says where did you get those scars they're going to see Jesus so real so he's not physically going to be standing there but through these two prophets that's doing all this they're going to be preaching salvation to the 144 000. they're going to accept it and see so much what Christ did for them they're going to say where did you get those scars but you get those wounds he said I want the house of my friends all right and they that dwell upon the Earth shall rejoice over them and make marry and shall send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwell on the earth and after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them what can't you imagine CNN and Fox News and all those cameras being pointed on those two witnesses laying in the street and after three days over there they're probably not looking very well you understand what I mean they're getting kind of decayed after three days at least they're blowing up but after three and a half days something's gonna happen behind a reporter that's that's reporting this thing them two men is going to stand up on their feet by the mighty God we serve and after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet in great fear now don't you think the world after they after they probably had a Super Bowl party yeah the these two guys are dead because they just torment day and night just torment the people over there and there's nothing they can do about it but see that Spirit just lift off of him so that Jesus can be crucified that Spirit left off of them so that they can be killed right when they're killed man they're going to be having a like I said a Super Bowl party with with you know they're going to have serve them chicken wings and all that other stuff you understand what I'm saying because it's it's people this is America it's Frolic and I mean the whole world are going to say finally these people are gone and then all of a sudden they're going to look and these two guys are going to stand up on their feet you talking about a hush you go by silence in Heaven Ain't gonna be silence on Earth right could you imagine go with having cameras of the whole world looking right down on these two dead guys laying in the street and they don't tell what they'll do to them they'll probably mutilate them and then all of a sudden they take a body change on camera on camera because the Bible says the whole world will see them right that's right and they that dwell upon the Earth will rejoice and make Mary and send gifts one to the other because these two prophets tormented them to dwell on Earth and after three days and I have the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them when saw them and they heard a great voice from Heaven saying unto them come up hither where'd you hear that at Revelations 4 1 said the same thing come up hither so they're going to take a Rapture just like we did in 4-1 they're going to take it here in between Revelations 6 1-19 come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them so what did they do though while they were here the two prophets those two prophets besides striking plagues they preach Redemption that's right you missed it they walk into that Temple that they're sitting there making natural sacrifices and those 444 000 they're going to say look guys you they're wrong it's gone in my heart it's not God in that lamb it's God that Lamb's blood only covers we come to tell you that a man came to take care of all you said amen a human Immortal man God in human flesh came to do this all right let's go to quote number nine because remember they only prophesy now in the first seal I want you to realize look this is where everybody gets it wrong they're wrong there's only three and a half years left of the Messiah Doctrine to the Jews son of man Ministry preached three and a half here he's got to preach three and a half more to redeem Israel that's right only all right but where they're missing it at they're taking and saying well that's all that's left after the Rapture of the church to finish the 70 weeks it's not right Bible doesn't say that Prophet doesn't say that so whatever man word be a lie then they're still three and a half years waited for the Messiah Doctrine to the Jews see they go to the seal book that's what they do they say well brother Brown's Revelation progressed in the seal so he he he he he preached it wrong that's what they're saying in Daniel 70 weeks he preached it wrong but now in the seals he's he's making it all right well you know anytime brother Branham was wrong he told us he was wrong he said I was going to make a horrible mistake if the Holy Spirit hadn't come into the room and corrected me amen and remember he used to preach that the Holy Ghost was just love just love he said but the Holy Ghost corrected me now there's no word where he come back and said Daniel 70 which is wrong throw the chart away throw the three messages I preached away because this is right now no they just don't have a revelation of what's going on because there is just three and a half of them Messiah Ministry left after the Rapture that's the Bible but there's one week left to get the Jews redeemed the 144 000 and the City get the Earth cleaned off get everything ready for the Millennium all right then they're still three and a half years waited for the Messiah Doctrine to the Jew and God does not deal with the Jew and the Gentile at the same time he deals with Israel as a nation Gentile I mean Israel is a nation Gentile as an individual all right let's go next one watch these two prophets gonna do when they come this Beast this Prince that shall scatter the power of the Holy people what will he do your break is Covenant with them after three and a half years he'll ounce them now people think that's communism that's just because you have the spirit of God hasn't dealt with you yet it's not communism what's that been preaching on it's religion right it's religious Devils is going to kill this place now these two prophets what will they do guys I think y'all quote number nine is supposed to be a whole lot longer than that because I got the first seal with about three or four quotes on here and you've only got one but that's okay but in the first sale if you'll read it reads start pull the number nine back up coach number nine had about three or four times where he said it but read the first seal and you'll see where he's talking about the Messiah message or the Messiah Doctrine to the Jew he's not talking about that for a week that's left to redeem the people and the city he's talking about the people he's bringing Redemption down to 70 weeks in seven years or 70 weeks that's seven years and see that's what gets me about the people they don't go back and study because now I have because we got we got another Minister's meeting see they're saying well he he was he was wrong in Daniel 70 weeks but he progressed in Revelation in 19 from 61 to 63 he progressed in Revelation so now he's teaching it there's only three and a half years left after the Rapture period Well I just happened to went back in 53 56 57 58 and 59. brother Brown was talking about one week of redemption three and a half here did Jesus preach and three and a half left to redeem Israel that's right I heard 144 000. so so so now brother Brown was really confused because he preached it this way then he comes back and preaches it this way in Daniel 70 weeks and he turns right back around and preached it the same way again that he did back over here I don't know what I'm saying people my profit's not that confused right if he is 25 1 is straight I'm telling you we need to find one that's straight if he's that confused I don't believe he is I just believe we don't understand what he's talking about amen but I believe that somebody has been breaking it down for years for years well there's the rest of it but that's okay we got we don't have time now we'll just read it on because I it comes and it talks about the 70 weeks to determined but he talks about that Messiah Doctrine and then he talks about the Messiah he doesn't say Messiah Ministry but it really is it's the ministry of the Messiah it's the Messiah Doctrine is what he says the doctrine of the Messiah that's right right it was him preaching itself yes the Holy Ghost preaching it now and it's going to be the Holy Ghost due to prophets preaching it to the 144 000. same God my man I don't know people you thank God you just thank God that somebody has broke this thing down so that even a child can understand it we got sisters in this church can explain it better than a lot of preachers in the message and I said do you want to make out a dish on the preacher the message you go right ahead but I'm going to tell you something it's time that we stop preaching about sea spot running right CJ running everybody understand I know a lot of you younger ones are going what is he talking about Freda knows what I'm talking about because we're the same age that's a first grade reader book the first grade reader you get when you open it says c-spot run spot run up the hill see Mary see Mary run see Mary walk and what was the other guys what was the guy's name dick James Sally dick James Sally dick brother Nick Jane and Sally and spot well now for those of you on the internet that was the first grade reader that's the point I'm trying to make we got to get out in first grade readers right See Spot Run will get you in the body of Christ maybe a c-spot run won't take you in a body change and get you out of here all right now look here we go now here we go now this is what it's supposed to be here's my paragraph 225 and 233 now this come this is the continuation of the first seal let's go back to it now see brother Brown was in the first seal he's not changed his Doctrine he's telling you about Redemption right right now just 70 weeks was determined perfectly as Daniel said that Messiah would come and would be cut off in the midst of the week now let's stop for just a second because the Bible doesn't say that the Bible doesn't say that the Messiah was cut off in the midst of the week that's right find it in the Bible there's nowhere but brother Branham reading between the lines reading the Love Letter you're showing us and that's exactly exactly in the middle of middle of side doctrine that he's preaching that seven years he's taking all that 70 weeks of Daniel and putting it in seven years three and a half that he physically preached on the earth and three and a half that he's preaching through two prophets right right that's what he's breaking it down to that's why everybody goes crazy because it says in Jesus prophesied three and a half years now in the middle of this three and a half years of Daniel in the middle of it he was cut off that's true 70 weeks is seven years when you look at Redemption it's three and a half over here and three and a half over here everybody got that okay now the middle of this tree years of Daniel in the middle of it he was cut off and now the last part is a tribulation period during the 1260 days that he's going to preach his last Messiah Doctrine to the Jews there's going to be a tribulation period all right where the Gentile church is oh this is great oh now don't the bride goes in with the ground then after the Millennium walks out upon the ashes of the wicked now we know this Roman Calendar back to paragraph 233 now we know this Roman Calendar has we got 28 days and sometimes 30 31. but actually the calendar reads this 30 days to every month that's right take a hundred a thousand two hundred and three score days and put 30 to it and see what you got three and a half years exactly to the dot that's the time that's allotted time for the Messiah message right to be preached to Israel like it was back there now I didn't have this quote I didn't find it just the other day this one's going with me to the minister to me coach look if that's the time what the 1260 days that's the time that's allotted time for the Messiah message to be preached to Israel like it was back there back where when he was here on the Earth right so there's your three and a half hair three and a half hair all right when he returns back and makes himself known in a symbol back when he comes he's talking about the sales all right let's go now back to him to number 10. this is back into the 70th week what these two prophets are going to do when they come this Beast of Prince shall scatter the power of the Holy people what will he do he'll break his Covenant with him after three and a half years he'll ask them now people thinks that's communism that's just because you're the spirit of God hasn't dealt with you yet it's not communism it's religion now these two prophets what will they do it's Moses and Elijah they'll rise on the scene they'll tell those Jews their mistake in other words the two prophets are going to rise out from among that group that's built the temple and doing their Temple worship and killing the animals and they think they got to do that before the Messiah comes because remember they don't think the messiah's got here yet right they don't think he's here so they're trying to get him here by making sacrifices just like the Old Testament did all right that's why that you if you'll study the five cups of Elijah they set a cup down for Elijah when they do when they have their ceremony over in in Israel they walk out the door and they look down the street and if Elijah's not coming they shut the door and they say until next year come see Elijah's got to come on the scene before the Messiah can come because they interpret That Old Testament as Elijah coming before the great and terrible day of the Lord but see what about those two prophets say hey guys look y'all missed it this is the fifth coming of Elijah right here standing in front of you that's what the two prophets are going to say you missed number four he got a gentile to go on a gentile Church to go on a rapture the spirit of Elijah I'm sorry they'll tell those Jews their mistake and Jewish Bunch that's there right now to be the 144 000 God will call these prophets what is it the spirit of Elijah off of this Gentile church will just continue right on into that Jewish Church go right on in and call Moses with him Hallelujah you see it and he'll preach the same message of Pentecost to those Jews that they rejected a messiah man you see it it would be the same Pentecostal message that these Jews will preach right over to them and they'll hate those Jews so bad till they'll kill them right right why because they'll be contrary to all that they've been trying to do since Christ left all right man is established Bliss Temple worship they've tried they built the thing and it's been torn down built that door down finally now they got the temple and they got then they're going to have two prophets and 144 000 going to go in there every day and do just like Jesus did they hated him in that Temple that's why they said we'd be not born in fornication like you are going to defame would have proved that he was born in fornication he couldn't enter it in the temple that's right because remember if you're a bastard child you couldn't enter into four generations right or for uh or whatever ten Generations 400 years see if they could do that and prove he was a bastard child he would but they hated him in that Temple but every time there was a feast Jesus was standing in that Temple because why he was at Paschal Lamb he was the lamb that should have been slain besides the one that was on the altar that was being slain so they're going to walk in just like Jesus did they're going to walk in and say hey stop it the massage already come and we've come to tell you that he's not dead but he's alive and here he is right here he seem to be the same thing caused the message that Jesus Jews will preach right over to them and they'll hate those Jews so bad so they'll kill them and they were hated by All Nations and in the midst of the week well after he breaks that Covenant after three and a half years after they get finished preaching their message all right and in the midst of the week because they raised up a great powerful 144 000. I don't think it's just the two prophets it's going to be doing the work that's right it's going to be a great powerful 144 000 right they had the Holy Ghost and brother you talk about doing Miracles they did them they stopped Heaven they didn't rain in the days of Prophecy smoked the Earth with plagues as often as they wanted they give plagues and everything else they'll give them Romans a hard way to go finally they'll be killed because that's what the scripture says our God is a terrible God when he's angry but remember that's what we're in the 70th week and the church in glory so we're gone we're not getting a part of this amen the wedding supper's going on yes now notice that's where we've seen her coming back to the millennial Temple over here at the end of the Jewish age not at the end of the 1260. that's the Messiah message right it's a chance at the end of the Jewish age the anointed here he comes riding on a white horse those following him a lot of horses horses Powers dressed in white blood of extra drifting blood wrote on him the word of God he cometh the mighty conqueror to save the millennium coming to the temple Glory there he meets that 144 000 where in the temple right they're already building it down here we come riding in to anoint it well that's the last one that's number six to anoint the most holy all right so now let's go back to Daniel 9 24 and real quick we're going to go through the first three and then that's where we'll start next Sunday is we'll start with the sixth full purpose but I wanted you to come to to um to see the first three and just kind of keeping your mind until we get there Daniel 9 24 said 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy Holy City to do those six things to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring an everlasting righteousness to seal up Division and prophecy and anoint the most holy so now number one is finished the transgression what does transgression mean to violate a command or a law when the Israel transgressed they broke the law right that's their transgression but God has come to finish the transgression not continuous stop it finish it eradicate it he did it at Calvary but They didn't accept the pardon that we accepted now they're accepting the pardon through two Prophets The Two prophets are preaching this to them they're gonna their transgression is going to be finished through those two prophets and it being revealed to them and then like I said it's going to be a type of justification because to be justified is that remember what I said when you become a Christian what's the first thing you do you become a lawyer do's and don'ts do's and don'ts when you become Justified it's do's and don'ts because you're growing up as a Christian all right your past sins are what finished is that not justification we're going to get into this next Sunday because you're going to have to see the seals and and the Redemption of the people here before we can see it over there but he's going to do three things right now finish the transgression transgression means to violate the commander of law but on the flip side it means justification because it finishes your transgression it finishes what you've done in the past because what to pass was under the law and that's what killed you right those are drawn to the law or dead all right you can't live the law but they finished it he's going to finish Israel's transgression all right let's go to court number 11. six full purpose now if we back up into Daniel again we'll find out that then when we find out here the 24th first all right to finish the transgression you finish what to finish Israel's transgression so it wasn't finished at Calvary now he's come when the Jews I mean when the the Gentiles are gone he's come down through two prophets for 1260 days they're going to do this they're going to preach and Israel that 144 000 is going to see that they transgress right okay to finish the transgression to finish what to finish Israel's transgression what is transgressives to go against something a transgress against me is to do it wrong to me transgress against you do it wrong to you so Israel did a wrong to God and in this 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel finish the transgression will be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob and that all Israel will be born again all of them will receive the Holy Ghost that's coming on down now let's go to the next one number two is to make a what end of sin what he's saying I believe what can wash away my sin nothing but the what does blood do sanctifies you right blood is the only sanctifier like him wash away my sin nothing but the blood of Jesus that's what's going to happen to them they're going to make an end of sins is that supposed to be plural and I think I wrote saying I got sins down make sure you it's the end of sins it's their sins are going to end all right now number three all right let's go to quote number 12. let's see what he said about end of sin where did they make their sin now listen let's turn to Matthew 24 here's what Israel made their fatal mistake here's where she done her last sin and the reason that she's in the condition today without you without reading all that you know what that is right they let Barabbas go and pilate said what shall I do which with this Jesus called Christ they all said unto him let him be crucified now remember that's their Messiah that Daniel said would come 70 weeks are determined and my size cut off after 62 weeks all right you remember this morning in the lesson here he'll be cut off not for himself not nothing he did and that's exactly correct he did it for what US let him be crucified scrolling up right here he go down just one more here's their mistake here is their sin then they answered then answered the people and said his blood be on us and on our children that's right and that's exactly what carried it over right but God's going to make an end to that you know what he's going to forget it he's going to forget it but if you ever remembered it you've got to bring it back up he's going to forget it there's where they done it he was making an end of sin for them how could he do anything else but forgive them knowing that he had to Blind their eyes that we could come in it's like his own children calling for his blood and they were blinded and he know they were blinded that's the reason he cried for forgiveness for them forgive them Father for they don't know what they're doing they were blind for our sake they were made blind that's what God's going to give them this restoration because he blinded them for me and you all right but when they see him again in their unbelief they did this because remember what they didn't believe he was a messiah there's their unbelief there's their sin but when you come back around and those two prophets preach that that's who that was that's going to end their sins put an end to sin what is sin unbelief they did not believe that was a messiah they could not see him to be the Messiah yet he done every sign the Messiah was supposed to do but they could not see it they were blind now in student number three and then we'll stop right there make reconciliation for iniquity all right reconciliation means to restore Fellowship if if a husband and wife separates and they reconcile what they do they come back into Fellowship just as they were before what does the Holy Ghost do it restores our fellowship it brings us into God right brings us close friends it reconciled us back remember what it's a message of reconciliation to bring us back to Christ that's what Paul said in Corinthians make reconciliation though for their iniquity and iniquity is a hideous sin but it's they he makes reconciliation for their iniquity he restores Fellowship back to them all right so that's one two and three you got justification sanctification and baptism in the Holy Ghost just like you and I so they have to go through the same Journey just like we did right all right they get the same Ministry that you and I get not different the same one right all right but now look now look it's the same as our Redemption what is it what does the Holy Ghost do the Holy Ghost finishes ends and reconciles because remember if they said this part of you that's still alive you don't have all together but when you say finish and you say in and you say reconcile finishes your transgression and your sin and makes reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is knowing to do better and not doing it it's a hideous sin is what um I looked it up in the in the Webster dictionary but iniquity is a hideous sin that means you shouldn't do it and you do it anyway well that's what we do but by the baptism of the Holy Ghost in our soul God has reconciled us back to Christ amen same way with the Jews they're not unredeemable they're as redeemable as we are that's right all right but God doesn't do it any different I want you to see these first three and then we'll stop right here and then we'll start we'll read um read Isaiah 53. Isaiah 53 is totally the six-fold purpose right totally what Christ comes to do because see they know what's going to happen they just don't know when it's going to happen to them but when the two prophets get there they're going to say it's already happened he's already finished all your transgression he's already finished your sin it's already reconciled your iniquity that's like brother Dale said if we what we're doing here that's what the prophet said realize who we are and what we're doing here we'll be a powerful Army didn't I just read you a quote that said when 144 000 received the Holy Ghost there'll be a powerful Army they'll take those Romans and they'll do things to those Romans that live you know we don't do but I've always said don't make a Jew mad holy ghost or no Holy Ghost don't make a Jew man all right and that's what you're doing dude you make them guys mad they're going to kill at least 144 000 they're going to kill him through profits they're going to see though if you read Zechariah 12 and Zechariah 13 we'll read that starting Sunday and you'll see the Redemption of Israel but all this takes place Gojo can you put that chart up musicians come on the chart of the last week all right this is this is the Gentile Church goes into Glory right part of the this is part of the uh thing that we did a couple weeks ago right here's where two prophets preach what we just talked about they're gonna make an end of sand reconciliation for iniquity and finish your transgression right here now look if you do like most people in the message the 70 weeks of Daniel ends right here I've seen the charts and I've seen people talk about it and preach it I'll preach it but talk about it if that finishes everything but what are you gonna do about these three guys right here because you can't see one two and three is what we just read a few minutes ago dinner's got to be about those after 1200 they leave right after 1260 days they go in in the glory they take a rapture well how you gonna bring an everlasting righteousness over here How You Gonna seal up the business and prophecy over here and how are you going to anoint the most holy which is us riding back in the Millennium Temple can't happen in 1260 days there's got to be one week left just what the prophet said there's one week left after the Rapture one two and three to to take a group of people home four five and six to restore battle alarm again we'll start on that next Sunday and I'm going to show you where it purified the Earth is being purified during this time because Everlasting righteousness brother Brown said the the world is going to be just like the Garden of Eden everything's going to start just growing back again it's not like a future home future home is going to be the city's coming right down and we're going to walk into it the Millennium is just going to be a progression because and this is one thing I don't understand brother Ryan said to be a gospel priest of the Heathen where's the Heathen coming from I don't know but somebody's got to live a thousand years to prove the sin curse is over remember God told them said the day you eat thereof that day you die a thousand years is a day and days a thousand years that's why it's called a millennium that's one thousand years well that's not for me and you we're eternal somebody's got to live a thousand years to prove the sin curse is over I don't know who's going to live that thousand years that's why I said it doesn't matter to me that part doesn't because they asked brother Reynold he said I don't know I don't know whether this will happen but this will happen but I know one thing for sure if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're not going to know what's not going to happen because you won't be there that's right but if you got the Holy Ghost you got a free ride right right over the top of all this and seeing Revelations 19 we come riding back in the millennium right to anoint the temple so the Temple's got to be built right in here somewhere to finish because 70 weeks are determined to do six things three of them's already been done by what we were just preaching not naturally but when we go home three of them's got to be done and they take a Rapture and the other three is going to have to finish the holy city so that you and I can come right down into it riding in Revelations 19 we'll read it next Sunday we'll ride into the millennium with Jesus Christ I just read it to meet the 144 000. they come right back down here and start building that Temple that starts the Everlasting righteousness then they're they're anointed then anoint the most holy is not to them it's us that part is to us but we're the anointing to the temple the temple has to be built and then we come in and we anoint that temple with what the Holy Ghost do we have that's the anointing that's what happened in the Old Testament they just didn't call it the baptism of the Holy Ghost because it hadn't entered into a group of people but that's what that anointing was in the temple it was God in the form of a spirit the Holy Spirit come down in that Temple right amen come down in the wilderness that was the light that that one priest could meet once a year he met the Holy Ghost but that Holy Ghost that that anointing or that atonement of the blood of bulls and goats couldn't take the sin away from that man so that that could come into here and that's what they're still thinking over there now but you and I know that Temple's been done away with sacrificing offerings I would have not but a what a body he wants to live in this Temple this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost and then what Paul said this is the Temple of the Holy Ghost this is what we're going to walk into the Millennium and say look this is what God wanted to live in we built this Millennia you've built this Millennium Temple according to Ezekiel 40 to 44. but we're going to show you justification outer Court sanctification inner Court baptism of the Holy Ghost and I believe holy same type we're not going to get away from our times we're not going to get away from the Plan of Redemption which is justification sanctification and to baptism of the Holy Ghost let us down number 369 the Ripple 369 in the red book we'll pick this back up right here next Sunday afternoon and finish up with a six-fold purpose of money God is Jesus is only here I got it did you see that it's important to know your friends away foreign It's gotta come from us to be made it rattles hold the air anymore there's nothing else to be said Lord bless you you're this man foreign foreign foreign
