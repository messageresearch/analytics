jerusalem whose name was simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of israel and the holy ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the lord's christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought into in the child jesus to do for him after the custom of the law then took he him up in his arms and blessed god and said lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou hast prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel and joseph and his mother marveled at those things which were spoken of him and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against yea a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed amen god bless you tonight and be seated and so i want to look at when looking at the life of of jesus and picking up from kind of background a little bit from what we were talking about last time when we were talking about in in the book of matthew and matthew uses this expression numerous times but he talks about that it might be fulfilled and we go back and and we look there and and matthew the first chapter and when it talks about the birth of jesus and it and it begins to talk about what was to take place and when when the the angel when gabriel came and spoke to mary and told him what was going to take place of what was what was prophesied and he said you shall bring that ye shall bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name jesus for he shall save his people from their sins and said all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the lord by the prophet saying behold a virgin shall be with child and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us so when we go back and look and and many times there there are several times in in the book of matthew where matthew says that it might be fulfilled he goes back and talks about jeremiah and the different prophets the different different prophecies that were fulfilled in jesus's life that would and so he began to speak of these things and as we were talking about last time that when we go back to the scripture and we realized that when the when the fulfillment of the of the word when the prophets began to speak you know the the people were looking forward to the prophecy but when they began to look and look ahead to the prophecies of what was being spoken when they looked forward they couldn't see clearly they couldn't see the prophecy clearly because it took a prophet to come back and point them back to the word because they began to fall away from the word and so as as the as we know as the prophets begin to speak you know because that's how god said that he would declare his word to his people that he would he would make himself known in his word and and as amos 3 tells us that he would do nothing except he would reveal his his secret through his servants the prophets so we know that the prophets began to speak and and as they began to make itself known through the prophets yet the it took a profit for them to bring to bring them back to the word because and in time because that was the uh method that god had used and as he began to speak then people began to uh take on their own interpretation of the word and then it would take it would take a profit to bring the people back to the word so that they could see the word clearly and so as as time began to continue on as we look through all the different prophets as they begin brother brown said that they they built the body so we know that as the word went forth he began to uh make himself known in his word but it was a but it was a secret to the people but he because and as it become to as we were talking about as it began to unfold didn't become a mystery because then it became something that wasn't clear to the people as you know as as our illustration was last time when you when you try to express something and and you don't know clearly then and it's a secret but in the unfolding there is a revelation but there's also a mystery as we were speaking of last time you know because you know there was a brother said god had a mystery secret that he wanted to reveal to the people he wanted to make himself known and you know as as we were talking last time you know if if you have something that that you have shared with somebody and nobody else knows that then that's the secret which is exactly amos 3 when he said it because when he began to reveal himself to the prophets then that was making known to that secret because the prophet saw that but then they began to declare that but when it became when it began to been spoke then when they began to unveil the mystery yet there was a mystery there because they didn't understand when god spoke to isaiah and told him behold a virgin shall conceive well when god spoke to isaiah that was that was a mystery that was that was a secret but when he began to declare that well then how in the world is a virgin gonna conceive well because that's contrary to the word because that's contrary to the way that that thing nature was to take place because you know let every seed bring after its own kind and so it's like well this is this is something new this is tough well how's this supposed to take place even if even isaiah didn't understand the things that he said even when we go back and we look at the prophets and the things that they saw in the visions and they began to speak the words even they didn't understand everything that they were saying but you know what they began to express exactly what they saw and and that in their expressing see then then there was a time that yeah it was people were trying to take take what they heard and they kept trying to wrestle with and trying to understand it but you know it wasn't time for that well because god is his own interpreter so when god came to the place god was going to reveal the word he was going to interpret his own word he would make it known but as time we know that that they they tried to um build their own organizations their own denominations as brother branham said you know they took the word and they uh tried to build their own understanding and tried to build it all up to themselves and not waiting on god to reveal the word to them and we see how they built denominations so when the word came to be fulfilled then they missed the word that had been brought to them because here here's the fulfillment of the word jesus of as as as the prophets built the body as the opening of the word came then when the word came forth then jesus became that manifestation of the word that had been preached all the way down through history but when he stepped out there then they said who is this even when even in the scripture when we talk when we look at uh in isaiah even when isaiah 1 when the scripture tells us and we begin to look at the scriptures that relate to the messiah him coming and you know he says that he would send his messenger before his face and he said there would be one a voice crying in the wilderness so when when that when the scripture began to say that there was a forerunner that would be coming that would be pointing them back then when even when when the forerunner came when john the baptist stepped out and here he is standing in the fulfillment of the word and he stands out there and he begins to proclaim that this is the day that these scripture would be fulfilled as as now now is the time that the word would come forth he said he said there's someone amongst us now he said that i'm unworthy to unloose his shoes and he began to speak and he began to proclaim to the people said listen you've been waiting for a messiah all these years you've been waiting for this fulfillment you know many times brother branham tells the story he said you know he was talking about mary and joseph sitting on the porch reading these scrolls and and talking about what the what the rabbis had to say and all these things and you know they were pondering whether this would be true would we see this in our lifetime is this going to be something that's going to take place but you know and and no doubt there were people that as they began to hear these things you know it become goal to their hearing they just become just old wives fables it's just something that we do in a religious duty but there were some people that began to hold on to that and believe that there was one day coming that there was going to be a fulfillment of the word the word would be fulfilled that he would come just as just as as moses as prophesied in jeremiah and isaiah and all these ones that had prophesied that he would come and fulfill the word and no matter how how dark it got and how how lacks the people god or whatever yet there were some people that had the desire to hear the word to hold on to that calling where i don't know where he's going to come i don't know anything about it but i do know that the scripture tells us that the scrolls have told us the prophets have told us these things that he's coming but everybody had their own own ideas they had their own thoughts as brother brown talked about you know one believed it this way one believed it that way when you go back and look and see what the old and when you go back and read history and some of what some of the rabbis talked it's it's amazing that anybody believed anything why because but we see that it was that was to be the time and the day in which they lived that was to be the fulfillment of the word one because there would be a great life there wouldn't be reve the revelation of the word but yet there would still be people that would be groping in in gross darkness in that day when when the greatest light came when jesus came manifested in flesh and then people still walked in gross darkness why because that was the day and hour which they lived and it was prophesied that it would take place and there they are you know couldn't believe what was going to take place so many so many rabbis had argued over what was going to take place would you know there's so many of them that when they talked about the messiah coming they somewhat even even have argued about whether he would actually be god made manifest or not or would he just be a man anointed by god and all of all the scriptures that and so when he began begun when when jesus came and he began to speak and he began to identify himself and then he stood there and he told them and they wanted to stone him and he said he said why would you want to stone me he said because you make yourself god why it was contrary to their own own thinking brotherhood said it was his own denominational idea that they held on to and you know you go back all the way through the scripture and i believe solomon tells us he said there's nothing new under the sun and when you when you go back and you look into the scriptures even and we look at things today of the beliefs that people have of the scriptures and you know there's ten thousand different denominations of people believing the scripture and they all believe believe the same blunderly the same book they all believe the same thing well you know what this is this is the scripture this is what we base our beliefs off of but then there's so many of them that have have taken it and cut it and sliced it and pulled it apart and it's like well exactly what part of it will you actually stand on is this god's word or does it contain god's word so when they begin to when they begin to take these things and they and the rabbis began to study the the old testament and and the prophecies and all these things and and no doubt they were great scholar scholarly men and and had studied spent their whole life and studying the scriptures and knew all the words and and knew every little jot and tittle and all these things and yet they still didn't understand when the when the prophecy came when the fulfillment of the word came they still missed it they still argued over it but you know we we go back and you look at all of these old uh these rabbis and and looking at the things that that were taught you know i mean so many things when you began to look at the prophecies that were in the old testament and you began to look at what they had to say one of the things that stood out to me i was i was doing some reading and i was telling brother joe and them you know we have we have people still arguing in the in the 70 weeks of daniel in the prophecy whether there's you know one week left or is there a half week left is 69 half 69 and a half finished or only 69 finished and and you if you don't want to see something that's convoluted some of these rabbis have tried to figure out even from the old writings some some have tried to take and put all this together and i mean they're they were arguing years ago about is there one week left in the in the 70 weeks or is only a half week and it's like you know there's nothing new under the sun there's still those spirits are still here people are still arguing over the same things and they're still arguing you know of those of the scriptures it's the same thing that people had way back then it's not changed any they're still here and they're still are getting the same points and so you know they still argue all of these all these points and yet yet they they still want to hold and still claim these things but yet when when the the rabbis had had taught all these things and the people that heard all these things and yet it would only take a profit that could identify the time the day and the hour in which the people were living and point them in the right direction why because there had been so much denominational mess up there had been so much denominational in injection of all this denominational seed had been injected into the word and all this stuff that that when he began to preach that when jesus came and he spoke to the disciples i mean into the to the uh pharisees and the sadducees and all of them and he began to point them back to the scripture and then when he began to speak then he told you know he began to say to them you know search the scriptures in them you say you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me the scriptures he said he said he as they stood up and said one day he said oh he said abraham is our father he said he said if abe if abraham was your father he said abraham would rejoice to see my day abraham rejoiced to see this day abraham longed to see this day and yet you say that you're the seed of abraham and here you are walking in the day and you still don't see it and you're blind to the word and you've rejected it but he began to speak to him and tell them see he began to show them the scriptures and yet they denied the scripture why because as brother brahma said he didn't fit their denominational idea they had their own uh i did their own teaching their own beliefs about these things so when he began to speak and he began to walk why because it was so humble that it was that it would pass the people by they didn't even see it when the scripture tells us that in isaiah isaiah 40 it says the voice of him that crieth in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the lord make straight in the desert a highway for our god he said every valley shall be exalted and every mountain and hill shall be made low and the crooked shall be made straight and the rough places plain and the glory of the lord shall be revealed and all flesh shall see it together for the mouth of the lord hath spoken it so when they begin to see hey there's forerunner is coming this one that's going to be a voice crying in the wilderness to prepare the way of the lord and when john walks out of the out of the wilderness and he comes out there wearing a camel skin eating locust and wild honey looking like a crazy man when he walks out there into the water and he begins to identify this the time in which he lived and he began to tell them this is the hour that we are to make known the christ the messiah is coming and then you know we began to speak of these of this scripture of being the voice of one crying in the wilderness well no when you know how do you how do you place this in the scripture when when you when you have the the high priest campuses and all the different ones that were so uh exalted and and they're teaching and they're learning and all these things and when they come out there then you know why didn't we you know why did as brother ram said you know he didn't come down on a great uh cloud of and at a golden staircase and all kinds of different things you know where he didn't just walk down to the high priest and identify himself but he came such a lowly humble birth and when when here's here's this wild man walking out and the scripture says that you know um you know every every mountain shall be and he'll shall be made low the crooked shall be straight the rough place is made plain when nothing changed it was still the same rocky ground it was still the same dirt it was distill it was everything was the same here we are how are we trying to find you know where is it where is this great happiness going to take place that that the prophet isaiah told us about all we're seeing is a crazy man come out of the woods and he's standing there and he's speaking and he's trying to drown people and he begins to speak of the of this this man coming and here here is this man and the only and the only man that he points to and he calls out says behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world and the only man he identifies is a man that had a had a bad reputation his mother had ill reputation and that's the man that he's identifying as the messiah he's like you know this is crazy and yet it was a glorious thing that that all of the prophets began to look for you know that isaiah and all the different ones and then when it came to pass it was so lowly it was so humble but it was so great one because that's the way god works he hides himself in simplicity reveals himself in simplicity but the people missed it but to the ones that were that were called those that were they were spirit-filled that were called to them to receive that that were led by the spirit those were the ones that called it not everyone was called to understand that not everyone was called to catch that vision not everybody was called to see that but you know what they call what was what was given to them they didn't he didn't answer all of their questions it didn't it didn't it didn't bring everything into clarity but there was something that was revealed to them by god that it caught their attention that they held on to that when jesus began to speak to peter and he told him he said he said who do men say that i the son of man am and when he began to identify who he was that the people said oh you're one of the prophets you know and all the different things as they were talking he said but who do you say that i am who do you say that i the son of man am and see peter began to speak by his own revelation because he said thou art the christ the son of the living god why because it was something that had been revealed to him they didn't he didn't answer all of peter's questions when when when it was a nathaniel was sitting under the uh the fig tree there and you know when andrew come to him and and told him he said come see this man isn't this the one that that we've heard about all our lives isn't this the one and when he came he said is there any good thing that can come out of nazareth he said well listen he said he said don't take my word for it he said why don't you just come and listen to the man why don't you just come and hear what he has to say and when he when he'd come up and then jesus told him said listen he said look here here's a man within whom there is no gal and he said he said rabbi when did you know me how do you know how do you know anything about me he said he said before andrew called you and you sat under the fig tree he said i saw you he said he said see that that he knew something that took place one because it was a a revelation something that took an experience that he had before jesus that he called something well he didn't answer all of his questions but you know what there was something that took place that caught his that he gripped him that he began to follow the things that jesus had to say that he began to walk in after jesus you know there's so many times that when people when people get begin to look into the scripture and they they begin to study these things you know they want everything but tied up in a pretty little bow and they want everything with all of the t's crossed and all the eyes dotted but you know brother scissors that's not the way it is why because you've got to take it by faith i mean when god comes and he begins to reveal things to you and you catch something by revelation but you know that's not going to take you all away well we have to walk by faith so we just continue to walk by walk by faith we can't just hold hold our own feelings our own thoughts you know there's many people in the scripture you know they they begin to hold on to those you know those things where they where they they it doesn't answer all of the questions but you know something began to be revealed to them as we were reading here in the in the scripture in luke you know here's simeon you know here's here's a devout man a just man here's a here's a man that that had walked before the lord all these years and and and and had a great reputation you know many people no doubt loved him and reverenced him but you know god began to speak to him and tell him because you know he held on to these things and was looking for it looking for the coming of the lord to fulfillment of the word it hadn't become dull even even in his old age and and all these things he still held on to the scripture what did what it had said it still meant something to him and even as he got older and all the problems that he had he still was holding on to the scripture that it would be fulfilled and it says the holy ghost came to him and and spoke to him and told him said listen you'll not pass away until this that you desire to see will take place he says you're not going to pass away until you see the lord's christ well you know no no doubt there was a lot of people that walked out there and thought well you know he's just getting old he's just beside himself but you know what he didn't change simeon he held on to that and he still began no matter what anybody said it didn't change who you know it didn't change his idea he didn't why because if he was a a man of god and had heard god speak before then he had already heard that and you know what he held on to that he didn't listen to the naysayers or anybody else or anybody else trying to talk him out of it do you really think that it's going to be in your lifetime seeming that this is going to take place he said well you know all i can do is tell you what god told me and i'm just going to hold on to it why because i i believe what he said but you know he's obligated to fulfill the word all i got to do is believe it if he spoke to me that's all i have to do is hold on to it i can't i can't uh you know figure out all the x's and o's and all the other other things all i got to do is believe it all i got to do is hold on to it and he began to testify to the people and and no doubt there was a lot of people that thought he was losing his mind but he still held on to what god told him and as he began to speak then you know that as the scripture tells us there when when mary and joseph brought jesus into the temple to fulfill the law god was working on the other end and he reached out and told simeon he said listen he said the fulfillment of this word the fulfillment of your desire is here in the temple and you know he being led by the spirit of god no doubt had held on to this and then the spirit of god led him to where the child was and he was able to pick up jesus in his in his arms and look upon this little child and then he says he said lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the gentiles and the glory of thy people israel and so and it says and joseph and his mother marveled at these things that were spoken you know no doubt they were holding on to you know having having to walk by faith and believe something that was just you know a miracle and and nobody else believing it and and you know had dealing with the ridicule and all the things that they had to face and yet they still held on to that word and then you know when they walk into the temple and here's simeon begin to speak upon the same thing that they knew there was a revelation to simeon that the same thing that they held on he began to identify the same thing and you know it marveled they were marveled by these things and he said and simeon blessed them and said unto mary his mother behold this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in israel and for a sign which shall be spoken against and when we go back into the scripture we know that he said it as a set for a fall why because he would be a stumbling stone he would be a rock of offense but you know there was a rock a revelation that people would be built upon that they would hold on to but he would also be for the falling away of people and a sign which shall be spoken against why because the sign that would come it would be just like every other prophet being the prophet of the prophets it would be the same thing as it was back then why because they they ridiculed the prophets they killed them they stoned them all the things that happened to the prophets that he would be spoken against he said that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed so we know that that he would come and he would he would make himself known and he would reveal the secrets of the pro of the hearts of the people as he as he began to do the the feeling of fulfilling the scriptures that was spoken of him and and continuing on here verse 36 of the same chapter it says and there was one anna a prophetess the daughter of fannie old of the tribe of astr and she was of great age and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity and she was was a widow about four score in four years which departed not from the temple but served god with fastings and prayers night and day and she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise unto god and spake of of him to all them that look for redemption in jerusalem and when they had performed all things according to the law of the lord they returned to galilee to their own city nazareth so we see that anna had also been moved by the spirit to speak and declaring the same thing that had that simeon had spoken of in the same time and may you know and it was just a it was a double confirmation of what mary and joseph had had had happened in their life what they had experienced and here it was when the fulfillment of the word fulfilling of the law came then they began to fulfill and begin to proclaim to them the same thing as a confirmation of what they had stood for what they had believed and the scripture says verse 40 says and the child grew and whacked strong in spirit filled with wisdom and the grace of god was upon him now his parents went to jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover and when he was 12 years old they went up to jerusalem after the custom of the feast and when they had fulfilled the days as they returned the child jesus carried behind in jerusalem and joseph and his mother knew not of it and they supposing him to have been in the company when a day's journey and they sought him among their kin folks and acquaintance and they came and when they found him not they turned back again to jerusalem seeking him and it came to pass that after three days they found him in the temple sitting in the midst of the doctors both hearing them and asking them questions and all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said unto him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and i have sought thee sorrowing and he had said un and he said unto them how is it that he sought me wishing not that i must be about my father's business and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them but he went down with them and came to nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these things in a heart and jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with god and man and so we we know with as as they came that you know as as mary and joseph had had this great experience took place in the temple that day and and simeon began to you know i don't know how many people you know but we know that he proclaimed his you know his his uh testimony and made it known that that he was going this was going to take place and no doubt that that anna being a prophetess being in the temple then that she had made no no no doubt she had uh scriptural experiences and and and the different things that happened that she knew what was and had prophesied different things to the people that that people knew who she was that she wasn't just some quiet but god had spoke through her and as they took these things away and yet when the scripture tells us that they went to the went to the feast every year and here they go into the at the passover and here they they go into into the city and they and they go and and and do and do the customs and everything but then all of a sudden you know then they they don't pay attention to where jesus is but you know the first thing jesus they find jesus jesus is in their time in the temple talking to the doctors discussing the word why because he was the word and then he's out there discussing the word with the people but you know they became likes about what was taking place and then all of a sudden they left without him and as and as they you know they were gone and then they decided to come back but the first thing that that that mary says when she comes back into the temple and sees him you know why did you do this why why why have you treated us this way well you know what jesus was exactly where he was supposed to be i mean they were the ones they were the ones that didn't keep up with him they were not the ones that was following to find out what was going on but you know they left but she's asking you know why did you treat me this way you know the thing is is it you know when it comes to whether one you know when you wonder what happens in your life and wonder why things have happened and why things go the way that they do you know the one thing we got to do is stop and realize you know god ain't the one that left god didn't move when things go cold and there's lots of problems in our lives many times when we look you know the problem is it's us we've gotten away from god why because we allow god to be put on a back burner we allow god to be put off to the side we fail to we fail to keep him close by and i keep our eyes on him and all of a sudden he's gone and they wonder why why what's happened and why have you treated me this way well he didn't change no they were excuse me they were the ones that left and she comes into the temple and the first thing that she says is your father and i have have salty with tears you know we're so brokenhearted so worried about you that we've been traveling back to get you you know why did you treat me this way and the first thing he says you know don't you realize i must be about my father's business here here i'm doing i'm doing exactly what i'm supposed to do you know and you know as the scripture says that you know they were astonished by his understanding and everything but you know here she was wondering about him and and the first time that she begins to speak after all this time that she walks in there and you know he had to rebuke her because of her answer because of what over testimonies you know and here he said you know and then she's the first one that comes up there and says as the scripture tells us that he would be a sign that would be spoken against and she was the one that walks into the temple and declares that joseph was the father here he was beginning by her own testimony but you know he you know he as brother brown said you know if if joseph had been his father he'd been in the carpenter's shop but he was not even god was his father he was in the temple with the word declaring the word but you know nonetheless he was subject to his parents and he went with them and so here we see that he would always be uh there was a sign that would be spoken against we'd say all the way through the scripture that many times when we begin to look at the scriptures people began to look but they didn't they didn't hold on to the word you know but and so as as as the scriptures went forth you know there's so many of them that you know that began to speak and when jesus began to speak and and go about and as the scripture tells us that he went out and to do good and to and to heal the sick and and to fulfill the the word and then the people walked out there and they said is this not the carpenter's son you know and it's it's not not seeing that it was the fulfillment of the word but the first thing they do is like well don't we know his mom and daddy and here and here he is out doing miracles and declaring the word to the people and the first thing that they say is like don't his mama got a bad reputation you know i think i think they said that his mom and daddy trying to pass off that he he's virgin born and when he began to point them back to the scripture when he began to declare the word the first thing that people could do is look back at his past and say was he born in bethlehem i don't remember him being born in bethlehem do you remember that you know then every time all it was it wasn't what jesus said to the people but it was it was it was always that accusation that could be made it was always the whispers behind his back that people began to say and it's like you know then they become to stir these questions up in people's minds that as they begin to see these things and and you know then you know when when they begin to question when the when the pharisees and the different ones begin to question him on the on the different things of this of the word and and then they would ask him questions and and you know then he would then he would begin to ask them ques you know as like when they they asked him you know it was john's baptism was it of man or was it of god you know they didn't want to answer his question why because they feared the people but they didn't they didn't believe what john had to say and he began to point them back to the scripture and say well this is this is if this is true then then why didn't you follow it and then when he began to bring him back to the word and point out to him and then they were like well nobody no man could answer him nobody nobody wanted to answer him why because they wanted to hold on to their own denominational ideas when when when nicodemus come to him at night that and you know began to speak to him and said he said rabbi listen he said we know that thou art a teacher come from god and no man can do these things unless god was with him but nicodemus didn't want to come during the day nicodemus didn't want to come where everybody could see him he wanted to sneak around in the middle of the night and come talk to jesus so nobody else had to see what he what he had to say why because you know he didn't he didn't want to give up his prestige or it might you know that he would have to answer why was he out talking to jesus why would he talk you know why why would he want to know these things but there was something that intrigued him that stirred up inside him that he would come to ask jesus these questions and then when jesus began to speak to him and he would tell him he said listen he said except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god and when he began to speak these things you know then nicodemus was there and he's like well how can i enter back into my mother and he said listen he said he said it's not being born by the flesh again he said but you must be born of the spirit he said except a man be born of water and a spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of god and he began to speak to these things and here here's a great learned man of the day and here he is and he didn't even understand the things that jesus had to say and he began jesus began to point him back to these things and yet he never did he never did follow in them but he did you know he held on for a little while but he didn't he didn't continue in it and all the way through the scripture we see them as they begin to speak as he began to speak to the different ones all through the to the to the people you know he said he said he spoke to the to the common people and they heard him gladly you know as the man that was blind there that day the young man that was blind and he stood there and you know and you know his parents were asking you know you know how did this this man this young man receive his sight and they were so afraid of answering the question you know it's like well he's of age you ask him i'm not we're not getting involved in this what do you well do you know how long your son was blind do you know that if it was really a true thing and then the young man walks up there and they were asking about you know how did this take place and who held you and all these things i know he could testify was this and i was blind i know what it's like to be blind but you know what there was one that came and told me that he could that he could recover my sight that i could see and he said all i had to do was believe what he had to say and do what he said do and i received my sight and you know there was something all of a sudden this man he stepped up and said you know i follow this man why because because all of them back in the old testament y'all said kept telling me that jehovah could fulfill these things he could he could fulfill he could feel and touch people and heal people the the psalmist david told us that we had one that that could touch they could heal all our diseases he could he could do all these mighty miracles we've heard all these things in the scripture and yet here's one that stands in our minds and does the miracles and begins to do these things he said he said do y'all want to follow him also oh oh forbidden oh heaven forbid that we have anything to do with this man this man's bells above anybody in the right mind would know this man had a devil and why would anybody want to have anything to do with him yet there was jesus standing there and said listen he said if j if the devil can cast out if satan can cast out satan and his house is divided his kingdom's divided he said he said this this is not it but he said but look he said it was it was what was spoken of in the scripture that these things would take place but yet and even no matter all that was said and done yet they did not believe it they did not hold to it why because it was they were the ones that would not hold on to it it was it was this um fulfillment of the word that they held on to their denominational ideas and here they are holding on to what god had had clearly vindicated to the people and yet they still turned it down and walked away and many times you know we see that the time and the age in which we we live we know that that that time and and see all these things would would repeat themselves again and we know that uh as we we've seen the day and the hour that we live that you know god is still doing the exact same thing that he's always done what was prophesied in the scripture that he would do these things and yet there would still be those that would not believe and no matter how much how much the word was made known and revealed they still would not believe it but there's only but there is a predestinated group that would believe and this is from the message what was the holy ghost given for brethren says there's only one way to find it he said there was a stone cut out of the mountain without hands that rolled into the world and smashed it out and it became like weed or chaff on the threshing floors he said let that stone the christ jesus that stumbling stone to the world a stone of a fence a laughing stone a stumbling block to the church but a precious and a lodestone to the believer a stone of assurance a stone of rest oh my resting i know that i've passed from death unto life my soul is at rest oh come unto me all you that labor and heavy laden and i'll give you rest for your soul a sign that's to be evil spoken of said the prophet to the prophet to mary it'll be a sign sure it will but it'll be an assurance it'll be a love it'll be a satisfaction it'll be something that you know you've passed from death unto life jehovah god became man took on our stock crossed himself from god and become man there's the sign become he was god and became man not rich men but poor man this is the super sign you've asked for a sign said god i'll give you one an everlasting son he could have come otherwise as i said but a baby why did he become a baby when that first little toothless mouth opened in that manger on the first cr the first christmas morning in his little manger from god and was man ever wit man come to the world with nothing but still man what was he trying to do what was he purposing he cried like a baby in the manger he played like a little boy on the street he told like a man but yet he was emmanuel this is the super side god dwelling in the creation that he created this super sign shall be a sign unto you brother brown continuing dropping down to 60 scrolling down to 68 there he said can't you see the real sinus jehovah become one of us jehovah god on earth as a fugitive a pilgrim in the land that he created rejected and pushed and laughed at and scoffed at a stumbling stone to the unbeliever a rock of offense a devil to the religious world but an eternal sign of the believer god with us the super son did you see it god made manifest god presenting himself to the world as a fugitive could have come some other way but chose to come this way listen to this don't miss it i think that god had his head in his mind he it would be appealing to the human being it is to the believer it is appealing when god became becomes one of us but to the starchy ungodly a stumbling block i'll give you the son a virgin shall conceive emmanuel will be with you god thought it would appeal to the human race that our god would be one of us that he would cross himself and become our dust that he would become our stock a human stock the creator who made all things and again it fulfilling prophecies the prophets had saw it he said another thing and the world was and the word was made flesh made dust flesh and dwelt among us the jehovah the word became human became dust and tabernacled with us everlasting fl sign shall never end oh when we think of it an eternal sign the super signs of all sign god becoming one of us and then he must be the seed of abraham abraham of course was the seed of eve he was the woman's seed that was to bruise the serpent's head but abraham if you catch it he had faith in god which re which united the spirit of god with the flesh of man there's where the faith come there's why he could be the abraham seed not all flesh but the uniting of spirit and flesh together god making himself tearing out rooting out all evil bringing into submission the flesh the dust that he created and live with you as a partner amen so here becomes that sign that everybody that was rejected as he said that they would be spoken of but yet he came to fulfill the word that he become one of us that we could become him he took he took on our flesh he took on our substance he became he became sin who knew no sin that we become the righteousness of god and here he be coming and he said he said this would be a sign an everlasting sign that he would come and he would become one of us and he would told just like we did and he would face all of the things that we faced but yet he would he would do it without sin and he would overcome and then when in the end then he would stand up and he would say listen i've conquered all of this he said he said you know he's i've come into the world and he said i've conquered he said now you're able to conquer through me he said he said all that that i have is given unto you and so now the same as being an heir of god and joint heirs with christ then all of these things and then as as they began to look through the through the scripture then all of a sudden then he became what we are that we become what he is and we still stand today and the fulfillment of the word it's today why because today and the day an hour which we live while we become why because as all the way down through the through the scriptures we realize that well in our day we've received a prophet why because god never never has left his word but he became in our day to reveal the word just like he did back then and to make it known to the people to make it known to you and i yeah we you know and yet and all of that that was spoken of yet there would be people that would come and and ridicule it and they would stand against it and you know ask all these questions and say you know why does it say this and why does it say that and you can't you can't defend this and why why don't we have all these different questions and all these things and all they do is get up and ridicule and discount the word why because it was spoken of that it would take place but yet there would be some that would stand up that god would speak to and they would receive a revelation god god didn't call us to you know to be apologetics but god called us to proclaim the truth i can't you know you may not be able to answer all the questions i can't answer all of the questions but you know let me tell you something i know what god has revealed to me and i can stand on that i stand on what god has showed me and i stand on that and yes you know what every time that someone has stood up even back then even when jesus stood and walked in the word that he was spoke of he was made fun of and ridiculed and scorned and you know what we still have that same testimony today that we still stand up and take the reproach of the word that we still have to be having to stand and proclaim the same thing the world the world doesn't like us the world has come well because he didn't they didn't they didn't like him they they stood against him he was outcast of the world and we are outcasts of the world but you know we have we have received this word and it's going to be evil spoken against but you know what it's a great thing because you know it was it's a great thing to us why because it's a great thing to me why because the word has made has been made known one because when when we pick up the scripture it's it's not well you know i i don't know how how that that puts you know how we put that together and everything because when when the prophet came and we've seen that in the day in which in which we've lived and then many people have probed at it and there was so many i mean great scholarly men have looked into this word and and have studied the scriptures and all these things and yet it takes it takes god using a man that had that he had uh prophesied that would come that he ordained that would come in the last days that would take this word and it would open up and it would be made known and he began to reveal the scriptures to the people and you have to get into all of that and all of the great understanding that has been made known then people have turned it down why because he didn't they're fancy it didn't match it didn't match their denominational ideas and then you know there's all these different ideas and different camps and all these things but yet there's still a voice being cried out that is still speaking the truth and there's still people that still have the ears to hear excuse me i thank god for the day in which hour which we live god's called us to proclaim this word to carry the reproach of it that's that's our that's what god has called us but you know it's it's not it's not whether you understand it all and there's people you know that still they they they have gotten that's that's all they do is they they find things to ridicule and and things that that don't match up and and all this and they just feed on that but you know what i'm not i'm not worried about all the things that i don't understand i'm walking on the things that i do understand i'm walking on the i'm walking into things that god has showed me that has made that god has made known to me that's what i'm rejoicing in amen i i want to thank god because all of these things even you know even when we look at the the life and the christian life well you know to be like jesus to see the things that jesus had to go through and all the things that he had to suffer and the scripture as the song brother i'm talking about he said must jesus bear the cross along and all the world go free he said no there's a cross for me there's a cross for me to carry and i want to carry mine gladly i want to be faithful in what god has called me to you know we can we see all the things that have taken place but you know the the the scorn and the and the ridicule and all those things you know that comes with it but you know i'm not i'm not looking at what goes on down here on this earth i'm not looking at these things i'm looking for an eternal home i'm looking for what the end result's going to be and you know you know all the way through the the history we you go back and looking to see what the different ones had to the price that each one had to pay you know we go back and you start to look and see that all the ones that gave their lives for this word you know it may not it may not be a physical taking of our life but it's a giving of our life to god it's a surrendering of all things to him you know we have a lot of people that that have have to have to face a lot of heartaches and problems but you know what i'm not i'm not looking at what goes on down here i'm looking for that eternal weight of glory i'm looking for what god has in store for us keep our eyes on the prize to know what god has in store for them that love him amen god bless you tonight let's stand i see what you get amen god bless you tonight dear patheth for the water so my so long if i fear you alone are my hearts desire and
