========================================

studying through the book of hebrews and we've made it to hebrews chapter 2 verse 8. so the brothers could go ahead and pull that up and we'll just keep continuing on as we meditate on the things that paul talked about in hebrews just to kind of uh set set a background again for for what we've been studying on paul paul in the book of hebrews is right and if you go if you skip over to the book uh or that the audio's not working it's good all right and hebrews hebrews chapter 10 paul kind of uh he mentions that the people that he's writing to are people that have been through a lot of afflictions and been through been through some struggles and so a lot of the things that he's writing about are to encourage them in their faith and in hebrews chapter 10 he tells them that don't don't give up don't with all the many things that we've heard and seen we've got a reason to believe and he lays out that case through throughout the book of hebrews um for why we believe in jesus as he's elevating elevating jesus and and why why we have can have confidence those in the very first church age why why they could have confidence and and believing on him and i think it's in um in first corinthians that paul laid out that we've there's been five there were 500 witnesses that that saw him alive after after you raised from the dead and paul lays out all these cases for for why we should believe in jesus and so let's let's continue on in hebrews chapter 2 verse 8 he says thou hast thou has put all things into in subjection under his feet under the feet of christ everything's under his feet friend that he put all in subjection under him he left nothing that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under him so we see a lot of things now now this kind of leads into the next verse we don't we don't see yet all things put under him but we do see jesus and and so we don't see all things put under him meaning there's a lot of things that you know we've got a lot of afflictions in life we've got a lot of struggles in life we don't we don't see yet people are you can look around and see people dying we don't see yet uh death uh we don't see yet death under his people are still dying so we still see death so we see all of those things we don't see yet all things put under him but going on to hebrews chapter 2 verse 9 on the next slide but we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should take death for every man now there's a lot of packed into that statement so let's just sit on that for a little bit longer and see what we can unpack because you know during that first church age there were people like i mentioned in first corinthians that paul mentioned that 500 people that he he mentioned that had actually seen jesus after he had raised from the dead and and there were a lot of people that had seen jesus walking around and seen the effect of his of his ministry and seen after the day of pentecost they had seen the life of christ actually lived out in people and peter and john saying look on us and telling the man of the gay beautiful or i don't have any silver and gold but what i've got i'll give to you and they could actually see the life of christ and these people but i i think really it goes deeper than that that that to see jesus and brother brown would outline as he was preaching hebrews chapter two that here you know there's a lot of people in the world today that cannot see jesus even though their eyes or their physical eyes are open that we can we can actually see jesus we can actually see jesus now by revelation now see brother am in hebrews chapter two he said the people were blind they didn't know him and he's talking he's talking about when when jesus was going down the uh carrying that cross on his back and they they didn't recognize who he was he said they didn't know him they didn't recognize him you say blind could they have their sight you can still have your sight and be blind now isn't that like a paradox that you could be maybe even sitting here in the in the building this morning and and and have your physical eyesight but yet be blind to who jesus is and not understand who jesus is now it was what a strange thing almost that in this day by by the preaching of the gospel by the message that we've heard that we can see jesus that we've got the power that god has given us the ability to see jesus even though physically he might not walk down the aisles of the church we don't physically see him out on the street or or doing things like they did walking on the shores of galilee back then but we can see jesus by the revealing of his word so if we go to the next slide now now jesus this this is that famous parable where jesus said let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind now now the reason brother the reason jesus said this uh called calling the pharisees the blind leaders of the blind because jesus he began to say strange things and he told them they were all worried about the the kind of food that they were what they would put in their mouth and he said it's not what in your what you put in your mouth that defiles you but it's what comes out of your mouth that defiles you it's what it's with the things that you say it's that what what comes out of your mouth that is is what defiles you and they they the bible says that they they got offended noah then came his disciples and sent under him know us now that the pharisees were offended after they heard this say and why were they offended because they couldn't see what he was talking about they were blind they couldn't understand what he was talking about now isn't that just a true example of the church today how many how so many people have become offended by the message because they don't understand what it is they don't understand that that they're not they don't realize that they're blind and so many people that remember that's the that's the forgotten be attribute beatitude blessed are they they're not offended in me jesus preached that sermon so many people get offended at what what they don't really under they think the message is about uh bopping women on the head and and treating or treating uh just just maybe hard to understand things just like the pharisees couldn't understand what jesus was saying so they they got offended at him and jesus said he answered and said every plan which my fatherly heavenly father hath not planted shall be rooted up let them alone they be blind leaders of the blind and if the blind lead the blind both shall fall into the ditch now he he's telling them they're blind he's telling us his disciples these people are blind and they they can't see now again think think what a i'm leading up to something i think it's profound how how simple how simple the evidence of the new birth is how simple the gospel really is as you hear the word the word begins to open up to you and you begin to see what the message is you begin to have an understanding of what the message is really about what the gospel is really about that's why if we go to the next slide in isaiah 42 16-18 it says and i will bring the blind you talk about a prophecy i will bring the blind by a way that they knew not now that's speaking of jesus christ because he said i am the way the truth the life i am the way and the blind when he came people people were blind they didn't understand how to get to god how they didn't understand the approach to god but when jesus came he opened up their eyes so that they could see so that they could have an understanding and you see that's why that's the whole purpose of the gospel is to give you an understanding to make you understand that that you were predestinated eternally that the the the scripture is actually speaking of you in malachi 4 5 6 that your heart is going to be turned it's talking about you it's talking about you in revelation 10 that when john typed you it's speaking of you that he took the book and ate it and you got to take the book and ate it and your eyes began to be opened up to these things god the word is actually giving you understanding and it says i will lead them in paths that they have not known i will make darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will i do unto them and not forsake them they shall be turned back they shall be greatly ashamed that trust engraven images that say to the molten images you are our gods hear hear ye deaf and look ye blind that ye may see so that's what paul is talking about when he says but we see jesus that our eyes were blinded but now by the preaching of the gospel our eyes our spiritual eyesight has become open and we can see because seeing is an understanding seeing is revelation a revelation of his word and what it what it really is revelation when you read the bible and you've got all these little facts and things that you've got you you read and you read about daniel 70 weeks and you read about the statue of perfect man and you read about the capstone and adoption and it seems like little facts that you're just you're just learning but when god reveals it to you he puts all the pieces together so that you can see a picture and when the pieces come together the clouds not up in the in the cloud the cows not up in the clouds up in the sky the clouds aren't down on the ground the picture is a picture a complete picture that's perfect that you can understand a picture that's painted and what what is the picture the picture is jesus that's why paul said we see jesus but we see jesus and that's why uh i put down at the bottom the scripture in revelation 3 18 i counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that the word to the layout i see in church age that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness did not appear and anoint thine eyes with i salve that thou mayest see that's why brother branham i think he made a lot many times he would tell that story of his mama rubbing the grease on his eyes because the grease would open up his eyes in the natural but he gave us a message god get sent a message through that little man to open up our eyes so that we could actually see now if we go to the next slide in the sardisian church age brotherhood said so when when we receive eternal life we're receiving part of that cosmic light that was back yonder before there was ever a molecule uh-huh that light of god comes into our heart that lightens us that we see jesus now now you see you begin to wonder how do i know if i got the new birth the light of god in your heart reveals jesus to you the bible said we don't see all things but we see jesus because as you're hearing the word that it's actually it actually opens up to you so that you see the picture now see how jesus was talking to the pharisees and he was he was telling them they're blind they don't see and you know a lot of times you can you try to explain to a blind person what you should be seeing and you but you you won't ever really understand until you see it for yourself you tell a blind person when you need to be seeing this or you need to look if i maybe if i was trying to explain to a blind person what i'm looking at right now i would say that well there's all these people looking at me and there's a i'm i'm standing up behind the podium up in the front of the room and there's all these things uh you know there's musical instruments behind me and i could try to explain it but when you see it for yourself then you know what it is when you see it for yourself and that's what revelation is when you see for yourself what the bible is talking about that's how you know something's happened when it's revealed to you now if we go to the next slide and again we're talking about paul saying but we see jesus now the the the that's that great story of when the the disciples were walking on the road to emmaus that brother brown a lot of times he would use as an illustration they were walking along and they didn't recognize who jesus was but then he went in and they went in and he shut the door they shut the door and they went into a place and he began to do something like he had done before he began to break that bread and he began to share things to him and their eyes became open and they were wrecking the bible says and their eyes were opened and they knew him they knew him in other words they had an understanding and he vanished out of their sight that's when you know something's happened is when you see when you see jesus when you understand him if we go to the next slide and brother and and and then jesus came and called he said he was that truly he was that plus god see he was the manifestation jesus is the body the boy the man god was what dwelt in him god was in him he was a god man he was a man yet he was god manifested in flesh and flesh so when we see jesus we see god now see how am i supposed to see jesus if he's not here in the flesh if he's not sitting in the pew in this building we see jesus by revelation that's what he said when you see the father see me you see the father we see jesus by the revelation of his word then we see him by the the effects of that revelation in our lives him moving in the church him in changing your life him actually healing people the effects of that life and his power is how we see jesus we know that he's done something for us because we see him and the effect of that of that revelation the effect that it has in our life so on the next slide brother ram said in the message look he said what are you looking at what are you seeing we must see jesus and the only way we see jesus is see the word this is now listen how profound this is we know that jesus is the word in the beginning was the word and the word was god and the word was with god and and those things he's he was the actual expression of god so he's the word but we have a symbol of that word here which is what brother roman said this is the natural symbol of the spirit so when we look he said it is the letter that's the spirit quickens so when i'm reading this word when i'm reading the word the spirit the word the actual word wants to quicken what i have received in my heart he wants to quicken that and make it come alive now what's the only thing that's preventing him from quickening it and brother said he wants to give you the holy ghost more than you want it but why does he what what's preventing it it's my doubt my doubt keeps the spirit from quickening the word my doubt and so that's why we come to church the more word we hear is actually purifying us it's building up within us until we come to a place until we can accept what god said that's why this is the natural symbol of the spirit this is the natural symbol the letters on the page that i can read that is a symbol of the word of god that will quicken this and make it come alive he said you know what i mean it is the letter that the spirit quickens now now you see why the new birth has been taught wrong so many times is because the new birth has been preached that you go to a camp meeting for example and you feel something and there you go you got the new birth but have you received the word have you heard the word without the word without the letter the spirit cannot quicken anything many times people go to it they'll go through a prayer line and they'll they'll get prayed on and they'll think they've got something they'll go away and they and then they'll go back to another prayer line after they after they they they realize well i i went through the prayer line but i still can't get rid of all i still can't get delivered i can't overcome the alcohol the depression the the pornography that all the things i can't overcome because they they didn't get that word the word down in their heart the word is the thing that actually makes a way for the spirit to quicken it the word is the thing that that allows it gives you something to believe it's a natural symbol of the spirit it is the letter that the spirit quickens see that that is the letter that and the spirit quickens this letter and makes it a reality the spirit quickens the letter and makes it a reality so let's let's keep going on there's a lot to be said about that brother ram said on the next slide he said in god's provided place of worship but lord it does delight our hearts when we see jesus glorified among us when we see him glorified when we see his word which he is the word when we see we can read it here in the bible where he promised he would do it then see him work it right in us then we're doing like paul said in hebrews 2 9 but we see jesus we see him in his word we see him performing his word we see him changing our lives we see the effect of his word and we see the word opening up so that when we read our bible it's not a mystery anymore because we see jesus we look into our bible and we see it then in christ the mystery of god revealed now listen to this he said look christ in you makes him the center of life of the revelation see christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation christ in the bible makes the bible the complete revelation of christ christ in you makes the complete revelation of the whole thing see what croc what god is trying to do what is the new birth then what's the new birth you say well brother brown what is the new birth it is the revelation of jesus christ personally to you the revelation of jesus christ personally to you now now see you say well i well how do i i was talking to one of the one of the young people a while ago and they went to a camp meeting and they went through the prayer line and they were they were they were seeking to know whether they had the new birth or not see see why jesus said he told peter flesh and blood is revealed flesh and blood didn't tell you this but my father which is in heaven it's got to be a revelation and and and one of the young people went through the prayer line and they were wondering whether they had the new birth or not and the preacher told them well i think you yeah i think you got it but see that's flesh and blood flesh and blood cannot tell you it's got to be my father in heaven which reveals you and and i'll be honest that that kind of raised my heckles a little bit because that's great if somebody tells you you got you got the new birth but it how much greater what more sure water prophecy if the father god if your father tells you whether you've got the new birth or not and how he's how is he going to tell you he's going to reveal it to you as you eat the word as you eat now now you might so you might be like sister shepherd laying on there on her couch when she fell asleep and she had a dream about the statue let me not move away too from the microphone she had a dream about the statue of a perfect man and brother brandon preached that sermon about the statue of perfect man she was wondering if she had the new birth and she was born again brother branham said she was and she was wondering if she had the new birth but see as you get built up as you get built up it's beginning to unfold to you until a place till you come to a place where you begin to realize there's been a change in my life something has happened and the opening of the word begins to build confidence in you that something has taken place in my life it's the revelation of the word the revelation of the word that is the main thing what is the new birth it's the revelation of jesus christ personally to you you see how revel when you see jesus that that trumps everything because you're going to have bad days you're going to have good days when you don't feel you don't feel things you don't feel uh i we were actually listening to to marcus becker on the way to church this morning and he was preaching up there in ohio and he was talking about how when you have sisters going through menopause you don't feel too great someday you don't feel too too it's up and down and just anything in life and so you can't base it on how you feel but you can base it on a revelation if god has opened your eyes to the truth and and revealed it to you then you you know that's the rock of revelation that you can base everything on not on how you feel not on whether you went to a camp meeting and felt something or went through a prayer line and somebody laid their hands on you and you and you had confidence in that minister or had had had conf or or felt a little emotion or something but the revelation of his word to you the revelation is something that nobody can take away from you the devil can't take it away from you you can't impersonate a revelation he said the devil can impersonate everything else but he can't bring the word by word he can impersonate feelings he can impersonate lights he can impersonate dreams he can impersonate everything else but he can't impersonate the word the revelation of the word and we got five more minutes let's go on to the next one we see jesus who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory and honor that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man now don't you just love the imagery that paul evokes tasting death like like he almost like he savored it like he he sat down at the table and and tasted it so and he tasted it so that you wouldn't have to now now you you think about jesus how how horrible that was all of that agony and and and and uh being whipped and and and going through the experience of of carrying his cross and and and the fatigue and not being able to get up there and hardly and all that all that he did for you and i and he did it because our sin needed an atonement think about the wrath of god was poured out on that man you know many times we'll come to church and we'll get to thinking well i wonder if god if god hates me i wonder if he even loves me but all of god's wrath was poured on that on that man so that it wouldn't be poured out on you and that proves that god loves you he proves it proves he cares for you because all of that all of that that that man went through all of that that he sacrificed and endured so that you could be saved now if we go to the next slide that he by the grace of god should taste death for every man so he did it for every man for anybody that we believe and not everybody will believe but he did it the way is open the way is made open and that's why in 1st john chapter 2 verse 2 it says he is the propitiation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world whosoever will let him come that's why in john 3 16 that the scripture we all know and we love to quote for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life and that's why the bible says in revelation 22 17 whosoever will let him take the water of life freely whosoever will the way is open see many times we get in our head that that if if we want the new birth if we want to come to jesus that we might have to wait 10 or 20 years or so it could be far off because you get in you begin to get in your head that maybe god doesn't love you or you don't understand the way the way to approach him but you don't have to wait you can accept him right now all you got to do the only thing that's keeping the spirit from quickening that word in your life is your doubt so all you've got to do is believe all you've got to do is say and i i can testify of this i can testify my own mind battles of things growing up in the message you know uh i i remember sitting there in my office at work one day just battling something out and i began to think you know i i i believe i believe that what that minister is saying is is true i believe that what he's saying is true after i battled it out and battled it out and it was like it was like heaven just dumped out on me right there in that moment why because in that moment i believed all you've got to do is believe that's what the word is for is to open up a channel to give you something in your heart to so that you can you know what to believe and you know that god loves you and you know that he's there for you and just believe him just take him at his word and john 11 26 says and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die believeth thou this then jesus can go ahead and come forward and we'll we'll close on that believe us thou this all you have to do is believe how simple the gospel is escapes us so many times because we want to make it complicated we want to make it something that's mysterious but it's as simple as can you believe it you love the lord this morning amen god bless you as we turn over the service to the musicians you
