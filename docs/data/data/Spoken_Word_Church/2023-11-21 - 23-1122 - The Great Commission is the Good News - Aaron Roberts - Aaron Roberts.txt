Great Commission is the good news amen because that's what he said go into all the world and preach the gospel to every living creature and here here in m Matthew he said to go and teach All Nations these things and that's kind of what I want to look at tonight because you know what it is good news amen but the but you know the world don't see it as good news they don't realize what what has been has been proclaimed in this day but praise God that we have eyes to see yeah and ears to hear amen amen well let's just all pray before we read the scripture tonight Heavenly Father we thankful Lord

way Lord have the preeminence in the service tonight Lord touch each one that has a need Lord the ones that are listening in be listening in later Lord just be with them touch them whatever the needs are and Lord we Just Want to Thank You Lord we set aside this time of this time of the year Lord the world looks and sets the time of Thanksgiving aside Lord for what you've done for us Lord but Thanksgiving is every single day of the Year lord lord for what you've done for us so we just can't thank you enough can't praise you enough and Lord there many that'll be traveling and doing different things and Lord we just pray that your hand be upon them Lord bless each one Lord bless the Gatherings and Lord we just commit all things to you Lord there's many that have a need in their bodies lord they're seeking answers Lord but L we just commit them to you Lord and we know that you can touch them because we've seen you move and even even when it didn't look like there was no way and but you've come on the scene and and worked a miracle and if you can do it once you can do it again and but as the the man that came with the child that was sick Lord and he he come and said Lord help my unbelief Lord help our unbelief Lord that that we can believe because you said if thou can't believe all things are possible and Lord that is still real today so Lord just help us in our in our ways we commit everything to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen Matthew 28 beginning at 18 verse 18 He says and Jesus came and spake unto them saying all power is is given unto me in heaven and in Earth he said go ye therefore and teach all Nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son of the Holy Ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and lo I Am With You Always even until the end of the world and then the other portion of the scripture is Mark 16 very familiar scripture and he says and he said unto them go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them and they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover amen God bless you tonight you can have your seats and you know looking at at these passage of scripture here when Jesus is speaking to to them and and giving them brother BR said it was the commiss the Great Commission to go into all teach All Nations and he here he was speaking in Mark talking about preach the gospel to Every Creature but then he was talking about teach All Nations all these things and baptizing them and then he says and teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and you know the the word there observe you know many times when we look at the word observe we just think it means to to look at or to watch but you know the the word observe has many different meanings to it you know we're getting ready to observe Thanksgiving so you know we just don't look at it we participate amen I don't know about the rest of you do I do amen I don't know about the rest of you I participate so you know that so when you look at to when it says to observe it's not just to look at something or to maintain observation of you know to watch but it also means to stay in compliance with it also means to take part of so you're taking so when you observe something you're looking at what what the scripture says and you're getting into what what Jesus said because he said observe the things that I have said unto you and you know one of the things that when we look at things and we talk about observe well you know there's there's two sides to that because it's not just doing something but it's not doing something also because there when you when you observe then you have to know which way you're supposed to go you know just like the the word crime when you talk about crime and everybody thinks well that means committing something you know I don't I I you know to do something well don't pay your taxes and see if you if you don't end up in trouble you know because it why because the word crime actually means an act or omission that's against the law right so when we talk about observing something then we have to know just like the scripture says abstain from all appearance of evil so those things and when he said do these things where there's things that he told us not to do and those things we stay away from but there's things that he wants us to do and those things that we are supposed to do so when we observe the things that are in the scripture then we understand because he said you show them to demonstrate the scripture you just demonstrate these things because he said I'm telling you that because he said when you go to do these things he said demonstrate the gospel to the people not just preach it not just talk about it but it's actually a demonstration of the power of the Holy Ghost and you know when because you know one of the things here in in the scripture when when uh Jesus is speaking to the disciples and tell them you know he tells them to baptize in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost but see it took a revelation because Peter when he got up on the day of Pentecost he didn't go back and tell them exactly what Jesus said because he knew what the revelation of the word was that Jesus had given him and when he stood up there and began to speak to him he said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost came but you observe these things that I have told you to do because he never said baptized in the in the title form of the father son but he told him that there was a name and he said he said there was only one name given under Heaven whereby men shall be saved and he said whatsoever you do in word or deed do all in the Name of Christ Jesus so there was one name that was given that has all of the Power has all of the glory everything that rest in in God was placed in one name and that was in placed in Jesus Christ and that was the name that was given to us and so when what do we take on then when we become a child of God we take on the name Jesus Christ then as the Bride of of Christ that we become mes Jesus Christ we are living in the power of the name Jesus Christ that's who we are today not who we're going to be or you know hoping for no that's who we are we have that's who we are that's that's what the good news has come and brought to us who we are amen amen so here this this is from the message my redeemer liveth and I I've got a few quotes I want to I want to read here and brother brother sister now this message that was read to us this morning we would call it the Great Commission it was the last commission our lord gave his disciples to go to all the world to preach the Glorious Good Tidings of the Resurrection to all the world for a witness and then he would return and that signs and wonders would accompany this message that was to be preached and then he goes on and he starts talking about Christian religion he starts talking about the Catholic church and all the things that just a skip time but you know he talks about all that and he says but he said it's always been my contention friends that those things mean nothing because you know when he starts talking about you know when when you try to hallow the ground and you try to put up relics and tokens and everything brother Ram said God never sent us relics and tokens he sent us the Holy Ghost and all the things that you know we try to people try to observe these things and you know they want to put up and have all these things well that actually means nothing there's no power there because you know many times when they when you go back to the Old Testament and you look at all the things that the the people in the Old Testament when they went back and you know they were just going through the motions and doing these things that that God had told the children of Israel to do well they just become a stink in God's nostrils because there was no faith there there was no believing in what was going on it was just something they went to church and done and went through the rituals and then they went home because they never believed in the power that would take place under the under what God was trying to do for them why because the people that stood in the pool pit and preached to them day after day week after week month after month they just went by because they did not believe what they said why because it was just a carnal commandment to them they just went through the motions why because standing behind the pull pit the people that actually preached it didn't believe it that's right brother amen and it's the same way today is that people that stand behind the pulpits don't even believe what they preach why why are people so tossed about why why why is denominations in the in the mess they are today why why do we see these kind of things why because people don't believe what the word says they don't read and so if they don't believe it then well you know I just I just take my own ideas my own thoughts well if you get to the point where you start taking your own thoughts well you're in real trouble because how can how can you try to understand the great infinite things of God with a finite mind amen that's right but he says it's always been my contention friends that those things mean nothing it isn't any man can die and lay in the ground but what Rose from that is what we worship today a living resurrected ascended Lord Jesus who lived today he said many people can die but it takes what rose from the dead and when he rose from the dead because he was the only one that could lay down his life because he told him ahead of time he said he said tear down this Temple but said in three days I'll raise again because he knew what he was what he was called to do what the word had told him to do when he walked out there he knew what was going to take place but he knew because the word had said so that when he went went down corruption would never touch that body and he would resurrect in power and and so you and I are the same way today if if we have went through the same process that he went because when we die out to ourselves when we raise we raise in newness of life in the power of Jesus Christ but the problem is is people don't see that people don't believe that but let me tell you some brothers and sisters that's more real than the seat you're sitting home that's more real than the air you breathe amen amen see Jesus this is from the M the Easter cell he says he said Jesus said go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature how far all the world who to Every Creature he said they've never received it yet and these signs shall follow them that believe how long all the world who to Every Creature these signs shall follow them in all the world and in every creature and then he continues on dropping down just skip that to the next one where he says Paul is ordaining these 30 years later in Galatians 1: 18 y if an angel from heaven preaches to you any other gospel than this which is already received see already been preached let him be accursed he said I believe that Pentecost began without ending I believe it's to be every creature all times at all places that Pentecost should always remain the Pentecostal blessings should be upon the people then he says now what is this Pentecostal blessing he said it's the confirmation of the Resurrection he says no wonder the gospel itself means good news good news of what he has raised from the dead and because I live ye shall live also so we ye shall which ye which were once dead and sin trespasses God has quickened Us Together by that spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead and we are now sitting in Heavenly places with him communing with him talking with him what a joy to tell the people that story that believes it to be the truth and he says I'm wondering today justess got a little bit more he said but I'm wondering today it's what's happening are we really getting the people to God are we just getting them to church we must get them to Christ where this quickening power he said it's good to go to church but he said that's not far enough but to go on to Christ from the church because we must receive this quickening power if we ever expect to be in that General Resurrection because it's the only thing that will ever bring us from the dead for if the spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll also Quicken make bring you to life your mortal bodies what a promise to tell amen what a promise to us he said the very essence of this Resurrection is to tell and to show and to prove that Jesus has raised up from the dead he's not dead he's a living he's he's he lives here he's in US it'll be with you even in you a little while and the world seeth me no more yet ye shall see me for I will be with you even in you until the end of the world now as Christians we all claim he is alive or we have been quickened from quickened from life from Death To Life by his spirit and if we haven't been quickened then we've not been made alive that's right so that's what so God has come and he has he has quickened the word he's made us alive so when he said when he said this thing what is what is us to do is to Proclaim that he is alive he's risen from the dead because the things that he done that we shall do also to Proclaim exactly what he done it's and we're here today to do the exact same thing amen that's right because we are we are the body of Christ if we're the body of Christ then the things that the head done then the body will do also that's right and he said greater you do the same works but he said you do the but greater than these shall you do more than this shall you do but many times the devil wants to wants to Cloud our minds he wants to Cloud our vision and not well I don't know you know I don't know if that's for me if that's for somebody else you know it's it's okay if brother Bob does that but you know the thing is it's but you lay hands on the sick right you cast out Devils you know well we're just going we'll just wait till Sunday and we'll we'll call brother way no you cast out Devils because you know what you because if if the devil is bothering you then you know what we can come and lay hands on you we can anoint you with allil but you know what unless you speak the word the devil is not going to leave you're the one that's got to speak to him and tell him he's got no hold on you because you're God's Property and you're laying a claim on the word of God for him to leave and if you don't do that don't expect nothing to take place it takes you you've got to speak the word right if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt he didn't say he didn't say for anybody else he said you do it amen even though even the weakest Christian yeah if you're in the body of Christ then you have you have that position because you have that that Authority you have that claim on the word to do that amen then it doesn't matter how weak how because what he say the weakest Christian when the weakest Christian gets down on their knees he said the Gates of Hell Shake why because the whole Foundation is shaking because you begin to pray and seek God and we like well you know that's that's good but sometimes we don't actually just sit down and meditate on that and realize that you know what you are more than a match through through Jesus Christ who's given you the power you're more than a match for the dev by ourselves we're not but through him through him has loved us and has equipped us that we're more than a match but you know we don't have to we don't have to pray and and worry and fret take God at his word amen believe what he said believe what he said about you but if we can just put our our faith in what he said amen that's right this is from the the message the faith that was once delivered to the Saints and let's see here he was talking about the woman at the whale and he says many times here when he was on Earth and before going away he said these things that I do shall ye do also you do also even more than this shall ye do for I go to my father go ye into all the world the last commission the Great Commission to every Minister go into all the world and preach the gospel what is the gospel you say it's the word not only excuse me Paul said the gospel came not through the word only but through the power and the manifestation of the word by the Holy Ghost AM to teach the words like reading a newspaper but he says but we want to see someone Anointed with the the Holy Spirit here brother R was speaking and and here we was talking about the um the Methodist Bishop there in India and you know because brother Brown said one time they told him said listen we can quote and understand the the just the letter of the word he said we understand because this is a um an Eastern book and he said we understand this better than you do he said he said when it comes to understanding what's written in the on the page we can understand that we read that we know all that we we can give great great dissertations on that but he said he said but what we want to see because they had been so wrapped up and seen just just the mundane and all these things but what they were Desiring was to see it come alive and he said he said that's the reason he said we want to see someone when he's telling brother R we want to see somebody Anointed with the Holy Ghost that can make it live again why because they read in the scripture what took place back then well if he's the same yesterday today and forever then we're Desiring somebody to show us that he's still alive today not just not just some historical God where we read about what took place years ago but no we want to see what him to live today he said that's it he said we want somebody who can produce what the Bible says it will do see otherwise we want to see the faith that was once delivered to the Saints there you are amen he wants so we that's what God has called us to do is to demonstrate the gospel because the world is looking for somebody to make these things alive to make these things real to make these things known not just not just talk about it why because there's many people that that have heard the word and and they but but you know they get so wrapped up on things and you know they they don't even believe what what they've read but you know what it takes it takes a a a move of the Holy Ghost to show these things and make them come alive you know it's so it's so amazing because you know when when it becomes alive to you by the Holy Ghost when the when it becomes Quicken to you you know you don't have to have an answer why because that is the answer because when it becomes real to you it doesn't matter what anybody else comes and tries to take you away from that and tries to bring every kind of evidence contrary to the word if the word is been Quicken to you if it becomes real because it becomes a part of you then you know what you won't you won't walk away from that because there's nothing going to sway you away from that because you don't need you don't need an answer why because he is the answer because when it becomes real to you that's what that will hold you amen that's right right you know I was listening to brother Matt Watkins the other day and he was he was preaching and and he was was talking about uh there was there was these men that were Bible scholars and and they had the one man said he said I've always had problems trying to read the scripture where it talked about uh Sodom and Gomorrah you know trying to understand that and and you know when when you begin to look at those things you know when when you see the the life that lot lived and you know here here lot was looking at God speaking to Abraham leading Abraham in in the way that he should go and you know then lot was standing right there right behind him watching to see all these things and yet he gets so wrapped up because because here is here's a man that's trying to follow God and you know he's trying to stay away from the things of the world because God's not leading him that way but you know what lot just got just close enough to Ju Just to be a carnal believer but he couldn't see what God was doing because God was trying to lead him and you know he just got close enough he just got religious enough but the problem was the pull of Sodom was too much for him because he could see how wonderful things looked at Sodom and he all of a sudden he went down to Sodom because you know he was because the pull of Sodom was too great for him but you know what the people of God the children of God Abraham when he was being led J you're what God brought him away from those things even when he failed even when he walked the wrong way then you know what God was there to put him back on the right track to lead him the right way but here's here's lot going into Sodom because not only does he look towards Sodom but the next thing you know because he saw the well-watered plains but the next thing you know he's wrapped up in the middle of it and brother Matthew was talking about you know you know they can't see you know when when they when they looked they were trying to the archaeologists have tried to find where I don't know if any of y'all have heard this but you know the archaeologists were trying to find exactly where Sodom and Gomorrah were and um people have they've tried to do the digs and all that tried to find where they're at and uh you know these men that were Bible scholars you know here they are and it's like well you know I just have a hard time believing what took place in Sodom you know and all these things and it's like well you know that was you know was that just a fairy tale that was just something that was written in the scripture or was it really real well all of a sudden the these men they got in touch with these archaeologists that were doing these these digs and they were finding these things and this man actually had read the scripture and I guess he was um a Christian and he was archaeologist but he began to dig and you know everybody else had their own ideas where where it was but he began to read the scripture and began to look and said no I think Sodom and Gomorrah is in a different location than everybody else thinks and so he started to dig where he thought that it might be well when he started to dig down they started finding all of the the artifacts in the ground and as they were digging them up he come across pottery that was in the ground and he looked at it and he said we've got a problem he said we got Pottery in the ground that's glazed and he's like this kind of glazing didn't come to the like the Ottoman Empire it's many years in the future we so it's like this can't be it so they they were looking they began to dig they see more things but he said they took this Pottery they sent it off to a lab and had them look it up and he said analyze this and tell me what you find so they looked at it and they said well it's called Uh the glazing on there is not like an average glazing what you would think but he's called it they I believe they called it trinitite trinitite is a heavy is a great heat that's been applied to this this pottery that he said trinitite is actually when sand turns to glass in a nuclear explosion and he said that's what was on those pots and he said they to dig and find human remains and he said they found them from the waist from the waist down and he said the waist up he said a lot of them were just completely disintegrated and they and all of the things they began to look at all the different things that they saw in this dig well when they began to talk about it the U archaeologists didn't want to explain it outright they just said well uh Sodom and Gomorrah was was destroyed by a heat event but they didn't want to explain what they meant by that and so they went on so they started when they when they had finished their course and had turned the cameras off they come in and they began to explain what took place they said it would had to have been a nuclear explosion for that kind of Destruction to take place and then when when they began to see that then all of a sudden here these men that had spent their lifetime one had spent his lifetime trying trying to understand these things by digging and this other man had actually spent his lifetime in a class reading the Bible had went to church all of his life had spent years all of his life trying to trying to read the scripture trying to gain understanding and and couldn't grasp that it just takes simple childlike Faith because God said he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah he destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah but you know all of a sudden then it's like we're going that changed my whole attitude that changed my whole way of life that came my whole thought because all of a sudden somebody brought me proof that God destroyed Sodom and gomorra am because what took place was not just not just some kind of natural occurrence but there was something that Supernatural had to take place there because when you see the damage the destruction that took place there then all of a sudden they're said well you know I believe that well you know how terrible it is that somebody's got to have got to have proof that it that that something took place when when it just takes childlike Faith whe whether I see it or not you know I believe it because God said so I don't have to I don't have to hold Pottery I don't have to go to the Holy Land although it would be great I don't have to walk the shores of Galilee why because I was in him when he walked the shores of Galilee but you know what he's here today and he's the same as he was back then he's the same yesterday today and forever I don't need the whole Pottery of relics anything like that all I need is the same life that was in him inside of me brother yeah when nobody nobody believed him when he walked when he walked out there nobody understood him they didn't understand those things but you know what as as Peter said when they were standing there and asking him those things about the scripture and he want are you want to go also and he said Lord to whom shall we go amen thou alone has the words of eternal life amen thou he didn't understand it so this is from we would see Jesus brother says he said he said what we lack today if if when Christ gave them commission to go to all the world not to make churches or to build buildings or to make schools which are all right but he said preach the gospel and the gospel is not building buildings or sending people to school but it's the power and demonstration of the Holy Ghost then he said these signs shall follow them that believe amen he said but the Bible Still Remains that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday day and forever am then if he is the same he has to be the same in principle and power he has to be the same as he was only one difference a Corporal body but before he left the Earth he said I am the vine ye are the branches now the vine does not bear fruit the branch bears fruit not the vine so he left in charge of his church this Great Commission to Bear the same fruit that he bore when he was on the earth that's right so we are given that commission but if we also given the commission then we're also given the power then we all they're also equipped to do the same thing amen then we have that then we have what we need to do those things then all you have to do is draw from that because if you if you have received it then it is just as as real to you and to me as it was to him that's right because if if we are if we are Heirs of God and Joint HS with Christ then the same thing that he had we have amen then it's the same that he to him see and said continue on here he said when he was speaking to the to the Greek when he said so we would see Jesus he's not so much as we would hear him but we would would just love to see him I just wonder if that wouldn't be the same feeling not to every person here to see Jes Jesus then how could we see him in his church in his people he said we are written Epistles the spirit of Christ lives in his people and produces his life and his ministry continues to go until he comes again and here he is it's the blindness of our eyes the reason we don't see him if we could just open our eyes to things that are real if we can just open our eyes to the things that are around us and brother B continues on here and he tells the story about the about the little boy want to know he said Can can anybody see God can anybody find God and you know everybody's like well you go ask the preacher and different ones but you know the preacher well you know you can't really see God but you know he got so discouraged but you know he found an old man that old fisherman down by the by the river and you know he asked him he said Can anyone see God after all the things that he had looked for in his life because you know he sat on a church pew and he heard so much in his life but you know he desired to see God he be he desire a little boy desire to see the Living God a living demonstration of God and then when when he was there and he was out there in the boat with that old fisherman and he began to weep and he told you he hugged that little boy and said God bless your heart he said he said that's all I've seen for the last 40 years and everything that I see is I see him everything in my life is him everything that I look at I can see him and everything yes can you see God yes he's in all he's in every aspect of your life if you'll just look for him you'll see him he's there but many times as he said we were so blind to the things that are around us we miss the things of God we miss the things that God has trying to reach out to us amen see here this is continuing on just scroll them and brother here brother still here in in the message we would see Jesus and you know he he's speaking of of the of the little the the lady that brings her her son into the Five and Dime Store and you know she's rattling everything in front of him trying to get his attention and you know what he's just stoned death and stoned blind you know he's just so fixated because he's said you know she said well the doctor says he's better but he's not and he doesn't change he's in the same kind of condition that he was before and he said see and I just wonder in this day that we live now if God isn't taking his child from place to place and manifesting different gifts and so forth before them that they still set num brained wow just so dead in s and trespasses until they can't see the glory and the gift of the Lord that he's trying to present before them may that be far from this great church tonight that's gathered here as God reveals himself may we be Earnest and sincere to see that it is Christ trying to make himself known to this church for the Salvation of souls for the healing of bodies and for every Redemptive bless that he died for all belongs to his church and to every believer so you know many times in our lives because that's what the devil wants us to do but sometimes we God brings things in front of us and he tries to get our attention to tell us who we are but sometimes we're just like that we get so numb bring to the things why because the devil is right there in front of you he's hounding you he's right there to hinder you and then God's trying to reach out and show you who you are and when and so when when these things happen see we're so Bound by these things amen and God's trying to tell us listen there's a greater there's a greater thing than what you have today just go on a little further let's not stop Lord help us not be numing see if we just get Bound by these things because that's what the devil wants us to do get so wrapped up in things that we don't see God in it amen this is from the message here ye himm he says I want to approach this tonight from a different standpoint and now Jesus meets with men in great Circles of many one time with 500 Brethren once with 70 with 12 with three with even with one he said that's what makes him so Divine that what makes him the infinite God to me is because he does things in such a simple way that our little finite mind cannot comprehend it he said his ways are Beyond ours they're past our understanding and to think that he would come down from heaven to visit one poor Lost Sinner is more than I can understand how did he ever come down to take on the form of sinful flesh to die to save Sinners why was he so interested in our healing that he was that he was striped and wounded by the Roman lash and through his stripes and suffering that we who suffer might be delivered it's more than the little finite mind can catch he said and to think that he would bring himself down he would walk to an individual would save an individual that would heal his enemy who was against him who had done everything against him and blasphemed his name and yet he was willing to come down and make this atonement and make that so that we could receive it then there's there's one thing that start then there's one thing that startled my thinking is how could a mortal being ever turn down and reject such Divine love when you know that your eternity bound when you've got to spend that time somewhere when all preparations has been made for your good pleasure and your eternal life and then to cast it aside for just a little pleasure of this Mortal life then you would complain about Esau selling his Birthright he said we are Way Beyond Esau in the way we sell our heritage for less than what Esau got and how when when you begin to take in the the account of what God done for us when he came when he left everything behind when the Splendor of heaven and all that when he left all of that behind to come down to take on our our position our F this not sin because he was not sinful but he took on the the likeness of sinful flesh just like we were in and he came down to to live this journey but he but he lived this journey to show us that we can overcome because he overcame it and when he came down that he took those stripes on his back so that we that would he would have our healing because it was already paid for before you ever got sick before you ever born or ever come into the world your feeling was already because before because he was stood as a lamb slain before the foundation of the world so before any of this was taking place the way was already made the price was already paid but you know when he came down and to finish these things to show us what he had done then how can somebody when you begin to to see what God has done for you to turn him down how can how can you just become so numb to this it's so it's so hard amen but praise God you know that's what God wants us to do by the preaching right Amen to catch our attention listen wake up realize who you are that's right amen take these things see when you when you see what God has done for you then when this is what God is trying to give you then this then it's and it's before you then you you don't have to ask because it's already given to you it's already yours see when you when you see these things when you when you see what God has given you that it belongs to you yes brother R said he said he said you know God don't want want a favor from you he because he said he is trying to give you eternal life when he's trying to do these things for you then it's already for you and said but see then that's what we have to do we have to understand that that's what God has given to us and he says he says no matter how low you are he said how little you are how Immortal you are how indecent you are how far out of society you've been ousted yet the son of the Living God loves you am and knocks at your door day after day and night and you just turn him down that's terrible he doesn't even sound sane to do such a thing to turn down the Son of God who's coming not to take something from from you but to save you from destruction when then is turned down he said what a pitiful sight it doesn't seem mental mentally right to turn him down right it isn't mentally right to turn him down it's a loss of mind to turn down the Son of God when he knocks at your heart's door yet he's turned down and will return back amen yeah why because he comes so many times and knocks at the door and keeps bringing the same thing and and showing you hey there's a way out we've got the remedy we've got everything that you have need of and you we go right back and we'll we'll stay in the same condition and miss out what God has done yep right when God is trying to speak to him and speak to him but you know just like just like the the disciples there you know when the disciples heard the word you know there was so many just like those 70 and you know all the different ones the multitudes heard Jesus when when when he was feeding them the the fish and the Loaves and all those things you know he had a whole crowd people he couldn't get rid of them you know they was they just hung to him but when he began to bring the word when he began to show them hey this is where you are and this is where you ought to be when he began to identify who he was and show them the way that because the scripture says he said he came to his own and his own received him not that's right but you know when he came to them when he began to make it known to them to show them who they were then all of a sudden who in the world can handle these things right when he be when he began to tell them he said unless you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life but he was trying to show them there is the way that because a w was promised in the Old Testament he was the Fulfillment of it that you can have the same life but they missed that and here he is when when the disciples were standing there you know they didn't understand what he was talking about but there was something that was ringing true to them that they couldn't get away from there was something that they were hanging on to and Jesus asked them said so will you all leave also he said Lord to whom shall we go he said you have the words of eternal life there was something that rang true to them they didn't understand it they didn't have to understand it amen but he understood them one thing if they could just believe it amen why because they had read in the scripture Peter and growing up understanding what the scriptures said and it wasn't going to be the same way that you know that the the priest said it was going to be the rabbis the Sadducees how they thought you know he's coming this way and you know he's going to come speak to us and he's going to have great robes and and great words he spoke like he spoke like everybody else and had a you know Jesus had a bad name nobody wanted to spend any time with him they thought he was devil possessed all the things and yet he was the Fulfillment of the word amen they couldn't they couldn't believe that but see they had to understand what God was trying to do for them yes and it's a same way with you and I see we just put our faith in him hanging on to these things that that he said just hang on to those things that you've heard that's right when he began and he said how can how can you expect God he said how can you expect God to do anything for you he said when you turn down the very Prince of Life when you've heard these things and you see them just like them when they when they saw those things and they heard Jesus speaking and tell them what was what was in the scripture and he began to tell them that I'm identified in the scripture I'm identifying you in the scripture because when they when they began to walk away when they began to doubt what he said did he not take them back to the Old Testament and tell them your father's done the same thing and you'll do the same thing when he told this when he told the Pharisees he said you're of your father the devil and you do the same thing you're going to turn you you killed all the prophets and you buried them up there and you polish their tombs but you'll still turn the word down because they done it true he said the same thing see they trying to hang on to their old traditions and and all those things that that that they had always held on to but see they were trying to show them a new way something that something that was real something that not just some tradition why because it just became old and and rotten and stinking you know brother BR was talking about you know just just like you know you hang on to these old things that just just like a a a old egg that's in a in a nest and brother R was talking about he said you know you see these birds and he said he said if if if the the uh the you know the hen or whatever the if the woman Bird female bird had not been with the male said you know she can sit on all the eggs and she can just be so faithful to sitting on those eggs and she can stay there till she gets so poor she can't get up off the eggs but you know the problem is is he said if she's not been with the male if she's if those are not fertilized eggs she can lay there and she can die and you know what those eggs will run away right amen there is nothing that's going to come out of that so until you come to the right place and get get it fertilized until it becomes real until you become receive the word and it becomes quick until you then it won't do you any good and know brother R says you know he said just like talking about Divine Healing and all those things he said if you got to those things and don't see that he said it's just like those old rot eggs and he said you need to kick them out of the nest you need to clean it all up fumigate it sanitize it get rid of all of it and start over until you get rid of all that why because if you've got your own idea and it's not bringing forth anything then it's time to be get rid of it just just get rid of it because it's not going to do you any good he said so if you've got to that point and it hasn't changed anything and you're trying to hang on and it hasn't changed it hasn't produced anything he said now it's time for us to get in the altar we ought to come to the Altar and pray until something comes and takes place until we pray ourselves through then we ought to be right here see he says he said you know you see you understand it because you know every one of us has received this invitation amen just everybody has received well because the word has went forth and so you have received this invitation to receive it amen we see every one of them that received it then they were then something took place yes but you know just like the Rich Young Ruler you know when he came you know when he stood there and he took the what was what was given to him when he be you know he understood I need something from God and and you know he said he coming and you know he asked the Lord what do I what must I do to inherit eternal life because he realized you know I need eternal life and Jesus told him exactly what he needed and he began to speak to them see he began to speak to all of them and understand but just like the the Rich Young Ruler and the Pharisees and the Sadducees and so many of them they couldn't humble themselves to the word that's it they couldn't humble themselves because they got to the place where they they this this is this is where I'm at right and they didn't want to give up what they had oh no right they were hanging on to something and he said you'll not go any further until you humble yourself and lay all that aside right see that comes a time and so we see that the condition that the world is in today see as as it was back then brother R was talking about what took place back then this is from the uniting uh the uniting time and sign he said we see this uniting time coming he said and the church has United itself against the message and then when it does that the nations are uniting themselves in communism to destroy the church again just like it did in the first place he said Israel had to turn down the message first and when they turned down the message then the military the National Life United itself together of other nations and come in and destroy the church and today they have done turned down the message of the Lord Jesus and they've turned it down and now the time has come to where communism is uniting the world together against the church see it has to be that way amen he said now it's hard to say that but just like they done the word came to them the message went forth to them their message for their day what they were looking for came and it was manifest in flesh it stood before them and the Fulfillment of the word and because they turned it down they had to turn the message they had to turn the word down and when they turned it down then the Judgment came right because the Judgment was waiting them but you know what God showed them Grace to bring them to the truth but he turned because but he said as he said you know as but he came to his own and his own received him not but as many as has received them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believed on his name which were born not of blood nor the will of Flesh nor of the will of man but of God and he said and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth see because they were under they were under the message of Grace but in the wings was was the message of Destruction because that's what when they turned it down and because brother R talking about back then they had the Fulfillment of the word they had the fullness of the word and what has come in our day what where we living at today we're living in the day of the fullness of the word this is the Fulfillment of the word because Christ is made flesh again in our day we have just exactly the same thing that they have because now today we see because what took place back then they turned the word down and now there's nothing but but destruction there is nothing but judgment but praise God there's a group of people that have received the blessings the grace of God theyve received that word and you know what they will be out of here there is a judgment before the Judgment Falls see we see the world and the condition that it's in because how everything is all falling apart why because when you turn the word down then you will take everything that is contrary to the word and you will embrace it and you will preach it and and manifest it as truth and you're going to uh persecute and go against everybody that is standing for the truth amen right and because you see the condition that the world is in today and you know everything that that is right and proper when you see people you know they don't even have common decency for people anymore no that's right brother you know it's so amazing when you see these people and you know they you know they call them you know on on the internet and everything you see them and everybody talks about carens you know these people you know because you know all all their job is is to get in everybody's business it has nothing to do with them but you know what they will get so worked up that they'll actually get in a fight with somebody over something that they have no idea what they're doing right but because but they think they think that they're the law that the world revolves around them that you know they're the answer to the problem and they don't even know the problem but they will go out there and tell tell people that you've got to live a certain way you got to do a certain thing and they don't understand what's going on and argue and cuss and fuss and not even realize what's going on brother there was a video this lady this man walks up to this lady and tries to talk to her he just walked up to her car and then she's like you get away from me I'm calling the cops and she's standing there yelling at him the whole time and he's just like listen listen I'm just trying to tell you your purse is on top of your car that's all that's all I'm trying to tell you and then she reaches up and grabs her purse pulls it back in the car and says mind your own business and speeds off you know it's like you know and and the and the worst the worst problem is you you see all these people out there and you know it's like how handicapped are you I say you got a handicapped sticker we got to figure out who's handicapped and we and everybody's one this person's more handicapped than that person and you know and then then we then we live in a world where everybody's a victim you wake up in the morning every everybody's against me I have all these problems and then I'm GNA tell you I've got more problems than you God makes me a bigger victim than you so you know what you're supposed to cater to me right and the biggest problem is is they become a victim of the devil because he's got between their ears and that's the biggest problem and so you see these people the condition that they're in and yet they will get to the point where they'll actually fight people and it's like you you see these people and I mean you go to you go these places people got have gotten shot right and you see all these things take place what is it well you know they didn't treat me like I was supposed to and you see these people you know they they go to these stores and it's like well you know what they make too much money and they just all go in as a crowd and just steal everything that they got and walk out the door well you know I'm not paying for it and you see that you see the condition that the world is in and now everybody's like well you know what you don't have to work for anything you don't have to learn anything because you know what you just got to be a big enough victim and make and Proclaim that you're a victim long enough so somebody will cater to you and give everything you have yeah and you see this condition that people are in and not realizing see when when it just comes into utter chaos and and that's and that's the world that we live in yes and the problem and the problem is is when you go to talk to people and you try to tell people listen this world is not going to stand all of this this this stuff that you see every single day this is this is utter chaos this is Hell on Earth this this world will not stand when you see these people when it becomes more depraved every single day and all of a sudden you realize that these people have lost their minds and you know what they've got their hands on nuclear weapons y and all of a sudden well what's holding them off what's holding all this off what's holding off the Judgment come on there's only one thing that's holding off the judgment and that's the body of Christ the bride of Christ is here because the blood is still here because she's still here but there's one day that she's leaving the blood will be gone and all of a sudden then the judgment will fall see we see these things so we see who we are this is from the message of spoken words The Original Seed brother R says Christ couldn't help being who he was he was the son of God that's it see what I mean now see if you were intended you see the word of God you believe it because why there's something new see why he said have you ever heard of a strain in a family a son will kind of impersonate his father mother grandfather grandmother he said well that's the same thing from predestination you were supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way you did you're subject to the fall but being that you're predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back where you were predestinated amen he said never saw that before brings you right what makes you believe the word of God and turn down these other things it's because you were there is something in you way back Yonder you're supposed what you made to live here forever amen so you had these things that's what it was because you were predestinated by God's for knowledge to come to these things why because you were predestined because he knew that you were coming that you would be here and the word of God would come your way and reach out and touch you and reach your path and that you would understand these things that you would receive it and there's many people out there that we won't receive it amen but praise God we were put here for one thing to receive this word but we're also put here to manifest the word why because there's still The Lost and the dying out there that have not heard the word but you know what we are also to be the ones to show the world the truth of the Gospel why because they've turned it down and they will not receive it but you know what there's still a witness God will always have a witness to the truth of the word in this world absolutely believe that so how many how many times have we had people that you know they they come along and you know they they try to tear down everything that the word says and you all the things that that has taken place but you know God has always had a witness amen God always has a witness to show the things when we see people trying to tear down the message and try to discredit everything and yet you know turns around there's people that come right on the scene and and are able to show the things that were there as the truth amen yes sir and they're like well you know nobody saw these things nobody never nobody saw the bridge nobody saw all these things and you know all of a sudden this this man you know some of y'all have seen the the video of the man that was the the lawyer you know his dad was mayor there and knew brother brandom he said as a child my dad told me he said he said uh brother Bill is Clairvoyant he said God shows him things that's how he explained it but well nobody knows about the bridge and that man was standing right there and he said my aunts and different people in my family knew that the bridge collapsed and knew those men died on the bridge and this man's not a message believer y but here's a man that grew up that had that knew brother br knew it his dad he said he said you know he talking about him and brother brandham would come to their house and you know he said brother Bram would sit and drink Coke or whatever and watch TV with his dad and talk and so these things and everybody's like well there's nobody all this stuff is made up and everything like that well you know what there's one witness well it took that one witness right there that man and you know what that man's testimony will judge them a judgment day it will be there to to face them that day that they had one believe that and so when when they say well these things didn't take place yeah there was there was one that was there to be a witness I think about brother Billy Paul when when he he tells the testimony years ago and he was talking about I believe it was a man was a was a dentist or whatever and he he went to him and the man asked him said he said Bill Billy uh he said have I ever done anything to you like no except what you're getting ready to do to me right now but you know he brought he brought a message book out and he put that in front of brother Billy Paul and he said why didn't you tell me about him Billy Paul not talking about his dad yeah and there was there was people that that found out from other people who who the what about the message who he was and he's like you never told me about your dad you never explained these things well how much more if the world's out there dying and you say you've not explained to me about your father not not not brother brandom no you know but your heavenly father if we're born again then the world wants to know who is your father why haven't you shared that with me come on you know many times you try to share people things with people and you know it don't even it don't even go it just goes right out your mouth and falls on the floor yeah right it doesn't go anywhere right brother but you know you never know you just share the gospel with people amen you never know what's going to take place cuzz it's not it's it's not our job to see it come to pass come to fruition our job is to sew the seed right that's right see if we understand these things and we take the things that that were given to us and know this is from the message the Investments and brother's talking about the Rich Young Ruler here as I was quoting earlier you know when he was talking about the the Rich Young Ruler see he knew what he was lacking and he said you know he never asked you know D he to join your church everything like that but he knew that he lacked eternal life and he said there's only one form of eternal life we strive for that and we was given that opportunity to receive it when he re when he when he asked because it's written asking you shall receive and it was presented to him and yet foolish enough to turn down because the price was too great he said you can't hold to the love of the world and to God at the same time for you cannot love God and Mammon which means the world and you if you love the world or the things of the world the love of God the love of the father isn't isn't in you see he had all of the things of the world that he wanted the great riches and all these things that he had and he had everything at his grasp all the things natural right but he had everything Supernatural everything spiritual in front of him and he had it right there in front of him and he turned it down he couldn't see the value in it because he he valued his riches too much the things that he held back that he held him back that's right he realized what he needed but it was too great of price and he said see he held on to those things brother R says you know he said I don't care if you own the whole world the whole world he said if you haven't accepted the leadership of the eternal life by the Holy Ghost how's it going to who are you anyhow he said you're a dead mortal dead in sin and trespasses righteous as you want to be as faithful as you want to be to the church preacher if you want to be in the pull pit but to turn down you die when you had everything in front of you eternal life laid before him and had everything that he had need of and he was so tied up in that eternal life everlasting life he said anything that's Eternal never did begin therefore it cannot end Eternal never begins and then the only way that you can be Eternal is to receive eternal life amen and there is only one thing Eternal and that's God not by joining church or Creeds or turning a new page on new years's or whatever it might be but it's receiving God the person of God in the form of the holy spirit in your life and you become part of God and just as Eternal as he is because you're a part of him everything has a beginning has an end but see when you when you pass that because God never had a beginning so he never has an end and when you become that he said and that word and that word in you produces the Life of Christ and it it could and if I could take the life out of a peach tree and put it in a pear it would bear peaches no more it would bear peaches no more it would bear pears on it because the life of the tree would produce it he said the life that's in you shows what you are your life testifies so loud in you until your testimony is not heard they know what they what you are by the life you live and the things that you do if the life of Christ is in you then therefore the works of the Life of Christ you live because that's his life living through you am you're just a vessel to carry on the work of God Amen so when we see these things see when you when you take these things the world's going to see who you are y isn't that isn't that wonderful that the life that that you live if you would just take the life everybody's well I you know I I wish I could be a Christian I could wish I could be a Christ I wish I could do these things I wish I could do these things well you know the problem is is you're trying to do it you can't do it the problem is is you've got to yield to him amen that's it see the tree doesn't bear fruit of itself the life brings the fruit a sheep doesn't doesn't bear wol because it sits out there thinking um going to bring bring forth wool going to bring forth you see I'm and he's out there what does he do he rests and relaxes he's in he's in a sheep out there what what is he doing he's in the hands of the shepherd but the life that's inside the Sheep is what bearss wool because he's a sheep that is that is the sign and what does he do he follows the shepherd and eats as brother Joe was talking about the other day you know when you know when in Psalm I believe Psalms 23 when he was talking about you know in the beside the Green Pastures he Le to be beside Green Pastures and he said when you stand there looking at the place that that David was standing talking about all the rocks that are there well you know that don't that don't look like what we would expect to be there right but you know what the shepherd knows what way to lead them and lead them to the place where they need to feed and then all of a sudden they when they know when the shepherd is taking care of them and lead them to the right place and eating the right things and you know what then all of a sudden they just start producing that well you don't have you it's the same way with you and I if we are the a child of God then you know what we don't have to worry about well you know I'm I'm going to try to do this I'm going to try to do no and you say well I've got this problem brother I've got this problem well let me tell you something the same one that brought if you're in justification the same one that brought you there because you know what you didn't get you don't justify yourself you don't get your placees you don't get yourself to justification because it's the goodness of God that leads you to repentance so when you when you repent it's the leading of the Lord to you to to come to that place sanctification takes the word but you know what it's the word of God that does that the Holy Spirit has to do that right because you know so many times how many we we've tried to do that ourselves we we TR we I I want to fix this problem and I want to fix that problem I want to give this up I want to do that you know the more times we do that we get frustrated we get overworked and everything like that and the devil just comes to and says you ain't nothing why don't you just give up y I would I I I would be I just quit doing I I you're such an embarrassment you know I would I would I wouldn't tell nobody I go church if I live like that well praise God you know what I'm just going to continue on yeah right well you know what God started God started me on this journey and you know what God brought me this far and you know what I just got to keep putting my hand just keeping it putting in God's hands and wait on him because you know he's the one that's gonna come because you know if you stay the course because he's going to show you the way to go but if you continue in the way if you continue in the path that he's called you and you continue to go that way and just keep holding on then you know what you're going to come to the place that one day you're going to realize that the things of the world have no more hold on you why because the word is coming into you and as you feed on the word now you can't now you can't feed on everything in in the world and and you know all the all the garbage and everything like that youve got to you got to deal just put all that to a to the side you've got to come to the place where the one thing that you're feeding on the one thing you desire is the word of God and put everything else to theide and do away with it and feed on the word and meditate on the word of God and see if it doesn't change who you are it doesn't change your appetite doesn't change your desire and quit trying because you know you try well I you know I I want to do this no I want to walk the way God want wants me to walk I want to walk the path he's called me to walk I want to live the way he wants me to live amen let's all stand we'll have the musicians come I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to do what God has called me to do amen I want to do these things because God is leading the way because many times people say as they as the old saying is is you know I I want you know I've been in the way a long time well that's what's hindering us lots of times is we're in the way we get in God's way but if we can just commit ourselves to the Lord and say Lord I you know I every and every step of the way amen the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's the same way you you yield yourselves to him amen and see if he doesn't do the work amen and everything else that as you go up the statue of a perfect what is it it's more yielding of yourself right and just continue I'm I'm just going to yield myself because you know the Devil he's going to fight you all the way but you know what every time there's a victory yeah and you say what about that devil he brought he brought me this far y right look at the things I've overcome but you know I didn't overcome them it was him through me I overcame and I overcome this well then what's the next B you know I overcome well you know it was you know Abraham held on to a promise God gave him a promise of what was going to take place that they was going he was going to bring forth a son well you know what he got older and weaker and more feeble true but you know he continued to hold on and he had faults and failures and problems but you know what the word didn't change the promise didn't change and you know even when he got off course and went the wrong way you know what God put him right back on the right track he kept going thank you Lord and he kept going the right way and he kept going he kept going well guess what there was a day that he come by Revelation you know what he realized that it wasn't him but it was God who made the promise and you know he began to walk in that promise and there was a day that he woke up and you know he began to see that son I'm still getting older still getting more problems everything like that but you know he began to see the Sun and he walked into that and one day when he saw that he continued to walk and the next thing he had a body change right if you can see the son whom the son has set free is free indeed well if you've been set free then you know what you've been set free from everything because if you've been Justified he that he is Justified he's already glorified well if he started you you on this journey then you know what he's going to finish this journey because he's already brought you but you know you can see your by your vision by your faith you can see there's already a body change the body change is already here it's all but you walk into that you just continue to walk that's right no matter what anybody else does you continue to walk in that and that's the good news and that's our commission to share the good news to everybody sir what a Thanksgiving I was thinking about brother Brandon preaching the invisible Union understanding who the bride the senual of virtuous bride of Jesus Christ he said what kind of what kind of Thanksgiving message is that the greatest Thanksgiving message when you begin to see who you are what a Thanksgiving that is when you begin to see who you are where you've come from when you've come from from the the poor and you you come from all of the what he has brought you from your sin and trespasses and brought you into the Glorious Liberty of Jesus Christ what a wonderful thing well I'm I'm going quit cuz I might preach all night but God bless you let's sing a [Music] song Amen to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more I want to love yes love till there's just no more love for I could never ever out love the Lord I want to live the way he wants me to live I want to give until there's just no more to give I want to love yes love till there's just no more love for I could never ever out love the [Music] Lord the way he wants me to live I want to give until there just no more to give I want to love love till there just no more love I could never ever I love the Lord I Want To Live old football coach told me told us all one time he said son he said boys he said I don't care if you get beat 50 to nothing he said but if you give everything you got out there on that field when you walk in you're just you're you're you're just totally drained he said that's what I want and that's what God wants in this field of life that he just wants you to give your all give everything you got give it your best like U like brother um um who was it brother Daryl Ward went into that football stadium and there's a thing over the door and we got it over the door back there it don't say I give my all to Tennessee football but it says I Give My All to Jesus Christ that's right when you walk in this door give it all cuz you know what there was a man said one time he said God will only fill those who are not full of their self amen right and that's right so we got to empty out what we we get these messages from from brother Tim brother Aaron Brother Bob Brother Lou different ones that come and preach that's what they're trying to do they're trying to empty us out so that we can what hear from God cuz his brother Aaron said that's what the old guy said said how long youve been in the way he said I've been in the Blessed Way about 30 years and that guy said that's your problem you've been in the way for 30 years so we need to let God have his way so good to be back good to be back in the house of the Lord good uh thank you all this weekend for for pitching in and taking over and and keeping

than you do I got more money than you do no you're there to take them Jesus Christ am and listen every time Jesus Christ shows up there's a resurrection there's a healing there's salvation when he shows up so we're going to pray amen that you will make a miracle am and see a miracle and not be surprised when you do see it sometimes we get surprised we shouldn't be surprised anymore we should be you know we seeing we have a miracle working god well if he's a miracle working God who does you do the miracle to himself no he does it to us that's right every day of our life he gives us a miracle that's right so I want y'all to go see a miracle I want you to produce a miracle produce the life all of you every one of you just look look for God everywhere you go and we sure do appreciate all of

brother Martin's um he wanted brother Lis to interpret but he's going to be gone I'd love to yeah that's what he said I I said who's going to interpret for me he said brother Lise I said not from hondur he said not so take them all you take them to them I got we got a whole whole stack of them down here take them all pray for them yes we're going to pray we going yeah brother Bob um come let's pray over these um and we'll just take the whole I tell you what put them back in there we'll keep these and you can take all these but we'll cut up some more we got plenty more to cut up all right we're going to pray that they go and do accomplish whatever they going to go to do that you'll accomplish it you've never been before brother the Bob's been it'll be a surprise but it'll be a good surprise and we appreciate the Lord letting them go and the desire for them to go because you know what guys look these people are taking time off of work they could go on vacation somewhere else but they're taking their vacation time and their time away from from even from family well your family is going but you're taking away from family time to go and do this and and it's an honor I've been to Jamaica 11 times been to the Philippines twice so I know how it is about going and being away from your your natural family but it's the work of God am it's the work of God it's like brother Donnie Reagan said yesterday I was listening to him he said he said you know he said when a man takes the the the ministry that we have this the ministry we have that's a committal for Life MH you're a minister it doesn't matter if you never preach another sermon if you've been called to a Ministry and you're ministering that Ministry is there all the time right and you you you neglect family sometimes you neglect friends sometimes to do what we are commissioned to do and now the commission is is to go all into the world and preach the gospel is as Jesus told us and like what brother Dan daisley or no what brother Dan and brother green said if you can't go send somebody so we're going to send them and we're going to send them with the blessing of the Lord in these prayer clo we're going to we're going to see not just one Miracle we'll see Miracles out of this yes sir also brother way and I talked about this I know some of you you give money to to brother Louise to take with him I'll be here Sunday if anybody wants to give any other offerings cuz I know they're leaving Friday they're leaving this coming Friday here Sunday if anybody else wants to give and you're leaving the next I leave the next Friday the next Friday December 1st December 1st sure go ahead just real real quick um when we pray the first place where I'm going to be going to and there's a situation that I found out about down there in the in the church that I'm one of the churches that I'm going to go to that I just I didn't know anything about it's a very delicate situation regarding the pastor and uh and I just ask that that you all pray that the Lord would just give me wisdom as I minister in that place because I do not want to take any sides no and I do not want to but but I believe that talking about the miracle I believe that there's a miracle that can happen right there amen cuz I even talked to the pastor the other last week on the phone just letting him know listen I'm I'm I'm I'm going to be there but and he really really respected the fact that I called him to talk to him Wonder wonderful and he said I believe he he told me he said I believe the Lord is doing something already so um because there's been ministers have already gone through there without even talking to the pastor and and it's just it's been it's been a mess I could go with all details but I'm not going to but just remember me in prayer that the Lord will give me wisdom for that situation amen amen appreciate that amen all right so let's all agree let's bow our heads and we'll pray over these cloths if you'll lay your hands on them and wherever these go we've seen Miracles we've seen cancer leave we've seen people healed just by giving these prayer claws so it's not a Hocus Pocus it's it is according to the word of God Paul's not here but the god of Paul is here and the god of Paul is what healed those people not Paul's cloth right but it is a contact that we're going to send over there from this church and through our brothers we're going to send this contact and this contact wherever it goes and you hand that prayer cloth to somebody there's your connection that they know that you this is behind them 100% we're all behind them this ministry is behind them and and the god that we serve is behind it and this is just something it's a vehicle to to to build their faith that's what they did with Paul oh Paul he was an apostle he we saw Miracles yeah I'll take his cloth there and and I know God was with him well it wasn't Paul's anointing it was God's anointing through Paul so we're going to send this through the Spoken Word Church to our brothers here our ministers and we're going to see miracle I didn't know anything about that you never told me about that so I didn't know that there's one already starting there's a miracle in the making I think is what the song says amen so we're going to see it fulfilled when it gets there though so let's all bow our heads and believe dear heavenly father Lord Jesus in the name of the Lord Jesus Lord wherever these prayer clocks go Lord number one we pray Lord that that there's Mighty Works behind it father you told us Lord that even in the scripture that evil spirits left people when the clo of Paul was laid Lord You're the same God and Lord I pray Lord that you'd be with our Minister Brothers Lord Brother Lis brother Aaron Lord we put behind them Lord this whole church father that's going to pray Lord every day that they're gone Lord we just remind us Lord that we need to pray for them because they're not in their country lord they're in a different place Lord and protect Sister Christine Lord and the girls Lord and any other that goes Lord we pray that you just keep them Lord Lord don't let them get sick father you just put your Mighty hand upon them lordu just Lord let us go into your Pavilion Lord and and be Lord what we're supposed to be as brother Aaron said go into all the world you told us to do this Lord so now they're going to fulfill this commission and it will not return void it will accomplish we will hear of Miracles we'll hear manifestation we will hear of Rights being or wrongs being made right we'll hear of all these different things Lord through the ministry of Jesus Christ through as brother Tim was saying this weekend so wonderfully that you're now working through the bride yes it's m Jesus Christ that's doing the work you're doing it through but you told us Lord that it was going to be this way Lord now I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that you touch each one Lord that's going father brother Christian also and brother Michael Lord that you'll bless them Lord and may they when they come back they have such a testimony Lord till it'll take it'll take all service for them to tell what happened Lord I pray Lord and I I'm I'm looking for that father and I'm I'm looking for even from Louis and and brother Aaron maybe a text to say hey a miracle just happened father I pray that you'd be with them bless them Lord be with them financially be with them Lord there's wisdom as brother Lis Lord Lord wisdom to to help in that situation Lord I know you put people in positions Lord so I pray that you put that our brother Lou in a position now that he can help that he can be something that brings him together father and I pray Lord that we that there's not be a division Satan loves to divide but Lord you bring us together father under the word of God in that Pavilion and we send that now to where they're going father wherever they go Lord wherever their feet touch Lord may you bless what's going on father just be with them and touch them Lord one more time be with their bodies Lord we know is as many times being being in the Foreign Fields you get tired and weary yes you're in a different place you're in a different country you're eating different food you're drinking different water but Lord you said you'd protect us and we ask in the name of the Lord that nobody gets sick that their their youth would be renewed and re regenerated while they're there Lord and that they'll preach to the gospel like I've never preached it before father huj I pray Lord It's Beginning to be toward the end Lord when we not going to be able to get to these places where we're not going to be able to go because a squeeze is going to come and different things are going to happen Lord I pray that that impact will be as you said Paul did would go and and and raise somebody up in a community and give them the word of God and let that person preach to the community Hallelujah and raise the people up well I pray Lord that our brothers here and our sisters will be a conduit that will flow through them Lord and it will be you and it will be your word Lord that that takes those people and binds them together Lord under you father under that Pavilion of Grace that you've let these brothers take the time off give them the money to do that Lord I pray that you'll give them safe Comfort Lord Lord and know that there's a group of people that's praying for them every day that they're gone and we'll see them back lord rejuvenated and ready to give a testimony we ask these things in the name of the Lord Jesus amen amen hey how many I me how many people that that y'all prayed for that first time that that for babies and they had babies uh it was three couples three couples three couples four coupl four couples five couples couldn't have child couldn't have children that we've given them the give them prayer CLA absolutely and each one of them has had children they've got children so Hey listen God in all that of well bless them double blessing amen we love you with the love of the Lord Happy Thanksgiving be with your family if you can you got a church family but you also got a natural family so don't eat too much but eat all you can like brother Aaron said it should be a Thanksgiving every day but we do have a day set aside to be thankful that God did give us a country that we're free free enough that we can go to those other countries and take the gospel to them because as as people have always said what if brother Randon was to had to come from Africa right or come from uh Tanzania or or uh uh who was it said they're going to Tasmania oh brother Chris long I said that's a good place for you to go Tasmania anyway praise the Lord but U why he'd want to go but the Lord wants him to go there's bride there there's bride there that's right you been there no Australia oh yeah you have been to Australia that's right but there's bride everywhere and God's we're gleaning to the last last group of people and if it takes brother Louise to to help a brother it don't just help that brother it helps the whole church that's why Dad many years ago we built we built a lot of churches and we built some houses and we built some of this and we built some of that well then he said no we're not going to do that anymore we're going to give it to the brothers and let them take it like brother Vernon and somebody come to him and say I've got a a leading of the Lord Brother Danny to go to a certain place well then the funds that you produce for them that we send them every month brother Vernon gives them 400 or whatever the plane ticket is to get to where they're going well listen if one person in that Community is helped listen you can leave and come back but God stays there with that person that's the way Paul did Paul would take a group of people and he would raise them up the Ephesians that's why he went to Corinth why he went to Ephesus he had to go back to Corinth twice but still it doesn't matter all right so he sends people like that but I told him many times in especially in the Philippines I said we can spend our time for three weeks and I can go preach for 15 different churches it's just an American coming to preach and everybody glories and everybody's happy but why not bring the ministers in right and have a ministers meeting like we did in palow when about 55 ministers were there and we got to teach a little bit on the seals and even so much to where a brother got Revelation and he started preaching him himself just you know teaching the others in in their native language that's best because I'm going to leave brother Luis is coming back Sister Christine coming back brother they're coming back here you better that's right amen you better it ain't a one way ticket amen thank you okay I'm not okay but when they come back God's still there that's right that's why there's a door there's an entrance been made there's a door been open amen and this church has been a a very intrical part of of going to different places and and forwarding the gospel to the foreign countries and we sure do appreciate uh what the church has done here over the years uh we give a lot of money for a little church as we are and we sure appreciate brother Dale doing that cuz he had a mind of of giving anyway so we appreciate that so just remember them in prayer and just have a happy Thanksgiving and let's let's sing that song one more time I want to live the way he wants me to live and you'll just be dismissed be with your family be be careful be safe on the highway the way he wants
