house of the Lord if you'd like tur in your scriptures where turn where we've been reading in Ephesians now we'll read uh second Peter and revelations in a minute as we get on through into the message but we'll just read from uh Ephesians 1 right now so remember the this weekend now remember Saturday night 7 o'clock we will be having services and we'll be doing our fourth of July weekend that we started here 40 years ago and so God has been good to us and like I said if you think we've been 40 years around the mountain maybe we're fixing to leave it I hope so and and you know I believe it maybe we're going to quit this marching around you know and around and two tonight if anybody had a problem we're sorry that the internet system may not be working all right so that they can do the live streaming tonight and but uh you know they'll have it back on the other part of it but it's their problem it's not us it's something wrong with the the wiring systems of the internet system it's not us but maybe it'll work maybe it won't so we don't know they're trying to do everything they can to to get it to going so just remember that and also remember if you will now we want you to PR practice in the church you know your song and things like that but see when you come back you come in and you start practicing and you start fooling with the sound system all right you know it throws it off to where that nobody don't know what's going on because now you got to figure out where what's wrong with the sound system to where that you switch it over to what you think it ought to be you know and and it messes us up so we're just asking you we saying please practice don't misunderstand you get your little feelings hurt then sit down on them forget it but you know just if you're going to practice just ask uh Josh or Tyler say first if we not here ask Richard to come up and make sure that what you're doing with the sound system that goes back to the balance of what it is you know because if you come back there anybody I've come in here myself and even turned on the the sound system when we would start the services and you know and find out that somebody had changed the settings myself you know so I know a little bit about it but not much but I just know which one's got to be Which Way But Richard and Josh and Tyler they know which one to put where and everything to do so if you use it please just just ask one of them to make sure that everything's balanced and put back in order to where that you know cuz if you don't then you start singing a song and it's off right it sounds all right when you're in here with just maybe one and you're doing but then when everything starts back at the rest of the system then it's off and and you'll be up and down and and all kind of things so if you will just please ask and and do that we want you to practice but we want it to be where that we can't won't lose what we're we're doing to set up and have to spend half the time going back through to get it balanced up you know to where it'll be all right so if you would please do that just ask Tyler or ask Josh to help you and if they're not here ask Richard to to come up and and that way everything won't get messed up okay all right so just remember that so as I said Remember the 4th of July this weekend will be coming up I'm looking forward to it brother Keith Reed going to be with us to preach for us on on Saturday night and then Sunday morning and then we will be having a dinner together and it is Catered for you because we appreciate you because the 40 years has been with you uh and all and we we certainly appreciate it and we want you to be happy about it so that's we've decided to do it that way and you know ask the Lord to bless and just keep each one of us all right so let's go to our scripture Ephesians 1 and if there's anything else uh yes two we will be eating together but there will be no evening service CU we'll be eating together and just fellowshipping together and we'll have plent plenty of time and there won't be any communion foot washing or something we'll switch it on over maybe to the next weekend or whatever because we are moving the Bible study from the first Saturday to the second Saturday of this month of this coming month of July to where that we can get everything balanced up okay all right father we thank you and we love you and we ask you to just help each and every one of us and Lord just direct us all into what to say and Lord what we would try to say our own selves you control that to where that we would only bring what you want to be brought unto your people because we we we just depend upon you we ask you to help us and to guide us and give us understanding because you know that's our prayer constantly is Lord give us understanding of Thy word not just intellectual concept but understanding by revelation we love you and we thank you and we commit it all to you now in Jesus name amen Ephesians 1 verse three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto it the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he ha made us accepted in the Beloved amen you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing I hope you brought back your quotes from Sunday and everything cuz I didn't run any off and everything to get it uh you know for tonight because I knew we just continue the same point cuz I'm wanting you to see something that you know I believe the Bible proves you know the prophet didn't come to give us another book or anything like that he come to give us the understanding of the Bible that we already had we were the one that had ones that had it confused it it it it wasn't confused it didn't change you know that was what was so amazing that one day that I found out my Bible didn't say for me to baptize Father Son and Holy Ghost right you know I thought it did I mean I read it and we done it you know cuz we thought that's what it was but we come to find out that wasn't what it said right well then the prophet didn't come to to give us a new Bible he studied other translations and things and used them and that's fine you know to and I do too I use it to compare and and and to see what's you know the uh points and all of the of what the the maybe the commentators would say about it or or the different Bibles I I like to do that that's fine but I do it for the point of of understanding to help me to understand and see the truth right but now we've been talking about you know adoption and we've been talking about and got up to the stage of speaking now about uh Romans 8 and 23 where it says to Wi the Redemption of our body all right that is the adoption that we need right now uh I I've tried to make it plain as I could as much as I know but that's why I try to teach the adoption in three stages cuz the prophet said you bring everything in threes and things amen and and that way you can understand it better but I tried to bring the adoption to that point to where that you know when you're born again we were we were just totally annihilated from the promises of God we were we're not not in no form to be able to claim inheritance of any form right and you know Gentiles and and it would have mattered if you were a literal Jew uh you still can't claim anything on that basis but see then we had to be adopted into the family of God by the new birth amen now that's what I believe that that would take place because what Paul said in Romans 8 about 15 that we receive the spirit of adoption right amen that's why he called it like that and brother random I know what he would bring it to and and talk about the adoption as being the uh the checkbook and the hear you himym and the the things of that order of the re of the Matthew 17 I know that I know he also taught that we've got to be born again you know and and by doing that God had to bring us into his family right by the new birth right all right well why can't we just say that he adopted us into the family because that's what he did and giving us all rights and reserving everything and then we studied for quite a while about the uh the fact of talking about the uh the you know Matthew 17 to where it would come down to the checkbook and your name just as good on the checkbook you know as your father Etc but then we started the past few Services talking about the where Paul get down and he he doesn't say that this is the Redemption of the body see that's where our our troubles has been we've tried to implant into things that's not there it's talking about to wit and the word to wit is to understand or to be witty smart you know intelligent but see when you even put it to the intelligence form and you go back to Webster it draws it right back down to to the word to wit or wit meaning that you know a witty person is a person who has knowledge right amen I mean that's the sensible understanding that it has knowledge and see Paul then is not talking about the literal change he's talking about a group of people that when the head and body unites in the body of Christ and that's the way I tried to bring it that when it comes to the second stage of the amount of transfiguration that Jesus said and you know came to yeah then he went forth and bringing the message of eternal life right through the opening of the seals and everything and that was the way we compared it exactly with the way brother brandom went right right through you know with him and his coming and his restoring the faith of the fathers and then 30 something years to do that then his message comes and and we' give you all of these quotes to give you better understanding to let you see what he said right uh but we see then it's coming down to understand the Redemption of the body that's right cuz we can't get the the the body changed until we understand how it's to be change right that that shouldn't be a problem with anyone everybody said brother Dale's an intellect I think I'm a dummy but it's all right I prove it most of the time but see it it's coming to a place of understanding that's right amen now that's what we need you say oh we need to change of the body we we need to understand what transpires not the uh chemical uh part that it starts here and it works here and goes there and this turns and that turns and we start with A Little Bit Of in in eternity in the middle of the Bailey and we work our way out I'm not talking about junk I'm talking about that we need to understand the Plan of Redemption right well I understand the plan justification sa baptism all ghost well why is a lot of the people still looking for yeah a new body to come body that's right amen and they're doing it in this message they still believe that they're going to get a new body that's right you see and and and all like that and this this world is going to be destroyed yeah well the Bible says it yeah and the prophet said that we didn't understand what the Bible said so we used those the other day now let's just turn there in Peter and use these These are the scriptures that brother randam used and the main point I'm want you to get tonight is one thing I believe in a Redemption of the body right all right yeah I believe this body will be redeemed right amen all right I believe this world that we're standing on will one day be redeemed and then the future home and that's why I've asked you to read that message over and over there is where the city can come down upon this earth right all right now see then in the Plan of Redemption we'll see it very plainly that justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost didn't annihilate you no that's right it only cleansed you and set you aside and then God come and filled you burn out the things now you all we're in the message see so then why can't we see that the same Plan of Redemption is for the world right all right and if you've read the future home you don't around what he said he said the world was justified in the days of Noah Sanctified and Jesus dropping his blood and one day we'll receive a fiery baptism to cleanse it and claim it you know cleanse it and set it aside to where we can come back and live here that's right all right now in doing that then see why can't we see that these bodies right see these bodies come out of this Earth all right and see then coming out of the earth then the body to be redeemed will have to go through the same thing right as the soul has went through to redeem it and as the world will eventually go through and the only thing that what we do is and that's that's part of the mystery you see we embodying things we step ahead of the world that's right amen see we go ahead of the world right all right now we may not get that far tonight but we we Step Ahead see the world was justified in the days of Noah Sanctified with Jesus's blood was having to wait for a fiery baptism but we step ahead of the world right and we're going to go into a change and go out of here in a moment of Twinkle an eye and all of that before the world will get its fiery baptism amen all right but see that's the secret that's laying in between to where we can understand but the main thing I want you to understand and people on the internet systems to understand that see we used to believe the world would be destroyed y you know I mean that that's what we all Tau I don't know what we thought but I know what we thought I guess we thought it was just going to and and then God would have to create and start back over again and and you know and all of the things and but we come to find out that wasn't exactly the way God had said it that's right amen all right now that's where we want to read in Peter to see that according to Peter that in the flood the world was destroyed that was his word amen but we're still here right right see so we missed it standing on the thing and said y back there know the world was destroyed well what did we do did we all get up and not ride over an ark and and come over and come down did that Ark carry us on up to another planet set us down on it or some kind of something I don't know right these all kind of man's ideas but just get to point now so let's read what Peter has to say about it to make sure look at verse 5 of Peter second Peter 3 and 5 for this they willingly are ignorant of that by the word of God the heavens were of old and the Earth standing out of the water and in the water now but the heavens and earth which which are now excuse me first see we by the world that then was being overflowed with water perished it didn't destroy right it only destroyed the sin right now you think about it you you that have studied anything and know anything that like up here in in Kentucky they find fossils of alligators they dig down in the ground and all of them great big animals and all kind of things wo over the top of them and you know what you got the church riding on them yely right cuz you got the oil right it took all the pressures and all of the things that made cold it made you know all kind of things and see it was made out of those bodies of people that's right and animals that's right that was destroyed in the flood amen right but all it was destroyed was the sin of the world right the core the outside was just moved about and and great changes took place and and and all kind of things around the world took place at the what we call the destroying of the world right amen but it wasn't destroyed right it only destroyed the world which is the cosmos right World Order systems all right then as I said you can go to different places you know and they're finding all over they find uh they found whole elephants you know just totally in inbedded in ice that had to happen so quickly until they had the green grass GR in their mouth and their digestive systems and everything was was full of green stuff and all it happened so fast that's what's called a destroying of the world right but it didn't annihilate the world Amen so that's why your prophecy when he picks these up as we'll read him he said that was something for me to see that that's right so Peter says it you know all right where by the world that then was being overflowed with water perished but the heavens and the Earth which are now by the same word are kept in store he just moved everything about right reserved unto fire against the day of judgment and predition of ungodly men all right drop down to verse 10 but the day of the Lord shall shall come as a thief of the night in which the heaven shall pass away with a great noise and elements shall melt with fervent heat the Earth also and the works that therein shall be burned up right looks like one of these days is going to be another Annihilation yeah and we'll get to it in a minute and read where the Prophet said see there it's not that it's the cosmos the world order that's destroyed all right then we go over to revelation 21 that we were using the other day 21 and verse one and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away brother R says same word see and there was no more CA and now John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride Adorn for her husband and I heard a great voice out of the heaven said saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and what does it keep on going and it looks like one of these days is going to be a great Annihilation and it will be there will be but it'll only burn off sin Cosmos World water all right now what I'm trying to get us to make sure we understand there if we can see that's possible that this world can be redeemed now this is what I was trying to get across Sunday afternoon but I just said well I better hold it and back up a little bit and if we can just see that this world can one day be redeemed that's right you know that's right and that the new city can come down and John saw it he evident was on Earth and looking up he saw it he's standing on something and he saw it come down somewhere so why not you know all right but if we can see that now here's the point of the message if we can see that this world can one day be redeemed right why would we have any trouble about our bodies being redeemed that's right am why everybody want to you it right I know what it was in organized religion we didn't believe God was capable you said no no no no yeah yeah yeah yeah we didn't believe God was capable of doing things we wanted doctors to take care of our bodies we didn't need healing we needed doctors I reckon we thought God was supposed to give us doctors and thank God he gave us doctors sure but the point that see we look at it and we've always mankind has always taught it is going to get a new body yeah that's right why can't we believe if we believe the soul can be saved and we believe that the world can be redeemed why can't we believe our bodies can be that's right amen now they're not going to be 70 years old no no right see we've heard we understand the message of redemption amen we're going to go back to a young man a young woman you know everybody's going to be 18 20 years old or something because that's going to be the setup that's right the babies is going to come up in age the older ones like us is going backward amen see and some of you the 1820 were going to meet you in the middle but that still won't be you cuz you got to still be changed right that's right all right but that's the main point see and when when we read what the prophet has said then we can see that the Bible is not saying what we thought it said right we thought it said it would pass away and John sees the city coming down out of Heaven to land somewhere amen amen why not just believe it's right here right we stand on you got a millennial reain you got a cleansing of this Earth in the millennial Reign amen you know before the Millennium comes you got a a a a transforming until it be back to a Garden of Eden that's right amen and then we going to blow it away see that's why but the people of the message see they don't believe that because they don't believe in the Redemption of the Soul they believe your soul is annihilated no it's the nature of your soul right right the nature of your soul the prophet said was of the world right amen and it had to be redeemed right amen all right but once it's redeemed see Satan can't get his hands back on it right amen that's why I want you to read the future home and just go backwards and for and look and and and think with him when he's talking there's many statements that he's making in there that will sound just exactly like that he's he's talking about Redemption of the soul and he'll be talking about the body he'll be talking about the world read it very carefully dissect the message as we call it right take it very carefully there is a statement let's see in the church age book where when they put it in the church age book they they were talking and and and one little paragraph brother brandham is covering River Jordan and he's covering Mount of transfiguration and they put it all in one thing and see it's two entirely different events right but the way it's connected in the paragraph little short one it looks like brother R don't even know what in the world he's talking about but see that's why the Holy Ghost is supposed to set these things in order you remember the the board you know you know brother R saying our language is messed up you know about board but remember the before and after describes it you know come on board and pay your board cuz I'm bored with you well that's just explain what I'm saying you know what I'm saying about the word board then so it's the Bible clearing and understanding amen and the prophet didn't have to change it but see everybody with the big education you know yeah oh it's going to be blow away when he days I got them words and brother R come along and he said well here's this word and said U now this big old word here he said I have to spell it to you cuz I can't even pronounce it but said it don't mean destroyed y said it just means to pass from one form to another one and here's a big old stuff shirt you think he on stuffed his shirt no come on he walked out of there and said he don't know what he's talking about y like aons and eons you and all kind of things I tried to talk to my brother-in-law one time about that the hell wasn't Eternal and he could quote them big old words cuz he'd been to college but what was the problem with him he just didn't understand how own ID idiot like me with a ninth grade education could know what them words meant and could tell him y all right but you see it takes the holy spirit all right that's right it takes the prophet's message so now let's just read a little bit and let brother around and then if I have time I have some more on the back here I'll try to get to but if we don't I just want you to understand one thing and the anybody listening of what we believe we believe in the Redemption of the body amen we believe in the Redemption of the Soul we believe in the Redemption of the body we believe in the Redemption of the world and that none of it means Annihilation it means Annihilation to the natures of it or the cosmos World Order of it right or the the top of it or the the trash and I believe it's far that's why it says heavens and earth because as far as man has went out in space to the moon and whatever these ships are going on now Way Beyond there and going on out into the atmosphere that's got to be cleansed y right see because why because mankind that put his ear mark on it right right see all right let's let's just read some and think about it if you have them if you don't then just go get the book and read it that's what I said I I almost R run the whole book but let's just start off this is page 14 of future home pre 64802 now now notice how G makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul when I saw it how he makes plain when he didn't understand it always he he come to an understanding one day how he makes plain to us here now his Plan of Redemption now compare what we see with our own eyes what God has done to redeem his world he done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable god changes not any of his plans of anything such a glorious thing continuous reading how he led us to himself a Tabernacle in Us by three stages of Grace just like he's led the world in three stages to come through the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of Grace I've taught that at the beginning I never changed since of course now they're saying that brother brand says they're quoting brother brandham and saying that brother brand said it's just the Holy Ghost now no I believe it's justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and he said here I know it's two times in this message he said I taught that from the beginning cuz he always taught it kept his trees running collect right page 13 future home he said it's only the atmosphere around it and the sin that's upon the Earth that will be destroyed now we realize that the heavens means the atmosphere above he's talking about the thistles and the thing it's only that to be destroyed y sin will be destroyed all right going down page 13 still in the future home and this existing Heavens are atmospheres and the Earth which is now this Earth holds those things but it wasn't made for that purpose sin caused it to be like that see it was made by God the Creator but all now what's where he put and all of our bodies that we live in now we're put in the earth when God created it because you're out of the Dust of the earth it was all laid out here when God himself created it you were in his thinking and in him the Great Eternal was the thought which is the attribute all right now it's like I told you a little catch there if you'll notice in your Bible that it said when Jesus went down he preached to the spirit that were Spirits in prison and it stipulates to those who were disobedient in the longsuffering in the days of Noah right yeah now why would he STI ulate it why would God stipulate it like that see it was 2,000 years right from the creation to the flood right but brother Brown said that your body was justified when the rain fell on it in the days of Noah what about those people before then give you something to think I so Jesus had to go preach to those who were in The Longs suffering in the days of Noah see he had to bring a witness a witness to them that there were some people that were going to be redeemed right right that's right was that not his witness exactly right other words didn't he go down and tell them you missed it y but there's people that have took this message and lived they people that took Noah's message and lived right amen that was 2,000 years remember a world a scientific world but see just just drop a little point to you right so then we know that Peter says according to page 14 future home here the Apostle in second Peter here the second chapter the fifth ver it's really the what's the third chapter yes I've got it it refers to three stages of the earth see he he gets three stages of it notice how he brings them the old world stood out of the water now that was the Andel luian now the one that is the present world we live in now called it a world the old world that stood out of water Genesis 1 now the world that is now present and then again he refers to another one the the world that is to come the new world three stages of the world so then now the three stages is going to stay the same as for your soul justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost right it's going to stay that way notice how God makes plain to us his Plan of Redemption oh this just thrilled my soul when I saw it how he may explain to us here now his Plan of Redemption now compare that with our own eyes that God has done to redeem the world he's done the same plan to redeem his people for the unchangeable God now I quoted that one more ago and I want you to get it how he led us to himself a Tabernacle in three stages of Grace just like he led the world in three stages to come through the world as God will come to the world after it's gone through three different stages of purification that's exactly how he comes to us through three stages of Grace I've talked that at the beginning I've never changed he said keep your threes straight all right page 14 still in the future home the old world the Andel livan the world that's present now the one to come the W ages that he begin that he brings to us see his Plan of Redemption is exactly the same by everything he uses the same method he never changes just getting you to see something if we can get to hopes of seeing at the world and how it can be and remember what I was saying remember my point to Wi to understand the Redemption of these bodies so we can understand the Redemption of the Soul then we can go over and understand the Redemption of the world it'll be a simple matter to come back and understand the Redemption of the body that's right maybe a little uh there that we have to get but it's still there because you're going to say to me brother Dale how can your body go through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's very easy but I won't say it but that's very easy we just hold that if we get to it tonight we'll get on to that point if not we'll cover it later going down page 15 future home God makes it plain to us if that wasn't a great confirmation a good a great loving blessing from God when I see this and see that since a boy first time ever Christ dealt with me I've always taught those three stages of Grace notice if it isn't true now it goes on down page 17 how striking he takes a place where we are to dwell through the same process now he's called The Church through justification he called it through sanctification then filled it with the Holy Ghost and Fire and took it through a process that he himself the Holy Spirit himself the Son of God could could dwell in the human heart now it has to go through that before it can come into it notice he done the world where the bride's going to live in the same way his plan of of Salvation notice the and deluvian world after it had repented by through the Bride of that day now watch it look how he would tie the the the world to cleanse it it's a message you remember that prior to this message it's a message brother had a message there's got to be a message to go with it all right brother dick and I were talking down while ago see that's what people don't understand it's two accounts in the book of of what is in Luke I guess but anyhow it's two account in the gospel maybe one in the book of Acts that when Jesus appeared to the disciples when he appeared to two on the road to M he opened their understanding of the scriptures that didn't give them the new word right amen they to go to Pentecost open the understanding to the disciples after he met them right that didn't give them the new birth they had to go to Pentecost to get the new birth but he opened their understanding see brother random has come and preached a message to you and I that we ought to be able to understand the Redemption of the body in the world and the Soul at least our understanding ought to be opened right that us whole lot further beyond the the understanding that we previously had right but I want to re am I want that to become personal to me amen amen like I was tell in W the other day but I mentioned it brother dick you know I've told a lot of things around here that God's done and I've seen and things like that well you know if you want to take me to a lighter detector's test I'll go with you cuz there's no way in the world you're going to get that to deny what I saw Brother Gary is talking about it man sees a pink elephant take him to a lie detector test and the L test would show he seen a peak elephant right you said no it don't exist it did to him yeah amen the machine will show that what's right if you got something within your heart there's no way for Satan to take that out of you you have the new birth there's not enough demons in this whole world to get you to deny that Holy Ghost that's inside of your soul cuz if it deny you deny you don't have it there wasn't one born again Christian that denied Jesus Christ in the FX of book of Martyrs now there was a lot that didn't have it right that turned and walked away a lot of difference in where something's personal or not after 40 years we already have an understanding of brother Brandon's message right God has opened our understanding but now we need a revelation there's a lot of difference between a head knowledge and a revelation you can't walk on the head knowledge pink elephants you can't stand on them right cuz they don't exist but if it was a revelation you could walk on it that's why you can't take away what somebody has seen right brother BR said if God told me to go raise George Washington from the dead he said I'd invite the world that's right to come and see him raised amen why cuz he had something real right yeah see he was dwelling in a reality all right so why can't we understand it all right let's see you page 17 future home notice the Andel livan world after it had repented through the Bride of that day day Noah he gave it a water baptism covered it over with water then justification showing that he's on the road to called his Fallen World from Eden back to its restoration again then Christ came and shed his blood upon it cleanse it and claiming it see that's the world that we live in now that's why Satan he goes on down he said that's why Satan tried to give Jesus the world he showed him everything and said I'll give it to you if you just fall down and worship me see but brother R said what he had an ear marked if he done that that's why he couldn't do it going down not did you notice Abraham when they tried to give him the land he bought it with so many sickles of silver before the people as a an inside said he drop down he tried to give it to him as a gift but he wouldn't receive it see then Satan could still have claim on this but it had to be bought San would have a claim on this world y if Jesus hadn't paid the price amen but when he paid the price Satan has nothing to do with it scripture say what Jesus there one day said Satan's coming and have nothing in me right now I want to get to that place amen now I may be there and so by the new birth yeah but I want that to be said about the rest of me right you said well I don't think you'll ever get that way well that's all right I now striving for that's right am you remember why I said that they quit on all of this stuff you know they're not going nowhere anymore why cuz it donees reach interplanetary travel and the prophet said that's the type of the Rapture so there's not a push to go right oh yeah they want to travel around but they drop back down right they watch let's just go on over and read a few for the world Listen to The Prophet page 23 future home for the world is number 13 if you're looking on your notes with me for the world is one of his attributes right now why is he so overjoy about redeeming this thing why wouldn't it be an easy matter to blow it apart and build and speak another one he's not going to do it but look what he says you realize that if he blowed this world apart he blow your body out of existence and you would have to get a new it right where'd you get it from Venus Mars Pluto or who still all the same Earth I thought we believed at least in some form the prophet did about the The Big Bang Theory he said everything come from the you know the S said everything come from the the one ball of gas that just blew apart back in the beginning yes so all of these PL and everything out there and they're still even moving we're moving we're not sitting here we're moving science can prove all of these things to us but look for the world is one of his attributes just the same as you are one of his attributes the world becomes one of his attributes because it was God's thinking in the beginning to have a world to be on a throne to be a king to be a redeemer to be a Healer that's his attributes we like the Healer like the Redeemer what about he's going to sit on the throne work here in this world we're going to sit on the throne with him too work here in this world Amen a kingdom all right going down 25 so as old world frame did not destroyed by the waters when it was washed off the frame of the planet the old frame the all the dirt all the stuff that God put on the Earth was not destroyed when the first world was destroyed and the Bible said it was destroyed but it never destroyed the frame it destroyed it just destroyed the sin and sinners that was on it the framework remain but you see now listen to this one but you see as justification as you Baptist the m just want to think of you just justification believing in being baptized that's not enough you wonder right back into the things of the world Bob your heart and wear your shorts and everything else see there is nothing happened yet just look back and seeing you done wrong what did justification do the world it never done a thing to it it started right off again just as much sin as ever it was that's the way a man does and that's all the father he goes Y what happened to the world sure it was justified but what it do started right back off amen did it change it when Jesus dropped his blood on it the world never even recognize other than a a shaking of an earthquake and and things right but it was not like even the washing when Jesus dropped his blood on the earth it didn't destroy the world and neither did it make it a fit place for God to live cuz it's still a junk right see the old framework 26 was not destroyed by the water the world was only washed off that it that got its baptism it was baptized so will the framework remain though it be burned by fire it don't destroy the Earth it just destroys the sin that's on it notice here some of you Bible students especially Dr Veil looking at me now in Peter in the second chapter of Peter here third chapter rather he uses the word world as a word Greek word Cosmos which means the world order the Earth will pass away melt the elements with firment heat see don't mean that the Earth the planet's going to pass away but the world Cosmos it don't mean the planet's going to go but the world Cosmos the Pol politics this boy that's a bad amen the Sinners and systems and sin I never realized politics this profet come along I always said that I've had my own definition of politics I know what ticks are and you know they're just blood suckers and that's what politics are but that's their business let them have they fine fun we get out of here Peter said all will melt with fervent heat and works therein burn up not the planet The Works therein The Works of man all their politicians and their schemes and all their denominations and man-made schemes will go all go with it when it burns heaven will pass away with a great noise did you notice here Heavens will pass away with a great noise listen the whole earth will be on fire and will ignite the gases in the earth and explode it exactly still on page 26 future home Peter said to S and Earth heaven and heaven will pass away and Earth with a great noise such an explosion will rock it because it's got to kill every disease every thistle every Thorn everything there is to be done the fire burn it up and remember it's not all together just a literal fire listen to it it's also a holy fire that's cor that will take away Satan and all of his all of his Devils both Heaven and Earth amen will pass away killing all the germs all the insects all the natural life on it and around it even the H2O the water will explode think about it cuz H2O is two part hydrogen one part oxygen a deadly explosive right that we didn't even realize and I don't think we still realize the stuff you go up down and drink can blow you to pieces all it's got to do is just be changed right right who knew that uh what was it it wasn't fertilizer what was the other one ammonia nitrate who knew ammonia nitrate would blow a building up right we put a lot of it on corn and it blowed the corn up you it made it grow but I never realized it bow up anything right if it had we' have had fun in our day I told you about we shot 17 sticks of dite one year that's where I don't talk about these kids about their little simple things right you it's not that way I I don't like to be what everybody think well you lived in our day we lived in a big we live in a good world we all with a bunch of junk doing the things goling down the Moonshine we knew about the herbs and the things but you see everybody wants to condemn the young people well all right it is wrong to do wrong right we know that but we done our thing we had our bell bottom pants we had our ducktail haircuts brother Dale oh yeah we look like Elvis Presley yeah Sideburn I never did have that at the duct tail I never did like Sideburn never have my own personal opinion I don't like them can't trust anybody got Sideburn that's my opinion I saw that's my opinion but now look he goes on to explain the big word and many of you want to put down this word that's page 27 the Greek word pass away it comes from the word he come to find it and it's the word p a r e r e c h o m i a and he says it doesn't mean Annihilation it means changing from one form to another amen so the word world in the days of Noah was not destroyed it changed from one form to another when this happens in the end of it it will change it from one to the other now he goes on and gives you a lot of examples he said Paul used it when you want to put it down in Titus 3 and 5 Paul is using the same word means regeneration of men y that man is passed from a sinner to a saint not completely annihilated when a man's changed he isn't annihilated but he's a changed person he's been changed from what he was to what he is not annihilated Jesus used the same word I'm reading from future home page 28 Jesus used the same word Matthew 19:28 now not 281 19 1928 he said to them you set with me and my king father's Kingdom regenerated the changed when you're changed he used the same word he used the same word he said when he said to the cult said loose the cat and let him go you remember that in the scripture said the same thing it's a resurrection of Lazarus loose him change him he's been tied let him go what does it mean the Earth will be loosed from the grip of Satan it'll be loosed it'll be loosed from politics it'll be loosed from denominational religious systems to be used for the kingdom of God now I want to ask you a simple question and I want you to answer from your heart not from your head a simple question do you believe the devil will be destroyed amen or is that a quote that's right cuz that's a holy fire that's going to destroy the Devil and all of his angels and everything he thank God for a prophet we wouldn't have never thought about it even though though the scripture said that Satan would be destroyed what a great God that we serve he's not going into the future home he will be there even un kept under cover in the millenum because he has nobody to work through but then he's loose for a little season he goes forth to bring forth all of the people but then in the end of it he's annihilated amen the thing you're afraid of Y will be annihilated that's right I preached a little sermon when I was in the Philippines I preached it year before when I said according to the Bible Satan will be one day like a man laying along the side of the road that's according to the Bible and said who's afraid of this man it called him a man in other words signifying right that he doesn't have his supernatural abilities that he has this day because he does have them he even passes out gifts brother bandam said Supernatural gifts Satan can do all those things he's a prince and power of the a he's do all of these different sure but what about him being destroyed amen and the Bible said you'd see him like a man laying in the ditch and Brother Dean back there in karate you know was a time he could just about jump over this building but you see Satan will be like a man laying in a ditch yeah not even enough energy to get up you afraid of him brother random saw Satan right he said he come at him saying boot he said well I'm going to just see what will happen he just booted back at it well after a while Satan was just gone Satan is our servant that's right he's not our Master he can only bring me to God and help me by attacking me pushing me through this right but he can't destroy me but there'll be a day he'll be destroyed amen so as the old saying goes you know Satan likes to remind you of your past didn't he well there's a good statement among the people of the message I don't know where it come from where it started but it's a good one said when Satan reminds you of your past remind him of his future his future will be Annihilation amen just remind him of it when he tells you about your past to say Satan what about you tomorrow what about you when God decides to destroy you oh of course he's going to tell you God can't do that but we know the truth Satan will be annihilated see the prophet said the next thing you receive was the baptism of the Holy Fire and when the Millennium is over God's going to give the world a baptism of fire it's going to blow the whole thing up the heavens and the Earth will be on fire it won't be annihilated that's right now it won't be annihilated see the reason it won't be annihilated number one it's an attribute of God we just read that didn't we you remember the quote the world is an attribute of God Amen all right then how can Satan destroy an attribute of God it can't be done amen our bodies came out of it I'm just making sensible statements that's what I like to do I like to look at something see what the prophet said see what the Bible said then make my own conclusion of course that's what people don't like they don't like you to make your own conclusions no you don't have no right amen I just make my own conclusion got if it's an attribute it cannot be destroyed that's right that's right okay and if my body came out of it come on and if it's destroyed then I'm going to have to go to Mars to get me new one that's right or so Planet that's right no brother Dale God is just going to speak well where did he speak the first from right amen he spoke our bodies right out of this Earth that's right amen no I come by Mom and Daddy yeah I did but you explain to me what that Prophet said and I'll listen to you because he said things that even you women argue about today cuz he said a woman in her thing comes down say many eggs comes down and Sh says there only one comes down now who you going to believe all you women going to believe the doctor that tells you that only one egg comes down read your profit right right he said there was millions of EGS he said there were millions of germs come down right and he said it was not the the first one it met that produced the body he said one from way in the back crawled over and come back to one way over here he said how did you wind up being a redheaded child out of all blackheaded people he said somewhere way back down through there said great great great great great grandmother was redheaded took all that time to get it out you see we're arguing with the message y well now brother D brother Brandon was just so dumb he didn't understand about the eggs now he might know about the Bible Well if he know about the Bible I think he know about the eggs you know and like I've always said they say which come first the chicken under the egg we know for sure which came first God didn't create an egg he created a chicken he didn't create a male and a female egg he created a chicken but you see sence says well we don't know I don't give a who what sence says that's right what does the Bible say what did the prophet say there's a lot of things brother random said that totally went against scientific knowledge but a lot that he said if the science would have listened to it they could have found out a lot more about right scientific knowledge if they just listen to him that's right what you see folks now I'm going to make a few statements and then we'll come back and I'll cover this again so I'll keep these notes that I've got L here now but I want you to think about something we've got a lot said about the Redemption of the soul and we believe it that it goes through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost and we now have things that we've read through what the prophet has said and we tried to study it to the basis of seeing that the world will go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen but we got a lot of open questions there that still left in our understanding what happens to this body with can't afford to do as the brother in the message says that we'll walk out on our ashes in the Millennium now that's a big man in this message he said we literally just walk right out on on our own AES in the Millennium and then somewhere out here down by some way some P some something we going to wind up back up there with it you know and make contact well I just don't see that I'm honest I don't see it that's right because why would you want it changed why you going to change something and annihilate it why you going to resurrect something and annihilate it right see that's what I said I'm just making sensible statements well we ain't supposed to reason about the Bible I say the Bible's only things reasonable the Bible says come let us reason amen the same one says to cast down reasoning so what's he talking about cast down Mankind and his reasoning the cosmos the word order the atmospheres the situations of life right we certainly don't want to wait on our body to be redeemed in the fire that comes after the Millennium that will destroy the world right amen Cosmos we can't afford to wait that long can we so we got to know something about it and remember my statement it doesn't say that we are the adoption see you you come to the adoption of the hear ye himym and that's headstone but then there's another stage high The Headstone yep and that stage is to Wi Paul says to understand the Redemption of the body didn't say the Redemption of the world are you listening right Paul didn't say we need to understand the Redemption of the world I believe we do because they put it in the scripture but get my point there has to be a mystery and we must annihilate all things that cannot be true you know that's the way I study something you know we used to take what do you call those multiple choice or something like that multiple choice questions you know two School teachers sit back there three of them in here you know they laugh at me dmy talking about but what do you you get a multiple choice well what's a mul choice no matter what they ask you two of them is so outlandishly wrong until even a a dummy will understand that they're not right so you you just MK them to off right then you have to study on which of the two is right and we used to know you know true and false it was every other one was true and every other one was false you just get your orders and numb right but anyhow listen to get an understanding of the Redemption y of the body right I didn't make a lot of statements Sunday because I didn't want people and I'm glad the internet system went down maybe tonight cuz it'll make people want to stir up later and come back and listen but just listen to me we can't afford to wait until the Fire Fall fall over there after the Millennium right to get a glorified body right that's right amen see we have to step ahead of the world right you know why where the world can follow us amen our bodies will go ahead of the world and then the world can follow us we're the king pin in the middle what you want to call it the Keystone we're in the middle we have heard the Redemption of the soul for 2,000 years right right right but very little has been taught of mankind about the Redemption of this body that's why basically all organized religion and high for this message believe you're going to get a new one right yep where's it coming from what planet what place what position what where's it coming from see there's some keys that brother brandham made in the message of the future home to give us understanding about this bodily Redemption we've got to have a place to Anchor it to we got to have an example a TI a shadow right to precede our thinking because if not we won't be able to have it like up in the scriptures right so did you read these things in the future home or did you just read over it and say boy he's your goof there how about page 44 future home it's not on yours now don't look for it when he went up out of the water he said I saw Heavens open Now where's this at River Jordan right where everybody now saying he wasn't God he become God he thought he was God somebody's God we don't know what God is when he went up out of the water the prophet said when he went up out of the water he said I saw Heavens open the prophet saw it now who's he talking about John the Baptist he saw the heavens open and here come descending Out of Heaven a form of a dove and a voice say now what does it say over there what does it say there in the scripture about Matthew 3 this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell and Etc ET ET Etc tells you the things he does but now here's what your Prophet said it say it now let's read it and see if it changed if he changed the interpretation or was he telling us what the Bible was really saying now reading between the lines is fine as long as what you read is upon the lines correct we don't believe in Reading between the lines to get something contrary to the lines now your Prophet didn't say that he said reading between the lines is reading about Abraham and Sarah and how that they went down here and took a 300 M journey and here was great here was Grandma you know yeah you know her granny call her he didn't call her grandma cuz she wasn't that time we called her granny I think and here this man comes out and he wants to take her as his wife I mean my wife I think for 69 years old is a beautiful woman I'm not saying that cuz she's here I've always told her she's pretty when her mother at 45 was solid wheh headed I thought now she get 45 she'll be wheh headed well she's not she's not whitee headed but I still don't think that too many 18y old or 20year Old Kings would want her as a wife when they could have all the others that around is that honest that's not degrading her is it now when she was 18 it's like Richard said when he saw a picture of her when she was 16 right before we married he said well you was a model she said I was I turned out to be a model wife see okay so we just read between the lines but we didn't read contrary to the line right right and we wound up reading eventually that her and Abraham that were both of them totally Beyond childbearing right Abraham done all right but he still done got to that point you know he done lost it right and when he did it says that they were both Beyond they wind up with a baby yeah Sarah dies and when he seven more kids that Abraham had or something like that he married and seven more or something right we just read between the lines didn't we we didn't read contrary to the lines cuz that's what the line said we just didn't read it right so now when we're reading Matthew that it says you know this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell let's read what your Prophet had to say in the future home and he went up out of the water and he said I saw Heavens open the prophet saw it he saw the heavens open and here come descending Out of Heaven a form of a dove page 44 future home and a voice saying this is my part of the earth that I have redeemed that's right and from this part of the earth I will redeem the rest of it for he is my word made manifest and the whole world I spoke it into existence by my word Hebrews 11 and Satan's held it all this time but I've come to redeem it so much of it has made his body and I'm coming to dwell in it amen now the brother R said that's what the Bible said all right now yours the catch to it 3 and 1/2 years later later he receives a change agree but God said it was redeemed that's right there was no Redemption to be brought later there was only a manifestation of what had already been spoken right amen would come into view m p 44 future home John said I saw the holy city the New Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven as a bride adorned for her her husband what and where did it settle on just exactly like it did there upon the Earth one day it's going to come down on Earth just like it did on earth work Jesus was part of that Earth Earth that the Holy Ghost descended upon is that right and remained upon him forever it can never leave him it's always there he and God are one always has to remain and so so John saw the holy city of the New Jerusalem descending like a comet or a dove coming out of heaven and settling Upon A redeemed entire Earth to do what to claim every attribute that he made the Earth far every man that was ever what that was represented in eternity and every woman is redeemed then now where was your body redeemed remember what we kept reading in Ephesians everything's predestinated in Jesus Christ in him before the foundation of world Amen I've kept reading that over and over and over hoping somebody jump up and say hey I see it everything we get is in Jesus Christ that's right whether it be Redemption of Soul whether it be healing for the body whether it be a body change or whether it be a world to come down and live on it's all in Jesus Christ right amen and without him we don't get anything right amen okay to do what to claim every attribute that he made the Earth for every man that was represented in eternity and every woman is redeemed then she's been scoured and burned by fire Jesus in his fiery Temptations in the wilderness for 40 days after that notice it was ready for his it was ready for his ministry think of it the Holy Ghost descending upon the Earth Jesus and the Holy Blood and watch out I hope it don't go too deep for you page 19 future home now notice now as we take this this place we are to dwell in now the Andel luian repentance then brought water baptism then Jesus came and shed his blood upon it to cleanse and claim it the world are you in he dropped his blood on it to cleanse with cllean it right where was your body right okay so Brother D you got to make this live for a minute okay I will Lord willing then comes the next destruction of the world it is now and sin that's in the heavens above pick up on these other quotes let's ask you another little simple question was our bodies physical compound elements of our bodies whatever you call them 16 elements pot ice petroleum Etc was that in Jesus when he stood there and the voice said this is my beloved Son our natural bodies was not in there right we don't come out of Jesus by natural uh DNA genetics true right but he redeemed that to where that he could redeem soul body that's right and the world yep would be all made in Jesus Christ right all right now that was the beginning of Jesus's Ministry we just read he was ready for his ministry right that's where these people can't understand the anointing that come on Jesus on the River Jordan that's right it was an anointing for ministry that's just simp simple because he goes right over this a little bit in in Luke about the fifth chapter fourth chapter and he said the spirit of the Lord is upon me because had anointed me to preach the gospel right that's simple but get to point now where does your Redemption of the body start so well it was done in Jesus Christ all right there's another one of those we don't want to wait until this that or the other form we need to understanding to it to understand the Redemption of the body not to change the change comes on an automatic process because we understand the Redemption right will you go with me that way amen the change will come because of the fact that we come to a position to know that we're redeemed and understand it will you will you go with me I don't ask you to amen cuz most of you ain't and like brother says you know amen is when you shake your head yeah you know and none of you ain't shaking your head so you ain't Amen in got one amen but think about it now what did we cover here a few months ago the Lord Jesus Christ had to have a river Jordan experience right that was his identification true that's what your Prophet called him he was identified on the River Jordan he was identified he did not have to have the new birth did he no cuz he was the new birth but he had to have that anointing to come upon him right to bring forth his ministry right now but you and I needed a new bur right so his first stage of adoption was that he started off on the River Jordan that's where your Prophet covers it now go ahead do what you want to that's right and then he comes to mount of transfiguration as to hear you him and then he goes on to the opening of the seals and has a has an understanding of the Redemption of the body right you remember that a few weeks ago when I was trying to say that you might not have been listening you want to go back and listen to some tap I've already preached most of this you remember when I tell you hey this is Mark number one you were to write it down what I say because I'll eventually get back to it huh Jesus didn't need a new birth okay but he went through that as an example right for you and I that's right and his body was redeemed right there amen 3 and 1/2 years of the most horrible time could ever be that don't have anything to do with it right he was already redeemed right amen that's why Satan couldn't touch that body Jesus Satan never killed Jesus no Roman spear killed Jesus no Jewish spear killed Jesus no beating on the back killed Jesus that's right he died of his own accord because of your sin and my sin amen that's right he paid the price amen agree but see brother r said when he dropped his blood on it that cleansed and claimed it amen our bodies that were in the earth y you see it's not only just that's not used in the who is it somebody get the scripture if you can I can't remember it but see I didn't mean to go this far you receive receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and fire right remember Holy Ghost and Fire right right you said well why does it say Holy Ghost and Fire brother R says because that fire that fire that's right comes right there as that Holy Ghost is coming in and says it burns out everything if you read the future home you heard him y said it burns out anything that was left that's right and the holy Holy Ghost comes and lives in you realize then that when Jesus set up a kingdom cuz that's what he come to bring wasn't it right when he give you the new birth Brother Gary he cleansed and claim that body he burn it out to a degree and he's still burning it out that's right cuz your Prophet says 49 of the future home that your soul is redeemed but said you're waiting the Redemption of the body he said it's growing on I've give you that quote three times already right it's growing on already started who is this MDC y he said it's already started see when he gave you the new birth right there he left lay claim on that body that you're living in yes sir Amen brother dick there's no way can ever be annihilated right you can burn it trash it do what you want to with it can't be annihilated why because he laid claim to it right that's why I believe we're not going to get a new body that's right is because the Holy Ghost come to live in this body right and now we don't like this remember a few weeks ago when I preached this way see when it says about Jesus it says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell see we say one of these days I wish I could get to that place well then you don't have the new birth that's right that's right sorry right if you think one of these days you want to get to the place that that God could be pleased to dwell in you you don't have the new birth that's right because the day he gave you the new birth he come to dwell you amen put his own life exactly right redeem this body come on that's right you want scripture right you want scripture for those who Justified he ha already glorified amen well I just don't see and I'm looking that's exact what you would have done with Jesus from the River Jordan in 3 and 1/2 years of the most horrible beatings and life happenings and what he could go through with until a day come that that could be made manifest and his body would be made Eternal right you wouldn't see it back there either I don't believe in getting another body Holy Ghost is dwelling in this body right amen if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's pleased to dwell in you now I'll say it cuz I don't mind being blunt he might not be happy about it he might not be happy about living in you and me in the bases of us being and the sin that we walk in right oh brother D ain't a sinner you know you're the biggest liar in the building that's right but he says he's pleased to dwell I've got notes one of these days I want to get back and preach on sin again I preached it here back a few years ago I want to get back on it again but see you say well what do you sin with brother Dale I say this with love in my heart if you sin today and you're a Christian if that sin is in your soul you're lost right absolutely amen but then you tell me you don't sin and then you try to justify and you say that where brother brandom said the the uh Christians are the only one that has sins you say that it don't say Born Again Christians there I'm turn it I'm twist it right that's right with love in my heart don't twist it right don't try to use scriptures like that that's right your Prophet said he sinned every day now where did he sin at was it in his body was it in his Spirit or was it in his soul right you say well we're just a soul have we come all of this way to divide Body Spirit and and soul and then want to wind up and sum it up by saying we just a soul I know that's right we are a soul we are a being right but you must divide the body spirit and soul according to Hebrews 4:12 if you sin in your soul you're lost right yes sir so where did the prophet sin if you want don't want to take anything and twist scripture quotes from the prophet he he said he sinned every day yep where did he sin at in his soul the soul that sinth it shall die all right you were probably rejoicing over the things you first heard and the talking about the body being redeemed when you receive the new birth but what about your rejoicing now I leave that we with love and respect of all things if you sin as a Christian you better make it in body and spirit right that's right but if you sin and your soul you're lost if you're just a soul then it makes you a sinner I love you let's stand you see it's to understand the Redemption of the body it's too wi to understand the Redemption of the body you know what will happen when we understand the Redemption of the body the body will be redeemed the world's not waiting on the Sons and Daughters of God to just be a signs and wonders you remember that because manifestation means what to make known signs and wond sure makes God known and we covered that no Divine Healing no Resurrection Divine healings and things is to make known God Among Us but the world is waiting on the Sons and Daughters of God God to come to a place that they understand the we redemption in the body right it must start in your new birth and work its way out what we got 87 read book 87 anybody have a need let me bless Lord the way leading straight to the land ofing
