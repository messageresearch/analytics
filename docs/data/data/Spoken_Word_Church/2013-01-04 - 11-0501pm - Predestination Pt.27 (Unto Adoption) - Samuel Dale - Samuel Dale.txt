the topic hope you remember what was the topic somebody's saying something seven things yeah seven things that i hate okay all right seven things that i hate that's in the scripture there it says six things i hate and then the seventh coming up you know all right and remember then the minister's meeting will be the second saturday and brother gerald hughes right and then the fellowship meeting will be here on the third saturday the 21st 22nd brother jewel 40 will be here preaching for the weekend so remember these announcements and keep them in your prayers ephesians 1 and romans 4. father we thank you for your love and your grace and to us thank you for all things and we know you said you give them to us freely so we stand here believing that this afternoon that you'll come on the scene and given to us the things we have need of because we pray as the scripture says that give us this day our daily bread so we grow day by day by faith in thy word and lord we know that we're to be as the prophet said this morning that the people couldn't wait so help us to wait upon you to make manifest your word and to walk in the light of the hour that we're living forgive our sins and lead us lord by thy grace and love and just have your way down and teach us in jesus name amen ephesians 1. we'll go like i've been to verse 3 through probably verse 7 i think it is six or seven blessed be the god and father of our lord jesus christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in christ according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holding without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved okay let's go to galatians you know i said romans but it's a galatians forgive me i'm thinking on romans 8 so but i want to use this one and then we'll get it in the way go to galatians 4. now i say that the air as long as he is a child differs nothing from a servant though he'd be lord of all but he's under tutors and governors until the time appointed of the father even so we when we were children were in bondage under the elements of the world but when the fullness of the time was come god sent forth his son made of a woman made under the law to redeem them that were under the law that we might receive the adoption of sons and because he our sons god has sent forth the spirit of his son into your hearts crying out by father wherefore dart no more a servant but a son and a son than an hour of god true christ you may be seated the lord blessing to the reading of the word now we were trying to express this morning and it was so i got real fast so i was trying to bring out a lot of things but you understand and i was doing it you know just to make sure we didn't i didn't want you to misunderstand what i was talking about how that jesus never never you know give us an inheritance he was the one that stood between god and man to transmit that inheritance down to us and him being almighty god the inheritance was fully in him but how could it be brought out see and while he was here in that flesh he could not transmit that life you know the eternal life our inheritance which was our name written on the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world and there was no way that he could could do that while he was alive so it meant he had to die see to be able to bring us to our bring the inheritance to the position that you and i could receive it and as i said god could not then just say well i'll just sprinkle eternal life down through time and so many people will grab it and you know and they'll become eternal and that would be what you would be saying if you were believing the doctrine that you always was eternal you don't need the new birth and things like that you just always was eternal well i i don't agree with that i agree with what the prophet is saying that you always was eternal because he's talking about if you have eternal life if you received eternal life that eternal life always was eternal but there was a time i didn't possess it as a person and even i hope you were catching it on the point that i was making that see then brother branham said that in doing what he done jesus inherited eternal life not that he had to have eternal life and soul because he was almighty god but the body was a human element that had to be made eternal see it was it was an element had a beginning so in doing the way he done he inherited eternal life in body and by that then you could go to the future home and say you know by this part of the earth which was on the river jordan he said you know this is my beloved son in whom i'm pleased to dwell and the prophet interpreting what that was saying was this is the part of the earth that i have redeemed and from this part of the earth i'll redeem the rest of it so that our bodies are in the process of being redeemed right and and it's working from the inside out and we stand like he did in a human mortal body that needed redemption not because he was a sinner but because his body had a beginning and he inherited that by doing the way he did so he gets something so we get something and we're heirs with him whatever he gets we're joined afterwards and i hope he was listening to to the point of trying to bring it to you at least thinking spiritual to that place of what we're talking about but now we're going to go into it if you will that's reason i say in romans uh you know we're going to go into romans 8 all right so if you will read romans 8 and study it especially from about verse 14 i think it is of romans 8 on what through 22-23 and just study that over and think about it and we'll be covering adoption and it will be in uh three stages you know and it covers it there in three stages but i want to get onto that just in one message but what i want you to do is to think on those things and you know think of adoption now in our natural day of d adoption is like you adopt somebody else's children all right uh you know that is our form of adoption but in biblical terms the uh one that's like we read in in uh galatians that see when a baby's born into the family that that became a point that where that baby was a baby it was a child it was an heir but it was not to the point of being able to uh handle or do or or talk about even you know the the inheritance that it was entitled to and was not it wasn't to the point of what would be called sonship and sonship deals with the basis of you're growing up you know all right and see we'll be covering that and you think on those things and uh you know we'll get to a point at the end of the message to make sure you understand how that we're tying it together but there's a little talk that i want to bring this afternoon and uh i don't know i meant to be short this morning and longer this evening but you know we'll get through by five o'clock anyway but but just uh bear with me because i want to make a point now as i said in the natural days of adoption we adopt other people's children you know into our families and then make them inheritance with us and as far as the law is concerned if you adopt a child and it's true adoption then that child is as much air as any child born into your natural family because that's the the law of adoption all right and uh see then doing that uh i know brother picash they have a lot of children there in the orphanage but at certain ones that they adopt when it does that means that that comes into their their lineage part with them seeing and you know making them i've talked with him before on it but um see we think about adoption and a lot has been said about it that you know of what it is and uh i'm just going to give you the definition from strong's concordance it says adoption of children 5206 and it's the same one for all six times adoption is used in the bible and said adoptionist sons says that relationship which god was pleased to establish between himself and the israelites in preference to all of the nations it means the nature and condition of the true disciples in christ who by receiving the spirit of god into their souls become sons of god it also includes the blessed state look for in the future life after the visible return of christ from heaven in other words goes all the way through all right now the point i want to make with you now i know brother branham i'll make the statement now then i'll re-read it your adoption is not your birth all right now and i'll re-read that to you in a minute to where you'll keep that but the point i want you to get in mind is one thing you and i the adoption uh i forgot to write that down but adoption was it really pertained to israel all right because it was an israelite custom and you know coming down but it paul says adoption pertained to israel and the covenants the receiving of the commandments etc etc belonged to israel because they were god's chosen people all right you and i were gentiles no lineage right whatsoever to be connected to god and adoption all right now but the only way that i can really get in to the right understanding for me to see it now is this way being that we were alienated from in this that's in the scripture ephesians i think alienated from the commonwealth of god right all right see we had no rights no lineages right there's not anything we can go to we can't go look how good i was look who i was born from my mom and my daddy were jews and i'm a jew you know paul said it's not not a jesus that would have it to do this inwardly and what's he talking about the new birth all right now we came kin folks to the devil of course the israelites did too and everything but they were setting up a stage right for god to be later used and and i've done a little uh research one time on the adoption of ways and and i don't mean it's not in the bible i mean they but they picked up a custom from other nations and israel began doing that right and and god didn't say amen i'll just put that in the word and i was already in the word but he it came on fourth because you won't find a lot in the old testament except uh you'll find um joseph and the code of many colors and and but the word adoption is not used right but that was what was taking place the one who was tutored and trained and each child as we'll cover later i believe each child and the children of israel i don't believe it's just joseph that receive the uh adoption i believe all of the others when they reached a certain age and were proven to be children of the family then they received their adoption you know into the family and all like that but joseph got a special blessing and got because he was the chosen of god i mean joseph his father and born late age you know like that and he received the coat of many colors we will review these things later but i'm trying to make a point to you see so the first thing is we've got to get into the family of god that's the point of adoption adoption will be to the point that god only adopts his own children he doesn't adopt the devil's children so we were born kin folks to the devil right according to the book of ruth we had one year again and we had the things had to be done to bring us to the place that was there and you know and in doing that then if we receive the new birth it brings us into the family all right now i want to use it like this and if you differ with me or somebody hears me say it i'm making this statement of my own for clarification all right that if we go to romans and find that you receive the spirit of adoption and we will cover that all right then the spirit of adoption can be your new birth right amen right the spirit of adoption you didn't have the spirit of adoption amen until you received the new birth that is your spirit of adoption all right everybody understand me so then we had to be brought into the family of god so why can't we say that by the new birth we receive the spirit of adoption so if god adopts us amen into the israelite promise not the israelite conditions nations etc no but he makes us a jew at heart an israelite life which is children of god he makes us that in heart not in natural lineage all right so now does everybody understand what i'm saying your new birth to me being the spirit of adoption brings you into the family and that way you're adopted into the family of god because you had no right of being in the family we have no lineage no no connections there's no we can't say that we're abraham's our father no abraham the father of israelites not father of gentiles now i know that a lot of them came out of that sure all right i understand that you know of ishmael and the isaacs and all of that i understand the story but still they had no promise the dismal side never had no promise it was only to the israelites which the promise made which would be the children of ishmael i mean of isaac right and israel had no connection whatsoever to it but now the thing on what i'm saying is you must receive the new birth right all right i don't want you to come up later and say but yet now this don't sound exactly the way you were bringing it sunday see i want this in your mind that we must be brought into the family of god all right so we could use the word adoption in the terms of bringing us into the family because if you don't do it that way then you would be making the sons of god in not even no lineage no lineage form then you you gentile has no lineage formed does anybody understand what i mean by that really the jews had a lens that was god's chosen he said out of all the world i chose you as a nation but he didn't choose nobody else he gave them circumcision he gave them signs he done everything all right but see then the only place that we can come in is uh talking about the book of ruth see but see boaz he didn't he couldn't pay the price for for ruth i mean because she had no lineage right right all right see her husband she went over and married her oh man you don't think they had no no life no everything was gone all right but yet see she was a he was a gentile in other words all right so then what happened he had to purchase naomi all right in purchase in naomi which was an israelite right then if if naomi was going to give ruth anything the then boaz would be buying that portion right and see i don't know what the name of the other one was but or peterson or see she went back she went back to her people she was gentile she went back to her people she had no uh it's not even discussed anymore her position is not in no types and shadows or or anything it's just it's left that way all right but see when boaz paid the price he paid the price for naomi all right but she paying the price for naomi then naomi could bring in ruth because of being her daughter-in-law she could bring her in and then boaz could take naomi and then he would automatically get ruth because that was in the family ruth had no property lineage you could say well he did it to her husband you know but still she was a gentile so you you have trouble connecting her to the israelites because it's all for tangent right and see that's what i love about the bible and every so often down through there you gotta wrap the harlot you got a ruth and you've got the things that the gentiles are just you know hearing under you've got all of the mighty men of david and them being gentiles and you you got them being shown here in yonder you know and i love that because it meant it's coming down right but get the point now then we'll start into the message so when i come back to it then you won't misunderstand it see the spirit of adoption brings us into the family it is not your adoption right it is the spirit of adoption all right that would bring us into the family so you can say we're adopted into the family see because that's what we are we had no way of getting into the family jesus christ paid the price to bring us into the family that's right all right so now if everybody will follow with me it won't be confusing when i get back to the other and really start laying it down hard and i will at the end of the message to make sure you don't misunderstand me but the point i want to make to you is one thing i want us to talk about uh something present tense you know it's good to talk about his weight said about abraham and all that but that's all a good story but i want to talk about something present tense and that's why i love the scripture like it is we read there in ephesians that we were predestinated unto adoption all right now brother branham says and it's right above one of the quotes we'll give it a minute he said unto what does that mean he said unto means something we are coming unto you i go unto the water fountain or something like that it's a word meaning that you're not fully fire but yet you're in the travel part of it you know and you're moving toward it something we're coming unto all right now this day this is the hour that the whole world has been waiting on all right right for someone to come unto full sonship we've had sonship we've had a new birth right every ages had the new birth but yet it's something that's not right yet that's right and and here we are at the end time and and you know i like to do this and once why like the series i've done on the book of revelations where you know that if you want to find your book and read the book of revelations because that's the bride's book i love that you know the bride's book is the book of revelations because you just all you got to do is just get in there and understand what it's talking about you've never find jesus in the book of revelation by himself you always find him in somebody with somebody because at that time he's already joined up now but notice it says we're predestinated on two right all right now that scripture to me now is pointing to the day and you and i are living in right all right now uh israel was predestinated to a point of what they were and how they done i mean the prophets were predestinated i haven't got that message yet remember the fifo ministry and the prophets because they're predestinated unto that place and you know uh the the gifts are pretty estimated the fifo ministries predestinated word of god all right amen now listen see this scripture is pointing to now right because look what the prophet says now off the message adoption now i'm using this and i will try to get back to the other because me and brother joe we we you know i wish we could transfer over but it's not that i love the other printing up of the way the the different things of the message is but this one is taken from the latest version from voice of god recordings and that's fine but the difference is in paragraphs and titles sometimes in a minute we'll get down to one that's called adoption and really in the old references that i use or the other uh form or whatever you call the the message it uses it manifested sons so sometimes it's confusing and brother joe is having to transfer it over to word that people will pick it up you know because there's two different it's not two different versions now and everything's basically the same some paragraphs are a tad bit different because it's a new revised version coming straight from voice of god recordings and i like it but let's say that it just changes the titles sometimes and if it don't wind up the same paragraph for you and on the internet you know you hear something and it don't wind up with the same message look at the date always give the date the date will be the same where it calls it adoption three or something like that or it calls it manifested sons look at the date i think it's 4 18. look at the date on it and if you miss a paragraph a half or so you know what we've had to do with the old seal book the old seal book when they put out the new seal book it's got the same words in it but it's got different paragraphs and you say page 40 and it might be page 42 in the new one you know so you know bear with us we do the best we can because if you leave everything on the old style the new style is off if you go to all new style the old style is off so we have troubles i i can't help it they decided to do those things i just try to tell you what's taking place so if i give you a paragraph number and it's not the same please look around until you find it don't say well that was wrong mine says this well i'm reading from a different thing or something but this message is number one on your notes it's adoption number four see it won't be called that a lot of times in the other style he'll give you a title but here's the today it's 5 22 the evening service 1960. now listen to what brother ryan says tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of god was ever to be manifested outside of this time now now you could stop right there and you could say brother branham we've had sons of godhold since calvary you taught us that that's right but he's telling us of what this age is right right all right everything in the bible's point to this age so now he's telling you about this age so that's what i'm saying this is this is a message to try to bring us update present tense time and you'll see why i'll make a few statements in a moment outside of this time where was there ever a time in the history this manifest that time to deliver all nature so now you see what he's pointing to this is pointing to the end time to deliver all nature all right nature the nature itself is groaning waiting for the time of the manifestation why before the atonement was made before the holy ghost was ever poured out before all the old testament on down there there couldn't have been manifestation it had to wait till this time now what's he talking about you don't find the word adoption written in here in this quote you find him dealing with the end time the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god all right which is here now the end time all right he's not dealing in this message talking about who's born again who ain't born again what's doing he's telling you what the world's waiting on he's telling you what we're all waiting on what the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god all right now what a time to deliver right a time to deliver all right see there couldn't have been manifestation he hadn't waited this time all the things have been brought coming shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of sons of god coming back and the spirit of god coming into these men so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like christ they'll it'll join him and his church together all right now pointing to our day so don't get tied up in what is this and what is that okay stay with me of what i'm trying to bring all right don't say well i thought this or i thought that just just stay with me and listen we'll get back to those things and cover them in detail i'm talking about predestinated unto adoption a pacific a specific place time event that the world has been waiting on if everything's waiting on i mean kind to this age we'll get to the scripture in a minute on a lot of things right now the word of god is i'm saying those prophets as they walked out there with that word of god they really were the word for their age and the people took that word and they became the word of that age and you could say well our david was he he killed goliath that's right he didn't kill all the rest of the philistines see the people caught on to the message and they became the word of the age they were living all right moses went up into the mountain come back all right he had the message but you know what a lot of times that people didn't want to follow that message so they died in the wilderness right but those who wanted to follow it went into the promised land right all right so now get the point no matter what we claim a message to the hour thank god but if you and i don't become that message amen right then god has done his part everything's done it's our responsibility okay see and we must recognize our day in this message this is not the age of martin luther right right this is not the age of john wesley pentecost himself this is the age to work that were promised to come to a total deliverance of even nature we've seen it in a manifestation drew the prophet in the basis of speaking things into existence of a bull running at him and god conquered the book through love and the bees nature etc its master for a moment but he said these things that you've seen when they'll be seen in its fullness you know right all right so being predestinated on two we are still in the tribal stages but somewhere somebody one day has got to come to the place to say this is that that's right i like the way brother said it he said you know he'd be saying that of the scripture where they said this is that you know learn the book of acts i think it isn't he said if this ain't that let me keep this until that gets here all right but i i think he believed that was that don't you right all right see we've got to be positive i'm trying to get us to a point just today to be positive this is on the mind all right so this is what i want to try to bring out that this is the hour right this is the time right no matter how bad we look no matter about what you think see people are saying you ain't got nothing i ain't got nothing well there's one thing about it we're still here we're not doing like a lot of churches and cutting down on their services and having less and less if it's possible we'd have more and more and we'll have more services this year because we haven't had it right good friday and saturday the sunday services and then we're gonna have a fellowship meetings and then we're gonna have a fourth of july time and hey man hey we're going to have a saturday and a sunday for that we're putting in more services and it wouldn't bother me if we had church every night i know that'd be rough on the body but i thought we believed that we had to go to church and do more as we sing the time approaching not do like the world that drops off and do but that's that's all right that's that's your business see what i'm going to try to do now is speak of the word or what is to be predestinated for this time now remember if it's predestinated that means there's nothing satan can do to stop that from taking place he can do a lot of trying but he can't stop it might cause his predestination all right remember it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally that's what 152 i think or something in the church's book but the word or seed all right and then being a word or seed then someone has to make that word manifest so what part of the word is for us okay you've heard right around and say that moses didn't build an ark and float the children of israel out of egypt right he said that was noah's day all right but they had a word to be fulfilled of going to the promised land now martin luther brought a message to the just to live by faith john wesley come along standing on that part of the word now not rejecting it that he rejected it he would have moses rejected the god that brought the children and brought him over in the ark right then he would reject the word like me it was all apart so john wesley believed in justification preaching justification but then he received the message of sanctification all right now pentecostal possessive street baptism of the holy ghost etc then you had the prophet coming in in his day and time thing and all of that is part of the word of god right and each one was predestinated the just shall live by faith was the predestinated word of god which meant there was no way that that wasn't going to happen right amen i don't care what anybody thinks it was going to happen why because god predestinated me and martin luther was the man that by foreknowledge he would fall into so he and his message become one right then the people in the message become one right all right right see so is it whatever age no that's right all right then in doing that we must find where we're at that's right we have a word to be fulfilled all right so now i gave you some quotes we're brought around and said he talks about like there's a man here that can turn on the lights 1963 12 29 paragraph 105 now in all ages god has set for some so set forth so much of his word for each age god always sends somebody that that word can get into and show the light of it that every age it does the same thing always does that so there's a word for every age you say well we're just sitting here waiting for a bus to pull up you know well now that was what martin luther said that's right he set the world on fire with justification because we just go to church if we want to if we don't want to we don't need to we can always listen to the days we can you know okay that's your choice because we're going to prove what we are see all right when god spoke through the prophets they were the word that's underlined in that same quote and they made that manifest for the day that they were living in okay turn on the lies preached in 1964 125 paragraph 33. we want to talk about this morning is rejecting this light by them it's sent to reject see it and it's just like it was then they reject a lot all right but we take the light he was the light of the world but he was rejected all right and it meets that condition every time that god maintains his light the light that the world itself rejects that light why it's written right in the bible each age god has allotted so much of his word for each age and he always sends somebody to make that word manifest all right now read all the rest of them down to there like christ is identified the same 64 418 paragraph 95. god unlocks his word for the age when that word is ready to be manifested now search the scriptures don't just take my word when that word is ready to be manifested then god sends down a prophet and reveals the word to the prophet so we've had the prophet we're not in the word of the age of the prophet now there are people that are just receiving the message remember unto means you're traveling that's right there are people that are just hearing about the prophet we've got to have that right amen all right but for everybody it's not god sent a prophet what's your message god sent a prophet no i like the way they said it in in india to the brothers and them said you've told us that god sent a prophet and i've sent somebody over here to tell us what that prophet taught in china i think what china yeah right right but now think about it the word of each age there's a bunch more quotes down through there two more about the word of the age all right now the word of the age would be made manifest by somebody all right so we're not in martin luther's age we're not in john wesley's age we believe it right we're not in azusa street pentecostal age we're not in the age of god sent a prophet i've explained that so you cut yourself off do what you want to i've explained that so people will just click and on the brain you don't believe it not we should be through that that's for you to do if that's what you're doing explain to the world that god sent a prophet but somebody's got to move on to what the prophet taught all right now because in this age then there would be a word for this age right all right now i lost my notes so forget that in this age we're to the age of work what didn't love this one what is it hebrews 11 40. they without us could not be made perfect that's right they could not be brought to completion without us right the fifo ministry according to ephesians is for the perfecting of the saints all right so there has to be a predestinated firefighter ministry right now not everybody i told you there were probably a lot of people in the days of martin luther protested the catholic church had little uprisings and like that sure and we're not against it but there was nobody with the message that was predestinated right for that hour but martin luther he got that message probably by listening to somebody else but then god spoke and you know they wasn't just sitting back there well we do we have no no no they were studying the bible right and and and all of the people and things but see when god quickened that that was the light of that age that was the salvation of that age all right now when it comes into wesley's time you've got overflows you know not just grew up dropped in you got overflows but in the days of john wesley john wesley taught justification his message was not just well folks we don't need luther no more we're sanctified now looser said you sitting up looser sitting in the pub drinking beer smoking a pie going beyond that days he's lost and gone no no john wesley believed luther's message but god was ready to move on the scene to advance the word the word was going to open and it did so it was just the street so was it with brother brown but now we're in what is called the bride age at every age had a bright age there was a bright age at every age with a bride birth into that message of the age which birthed them out of the age there was no bride ever in an age well they lived yeah we're still living here right here my brother said i'm not from mexico the lady will see him he was bringing the message to the bride this is the bright ages on the sill book he said i call your bride now see then the scripture is pointing down here to something's got to take place well we're just i said we're just sitting here waiting on the bus they got all kind of definitions of what that is i mean this has got to happen that's going to happen this got to be done that's got to be well what if it don't happen right we could be sitting waiting on the bus that don't pull up i mean i just always try to be honest with you with everybody i believe what the prophet said but i want that word revealed into my heart to see who i am because knowing who brother branham was won't save me to knowing who jesus christ was won't save me all right to be able to make a a uh discourse speech and bring him all the way down and bring him right down into a cradle and write out and up over the words that and won't save nobody it's got to be a personal experience in your heart of the baptism of the holy ghost to bring salvation to you benign in other words your words got to be made alive all right and that's part of the word to be made alive here at this time you and i are not to make those others manifest we believe all of the others i was in the funeral brother maloney i think her sister maloney one and the undertaker said by the way what are you i said i'm a method baptized pestering pentecostal he said i'm sure i hate to write that on your death certificate i said i don't intend for you i intend to be changed because that's that's what my my hopes are it's based on it if i'm not don't let me hinder those again but there's a word for every age to be made alive and there's a word for this age if it wasn't for one scripture day without us cannot be made perfect that's right that places somebody into a place a position of what we read that were would it be brother rather said outside of this age of the manifestation of the sons and daughters of god coming to the headstone he said they would bring it to a position to work that would fulfill all the scriptures but in doing that can we see the age we're living that's right that's it we are predestinated on two a place must be reached in this age that adoption comes to full sunshine that they can control nature right here's where we're going to get into it a minute but that's all right where they can do this that or the other right well brother brown wouldn't have done it well if that would be true that would still be enough to make sure the word was made manifest for the age right no problem but we could stand here all afternoon and talk about the things that god has done among us but do you ever put it together to think about that maybe god is with us right i mean we've seen everything in the book in this little building we've had the word of the lord it says it won't rain until i called for it and then i stood right here and told you i said you better roll your windows up because i can't fart and it's coming but see what well brother you think you're probably oh i told you not one i'm a child of god why do you want to go to all junk like that i thought it was for all of them where you trying to make something out yourself i don't have to make nothing out of myself no fella said one time he said ain't no brag it's just facts if i stand here and tell you facts and you've been live with me and can't deny there's one sitting right there that i said he'll come to god i told him i said he'll be a preacher in the pulpit with me see we don't want to look at that well that just lucky guess well i told joyce that danny's coming so that's all about two of them what does he do to everybody because god ain't told me i tell it when he tells me and sometimes i don't even tell you everything he does tell me why because you get built on well brother dale's got it i'm not trying to tell you i got it i'm trying to tell you god's got it but i'm trying to tell you to get out of the thing and then you're you're thinking in your mind well brother branham's only one could do this right around i'm just trying to tell you the truth i'm trying to get you to see the god that's in your life what was it sister brenda you standing there the lord spoke to you about something why can't we play that right you mean he'd do that he only spoke to the prophet what you know the only reason they don't speak to people because they don't believe that's right amen you blame god for not speaking to you maybe you ain't got out of your carnality enough to get where god can speak to you i've never tried to get you to come here on because of signs and wonders that's right i told you about it we had a brother come here from years and i begged god not to do nothing while he's here because all he do is go out and run his mouth and he causes a lot of trouble because sign seekers come running in and then they get pictures want to take cameras they want that you don't try to find a pill or a fire with a drought you're exactly right i don't want you here unless it's a word if it ain't the words you come here for you're going to hinder me and i'm going to hinder you you need money to go somewhere left let me know ahead that's as plain as i can be that means i ain't building up nothing i'm just me and i'm sorry i know i'm not what you think about a pastor i'm the first one to say that but i've done the best i could try to do to show you god amen but i'm trying today to show you this is the time when are we going to believe it's the time why we've been here 40 years after the prophet's gone 40 something years now because we're not ready because we're not believing what god says oh if i could just see you'll never see it right god draws millions of gallons of water out of the ocean every day never makes one sound you didn't go around broadcasting this stuff i mean but there's a word for the age lighted for the age on the earth and somebody has to be here to make that live that's what he says in the feast of the trumpets let's read that in 64 719 in the morning service paragraph 57 sits on your note you remember god is the word and each age has plotted the word for each a he has lotted the word free change that would be on the earth he lighted it in the church ages and the seven seals revealed every bit of it that's right that's what the seals was about right the seals is to reveal and show us the age the time that we're living the position that we're expected to be in right yep you don't have to do anything let god do it amen why i was reading her this morning said i'd like to spend a lot of time she's pentecostals and only pentecost they're always looking for signs and wonders and things get the word first to sign the ones will follow it you don't know what to judge it by if you don't have the word first ain't nobody in the world that don't believe in signs and wonders any more than this man you're looking at because i've told you of the things that god has told me to come to pass amen i've got to believe in him being real i told my wife one day i said i'll quit preaching if something don't happen she said you preached your life certainly i said it'll take place or i'll quit well she had to admit one day it took place right but you see church when are we going to get to the place to believe in where we're standing now and what we're doing well i just don't see it look like we have everybody healed in the building what kind of an idea did you where did you get that from the closer jesus christ got to calvary the worst conditions he lived in the older we're getting the worst conditions is growing in us right right we're expecting to be 100 years old and running around with my 21 glory hallelujah no you know glory hallelujah i'm still alive but that man said that day at work but he's talking something about the candle he said how many catholics are there i said about that time is 500 million he said you mean you're all wrong and you're right i said well i didn't say that the word does he say well how come you're sick i thought for a minute god give me an answer i don't think this ain't dead he was nice enough man he said i'm sorry i shouldn't have said that to you i said well it's just the truth i'm still alive why can't we believe what god is doing among us instead of well i'd like to see the ears we all have to be healed right but the bible says many are the afflictions of the righteous that don't the lord leadeth out of them all the reason we're not healed is because we're not taking it and getting serious all right but you see we get sick and we just oh i was i wonder what happened what have i done wrong you're getting older and your body is deteriorating if you're young right but you see church we're not looking at things as present tense my whole point adoption is your placing into the body of christ right right positionally placing but yet the new birth puts us in the body because we were born kin folks to the devil he had to bring us into the body before you can even speak to us about adoption the natural israelite was born into the family they had proselytes i don't know of any record they adopted proselytes they had proselytes to the religion but yet we're not proselytes we're the sons and daughters of almighty god with a word for the age that we're living the bible is pointing to you and i you want to know what we're here for it's pointing to you and i having predestinated hush us right yes right don't worry about luther's age it's done wesley's age just a street around his message they've got their message and gone off the scene but there's a message for you and i to be living that will not die what about in thessalonians excuse me what about corinthians right the word that you promised not to die now why can't we believe that what is it first corinthians 15 52. we're promised not to die amen well that's when you go out you talk to people and you find out what they believe right you get to talk to somebody and they say yeah the end of the world's here into the world here right yep end of the world we're living in the last day you start talking to them about the real signs well nobody knows a day or an hour maybe 50 years from now maybe 50 years from now let's take place in other words 80 years old and 50 years later they're bound to know they're going to be here nobody wants to think about something living present right the lord's coming well yeah nobody knows today or now maybe 20 years from now maybe maybe no see somebody's going to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye now why can't we believe that right we do mentally right right anyway that's been quoted for 2 000 years right even the man that quoted it never attained unto it right the one that said it but now i believe when he said it it was present tense to him i believe that when he prophesied when a man prophesied in the spirit you know and tells you what god said that don't matter about time elements ages nothing to him that is real as real as it will ever be that's some present tense when god reveals the word to you that is present tense all right you see what i'm talking about another brother said to tell you brother sister outside of this age you know so he must've been talking about us you talking about somebody yeah why can't we believe we're that people and i've always said with him if i can't make it benefit i don't want to stand in the way somebody can't right right i wouldn't believe it if this old boy goes to the grave you can better say one thing about the devil had a battle yeah all right so the boy didn't lay down and said well i'm saying you defeated me and where that man said i want to fight him or something i don't want to bite him on my teeth until he wears out and then i want to gun him to death you just ain't going to give up zachary he's pretty tough now in his age not only big but when the fellow was little you got a hold of him but you better be careful because he didn't believe in giving up and you think you had him he gonna hurt you because he didn't believe in giving up i don't either i don't believe in giving up that's right i give out i don't believe in giving up i want to fight him and do everything because i believe that we're living in the age the word time and eternity is going to meet all right now you're talking about for the world i ain't talking about i'm talking about for the bride of jesus christ time and eternity's got to come together heaven and earth is going to kiss again because it dead back there in a man he said what happened back there is going to happen again but do we believe it all right brother says we're sympathetic with it right there right when i believe the prophet's message but what about this well i don't know about that what do you mean you don't know about it the prophet said show me one thing i've ever denied about what he said that's on the internet that's anywhere well brother dale you don't believe it i didn't say believe it like you do i said you show me where i won't say what the prophet said but you better make sure you know how to say what the prophet said because i'm going to remind you what he did say but listen brothers and sisters there is a time to all things that's ecclesiastes not a time for all things that's yeah no that's not even scriptural there's a time to all things if there's a time to cry there's a time to sleep there's a time to eat there's no there's not a time far because of time for would mean you could eat it anytime you wanted to there's a time too right all right i think this is the time for us to start confessing who we are well i don't want to say it because if i'm not here i'm lying you're lying already amen what's the difference in one lie or the other lie they said the brother brown said run around you told them people as healed he said what did you want me to tell them that's what the bible says he said it's up to them whether they believe it or not amen he said i told him what the bible says amen right but you see we want some kind of a rabbit hat trick that's right we want to look for something and if it don't happen that way one of the kids one time i remember which one might have been a grandchild one of them made a good point out or something sometime it's funny in a way but wouldn't find it but they said papa said you always talking about the lord could come any time he said then you turn around and say this certain thing got to take place well what's your answer i was told i said well anything to take place in hurry things that i said need to take place take place in a hurry because you can't hinder god but you understand my point is this the word comes predestinated eternally when martin luther caught that message for that day of the judge shall live by faith time and eternity met because there was a man standing there that the world was against and satan and everything in the world was against but they couldn't conquer him until he brought his message he said one of the men down through time you know they said don't you know that might have been luther said don't you know the words against thee said i want them to know i'm against them he protested the catholic church which meant excommunication and death that's how much he believed what he does done what about you and i we can't even get to church and live the message and then we want to blame god and then we want to look around i never i've never had any trouble with laity people talking about the message of god always preachers that i have trouble with right my preachers are just dumb enough excuse me to tell you that they don't agree with you but they won't tell you why right or they'll come up with some idea you know we were talking about certain brother yesterday and this brother he boy he was really laying it on up here one time and he said man should see that when joseph was sold in slavery he said first thing it happened said he automatically castrated him because he wasn't going to have servants around the women of you heard that but you didn't pay no attention i said well sure was an odd situation when i got a chance to speak i thought joseph had two or three kids later they must have had some miracle surgery what's up everybody oh look at that look at that that brother brought me up i've never seen that i had neither right cause he wasn't true same one said paul that he was married the apartment said he'd record he had to be married i said i don't give a hoot about the sanhedrin because it's wrong run around said paul was not married took me a while but i found it but is that my answer back to him was i said i guess what we need to do to go home and kill our wives because if we can't preach we get if we're mad we just go kill our wives because paul said be as i am you say that's carnal talking plain no it's plain language because i don't play with the word of god i don't like jokes and things made out of the word of god same man said one time they talked about them deacons and elders said they have to teach he said yeah you got to watch them or have to teach that's playing with the word of god i don't like that the word of god to me is serious i believe what god said he said there was a people and the prophet of god said there's a people predestinated that means god eternally determined that to take pledge that there'd be a group of people standing on the earth they would face death and life at it they'd be changed in a moment in a quick level now we'll get into the adoption and find out the reason we're not to that place is why because the child's behavior is the one that hinders them from coming to adoption amen is that true see then it's probably our misbehavior brother says misbehavior of unconfessed sin and you know his definition of sin i ain't smoking and gambling it's unbelief in god's word see i want to say to you today i believe this day this scripture is here to be fulfilled what that we are facing the depth of natural things and why can't we look at it and see that that all of that means that look at all these storms around look at all these conditions that are happening if you can't see we're in a pre-tribulation you better open your eyes that's right the bible speaks of seven thousand people dying in one thing and that was a great thing two hundred something thousand died in that one great earthquake thing over there look how it's mounting everywhere when they say about japan move 13 or 16 feet toward the united states because of that earthquake what did it do to us everything in the natural you can see me oh look at this the paper says this the paper the bibles well i don't know about that i believe what garner ken armstrong would say i believe what some give a given newscaster some non-wonderful courage paul harvey he ain't working now but you know paul irv he said it you said what the bible said i don't know about that right if i could just see i'd believe it bible didn't say that bible says i believe to see and say i seek to believe that i believe to see listen folks somebody's got to make alive the scriptures for this day well why can't we believe it why can't we say we're the people right right why can't we say the scriptures that we're the people at the end of the world just come upon somebody's got to say it right but we're sitting in our unbelief i'm saying well i don't believe you because i can't see it well you know what you never will see it listen folks if you ever get the new birth as i said it's not a sprinkle of goddesses if you fall down there's ways of going through to get it you're going to have to believe and you're going to have to confess you have to believe you got it confess you got it don't got it right you have to wait till god gives it to you well then that's the way it is in the end time i believe there's a group of people standing here and i'm going to say this and i'll quit because this is the message i've got to wait in the notes forget them anyway see somebody's got to be standing here in the end time and time and eternity is not together together it's gonna have to be the word first that says it because the word don't say it forget it they're having revivals all over the country they're doing all kind of things the prophet of god said ain't no worldwide revival that's right now what's he talking about he's talking about the bride but listen somebody's gonna stand here and say it why can't we start saying time and eternity's got to me that's right all right now if i die and go by the grave i'm not in this scripture i'm fixing to tell you if you're dying going by the grave you're not a part of what i'm fixing to bring okay anybody understand because you can't believe that you can be changed in a moment in 2011. dude you got to go by the grave no disrespects to nobody if i die standing here today don't put over my tombstone he died at disgrace no i was screaming trying to get you to see it if nothing else say he was trying to get me to see it but somebody he's got to look death in the face and say we're done oh boy god's done a reveal to me that i've changed what if it don't take place well what if it does where are you going to be right could i make a big frown or whatever to make you understand what i'm saying you go out there this evening and then you sit down after you say son don't you go down i challenge you son don't you go down you better have your hat to put on dark guns cause it's coming but if god reveals to you that the sun won't go down go out there and say it and it won't go down right right now but if it's our own quotes what is it that's right see that's what everybody bases it on but you see if i'm going to make the change now you don't want to tell your change then you realize and brother gary shake yourself on this one okay you realize i'm standing in the body and in one split second i can be made eternal i don't know how much the twinkling of an eye is and everybody's trying to make it a blink and what the prophet did what who's concerned about how long that is it just simply means in a short period the best one i heard about it was a twinkle in the eye was if you're pro if you're staying with a prophet's message he's your eye that's a good point because you know what he believed in it he believed any second god could come you know what right there was a predestinated group of people that had to come to believe his message that would bring him out of the ground right here but you realize that if if you can just see what i'm talking about if i die i go back to the gases brother brown said not necessarily the same gases but the same 16 elements now what's he saying you know what i'm fixing to say right a line in africa jumps on you bites your head off and chews it up and they throw a dead over him and they throw him on an airplane and they fly into california half your body's in california your head and everything else when he uses the bathroom is in life us in africa the body and the head's in california now what are you talking about that to me is what rudolph was saying not necessarily the same gases but the same elements you return back to the gases but he'll speak and out of the earth to come that body but somebody ain't gonna have to do that somebody's gonna stand here and say i'm changed and it'll take place there's where time and eternity will come together but that's a message in the end time because you're predestinated unto that light in this day because there's more to adoption than just the manifested sons and daughters of god there is a two witness redemption in the body we'll get to that that's right why can't we believe every time an eternity meets you realize if you're not going to go by the grave you're living in the body it's going to be changed come on that's right you're living in the body that's going to be changed and if you go by the grave you're coming back up in the body that you live in the only difference is somebody's gonna stand here not have to die why can't we believe that we're them that's right why can't we say this is what is predestinated unto this age lord let me fulfill that amen that's right that's right let me be what you predestinated me to be and i'm talking about what it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally with the word receipt but what about when the word is eating a person comes together don't you believe that jesus was the word holding up one hand to show you what i'm talking about body at all getting that eternity one day right right and he turned around and he said you destroy this body in three days i'll bring it up right but somebody don't have to say that somebody said i'm changing somebody's predestinated unto adoption now we'll get back to it because he predestinated on the sonship predestinated unto resurrection but why can't you say you're predestinated see this this is the scripture where time and ages must meet it has to always be this way someone will have to confess i am the person that will not go by the grace that's right now jesus said you destroyed this body three days i'll bring it up and he did right right well i can't want somebody to be saying you can't destroy this fight now come on i don't care how many bombs they got headed this way your prophet's done said you're going out here in the rapture for one bald fall he didn't say they come over here and make dirty bombs and sneaky bombs blow height from new york off the map he said before one bomb falls right we're going out of here announced right now seeing people disappeared today here comes these bombs somebody just stand there this is cool and says that you're scared i don't got here yet let's go run word amen mommy run either going to be here in a split second get me out of here you see what i'm talking about in the bible times we talk about people who had this great supernatural faith that they had beliefs they challenged this david killed the buyer of the line the giant etc we can talk about that a lot well why can't we see that they simply was believing something present tense instead of prophesying right like your sister was it said no don't you understand in 30 minutes we're going to be at the bottom of the sea or we'll either be in the harbor she was rejoicing saying glory hallelujah they said why she said i got a daughter over in the harbor waiting on me said i got a daughter in glory in 30 minutes i'll be with one of them what can you do with a person like that that's right you might just sleep alone oh they're fanatic well amen what are you i like the one where brother brown saw the man that thing who had the signs and i'm a fool for christ he said everybody was turning around and looking as a man walked by he said i turned around and looked too and he said on his back said who's full are you now here's my last statement all of those in the bible whoever amounted to anything or anything ever took place either way you want to make it brother branham or lutheran wesleyan or messengers whatever you make it there were people like you and i the people that god had spoke to and him speaking to them i mean it was a predestinated word and they believed it and that brought eternity to them what about it what about it when are we going to start saying who we are instead of saying what the devil says we are the devil says you're sick sam whale what does the bible say let you redeem say so or something like that when are we going to start saying what the bible says well somebody will why can't i sing a part of it i hope you caught what i said a moment ago if you go by the grave don't misunderstand me you're not gonna go by the grave being five foot tall and come up nine foot tall you're gonna come back that body but it can turn back to ashes and gases and things like that but god will speak it right out of the dust of the earth but somebody will be standing there in a body that will be changed that's the message to wit the redemption of our body to understand the redemption of our body when we think we're going to get good enough we think we're going to do some magic thing you know as i told you in the baptist when you paved the parking lot or painted the church you automatically got a trip to heaven they never preached anybody to hell they needed a pervert of all forms but he never went to hell when he died if he painted the church or paid the parking lot yeah but then why can't we say who we are by the word let's stand come into the communion time why can't we believe he said well brother dale if we had what we talk about what we have and people said that if we have what we think we have why ain't things happening open your eyes how long do you want to stay for me to tell you what god has done through this one person that you see that you can't deny it that my blood type was totally changed from a negative to a positive that the lord healed my eyesight went from where i couldn't even shoot a gun with an iron sight because wavy outside and for eight years i wore no glasses and beside that um little zach little black zach's been wearing glasses get him to tell you about it and daddy said zach where's he glasses he said don't need them no more he said i put my glasses on it's all fuzzy he's healed yeah we don't count down what do you need to believe right well i ain't for it happened to me we didn't believe accept it for you it's not just for me right the prophet of god come to speak of a bride right with somebody can be that bride that's right but we look at our own ignorant ideas and try to figure it out there stood a man one day and said the bible promises this the bible promises that he said now i want to tell you this day this scripture is fulfilled right now how many believed there's really not a record anybody believed in that day that's right right right but did that matter to him well nobody didn't believe me lord trump i guess i said it wrong i need to make sure to check up on what to say the next time he said unless you believe that i am he you will die in your sins and i don't believe he is smiling when he says you see we can talk a lot about what's being i'm talking about what's here i didn't do this 40 years ago and i don't do it because 40 years is passed on somebody start got to start saying it we're here and if this is the time to inherit all nature but what's hindering us our childhood training we're not following the training that god wants to give us right think on these things let's read the scriptures with the community and aaron and wade if you would forever received with the lord that which also i delivered unto you that the lord jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this due in remembrance of me after the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the new testament in my blood this dewey is often you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as that as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do shoot the lord's death till he come or for whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily she'll be guilty of the body and blood of the lord but let a man examine himself and show letting me to that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drink of damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you in many sleep for we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened to the world that we should not be condemned with the world where for my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him meet at home did you come not together in the condemnation and the rest will sit in order when i come let's just have a few moments of solid prayer praying one for the other remember the sick among us the things so remember that god wants us delivered we thank you for all things father forgive our sins and lead us by your grace in jesus name now i've had a cold so i don't wanna be afraid i'm gonna let weight break the bread but i know what the human that way sanctify and break family father we pray lord jesus take this bread my lord signifies your body lord it was broken for us lord account father we pray now that you just as we take it lord be a part of our body and lord just take it heal us and help us and make us well forgiveness of our sins bless us in jesus uh i just don't want to deal with hindering nobody father we thank you for this wine that's went through the process lord is to the place now that it gets better each day because it's the top of your blood that we shed for each and every one of us lord as we eat the little piece of bread and we drink the wine it becomes actually blood cells in our body and that way we can live by it lord if we ate enough of it and drank enough of the wine we could we could live but yet we just take this little portion as an example to see these things but you sanctify the wine and the partakers that we may all be one together in you in jesus name amen good morning i'll walk by the river i'll rest me the evergreen i'll carry my cross through the midnight good morning there's glory sometimes i'm despised and rejected and i question oh father then i take one more look at mount calvary and it gives me the strength to go on say them to him and think about it come on sometime between six and nine o'clock the prophet of god said that's the fourth watch of the night that's when jesus appeared on the water the prophet said there's only three watches in the night that's right because six and nine is in the morning it's called fourth watch of the night because it was still dark when sick starts for me come morning just think this is what we'll do at the marriage supper we'll take the communion be a wonderful time morning he said well how long would it take for the lord jesus to pass out bread for billions of trillions of born-again christians sitting down on the table i don't know i don't care because there's gonna be no time oh my god everything's gonna be present tense that's what i'm trying to get you to see there's a present tense gospel there's a believing that's real the day you receive the baptism of the holy ghost was rejoicing period right it was eternity for a split second there and then all at once the devil when he jumps on and says he didn't get it but what does that matter tell him he's alive my wife i didn't get it well if you didn't get it just keep believing until you get it just keep telling the devil he's a liar i don't wanna lie you're born one i don't solve nothing you're not making no great speech to me to say i don't want to lie the bible says by stripes i'm healed it doesn't say if i do this or do that it says buy stripes i'm healed why can't we believe it but why can't we believe that there'll be a change right right why can't we believe that because it will be why can't we believe that we're being changed that's right but i thought the bible said that we were being born again that's right sometimes a process has taken place why can't we believe it when are we going to start believing what god says instead of believing what the devil said you say i i'm healed i'm delivered and you'll go home a whole lot happier why is it when you get sick that you got expected to feel dirty and down and and got to lay around and say i don't know if you're good you'll get over it a whole lot quicker by getting up thursday i was coughing and so congested my wife knew it made me call the doctor to get something all right that's fine we believe in it but yesterday i was working out in the yard with the tractor i could have been laying up in the bed oh i feel so bad and you know what my wife would have waited on me but instead of that she was out there fussing at me there you're sick and out in the yard working cause i ain't gonna lay down you do it you won't get up forgive me let's take he said one of these days brother they'll hit you and you'll lay down well i'll be laying there saying buy stripes i'm healed that's right i miss going to work one day no go ahead my brother wants to testify come on up here don't you don't never know where to tell things from but uh you know i've been looking after her grandson who went over their house one day and then we brought him over to our house two days the last day we were over there and she and i'm not saying this to make nothing out of me or anybody else i'm just i'm just saying it happened and anyhow she said i'm gonna take daniel fever and they got this little thing that's sticking here you sing like at you she got back in the car and opened up she going around through the bag and she says i left that thing at home and the car and the thought went through my mind was now i got to go home and get that thing and take it all the way back over to nickelsville and the thought come to me brother brother said if my pocket knife was laying on the dress right he said and i just called for it in my pocket right all of this happened and then she said here it is and that that bothered me to whether or not it really happened then ain't nobody nowhere knows whether or not that happens or not because it happened and i believe i believe that's happening amen i believe well never happened to me never will you don't believe it wouldn't for you right wouldn't for you that's just easy i'm sorry but it's the truth when are we gonna believe are we going to say what god says and talk about what he does see we can stand here all afternoon and let the rest of you testify the things that god has done right but that's just you know i had that thirty or six that time go off within a barrel of less than six inches of my head and my head pointed towards the tree and the gun leaning against it and i was just that close to it and it went off and bark went come back into pieces and pieces of lead come back in my forehead and i didn't feel a thing i was actually hunting to see if i still together i had enough conscious in my mind i couldn't hear or couldn't feel and i got enough conscious in my mind if the top of my head was gone my hand would fall in and i was expecting it i rubbed across and i looked at it and there was blood little spots i said well that ain't gone let me see if i got the rest of it he said well what'd you do what was it going to do terence was over on a tree over there waiting one and she wanted to sound off today didn't even know that i'd been my gun what was it going to do well i'd been screaming and running to the doctor for what i went on up the tree and hunt i just didn't load my gun until i got up on the tree the next time and i've been more cautious of that and i try not to do it see we see why can't we believe that god is like i told you sitting up on that tree feels like my heart's hurting dying my arms aching all over just like a heart attack satan says i got you i said well lord i just eased back down to the old stands you know she had the hand hook to crawl up and i just slid back down and sit down kind of propped on the stand i said well lord if i go here i'm about 18 feet off the ground i don't have to feel that ground i don't have to worry about it i'm closer to you and i wouldn't be fight down there what does it matter to me what they find and i just sat down pain just started to ease it away i sat there an underdressed leg i'm just a scared brother that scared of what you must not be saved i ain't stupid i ain't walking out here from the train that come down the track nobody's talking about junk i'm just talking about what good would have done me that to run that day and jump down and by by hugging that tree i'd have probably had a heart attack because i had to belly hug it the old days were the stands we had i'd had the belly hugs and rashford to get down 18 feet i'd have probably had one because i'd have been so nervous but instead of that i just said thank you lord you know what are you afraid of the ain't no devil in the world can get you to a goddess through with you do you think he could have stopped martin luther there ain't no way you can't stop this end time bride just say it let's walk into it you don't never say it you can't walk into let's get into the scriptures on the foot wash first john or john 13 verse 2 the sufferer being the end of the devil having now put into the heart of judas it's carrick simon's son to betray him jesus knowing that the father had given all things into his hands that he come from god and went to god he risen from suffering laid aside his garments and took a towel and dirted himself after that he poured water into a base and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with a towel where with he was girded then cometh he to simon peter and peter said unto him lord thus thou wast my feet jesus answered and said unto him what i do that i know it's not now but thou shalt know hereafter peter said unto him thou shalt never wash my feet jesus answered him if i was thee not thou has no part with me simon peter saith unto him lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head jesus said unto him he is worse than it is not saved to wash his feet but is clean ever wit and you are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore said he you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet and had taken his garments and was set down again he said unto them know you what i've done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you verily verily i say unto you the servant is not greater than his lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things
