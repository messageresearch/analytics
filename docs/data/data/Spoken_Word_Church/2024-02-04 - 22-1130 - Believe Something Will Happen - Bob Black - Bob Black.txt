turn there or you can look up on the screen here and we'll just uh speak on a topic something something tonight this uh this the Lord laid on my heart believe something will happen let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word and I pray God as WE peer into your promises Lord Jesus that you'll Quicken them to us Lord to Lord that you'll build our faith Lord God and edify us tonight Lord and Lord we know Lord that we're we're such a needy people Lord God and we have many different needs Lord and sicknesses and ailments and problems in our mind and problems in our bodies Lord Jesus and I pray God that you'll just speak exactly what we have to need what we have need of tonight Lord God Lord to just build our faith up to where we can believe that something will happen amen we ask that you'll Grant it in your name amen so Joshua chapter 10 uh verse verse 12 says then spake Joshua to the Lord on the day when the Lord delivered up the amorites before the children of Israel and he said in the sight of Israel son stand still thou upon gaban and thou moon in the valley of aelon and the sun Stood Still and the moon stayed until the people had Avenged themselves upon their enemies is not this written in the book of jasher so the sun Stood Still in the midst of heaven and hasted not to go down about a whole day and there was no day like that before it or after it that the Lord hearkened unto the voice of a man for the Lord fought for Israel and Joshua returned and all Israel with him unto the camp to gilgal you may be SE to the Lord I his Blessing to the reading of the word now just to kind of set the stage I I I'm going to talk about somebody and the one I'm going to talk about is is this man I I I got to look at what he believes and um some of y'all have listened to him online and read what he uh and kind of talked about uh just listen to what he has to say and he's this preacher out on the west coast called John MacArthur and um he believes that uh well I I I wanted to really he said some things about about miracles and uh how God just don't really work the way that he used to and so I really wanted to dive in and see a little bit more about what he what he really believed and come to find out what he what he's gotten to do is he's he's looked at all the Hypocrites and all the fakers and all of the things he's looked at the ones that said look at my little piece of toast that there's uh it's look it's the face of Jesus and this signifies that I'm something special and look at look at the one he's he's looked at the ones that all these different ones that say uh just just uh dramatic things and he's he's began to like so many so many today even maybe even today in the message began to associate something happening with a hypocrite now brother John M John MacArthur he made a statement he said God had a special purpose for the eras of Revelation back there you know the days of Paul and the days of the Apostles but now he's got a different purpose now just as powerful just as wonderful so he's saying in other words now now we we we we're just we're just about understanding as long as we understand then God's not going to manifest himself so much in Miracles and things the way he did with the early church in other words he's packaging it up with if we could say it another way that the days of Miracles has passed that you're not going to see God move in the way that you did with the early church because what what's he doing he's associating he's associating Miracles with Hypocrites now now now we we maybe let's bring it bring it all down you ask the question do we are we doing the very same thing because you know sometimes you I I think we've we've all uh We've uh sometimes we can look at we we've all heard we've all read the the message anointed ones at the end time and and we know the things that brother brand said about that but then we can we can maybe almost in our mind begin to associate God actually doing anything because we've seen so many Hypocrites and we've seen so many fakers and we've seen so many say I mean come on now let's look at look back in your own life all the ones that you've heard say well I had a dream and that shows me that I should I should do such and such a thing but yet they won't even come to church and I I I've I've I've saw a vision or I've saw saw something but yet they're not matching up with the word and you know they're not living right and we've seen so much fake but you know there really is a genuine and this message came to actually loose to us the supernatural something if you believe something's going to happen and when that something happens don't look at it and say don't look at something happening when somebody comes up to you and tells you a testimony of God actually doing something in their life and changing a situation and their family don't look at it with critical eyes but I I I I believe that God wants us now and in this hour to begin to realize that miracles do happen that God is a god of Miracles God is a god of Miracles a miracle that God can change your life do you realize that it's a miracle that God can change your life it's a miracle that God can come down and move into people and and worship and change their worship to where they're not all St and stiff anymore but to where God is actually moving in their moving in their lives it's a miracle that God can take a young person that's got a nicotine addiction and take away that habit from them in a day so where they don't want nicotine anymore it's a miracle that God can come down in a service and speak a word to somebody that that begins to where they catch something and a tumor will fall off it's a miracle that God can deliver somebody from kidney disease it's a miracle that God can deliver somebody of a migraine and take that away from them you see God is a god of Miracles and if you believe something's going to happen you look down through all the Old Testament and all the New Testament and of all the people that believe if you go read Hebrews 11 which is what we're about to get to in Sunday school if you go read every one of those testimonies of faith when they believe something happened they were given a baby or their their health was restored or their life was restored or God came on the scene and fought their battles and that same God that fought their battles is here on the scene to find your battles at work when your boss don't love you your wife don't love you or husband don't love you or your kids have turned away from you that God is still a miracle working God God is still on the scene to work a miracle now you see what John MacArthur didn't understand doesn't understand today that the days of Miracles has not passed and he's what he's got he's got all CAU up looking at the false but you see this afternoon if we'll just get away from looking at the faults and looking at one another and wondering why God don't heal that one over there that we're looking at if we'll just keep our eyes on Jesus and believe something is going to happen how many of this afternoon wants something to happen in your life how many wants to see God move in your life something will happen sometimes we just think that Miracles have Out Of Reach sometimes we think God has left us that God has moved away from us that God ain't here sometimes we get we get cabbaged down and we think well it's just good enough as long as I know the message but I don't want to just know the message I want to live the message I want to live as so much that other see Christ Living in me to see that God has done something in my life life and brother said that's the way when we come into Christ is something just seems a little bit high like Miracles like God actually doing something Step Up In The Gospel ranks and find out what belongs to you I believe tonight maybe if we can just grasp what belongs to us that God is still a god of Miracles that he still Jehovah J that that same God that spoke a ram into existence next to Abraham is still able to speak a miracle in your life tonight God's got a step ladder that reaches Plumb into Glory Jacob saw it one night with angels coming up and down from Earth to Glory it's all yours God's provided it for you just get on it tonight and climb right on out of this Earthbound people here that says the days of Miracles are passed we are not Earthbound people we are heavenbound people filled with the Holy Ghost climbing the ladder to Glory going to Glory everything along the road belongs to us to us Everything Jesus died for belongs for us I'm still looking for paradoxes tonight I'm still expecting something to happen how could you not expect something to happen if you can look into God's word and see that everything that Jesus died for you belongs to you I think that's what Joshua was doing when he spoke when he spoke and the moon stood still over there and the sun stood still over there he got a glimpse that everything everything God had promised belongs to him he was sitting there in the promised land going on the way to the promised land and he knew that all those promises were his and if we could grab asked that tonight that all these promises laying here in the word are ours something is going to happen brother if you go look and find how many times that brother Brown said something happened he said it 556 times all of a sudden something happened in a real cool feeling went through her and she began to cry and the sister in the prayer line something happened there in the church one night he said God bless you something happened then didn't it something happened as asn't it you're healed sister he told a sister something happened then when I said that didn't it there's something happened here a new creature was born he said in another place and 556 times he said something happened why because somebody got to believe in somebody walked through the prayer line and got to believe and somebody sat in the congregation and got to believe and somebody began to accept God's word and got to believe it and something happened and when you believe something will happen too don't be afraid for something to happen people around the message have got to they got to thinking that it's good we just cabbage down and we think we think we've got it because we understand things but I got to see it lived in me listen it's not the anointing it's not the anointing that makes you a hypocrite we get so scared we got so spooky of the anointing sometimes just like the the the disciples there on the water when they saw Jesus walking toward them it's not the anointing that makes you a hypocrite are we afraid of being a hypocrite sometimes because the anointing comes because God gets to move it in the people it's the seed that you have received that makes you a hypocrite you receive either the word of God or the serpent seed you receive either of those two seeds and hold it in your heart and that's what makes you a hypocrite but we need God God to move this gospel was given so that something would happen it was given so that something would happen don't be afraid of something happening when something happens in the church don't look at it a scance and say well I wonder if that's really true I want something to happen in my life you know from the very first gospel sermon that was ever preached there on the day of Pentecost when Peter come down them Steps From The Upper Room and begin to Proclaim what had happened something happened the very first sermon produced something happened the Holy Ghost fell on all them that were filled outside the Holy Ghost fell on them in the house of Cornelius when the word was preached to them the word didn't just go and laying on the ground it didn't go and just return void but it actually accomplished something something happened when they believed it and that's what a paradox is it's a paradox when something Incredible without a reasonable explanation happens that's what a miracle is a paradox is a miracle when something incredible happens when a tumor falls off when your migraine leaves you I remember one time brother Harris years ago was sitting there in the back of the church and he took communion and something happened and he began to run through the church because his back was healed how many of you could remember all the things in your life where you saw something happen because you believed because somebody believed when something it seems incredible yet it's true that's what a paradox is a statement that is seemingly contradicted or opposed to Common Sense and yet it's perhaps true it's a paradox that God can take away a nicotine addiction it's a paradox that somebody could that God can deliver a young man from wanting to smoke marijuana every day and every night that that God can deliver somebody from being lazy bones and not wanting to go to work that God can change your character to where you you didn't want to go to church but now all you can do is read the Bible that you can't tear yourself away from it somebody that didn't couldn't take the time to read a long book but now you want to read all the message books you can and that's a paradox it's incredible when the chains come off it's incredible when you're delivered it's incredible when you see somebody that's been in change of pornog graphy that they can't get away from it they don't know what to do and when God delivers them it's a paradox it's a paradox when Freedom comes it's a paradox when Freedom comes to your home it's a paradox when he comes and visits you by your bed at night and all the despair is taken away it's a miracle when you can worship God the way you God intended you to [Applause] do and brother R will say a paradox then would be the same as a miracle a paradox would been something that seems like it just couldn't be the knowledge of the human mind is altogether incredible but yet it's proven true a miracle will be the same thing for a miracle cannot be explained a miracle is something that happens and you cannot explain it that makes it a paradox it's incredible but yet it's the truth and I believe this afternoon we believe we serve a miracle working god let's Elevate our faith let's climb up that ladder to the thing that seems like it's impossible because we we serve a God that's going to change our bodies and how can you how can you have faith for a body change if you can barely believe for a toothache God wants you to elevate your faith come up a little bit higher until you can believe that all things are possible to them that believe God is able to heal you if you've been sitting on that sickness for 6 months or six years it don't matter to God God is still a miracle working God you know how I can believe that he's a miracle working God because I'm a miracle ever born again believer in here is a miracle it's a miracle that God plucked you out of the Wayside and changed your heart and change your life and if you're not born again this afternoon God can make you a miracle too cuz he's still a miracle working God all you got to do is just sit there and open up your heart to him just crack that door open a little bit let him come in let him come in and believe and he'll begin to change you he'll come in and Tabernacle himself and make a miracle out of you so that everybody will look at you and say something has happened to that person something has past my understanding past my intellectual understanding I don't understand how that person that used to cuss and swear and live in the world and love the things of the world now has been changed Something's Happened to him brother B said I believe that every Born Again member of the body of Christ is a paradox in themselves I believe I believe each one of you Methodist and Presbyterian and Lutheran that never had experienced the baptism of the Holy SP Holy Spirit was in some formal church that did not believe in the genuine New Birth and has now received the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a perfect example of a parag paradox because something happened to you something happened to you oh you don't have to raise your hand but how many in here can say I remember when something happened I remember when the Holy Ghost came into my life and it wasn't just something in my mind but it was something that changed my heart and quickened the word that I held in my heart to me something happened to you that change your whole bu being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle something happened something happened when Jesus was standing outside Lazarus grave and he spoke and Lazarus came forth something happened when Peter walked on the water to Jesus Jesus wasn't just look Peter wasn't just looking and saying well I'm fine sitting here in the boat but he wanted something to happen and he stood up and he got out of the boat when nobody else would something happened on the day of Pentecost when they were filled with the Holy Ghost it's a miracle that the Holy Ghost can take a sinner and change them something happened something happens when you take God at his word and believes if you believe something is going to happen I want to challenge you tonight to take God at his word and see if something won't happen take him at his word take him at his promises and say if you can clothe a spar if you can clothe a Lely I know that you're going to put money in my bank account I know that you're going to provide for me if I don't have a dime you're going to take care of me cuz you can take care of the Lily and you take care of the trees and you take care of the earth you can take care of your bride how many oh can't we look into the confidence of God into God's word with that kind of confidence and know that he's there for you to know what access you have access to the promises it's a miracle how that God can take a man's thinking brother Ram said and his ways and his life and everything and change it from what it was to what it can be what he can make it to what what it can be what he can make it all you think about to what it can be to what it can be not probably ever born again Christian in here is you you your confession would probably be I ain't where I want to be oh but think what God wants you to be what it can be what your life can be and there's a miracle working God is still on the scene to make your life what it can be wherever you are in life if you're living in sin if you're bound in change of this world oh think what God wants your life to be that he wants to make you a miracle he wants to make you a miracle out of you but you would have to agree brother said it's a miracle that God can take someone from the world and change them to be like him and what changed you was not just an intellectual conception it was a power to change your life oh can't you just look in your look at your own background and think sometimes we think maybe we the devil come and maybe give us thoughts where you you understand these things because it's all in your mind and you act this you're you're like this way just because just it's something natural no it's supernatural something Supernatural taking place oh you you couldn't understand the things that others prob at you couldn't understand these things unless something Supernatural had happened you couldn't live this Christian Life unless something Supernatural had taken place in you there there a miracle working God that's doing something brother B told that story of the young German man who was that little boy who was dishonest and he was so dishonest he he could he just couldn't apologize and he worked himself up in his intellectuals to try to to try to act like it and try to fake it and brother R said that was a fine young man very fine boy he was going with a little girl very fine little girl out of a fine family and this boy all of a sudden came up with some kind of an idea and he just walked away he did something wrong to the little girl and much as promised her to do a certain thing and then didn't do it and instead of coming to the girl and apologizing like a gentleman should do he it just wasn't in him to do it he wasn't equipped his character hadn't been changed oh you see what a supernatural thing it is for you to be able to apologize for you you to be able to love somebody enough where you can go over to them and say I'm sorry instead of just holding it up and well I well I don't care I'm spining around in your mind until you're the right one it's a supernatural thing to be able to love one another it's a supernatural thing to be able to lay down your life to love somebody else the same way that you love yourself to bear with one another to look at somebody else through God's eyes and this young man wasn't equipped brother said the boy was a Christian as far as a Believer he had repented and been baptized and had his position among the Believers but yet had not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit no ma no no matter how much he thought he had I I I I I I think maybe we could just dwell on that a second that you know the Holy Ghost is going to change you it's going to do something it's it's going to it's going to produce an effect in your life and we can sit in church and and act like it all act like we're we're changed but if God hadn't really done a supernatural work in your life you'll never be able to act the way a real true genuine Christian acts because you won't be able to love and you won't be able to forgive and you won't be able to bear with one another and you won't be able to repent the way that a Christian can you won't be able to you won't be able to kneel beside your bed and say forgive me of all those wrongs that I've done and you won't be able to do you won't be able to do it because it's a supernatural miracle in the life of a born again believer where God has actually wrought a wrought a a change in your life when you're born again you see you see if you just if you're just going at home and you got to if listen if you got a tnder account you ain't born again if you got a if you don't know what a Tinder account is and just chalk it up to Grace if you don't if you got a Tinder account and you're going around from house to house you ain't born again if you'd rather be at the pool hall or The Honky Tonk or down at the racetrack instead of church you ain't born again if you love that worldly music beat you're sitting in Walmart and you say well I I like I think I'm going to get go sit in the car and listen to that a little bit longer you ain't Born Again cut your music rock music songs about adultery that don't have no place in a Christian's life why because a Christian is going to be changed a Christian is going to be a changed being oh I wish we could get away from that eye that the new idea that the new birth is just some private thing that you you just get alone and you you say well I I I know I'm born again and it's I'm just going to keep this to myself no listen when you're born again you go into that holy of holies you coming out and what are you coming out to do you coming out to share it with the rest of the church and the rest of the people that you work with you coming out to share it with the with the ministers and everybody's going to know whether you got the Holy Ghost I think sometimes we kind of shy away from that that everybody is going to know whether you got the Holy Ghost the whole world knows if you're born again they might not call it born again but the whole world is going to know whether or not you're born again you know what that's what brother Brown said he said you won't have to go around testifying this that or the other if you're a real lover of the Lord everybody you come in contact with will almost know it you are written Epistles you're sealed and a seal is on the backside the same as on the front side both going and coming people know that you're a Christian you walk different live different act different you are different when you become a Christian how many could agree tonight that when you that you're different when you become a Christian you're going to address different you're going to put away all them worldly things you're going to love the you're going to love the Lord you're going to love reading his word you're going to act different and do different but you see in this case in this little German kid his daddy said it was okay and brother BR said the father raised up and said my son went to the altar he was baptized correctly in the name of Jesus Christ and water baptism in the pool and said I know my son has come to Christ you see what he was doing he was relying on his natural father to tell him whether or not he was born again God don't want you to rely on your natural anything to tell you whether you're born again he don't want you to rely on a minister in a prayer line to tell you whether you're born again he don't want you to rely on your mama and daddy to tell you whether you're born again you got to hear from your heavenly father to know whether you're born again your Earthly birth is all messed up and you're that voice that Earthly voice can't tell you whether you're born again or not but that Heavenly voice is going to tell you you wait till you hear that voice of the heavenly father to confir to confirm your birth in Galatians 4:6 it says that when you come forth with your new birth you come forth you're going to come forth crying AB a father why because you don't recognize your mama where you come from with your natural birth anymore but you now you come forth the first thing you come forth you you see when you come forth from your your spiritual birth as your father you begin to recognize that you got a personal relationship with him and you know where you came from you know your heavenly father oh if we could just wait to hear from God to speak to us whether or not we're born again then waiting for somebody to go give us the Glad hand of fellowship and or give us a ad boy on the back of the back and say well I think you got it no you you need to sit by the bed and pray and cry a little bit and find out whether find out whether God has really accepted your faith or not find out whether God has really quickened the word that you think that you've held brother said I said that may be all right all the outward emotions he might be identified as a Believer with the Believers but until he is regenerated born again I'd advise that young man to never marry a woman excuse me he'll make hell on Earth for her until that gentle sweet forgiving Spirit of Christ comes in oh my to think that without the new birth marriage would be hell on Earth to think that without a change in your life marriage would be hell on Earth without the new birth you can't forgive without the new birth you can't express right right oh that's that's the path the peace if you want peace in your home and peace in your marriage get get closer to Christ you know we talked about Oneness so much and if if so so many I think have gotten confused that if we can just agree with one another then we'll be one but no let's agree with Christ I want to agree with Christ if I can get into him then we'll begin to agree with one another he's the main thing without the new birth you can't express Christ without the new birth without the new birth everything just becomes chaos that's what brother Brown said then with that then that will be a paradox in itself to take the very nature of a boy that's bred between father and mother and yet in his intellectuals he is trying his best to overcome it he can't do it oh you see why it's a miracle now it's a miracle because you can't you can't in your own self you can't overcome it how are you going to get away from that pornography demon how you going to get away from adultery and fornication and the lust of Flesh and the pride of life how you going to get away from that suicidal demon that makes you tries to get you to cut yourself or how you that listen there's a long list of things that we could unroll that how you going to get away from that the only way you're going to get away from it it's got to be a supernatural work it's got to be a miracle that's what I believe I believe in a miracle working God and if you need a miracle tonight there's a God that's ready to give you your miracle if you need Freedom tonight there's a God that's ready to step on the scene for you right now and give it to you he said he'll never overcome it Christ will have to overcome it when he lets Christ in then he's already overcome then it'll be a perfect Paradox when a man is born of the spirit of God this takes the Miracle of Life to overcome your Earthly genes you know that's what the the new birth is doing is actually changing your character it's correcting your Earthly birth it's correcting it everything that's wrong with your Earthly birth it's correcting it it's correcting that temper it's correcting that lack of patience it's correcting all those things all the way the things that you didn't act right the way that you couldn't treat somebody right it's correcting that and changing it and it's a paradox that God can take your old carnal horrible nature and change it to be like him that God can make a stubborn person understanding somebody that cabbages down and say I ain't going to listen to nothing that that preacher tells me I ain't going to listen to that I don't care whether it's truth or not I ain't going to listen like like Cain almost that God could take somebody like that and make them understanding and make them patient and loving that God could take a quick temper person and make them patient and kind somebody that's got a temper like a bug saww God can make an evil hearted man somebody like that man that was ready to kill that little that little dough in front of brother BR and make them loving and sweet nature oh tell me that ain't a miracle that's a miracle that God can do that and we I'm looking at a lot of Miracles sitting here tonight that God can bring an Unapologetic heart up to the altar that God can make an hard-hearted man come to a place where they apologize and repent you know that's a miracle somebody with a old cold stonny heart that don't want to listen to nothing about the gospel and the gospel can soften it up to where they you see tears falling down their face and hands lifted up ready to receive his word that God Can Make A Hard Hearted Woman come up to the altar oh we need the new birth we need a Miracle we need a paradox in our life that God is a god of paradoxes oh the new birth is your foundation you it's everything to a Believer it's the foundation of your Christian walk it's the foundation of your life it'll be the foundation of your marriage that's why brother Brown told George Smith you can get engaged to her to Rebecca but you can't but you need to get born again before you get married why cuz you need a character change if you want to have a successful marriage if you want to have a successful anything you need a character change right you need a miracle in your life it takes God to bring a miracle but we've got a God that can change things oh come on now let me meddle a little bit now listen listen if if the Holy Ghost changes your character your Earthly character to Heavenly if it corrects it if it's correcting all that and see what good are all these horoscopes and things what good are all these astrology things because at best a horoscope is looking to your natural lineage at best you look up in the sky and say well I got my temper I got my temperament or whatever from my mom and daddy because I was born on this certain day or whatever because the the the I it was it was uh 3:00 in the afternoon when I was born or whatever it was and you look up and you can see maybe you can chart maybe if there at best if there is any value in a horoscope it'll tell you some insight into your natural birth but I ain't concerned with my natural birth I want to look up to the heaven you know brother R said in the stars is every person in the Bible was written in the stars but not the way a horoscope is written because the the B the the Stars tell you tell you the whole journey of redemption from Christ coming at Virgo at the to the Virgin all the way to the Aquarius the water Bearer I'll pour out my spirit on All Flesh all the way to his return at Leo the Lion and if you can identify yourself in that star and those Stars that's what I where I want to be identified at I want to be identified in a change life not some not my carnal history not my not where I came from in my Earthly Journey but I want to be identified in Christ brother said I've seen critics stand off and make fun and carry on of a holy ghost Revival and after a while god get a hold of that same man and change him and here he stands right in the Pulpit preaching the same thing that he once hated it's a paradox how that God can take the unbeliever and make a Believer out of it something happened to you that changed your whole being and anyone could look at that and know what a paradox is a miracle oh you think about that that anyone could look at your life and know that that's that's got to be a miracle oh we could go around the room and tell all the testimonial about where you came from and and and and the and the and the and the places that the devil got us from in life and surely you know doesn't that build your faith to know that you can't be in the place that you're in right now if God hadn't wrought a miracle in your life and he a if he's able to do all that think about what he's a where he's able to take you from here if he's able to take you from there to here surely he's able to take you from here to a body change if we'll believeing because if you believe something's going to happen something's going to happen brother said if God ever gets a hold of an individual there was there's something that will control their emotions to the word something that will cause them to Humble themselves to a m to the word it's a miracle to see your son or daughter of God surrendered to the word and changed by the word everything every the word is holds everything together the word is what holds your life together the word is what holds the cosmos together you all you see what I'm building up to cuz the cosmo the all the stars and the planets were standing there and it was held together by the word and Joshua took a step back and said I believe God's word and if God's word is able to hold it together God's word is able to move it God's word is able to keep it still God's word is able to control it this a paradox the word the word holds everything together in Hebrews 113 it says through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which were seen were not made were not made of things which do appear the the worlds were framed by a miracle brother said how it stands in space so much we can say to that take hours upon it but we find out here that Joshua stopping the sun now that's a paradox right it's a paradox but God did it anyhow what by a man not a God not some great angel coming down from heaven a man with faith in the mission that he was given to take that land the word of God was behind it I give you this land and everywhere The Souls of your foot Shall Set upon that I give you it's yours footsteps meant possession now that's a great story for Joshua now but you can have that same that same power in your life if you look into God's word and say that God I know God has given me this land I know God has promised me my children I know God has promised me the baptism of the Holy Ghost I know that God has promised me adoption because this is the season for adoption this is a season for somebody to come to a Capstone Revelation this is the season for it and I know I know God has Pro come on now let's look into the word and accept your promises accept your benefits whatever the word says you can have you can have it if you believe it cuz God is the god of Miracles and he wants you to he wants you to ask for difficult things don't you remember that quote brother said do God don't want you to ask for simple things he wants you to ask for hard things he wants you to ask to feel to help you with that with that car payment that you're struggling with he wants you to ask to to grow up the statue for a perfect man he wants to ask for you to ask him to take away all that stuff that you've been struggling with the achievement he was trying to do brother say see his enemy was routed and he knew if the Sun ever set them Kings would get together and they'd come back upon him with double forces so the son was going down and Joshua a man commanded to do this said Son stand still why cuz he was looking at the enemy and he said I know that God wants me to defeat this enemy and his word has promised this we're going to the promised land aren't you going to the promised land sitting here tonight you're on your way to the promised land so don't let no don't let any devil stand in your way any devil get in your way and tell you you can't overcome that it ain't for you cast down reasons cast down imaginations cast down every vain thought cast down everything that the devil throws at you brother ra said whatever God did I don't know but the sun Stood Still the moon over aelon because a man a human being a human being was in the line of duty how you going to be in the line of duty this afternoon you get in the word because the word is his will and the word shows you what God wants done and if you know what God wants done if you know that his promises are to you and that you've got access to it that something is bound to change because you're in the line of duty just like Joshua was you begin to speak the word just like Joshua did because you know what the word says you begin to speak it you begin to speak it beside your bed at night you begin to speak it behind the steering wheel in your car as you drive to work you begin to speak it in the morning when you rise up when the sun's coming up behind the hill but over the hill because you know what God wants done come on now it's adoption time God wants children of God that know what he wants done with the word how many needs a change this afternoon how many wants a miracle God is looking for somebody that he can use like Joshua he's looking for somebody that'll get in the line of duty and Joshua knew he was in the line of duty he had a reason brother R said of course you got to have a reason for it you can't have faith unless you got some kind of reason as I tried to say last night some people's faith is in their textbook some people's faith is in something else but depends on where your faith is sometimes we doubt the reason that God's given we look in the Bible and we read that we've got a benefit package and we think well I don't know if God's going to forgive my iniquity I don't know if he loves me enough to heal all my diseases but it's laying there in the word if you can just believe it if you can just believe it then the god of Miracles will come upon the scene and do something he something is going to happen his will shows the reason brother BR said I want to believe God's word what he says is true then I've got to see whether it's his will or not despite all the other influences despite what my eyes can see I want to see what his will says about it and his will is his word in Matthew chapter 6 he said Jesus said to pray like this thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven in Matthew 7: 21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of My Father which is in heaven and we've got his will we've we've got his will because his will is his word in Psalm chap 33 it says the counsel of the Lord his word standeth forever the thoughts of his heart to all generations so if you'll just stay with his will something's going to happen sometimes it's kind of hard to stay with his will like that Prophet there in the Bible that that that God told him to go over here and speak a speak a word I think it was the prophecy about Josiah in the Bible there and he he told him don't you turn to the right or to the left you just keep on going and God t him a little bit he told another Prophet to go tell that tell him tell him turn aside he said unto him I am a prophet also as Thou Art and an angel spake unto me by the word of the Lord saying bring him back with thee into thine house that he may eat bread and drink water but he lied unto him see you don't deviate to the left or the right you stay right with God's word and sometimes that's a hard lesson for us to learn that you got to ignore all the other influences in your life but you have to look straight to God's word I was talking to somebody recently about you know when I started preaching you know You' hear this one preacher over here say I can't preach unless I'm nervous when I'm when I stop being nervous then I'm going to stop preaching and then you hear this other preacher over here say well I never get nervous and so that's the way you got to do you got to if you don't if you get nervous you you can't preach and so you now you got those two opposing things so which is right well listen you got to have your own experience you got to find out what works you everybody's got to fight you look you look into the word for your own self and you have your own experience because you can't rely on anybody else's experience listen when your friend says it ain't worth it you just keep your eye right on the word when your family says you can't be healed and everybody that you know says it ain't going to work for you you keep your eyes right on the word of God oh when a minister says you can't be saved maybe because of some circumstantial thing that they think that binds you from being saved maybe because you maybe because your mother and father weren't married when you when you were born or whatever all this nonsense that's going around when a minister says you can't be saved you cast that aside and you look straight to God's word oh when the internet says it can't be true you cast it aside and you just stay straight with God's word I was reading one of them articles the other day just because I I kind of like doing that as a Pastime just to see so I know what they're saying I I'm I'm not afraid I I wouldn't encourage everybody to do that but listen there's it's I anyway my point I was reading one of them things where they were where they were telling a story about brother brandom and and I was reading I was and I and they were just casting in a terrible light and I don't remember all the details of the thing right now at this particular moment but I I went and I started to research it for myself and everything that they said was lies everything they said that brother Bram said that this that he was saying that uh it was what he what they were saying was that he had said that that uh Hatty R little girl that was in that wheelchair that brother R spoke healing in her and she died in that wheelchair you go back and see what brother R said he never he said if if the Lord told me to say it if the Lord told me to say it I would seek it speak it but he never spoke healing over her he he and if if he did if he would have she'd have come out of that wheelchair but he never did it the way that they said see they're telling lies and you got to go if oh that's why we need the fivefold ministry cuz a fivefold Ministry go search that stuff out and study it and make it easier on you make it easy so you don't get fooled by all this nonsense and somebody a lot of people just get fooled because they they just don't they they're not U how can you say it that that they're not capable of studying or whatever whatever you want to say but there's a fivefold Ministry that'll study it out for go ask somebody if you're if you're getting if if you're getting swayed by all these all this nonsense that people say because it's lies it's a bunch of Lies it's lies about the bridge that's why I don't even like saying well if you could tell me that brother brandom did do something wrong I'm still going to believe because brother brandom didn't do those things that he said that they did he didn't go go sleeping around he didn't he he said the right thing about how many fell off those Bridge everything that he said was correct everything that he said was correct you can't if you just keep your eyes on Christ keep your eyes on his word keep your eyes on his will and don't look at nobody else keep your eyes straight on him and brother said in the message perseverance you must first find the will of God before you can do the will of God you must first know what his will is in the matter and then don't turn it loose and the token he said he cannot go contrary to that word he has already purchased your desire if it's according to his will and his will is to heal his will is to give you your desire his will is to work a miracle in your life his will is to change you to make you like him then if his will I got to check out my objective to it and then my motive in doing it if I do it brother R said because I say well I'm going over the mountain here there's a mountain before me there's a million people on that side perishing I got a 100 million over here I'm preaching to well if I can't get over around or under the mountain or nothing and yet something in my heart keep telling me go over the mountain go to them go to them they can't get over it now Jesus said they shall move this mountain oh you see if you got the right motive if you're asking for the right thing and not because you want to get rich not because you want people to pay you money not because of popularity brother said what what if I say no I don't care about the money but when I get over there someday the ages to come they'll put up a great big Monument say brother Brown I'm the great missionary and still my motive is not right oh popularity is what get so many to the side amen I I won't preach against sin so I'll get more likes I won't preach against sin so I'll get more adab boys what what does it matter how many views we get on the internet what does it matter how many messages we get about how good we preached oh you just you got to put you got to put the good in the bad up on a on a little shelf don't don't let the things say that people say about you have have nothing to do with your whe it what people say has nothing to do with whether you're successful or not you know how you'll know you're a success on the when you go beyond the curtain of time and Jesus says I well done thou good and faithful servant when you hear well done and thou th good that's what I want to hear we're not preaching for adab boys we're not trying to get likes and and all those things but brother R said when I don't care if they ever know he went over there he's just in my heart then I'll speak to to that mountain it'll happen see it's got to see your motive and your objective depends on who you are and what business that's where the church misses it so far they get worked up in an emotion and first thing you know an enthusiasm you don't stop to check it back here again check there for sure then it's thus sayith the Lord if you got the right reason the right objective and you know you're in the will of God something is bound to happen amen something's going to happen oh you think about that tonight when you go home if you got a right reason for the for for what you're praying for if if you got a right if you're praying for your kids to do well in school you got a right reason if you're praying for the right objective if you're praying for a good Godly spouse a good Godly husband that'll be aead over your family a good Godly wife that'll raise your children right that Mountain's going to move God God's got to do something Moses had a commission to bring those people out of Egypt Joshua had a commission to go over and take that land and God caused the Great par Paradox and you got a commission you know what a commission is a commission is constitutes documentary Authority that the person named is vested with the powers of that office and is empowered to execute official acts like an officer in the Army get a commission you can go and you're fighting and making decisions on behalf of the country that you live in and if you've got a commission what is your commission our commission as ministers is go into all the world and preach the gospel and cast out devils and signs and wonders are going to follow that's our commission that the that you preach the word it's going to have an effect and you've got a commission your commission is it's written to go speak and go forward your commission is all these things laying here in the Bible the trouble of it is today brother R said the churches speak look like say what did Moody say what did sanki say but what did God say speak and say what God said let's go forward not look back but go this way amen and it was a paradox when Noah preached the word to a scientific age and Noah had a commission what was his commission destruction is coming get in the ark oh you see what a what a paradox that was when Noah began to preach and he preached and he preached until finally rain came and they didn't know where the rain came Noah preached to an intellectual world like we're preaching preaching to now Noah preached to a world that would sit there and say well I don't believe that God is able to do it a world that was so intellectual in their conception that they failed to believe that God was still a god of Miracles Noah preached that to a day when they were farther advanced in science than we are now you think about a day where they could build the Great Pyramid and move those great blocks and had all those great scientific advancements and Noah was preaching in that day when nobody wanted to listen to him preaching about something that they could prove by their science they could look up and say well there ain't no rain in the heavens say it like this there ain't no going to be no body change how's God going to change your body how's God going to perform a change oh you see what God's Building us up to if God can change us from there to the here God is going to change us from here to there God is going to change because God is a god of Miracles you see it's time it's time to get in the ark and what is the ark the ark is this message that we've heard a message that's going to transform us from that Old World that old carnal world into a new world a new place a new a new situation where we step out into a body change y'all they got in that Ark and they they went from they went from point B A to point B all right they saw the water come and wash away all their troubles wash away all that carnality wash away all those people that didn't believe and wash away all those people living in sin and and mocking and but they were screaming on the doors when those when that when God shut the door thank God you see thank God for a message of Grace a message of Grace that we've heard it was a message of Grace that Noah was preaching to come get in the ark destru destruction is coming get in the ark and it's a message of Grace that we've heard if we if we hadn't received this message from God you think about we like the Bible says we'd be blind leading the blind it was the blind leading the blind until we heard this message that God has given to us we didn't know we wouldn't have known what to do we wouldn't have known how many gods there were if God was in three people people or or one we wouldn't have known we we wouldn't have any how to be baptized how to dress that how to be healed how to receive the new birth we would have been like the blind leading the blind but we've heard a message of Grace and you see why we're not lifting up men we're not lifting up a man but we're lifting up a message to say thank God for the grace of God that come down in our lives Noah was the only one to have the word in that day Noah only had the word of the Lord in the face of all all of their science in that day Noah was the only one in that day that have the word against all their instruments Noah had a revelation of the will of God and you think about who's got the word in this day there's only one place one Arc one door you can go through one place that you can hear the message of Grace to get in that Ark oh think about a miracle you talk about a miracle a miracle that you're sitting here how many people have you tried to witness to and just talked about things just at a B basic level and they just can't see it but you heard it and you believed it and you're sitting here it's a miracle that you're sitting here it was a miracle that eight people were in that Ark with all the millions sitting outside it was a miracle that the FL that the door shut on and no one no one didn't know how to shut that door he he built that door and I imagine him looking up at that door is too big I don't have the instruments to shut this thing I I can't I can't lever it into place I don't know and he went to sleep one night and woke up the next morning and God had shut that door and it was a miracle and everything in Noah's life was a miracle when the rain fell on the on the day that it fell it was a miracle after all maybe his family sitting up there began to doubt and everything wondering if the message was really true and the rain began to fall and be they begin to hear the thunder claps and the the screams on the outside as people began to beat on that Ark and it was a miracle it's a miracle as as that Arc carried him around the earth and the door opened on the other side of the of the globe or wherever they were on Mount AA and now they came into a new world and all because that Noah had a revelation of the will of God he knew it was going to rain oh you think about the place you're sitting in right now he knew destruction was coming he knew the way of escape and he knew he was going to build an ark he had his commission oh you see now you got your commission your commission to build your commission you know the way of Escape you know the cast stones got to come you know the only way out is this message he we know that destruction's coming because that's what Malachi 456 says that there's got to come Elijah before the great and Dreadful day of the Lord there's got to come you say you say well I wonder if this message is true then tell me what that scripture means tell me what Revelation 10 means if it matters to you tell me what Luke 17:30 means if it matters to you they never had rain but Noah said it's going to rain the water was on the the Earth not in the skies they can take an instrument and prove there was no water there but Noah said it's going to happen anyhow see and it rain see it don't matter how many aches and pains there are in your body if your knees are popping one of my daughters told me the other day Dad I can tell when you're coming up the stairs cuz I hear your knee pop but see that don't matter that don't matter because it's going to happen anyhow our bodies are going to be changed there's a God of Miracles if God has brought us from there to here God is able to change our bodies he said that was a paradox SE something that could not be explained but God shook the Earth around just in condition so it would rain so you see it was a paradox for God for Noah to do that oh you see why we've got to believe in miracles we've got to believe in a miracle working God oh don't just come to church and just cabbage down and say well I'm sitting here warm in the seat and fail to see that God is still a miracle working God I think we should come to church expecting to see Miracles we should come to C Church expecting to see God move that should be our expectation why because you're a paradox and if you're a paradox then surely you can believe in paradoxes because God has changed you he's worked a miracle in your life and surely you can expect more miracles surely you can expect signs and wonders if you yourself are a sign and a wonder and God did it that way because he was going to do it again in the last days God worked all those things out in Noah's life of the preaching of the message come and get in the ark the do shut and all those things because he was going to do the same thing again in the last days as the days of Noah were so also shall the coming of the son of man be for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking marrying and giving in marriage getting married and getting divorced until the day that Noah entered into the ark they still carrying on their lives it looked like everything was going on normal and it's going everything looks like you look outside and people don't know anything about what I'm talking about right now now just like they did in Noah's day and ignore the gospel truth and knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall also the coming of the son of man be God would send a message in the midst of a scientific age of disbelief a message what to catch us away just like that message in Noah's day caught them away a message of a miracle a miracle working messag Amen to catch eight people away and as it wasn't that day so shall it be in this day when the coming of the son of man it it's a secret catching away in that day and it's going to be a secret catching away in this day the most evil scientific age oh don't look for nothing else to happen oh you've already been purged you've already been washed you've already been cleansed you've already been filled you've already been made ready and let me say it like this the word is sufficient you don't need nothing else to happen to you to cleanse you out you don't need anything else to make you ready the word is sufficient for you the word is sufficient for the bride the word is everything that the bride needs to make herself ready oh isn't that what was revealed in the fifth and sixth seals that the word has washed you and made you clean the word has purified you the word has cleansed you and that's all you need to be made ready is the word the word is everything that you had need of just like it was in Noah's day and Noah Noah couldn't prove by their intellect what he was saying they couldn't prove by their intellect well all he had to do all he had was the word and he based everything on the word when he said get in the ark he preached a message to get into the ark why did he preach that message cuz he knew there was going to be somebody to get in you think about that that this message was sent because God knew somebody was going to get in the ark I think I'm looking at I'm sitting here tonight some God knew somebody was going to receive it oh aren't you glad tonight for a miracle working God that send a miracle message to work a miracle in your life to save you and call you and move you into that Ark where would you be if this message hadn't come where would you be sitting right now you ever thought about that what would you what would you be doing right now maybe you'd be sitting in front of front of your TV at home watching some some some movie that ain't going to do nothing but corrupt your mind watching something watching some newscast that just goes around and around every day it's the same old thing more bad things more bad things to just pollute your mind but we're sitting here listening feasting on the words of life oh to think of his grace to think of God's race and in that day people didn't want to get in the ark they didn't want to get in the ark because they didn't like Noah and the same day people don't want to get in the ark because they they they've they've heard all this hypocritical stuff all this lies about brother brandham maybe tonight you've heard a bunch of lies about the ministers in this church maybe tonight that's what's keeping you from getting in the ark because because you don't like the way that the gospel has been presented they I I'm sure it was the same way in Noah's day that they got so upset at the way maybe the way that Noah's hair was matted or the way that his hairstyle was or the way that he wore his clothes or something was offputting into them and they ignored his message ignored the gospel and said I won't get in the ark because I don't want to be subject to that man I don't want to listen to him it's the same way today people look at the flesh instead of listening to the gospel people today say well what a weird group up there that believe you have to believe a man to be saved what a weird group to believe that you got to believe a man and meanwhile the whole rest of the world is believe in their men the Presbyterians got a man sitting over their denomination and they're believe in what he says the Catholics believe their Pope the methodists believe their guy everybody's got a guy that they listen to the Democrats have their guy and the Republicans have their guy and the Libertarians have their guy and everybody's listening to their guy and then they're pointing at us and saying well you're listening to the word of Truth so I don't want to believe it and failing to enter the ark oh if we could just lay down our pride and lay down our egos and just listen if we could just open up our ears and listen to the truth we'd climb up into that Ark gladly cuz you're going to have to the only way to go in this Rapture is to get in the is to get in the ark the Ark of this message sir you are not going in the Rapture if you don't get into this message this message is the only way that you're going in the Rapture it's the only way out of here it's the only ticket to that other world like that Noah's message was the only ticket in his day to that other world where the ark took him you believe Noah or you didn't get on the ark you either believe Noah or you don't get on and when the door was shut by God it was too late you think about who would want to be outside of the Ark when the rains began to fall when the water began to rise and the people began to realize that I should should have I should have just ignored my superstition about Noah I should have ignored all my my ego I should have ignored all that and just got on that Ark and then I would have been safe now who would want to be here when the bombs Begin to Fall you see why we preach so hard we we preach so hard because we don't want we don't want to see anybody here when the boms began to fall oh have you ever read those stories about the when the bombs fell in Japan what happened there was this group of people that the bombs fell and their faces were actually melted off until they had had no eyes left all they had was a gaping hole in their face where their mouth began to open and open and they went around their skin melted and and went around like like crabs through the street and people saw horrible sights when the bombs fell and you think you think this when the bombs fa fall when Russia begins to bomb and the bombs fall all around the world world that it's going to be any different than that little peanut peanut situation of heroshima and Nagasaki oh if you if you're sitting here tonight I I'm I'm going to go ahead and do like a good Baptist and hang you over hell because listen it's time to get scared it's time to do something do something don't you don't want to go through the things that are coming on the face of the Earth and you think about in Noah's day how it was easier to get animals onto that Ark than it was to get people he preached and he preached and he preached and all God's spirit had to do was move upon the people move upon the animals and here come the giraffes and here come the elephants and the clean animals seven by seven and the unclean two by two they marched they marched cleanly and nicely and orderly right up there cuz God's spirit told them what to do amen but you see God's spirit moving in the congregation and people's with their hard hearts and they won't listen and they get all upset at the preachers and they get all upset at all their little Pitt Patty ideas and they won't move it's see it's the same way today as it was back then where it's easier it's easier to get an animal to move away from the wall when a tornado's coming or when a hurrian crank's coming it move easier to get cows to move out in the middle of a field lead under the leading of the Holy Spirit did they get people to come into the ark but if they wanted to get in that Ark they had to come by Noah's message the only way to get in the door was to believe what that man preached you see I can't help there's a lot of things I can't there's a lot of things Noah couldn't help Noah couldn't help all the scarecrows Noah couldn't help today we can't help I can't help all the websites I can't help all the critics I can't help all the weird carnal stuff that's been done the guise of this message there's been a lot of weird stuff there's been a lot of weird things a lot of weird things that preachers have said behind the pulit and I can't help that I can't help all those things I can't help people that ain't living right now I can't help the Hypocrites I can't help the anointed ones in this age I can't help the things that are leading people astray I can't help preachers that misrepresent the gospel but that was a lot that Noah couldn't help either but it was the truth anyhow he preached the truth despite all the things that the devil threw as obstacles in the people's way to get them to get him to disbelieve and I Noah couldn't help in his day and we can't help today but we're going to preach the truth anyhow to think that God fornew how many people would get on that Ark and how many goats and how many sheep and how many elephants and how many maybe there was dinosaurs how many dinosaurs would get on the ark maybe little ones maybe big one I don't know how many but God knew how many would get on that Ark he knew the number of humans that were going to believe that word and they were ordained to be believer and the generation that they were living in and God knows sitting here tonight if you're going to get in that Ark listening in on the Airways tonight maybe sitting a home in your living room listening in God knows if you're going to get in that Ark if you've been ordained to receive it in the age that you're living in you're going to believe it despite all the scarecrows despite all the intellectuals despite all the educated despite all the naysayers despite everything because it makes no difference to a Believer cuz a Believer is a paradox himself and a Believer is going to believe no matter what the what devil throws at him a Believer believes that God is a god of paradoxes a Believer believes like brother Andrew Glover said one time a Believer believes in the bad times a Believer believes in the good times it don't matter cuz that's that's what a Believer does a Believer believes this message is the word and the word is everything you need to get into the ark if you want a way of Escape step into the word of the age that you're living in amen Noah preach the word all Noah had was the word all Noah needed was the word and there is where Noah's power was and there's where your power is the power to know that you if you look in that God's word and it says you can have it that you got the right motive you got the right motive you got the right reason you got the will of God that you speak the word and something's going to happen speak that word oh you see what God has built us up in by this word that's been open up to us precept upon precept here little there little built us up to a place where you should be at a place to speak that word if you have a need in your life speak it if you have a need in your life this afternoon don't leave without receiving what you have need of but speak it speak it and say God I confess that whatever you said I I claim it right now I claim my healing I claim I claim Deliverance I claim salvation I claim my children you speak that way word and you've got the right motive you got the right reason you've got the right will something is bound to happen why because a paradox is speaking speaking a miracle you're speaking what God has already said it's a paradox when God goes to working a that's what a paradox is it's a miracle working God moving it was a paradox when Israel stood on one side of the hill on Goliath on the other side it was a paradox when David took God at his word and went defeated Goliath it was a paradox when David killed Goliath when with it the sling cuz where the word is where the word is the spirit is and that's where Miracles are going to happen Revelation is a paradox oh you think about what a par what a paradox it is to look by faith and ignore all the situation that you're looking at it's a paradox that the Holy Ghost can open your eyes and you can read the scriptures that have blinded others but you can see it clearly it's a Paradox that you can see what others can it's a it was a paradox that Paul could see that light but others couldn't it was a paradox that Peter knew who he was when others didn't when Jesus went around that campfire and began to ask them who do you say that I the son of man am and and everybody was like with this one and this one and that one but Peter knew who he was the Holy Ghost didn't work as a paradox and life is a paradox when that little baby was born to Mary it was a paradox that God could speak life into a mother's womb and she'd be a virgin it was Joseph couldn't explain that Mary couldn't explain it science couldn't explain it but it happened anyway amen it was a paradox when he gave his life there on the on the cross and he gave his life so that he could give his life to us and that's the greatest Paradox when God gave his life you know you can't separate a man from his life if you got the life of God there ain't no separating that in Romans chapter 8 it says who shall separate us from the love of Christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or Peril or sore nothing can separate you from that life and that life of God is a paradox it's a miracle that God could put his life in you and live in you and walk in you and talking you it's a paradox that a man or a woman could yield themselves so much till God could take over could take them over Amen brother R said we Pentecostals we're taking God too commonly the whole thing we just let it pass by don't do that he said listen right now in our midst Jesus Christ is here that's a paradox how that he's alive after 2,000 years who can explain that how that he that Spirit unseen can come among us and take an individual and identify himself exactly impersonate himself in an individual as you as a Believer and to a gift that's a paradox you are a paradox and a paradox don't have any trouble believing in a paradox a paradox a miracle don't have any trouble believing in a miracle you are a miracle tonight as the musicians come you can believe for the impossible am you can believe for healing you can believe for a body change despite what science says when the doctor tells you it ain't possible like they told like science told them in Noah's day it ain't possible for rain to fall you can believe in a miracle it's a miracle when God brings life so this afternoon as we stand at our feet I've got news for John MacArthur the days of Miracle are not pass the days of Miracles are still here if his presence is here what does it matter what comes our way the days or Miracles are still here he is still Jehovah Gyra amen yeah go ahead I was on the CCH and said call said said honey got you I don't know I and said hone amen amen now see right there what what that ought to do to all of our faith is elevated oh if God can do that for them he can do it for you if some are receiving a blessing you can receive a blessing oh whatever you have need of God is a miracle working God oh you think you think about when brother Brandon was telling he was sitting there in hat Rice home and he was telling about how that God has still Jehovah Gyra that he's still that God that same God that was able to speak a lamb and put a lamb next there for Abraham that same God was able to speak those squirrel to put those squirrels where brother R spoke them into existence and hady rght said over there and she said that ain't nothing but the truth and brother Brown said that a greater he said a super anointing came in the room May I'll say it like this a great when she said that a greater anointing came in that room than when brother Brown said spoke those srels to begin with all because she said that ain't nothing but the truth if you can believe it if you can believe it but you have a paradox and didn't hady right get a paradox there when she said it ain't nothing but the truth she spoke she spoke salvation in her little little boys lives and she got it oh yeah I think sometimes we we just don't realize what we got access to and all because God graced us with this message oh we got something worth more than silver and gold something worth more than all this Natural Life wor more than anything this world holds that to know that the days of Miracles are still with us because the god of Miracles is with us let's sing a song and worship Him Blessed Assurance this evening amen Blessed assurance Jesus Is My Oh What A Taste

everybody back man we got everybody back here with us now so we're good and that was good um a couple announcements there will be no Bible study Saturday um y'all can't hear me I can't yeah okay all right can you hear me now all right we've got we will have no Bible studies Saturday Sunday we will have no communion we're only going to have one service and then the Sunday School classes need to do their gift giving here we're going to have regular service Sunday regular service 9:45 brother B will be doing Sunday school up here and the rest of you will be doing Sunday school downstairs and if you got gifts to give out you need to do that there because when we go to the venue we will just have the giveaways of what we give y'all as a church and what the coins and and and some of that so everybody clear with that there'll be no communion that Sunday because of next Sunday because of that all right just remember too that prayer service will be next Saturday not this Saturday next Saturday on the 10th at 7 o'clock we'll have a prayer service we'll open up the doors turn the music on have prayer and um and we're praying for the church but we're also praying for the meeting coming up at the end of the month which will be with brother uh Wayne Lawson there at the end of the month on Friday Friday night and Saturday night so remember that no communion uh we'll have communion at the end of the month anyway on U New Year's Day so so we love you with the love of the Lord thank you for all sure enough the prayers of everybody that went out to uh um of every getting everybody back together so it's always good I told them Sunday afternoon there were more people watching online than there was in the building so that's how many of y'all were gone but and sick so we glad to have all the sick ones back and we're glad to have all the ones that travel back but we appreciate brother Bob we appreciate the stand it's a listen if you're a Christian it's a paradox period everything you do is a paradox because you just don't think like the world that's what we've been trying to say it's just a paradox you just don't think like the world and and you don't do like the world and the world looks at you and thinks you're crazy they probably looked at Noah for 120 years we think 60 years since the Propet left they've been looking at us to bride and people are now they're going I and they did the same thing when Noah probably at first they thought yeah Noah something different rain we going to have rain we're going to help you build this boat no no Noah only Built that art big enough for eight people God knew that' only be eight or he would have had to build 50,000 boats because there was 7 million billion people in the world at that time but he knew there was only a certain group of people just like us that's a certain group of people going to make it and we just pray that we're the ones we we we just going to do the things that God tells us to do we're going to our greatest gift of this whole season is that we'll do what the word of God says am and that we'll do exactly what we've been taught and and man you know you you things are you think sometimes it's repetition I was thinking the other day repetition repetition but you know what repetition as human beings you do things you know I mean people are not going to just go out there and play football they're gonna practice so we've been practicing for 50 or 60 years some some of us and and I think it's about time to play the big game it's about time to get out of here it's about time take what's been preed and live it and and that's the greatest gift God came to give us a gift now we're going to give one back to him by living what he said but thank God for all of you we appreciate you like I said only one service Sunday then we'll go to Hidden Acres and we'll have a catered dinner down there and then we'll have a gift giving after that and I think we've got it till about 5:00 so we'll just have a time of fellowship and uh I think there's going to be a few singings or something Sunday so we'll have a little bit longer service maybe I don't think we're going to eat till 1:00 Lisa when are they coming 12:30 12:30 they're coming at 12:30 no they're coming at 12 well we'll do the best we can okay because we got about three programs that they're they're going to do so uh so we'll uh do the best we can but we'll we'll get there and play anytime so love you with the love of the Lord and go with God on the way home be safe and remember one thing you are a paradox you're and that's what God wants so that's what we're going to be we're going to be the will of God we're going to be the Paradox and we're going to be different amen we're going to think different we're going to act different amen so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this evening you give us thank you for brother Bob Lord just pouring out his heart and I pray Lord that you would help help him and strengthen him Lord and as we always know that it's tiresome sometimes as you preach Lord and then you got to get up and go to work the next morning I pray that you'll give him Supernatural strength give each one of us Lord Supernatural strength Lord as we Endeavor to do the best we can Lord here on the earth father but we know one thing's for sure we are chosen we are elected and as brother hernie always said to be ejected out of this world father we pray that you'd be with each one be with the ones that are still sick be with the on Lord that still have fever and
