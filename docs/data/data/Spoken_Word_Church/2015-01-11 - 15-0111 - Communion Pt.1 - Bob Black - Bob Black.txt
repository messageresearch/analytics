========================================

I think we're so let's turn to 2 Corinthians chapter 6 this the book right before Galatians so it should be pretty easy to get to so like I said I want to I want to talk this morning on communion because what brother Wade has been teaching on for the last year and a half I suppose or I'll have alone is really communion it's it's uh uh we'll get into it in a minute I don't want to get ahead of myself but let's let's read um 2 Corinthians 64 through 18 let's um before we read let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord God we thank you for your grace to us Lord and the the opportunity together to come together and gather around your word and and to fellowship with Believers Lord Jesus God we pray that you'll be with brother way this morning as he speaks Lord and be all the ones that couldn't be here with us today Lord and Grant it Lord that you'll give health and minister to us Lord Jesus and open our eyes to see your word yes bless us today we pray in your name so let's 2 Corinthians chap 6 verse 14-8 18 be not let me start at verse 11 I'm going to read down to verse 18 oh you Corinthians our mouth is open unto you our heart is enlarged ye are not straightened in us but ye are straightened in your own vows now for a recompense in the same I speak is unto my children be also enlarged be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness and what Concord hath Christ with B what part hath he that believeth with an Infidel and what agreement hath the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them and walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate say the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you and will be a father unto you and ye shall be my sons and daughters sayith the Lord Almighty amen so there verse 14 be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers now now there's the thing how how can you know we know we all know the scripture in Amos 3:3 how can two walk together unless they be agreed right how can we walk with God unless we're in agreement how can we have communion with him and uh the the problem you know we all we all know the story of the Garden of Eden how of how communion was severed between us and God because that what happened in the Garden of Eden was that instead of valuing all of the word of God they just took one word and and went one word off one word off and that broke the communion with God and what happened when communion was broken is they lost they lost uh the ability to know what God's Will and purpose was and there's there's so many things wrapped up in communion that when you have communion and fellowship with God you know what his will is you know there's a quote I don't have it right now what brother said the bride will know what God's will is you'll know what God's plan is and you can see God's plan and the St a perfect man how he's he's he's he's moving Us in in close closer and closer fellowship with him with in communion through a growth process it starts off like kind of like we're we're apart from God and he he brings us together by justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost begin growing up the statue of perfect man adoption and and at the end of the process you're you have true Oneness of unity with God true communion now that's what real communion is is where you're you're in agreement you understand one another you can't uh that was that's the whole problem of how how can somebody that's in darkness and the light of the world how can they walk together and that's what God is trying to do he's trying to bring us together into Fellowship so that so that he can make his great plan and purpose known so he can give us a part in it he gives us and in that message brother R preached what was the Holy Ghost given for he said the Holy Ghost was given so that you know when he was when when they were leaving the Garden of Eden that that same God that was crying out I'm going to make a way now is crying out from within your heart to call the Believers to the message that you've heard and you have a part in it you have a and that's why there's a desire in the believer's heart that to so that other people can hear the word they hear the truth because now you're in communion with God now you know uh I really started studying on kind of in the line of a conversation with god because that's what really what communion is it's not you know many people you have a you you'll have a conversation we call it a conversation that ends up being one-sided and and sometimes ministers kind of like to do that that you talk to a minister sometimes it's been my experience many times that it ends up almost being one-sided there they're pouring a lot of information on you and you kind of stand there that's right and uh but but a real conversation is is back and forth there's got to be a response there's got to be and and you look at that that conversation between Jesus and Nicodemus Nicodemus came to him at night and they had a conversation Nicodemus would ask a question and Jesus would tell it to him the woman at the well they had a little conversation and that's how brother brand said that he would uh he would have a little conversation in the prayer lines to get in touch with people's Spirit to get to get a fix on what their problem was now before you can have a conversation you got to what you talking about you got to have something to agree on now now there's many brothers I I I can't after the the new year as a brother U mentioned to me he said my you should have seen that Alabama game I I don't I don't know nothing I can't have a conversation about that I can you know at work sometimes I I we'll just have a little game I'll fake it you know I'll say Bo if they just bring it together if they just can bring their realistic synergies together that really do it this year and you can fake it you know but um I I can't really have a conversation because I don't know what they're talking about and and you know even with with with anything fishing or anything you know you you got to have a common ground right now you can't uh to see what God's doing he's bringing us up a growth process and he starts you off with justification and you begin to have a little conversation you say I've got communion because like Martin he looked at Romans 7:17 and and he said now I know that I'm not saved by my works when he had uh he was beginning to have a little conversation with god but the the growth the plan is not finished yet he he's grow he's bringing us on up to where he can really have we really know what's going on we he can really commune with us and and we're in in tune and and we're and what happened in the Garden of Eden was they got one word off and it it caused everything to be on edge and now that's how it is brother R A lot of times you almost can't talk about these kind of topics without bringing in home life and because he used so many examples about a man and his wife Christ and his bride how can if if you have a home life where the the man and the wife the husband and wife are not in agreement everything is going to be an edge just it's going to be uh like maybe this is a bad example but sometimes my wife and I disagree on uh what temperature of the house should be and it just I you know if it was up to me maybe I'd put um I'd just load up that wood stove and have it at 90° but uh and Monica likes to have the windows all thrown open whether if it's 30° at night well my so you got to you got to be an agreement and and and you know in that case we we come to an agreement cuz I I'll put on a lot of extra clothes a big old sweater or whatever and that you know that brings us to agreement but that's not how God does it he brings us to agreement he he brings us from light to Darkness from from Darkness to light by shining his light on us the light of his word and making it come to life in our hearts now now there's the there's the key if if we got the we we uh the danger is knowing a lot because having the truth he said John chapter 4 that we the we've got to worship Christ in spirit and truth right amen it take it it it takes a combination right if you just got if you just know a lot then and then uh and Paul said in Corinthians that that knowledge puffeth up you begin to uh I was reading this message where brother R began to talk about how that what what knowledge does is it causes complexes it causes people one one's bigger than the other one's you know it makes everybody uh at different different levels and things and but when you're in agreement with it when you're in communion with God it puts everybody in in one Fellowship by one Spirit by one Faith by one baptism amen we can all come together and true communion brings us into fellowship with God and to fellowship with one another because now we have something in common that we can Fellowship around right there's something in agreement with us something that binds us together and you know I I was thinking about this the other night when some of the brothers got over the house and we were just kind of sitting around and you start talking maybe somebody be talking about fishing or somebody be talking about football and everything but then there's that almost magical moment when the topic shifts yeah to the word and somebody says I was reading over in Romans or something about this scriptures that just really means so much to me and it just really Quicken the other day or or can did you remember what brother Dale was talking about and and there's the thing that we can really Fellowship together that's the thing that we have agreement with God on agreement with one another on you know I believe that that the bride is coming together in true Oneness right God is is it's the Holy Spirit doing it it's not something you can do yourself it's the the work of the holy spirit before the the day of Pentecost all the Believers were in Discord there was some trying to can we sit at your right hand can we do this who's going to be the biggest who's the greatest among all your disciples and then what brought them together was when the spirit fell they were all in one Accord yes that everything the atmosphere was just in in the right place and they all came into communion and that's what brings communion so now now the question I'm not really talking about the Lord suffer but I think that uh maybe by the end of this little series you'll it it might help answer some questions when can I take the communion are you in agreement with God's word how can two walk together unless they agree you can say well I I know what brother brandham taught I nod your head but does your life agree does everything agree does it completely match up matching pieces is everything just in in perfect alignment and that's you know brother I got to thinking I just made a little note about this and I I just want to comment because brother Brandon said when he was in a prayer line he would begin to talk to somebody to try to get in touch with their Spirit now discernment is a is a is a interest in topic you know brother BR said every believer should have should be able to discern between right and wrong you should be able to know whether something is right or wrong and he also said you can talk to somebody for a little bit and tell because out of the heart the MTH from out of the heart the mouth speaketh whether they've got the Holy Ghost how is that how does that work because in the beginning they got out of communion by denying one word of God and when you talk to somebody and they begin to make excuses for why they cannot why their family can't follow the word why they can't follow the word make excuses for not obeying the scripture what show it plainly and then they begin it just shows that there's something wrong now I I don't I I don't believe that uh you know I I mentioned this before I I would never go up to somebody and say you have the Holy Ghost or you don't have the Holy Ghost because it's got to be a personal revelation I can't tell you you whether you've got to take communion or not or or things like that but uh when when the Holy Ghost is when the when the Born Again experience is active in your life it will begin to make you line up with the word yes and it's a big red flag if you say well the Bible says this but you know I I'm going to continue on in my way because the there's a promise in the scripture that says it will lead and guide you to all truth amen it will make you line up it makes these virtues be active in your life it makes them be it makes you be fruitful yes you remember brother said your fruit is your Doctrine it makes the doctrine that you have heard come to life and live in you now we got about 15 or so minutes uh let's see I was going to put this on the screen cuz I'm kind of comparing true communion with knowledge maybe that's kind of what we're we're talking about and I I I don't know if you can see this this is uh I don't expect you to read the words or anything but this is a little pyramid this is what the the thing that they used in schools today to kind of instruct teachers of how they should bring up kids and this this is also a pyramid but it's a pyramid of knowledge it's not a pyramid of what God's doing it's a pyramid remember in the Garden of Eden they had a choice between to take God's way or to take knowledge now in this pyramid there's knowledge and this pyramid there's knowledge yes there's this kind of knowledge and this kind of knowledge the bottom the bottom on this period is knowledge and then it goes up to comprehension application let's see how we can apply the things that we have learned I'm not trying to make a doctor or anything I'm just kind of ill to illustrate something analysis synthesis and the Very Peak is evaluation so you know man we could if if you're trying you'll never be able to figure it out you'll never be able to to uh they could never figure out Matthew 28:19 but on the day of Pentecost when the spirit fell then what they could not figure out they got the revelation of and Peter came out and said I now I know know who I've been talking to all this time that I know who how we should be baptized I know the way into the into the the body of Christ now thinking about conversation called communion is a conversation I went back in the uh you know whenever whenever you bring out strong concordance everybody kind of gets that Sleepy Eye you look so don't you I I went back to look at the definition of what conversation means in the Greek and the Hebrew and this was really interesting so don't fall asleep on me and don't get cross out but a conversation is not just a dialogue but it also means the way of life of life it means the manner of Life your conduct behavior and uh there's another word similar to there there's a couple of words in the Greek Lexicon that means uh one means means the manner of Life conduct Behavior another one means to live to abide to behave oneself to conduct oneself behave oneself live and in the Old Testament the Hebrew Leon conversation means your manner your habit your way the course of life and your moral character so I believe what God is doing when he communes with us he's taking his the conversation of his mouth and bringing it down into our hearts so that it can live that life can live in us that's uh let's turn over to 2 Corinthians chapter 4 that's there it is this is so beautiful how true communion always starts starts in in secret there's all these scriptures that say that what God does and it something's done in secret and then is made manifest you go into your prayer closet and and have private communion with God and then it's made manifest in the open communion with God happens in a secret place with one a one-on-one thing with just you and God in your like brother R said in that bedroom chamber where there's something going on personal with you God that nobody else knows about let's read verse three 2 Corinthians 4:3 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost and whom the God of this world ha blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is the image of God should shine under them for we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and our eles your servants for Jesus sake for God who commanded the light to shine out of Darkness hath shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ now remember a few chapters over we read about how how can Darkness and Light walk together now that's what's going on here he has shown the light of the Gospel into our hearts to convert US from vessels of Dishonor into vessels of Honor yes to bring us into perfect communion now now there's the the key you say I'm Justified I'm in communion that's what brother R said you're Justified you're in communion but that's not the end of the story right I'm Sanctified I'm in communion I got a mar John Wesley I got a a higher Revolution Evol revelation of the word but that's not the end of the story keep going up Aza Street a messenger came well now you got to hear you got to hear the message you got to eat the book and it's got to it's bringing you into perfect communion perfect Fai a perfect knowledge of who he is and who you are because that's what the books of this uh the the letters on this page are testifying of is that God's got a bride he's got somebody that he's going to manifest himself in all right my computer's not working again let see that was another scripture I wanted to read right before we end well I I barely got through any of these those you know what I'm going to stop right there let just read 1 John 1: 5-7 and that says you going to have to turn to it says this then is the message which we have heard of him and declare unto you that God is light and in him is no darkness of at all if we say that we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we lie and do not the truth but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanseth us from all sin so next time we're going to continue on this thought is my plan and we're going to look at how God brings us into perfect fellowship with him cuz we've been you know brother Way's been teaching us on the stature of a perfect man um but I want to kind of look at uh I'm going to switch over to Ezekiel 37 you know everybody knows what Ezekiel 36 is right that I'll give you a new heart new spirit Ezekiel 37 takes those dry bones and brings them to life and how does he do it how are we brought into communion with by the word by the speaking of the word by the we've heard a prophet in this last day is being preached to us we can put the tape in the tape player and press play and it's it's growing us into the fullness of the stature of of Christ himself amen and I think we're all well first that so we'll just uh stop right there God bless you
