Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord Open the Eyes of My Heart I want to see you I want to see you see you high and lifted up shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and life As we sing Holy Holy Holy amen up shining in the light of your glory you love him pour out your power and love we sing Holy Holy Holy holy holy holy holy Ho Holy Holy Holy Holy and I want to see you amen and amen I want to see it don't you we see him in the word we see him unveiling unto us but I I want to see him face to face and we got a promise that we'll have that opportunity so that's wonderful isn't it good to see everybody in the house of the Lord good to have sister Scoggins back with us and seeing her spry and jumping around and everything's going good so uh I told her she's welcome to go back and sit in my office if she needed to tonight so if she moves about you just you know going back there and sit and and watch it on the screen there oh remember now the uh Bible study will be the first Saturday in July and remember the fellowship meeting will be the 3rd I think that's the 16th or something and as far as we're knowing now is that brother pageant so we you know if there's any difference we'll let you know but it should be that amen but uh if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Revelations 3 and in second Peter 1 and just remember these now before you're seated I have some quotes quotes up here that you know a lot of people now we they didn't make it plain blunt brother brandham never taught it we don't believe it the Bible doesn't teach of the Bride going through the tribulation that's right no way because she is perfect through the blood of Jesus Christ but now there may be hard days ahead of us and I'm not a I don't know what you call it sister Susan talking her the other night about optimistic pessimist I never have figured out which one I was because I I never worried about it but you know I know what to profit I've tried to keep up with it for years and and things of what he would say about persecution coming to the church now not tribulation everybody understand not tribulation the bride does not go through the tribulation but there's two in here that he actually says it's thus sayith the Lord that there will be a persecution come so you know you take these I made a I hope enough to be able to make each family one and if not we'll run off some more and things and you know have having that and you read them study it I I'm not one to say I'm looking forward to this but I know what the prophet says this way and I don't think it's in there but he said the bride always done better under persecution we need to be tried a little bit we need to you know need to be clicked a little and things U but you know people will say well I I don't believe that well that's all right that's your thoughts but the prophet of God said these things so we just say we give you what he said and it's on the internet to be placed out to where that people can read it you know and that way you'll be reading what he says so remember that all Revelations 3 2 Peter 1 Heavenly Father we thank you tonight for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the fact that this part part of the time that we are living that we we still do have our freedom and we know that things are vastly going away from us and all things could happen in a very short time because your Prophet said that the most of most of the Old Testament scriptures was fulfilled in the last few hours of Calvary so we know it can come fast and we look forward to you coming and whatever that transpires and takes then let it be as it is so we will just praise you and honor you and and thank you for all things forgive our sins because we want to be covered and be ready in that day in Jesus name amen okay Revelations 3 and unto the angel of the Church of the lady of sin right these things sayith the amen the faithful and true witness who the beginning of the creation of God all right now we go to Simon Peter and see what he has to say about this new creation right Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious faith not written to the world right them with the same Faith he's got with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord see your thoughts may run to the point when you're reading that obtained like Precious faith and you say we have the same Faith as Peter well that's true cuz everybody does not have the same measure righten that is according to you is your measure so but it is the same New Birth that Peter had right okay grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound now not just say in you they need to be piled up heaped up and you know great amount they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated if you want to pass these out Wai well okay we'll keep them up here we don't want you reading them while while I'm preaching okay so make sure you get one in all right good good point okay good point all right but now what have we been talking about the stature of a perfect man from second Peter all right and knowing that the prophet is explaining that to us as to the very thing that God expects and God has provided now if he expects something of you and I then as one known fact he has provided a way all right so then that's that's within it and what is our way of climbing up the statue of a perfect man just like a baby's way of growing in height and size and thing is by eating so we just keep eating the word all right that you say but what brother Dale what I need virtue what could I read to get virtue read the Bible Well I I need to read certain scriptures don't not read the Bible that's right see just read and then God will take what you've read and turn that into what you need right he'll make it work out for the right place all right watch it in a second now as we tie back to something but what have we found out through the messages prior through we spoke on faith and then we spoke on virtue and knowledge and temperance I mean Faith virtue and knowledge last uh Sunday and then now we'll speak on Temperance today but we found that what the prophet says on the Statue of a perfect man he says have faith and be born again he say now that what you're doing is you're laying the foundation he said the foundation of all Christianity is based upon Faith all right then he goes on to paragraph 178 say after you're born again these these are the things that he expects you to add all right now how have we found out that he expects you to add not you add in the bases of you making some way that you could come to do something but just partaking of his divine nature and letting it come from what did he say he says on paragraph uh one no par 44 the way back 62 he said the virtues of this Holy Ghost have to come from the inside out that's right amen all right so all we got to do is just keep taking the word in he will press out what we have need of and he will bring it as we have need of it right because it'll be there he doesn't expect everybody to uh climb the same way you know what I mean all together at one time this is not that way this is not a group therapy this is an individual of fire with Jesus Christ one grows faster than the other you know all right because that they are made that way all right then he says on the position of a believer in Christ we gave these last Sunday he said after coming into his body you become partakers of his divine nature after coming into the body so you're born again at Faith then he expects us to add virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and what do we emphasize over and over the new birth faith is not a virtue that's a birth that's right amen the baby comes here without virtues it must be taught those are grow into those in its life all right so is it with a baby in Christ that we become in the earnest of our inheritance all right we went from that of be born again and have let you know have faith and be born again then we talked about last Sunday that talking about virtue that it does not mean paragraph 143 it does not mean a virgin life in that situation it it was meaning strength amen you know and Jesus it said virtue went out of him why because they could draw something from him that was strength right all right then we went on into knowledge where it's talking about adding knowledge and it's knowledge to know that God that in his Bible that the Bible does not contradict itself all right that's the knowledge we need cuz remember now watch it in just a second These Are Holy Ghost virtues that's right they are not just virtues of an individual am all right we'll get to it and read it where you can have a portion of these virtues and not even be born again you've been around people you see them have you know great things in their lives that you like to be around them but that's not the Holy Ghost virtue because see that would not be just wanting to be around them and them being with that you couldn't come out to say virtue then would be strength see and and it would not lay into to that form but we talked about Sunday afternoon that the Bible does not contradict itself that's right and the prophet is speaking of the on uh paragraph I think it's 188 or something right in there he talks about the stature of a perfect man that these are he this is Heavenly knowledge right amen it's not Earthly remembering it's not just something that we read we ought to do that but it is Heavenly knowledge see that comes by our reading right amen you know our hearing our partaking the then it comes out to a Heavenly knowledge all right now and it's heaven born he called it knowledge now here's what I want you to think cuz I'll repeat this the next service the next one the next one the Lord willing all right see you must have faith as a new birth and be born again you cannot add virtue you know Holy Ghost virtue to an individual that's not born again amen all right are you with me now you cannot add virtue to a person that is not born again so that's that justification sanctification you don't expect those things to transpire all right but then when you're born again see now you can add virtue why because you have something to place it on Amen but now follow my point you cannot come to Virtue without being born again you say well I've got this knowledge that's head knowledge that's wonderful but that's not what it's talking about here this head knowledge that he comes to when he leaves virtue to come to head to knowledge that knowledge is Holy Ghost knowledg AM that's the only thing that will lay on the virtue amen that is Holy Ghost virtue right yeah right but see you can't run up to the ladder you can't say well I'll just bypass these and I'll go up here and I'll just start right here cuz this is this is the age we're living in all I got to worry about this age we're living in just got to worry about brotherly kindness we just we need brotherly kindness well go up in Philadelphia stay up there but You' find out I been up there a little bit it a't his brotherly kindnesses certainly Holy Ghost virtue kind virtue all right but see you first have to have faith and then the same material you remember that Sunday the same material of Faith you know Revelation Faith birth is what brings virtue into being amen it's the same material all right see it's not that virtue is one material knowledge is another material you know Temperance is another ETA no it's the same material we're going to strike it tonight because it's got to be the same material to vulcanize together all right see it has to be that and other words for us to follow it see then you don't just say well I've got a new birth now I'm going to add knowledge you can't do that irregardless of what you think about your knowledge you've got to have the virtue which is the Virgin life or living the life of Christ because what would would it be if you went from the birth to knowledge now come on we got a long ways to go down the road and some quotes it's going to get a little shaky brother BR says gifts without these virtues if you read the book you're supposed to what did he say gifts were without the virtues he said a stumbling block right well I just have knowledge that's a gift to me it's a gift of knowledge not it's a gift to gab yeah gift to Gap okay but are you following me now see as we go along we'll keep adding to the point because I want that instilled into your mind that see you start start by the new birth and then God adds virtue to you and you come out living a clean good life see it doesn't throw away with the Virgin it doesn't throw the Virgin life away it's just not meaning it in that situation because it would not fit see if you just said well that's just a virgin life well you know you say well I'm a virgin I'm I'm a virgin you know so I I'm in that category that's not exactly The Virtue that is speaking of in the Statue of perfect man although that's well and good and wonderful and honorable and desired you know should be desired to be but it's not what that is speaking of see you would limit yourself to what you would be thinking but if you take virtue as it is in the Statue of a perfect man then you can run it over a great category of a Christian life amen you know and you carry it to others and they can see all right now so is it with knowledge that you have knowledge and by having knowledge see then that being Holy Ghost knowledge and how did the prophet say you have it how do you check your knowledge you know how do you check your knowledge by virtue and by your faith right is that what we were reading Sunday see it's different read the book real slow and now most of us has got the older style books say I don't even know where they ever did put that one out with the with the uh statue of perfect man with the uh uh paragraph and things you know listed and most of your old one there is some word changing from your old one to your computer so so it's hard to follow you won't follow it by by saying paragraph so and so in the old the book that come out because you know that was just a way of doing it okay I say those things to keep you from getting look I can't find what I'm looking for sometimes you have to read a little bit backwards and forth to find what you're trying to find all right now to try to get you into that point all right but see heaven born knowledge then would be coming from heaven and I thought the prophet said what about heaven he said Heaven consists of the word amen right not just made by it not just created by it amen Heaven itself exists by the word because that's where God is so it's Heavenly knowledge that will will come together we'll see in a minute it will vulcanize if you got it right see your faith your virtue will vulcanize to the faith then your knowledge will vulcanize to it and then it won't be in sear you know it won't be you won't be able to to tear it down all right no so it would bring it so keep the point so we'll repeat that before you can add virtue you must have faith because that's the only thing you can add it to because is the same material the revealing of God's word all right before you can have knowledge you must have faith and virtue amen right then your knowledge will not be head knowledge it can come into an existence of Holy Ghost knowledge amen right y all right now keep that in mind so we'll be repeating that a good bit to where that it'll stay with you now let's start in what the prophet had to say now tonight about this little part we thought talk about of temperance you well Temperance that's that's you look it up you know and it's oh you know it won't say doing the way without alcohol but that's what most people think you know well you just don't drink no alcohol that's Temperance that person really got Temperance he a got a temper if F bu sa but got Temperance because he don't drank alcohol that's not exactly the Bible terminology the of what it's being said so all right so let's start on number one and we'll just read through a little bit and then make some comments because you say well why would you be trying to teach us these things when we're already up here here well uh Peter wasn't talking to people that was up there that's right right he was talking to people that was down there where faith is at right and he was trying to tell them how to get up there well see here comes brother brandham and that's what he said that these things came to him on the Statue of a perfect man down in the woods on a message he was trying to preach well he'd always tried to preach Christian Life I mean you go back to the interve and he talks about the bride being a walking instrumentality of God he always taught that but this brings in to see how to do it right he said connected in so then see how do we do it we do it according to what Peter says so what is it for tonight add Temperance right now as we'll go along and read where it talks about a temper now we're going to put this up front and then say it about three times going through see uh most people are taught when they get born again I don't have no temper right I I when that Holy Ghost came it took away all of my temper it took away all of my problems well now number one is one thing then you make Peter a liar because Peter said to as Temperance so you're making him lying you know come on you're making him wrong because he's telling us we must have this amen but but I I I when I got born again I ain't never had a 10% sin just let somebody cross you just a little bit come on boy kick a shovel out in the yard right see some people you can talk to and some better not cuz some get your feelings hurt because you expose them but you know I've always been able to say what I wanted to about brother I and he just Grunt and say preach it you know and uh but see we think and and I I'm agreeing with you listen that when you get born again you don't keep on living like the devil if you do there ain't even no need of talking about being born again I mean forget the whole situation that's right you know just drop it and forget it but something did happen amen but yet we still got a lot of the human parts of us that are not brought under control and I'm not talking about this body and neither am I talking about just to uh talk about the spirit realm of you know memories and conscious affection but now remember we'll get to that a little bit later that uh some of these virtues is listed in the the fruits of the spirit that's right there are expected to be there but just think about it so we'll read it where if it doesn't mean to stop drinking alcohol and it means controlling your tongue see then it's getting to a different situation than it would to just say I don't drink alcohol it's getting to working upon something that's within us because these virtues have to come from the inside out right A lot of people have them from the outside trying to bring it in and they can do this they can do that you know and they're nice people and wonderful you know and and in no way I throw it off on them but I'm just asking the question is it holy ghost Temperance or is it mine you know is it my ability I never was a person that um would be so-called having a temper I had plenty of it but you never knew it because I had a control of it you know and I I just wasn't uh you know to the basis and I always wondered if I had God's Temperance or my own because I did have we'll get back to it in the message kind of like a self-control where other people you know I've always told you I didn't use vulgar words you know I just didn't do it and and I certainly didn't use them the words anybody else cuz I I like my teeth staying where they were and that was a good way to lose some you know and get hurt because you just run your mouth all right but I I was always that way I've never had I didn't have to become a Christian to make those things I never liked uh violent Sports uh I played enough basketball and everybody think basketball is a good tender little sport but it's not if you play it right I've had teeth knocked out I've had everything from you know basketball but uh you know but I had a little control like say that about basketball you know how some people are rough and pushy and things about it this is a point and we were playing against some boys we played some pretty good teams around here and uh this boy kept pushing and I just I put up with it for a little while and then after a while I got right in his ear and I said listen if you push anymore me and you got problem problems we play in basketball we play rough but you're getting too much well you know what I never had no trouble with him the rest of the game I didn't stop him from playing ball I'm just saying I had a control back there when we get down to fact was saying you know you can have a certain amount of the you'll see that that's true but I always wondered if that was gone from me you know and and I had a man one time and I've always thought it like I've told you about it but I've always seen how that you know in the old days they would take a glove they'd have an argument they take a glove they slack each other's cheek they turn around walk out there take a gun walk off shoot each other and just kill him well I understood that because that was an insult you know the Striking was the insult well I always wondered if I could take that and I had a man at work one day he slapped my Jaws real good because because of something I done to him and uh I done back to him because what he was doing to me he was pinching me between the legs and I don't like people plays games like that and I kept telling him to quit so I pushed him pretty hard well he SLA me and instead of flaring up I stood and looked at the man and I was grinning this lat I had to you know after I received the baptism with the Holy Ghost and I was grinning and he just turned walked off and you know what he never bothered me no more never no problem but I was standing there saying Thank You Lord you got a temper you've had one you'll find out somebody will push you one day and you will see whether it's real or not you'll see where it was real by somebody putting you to a test okay we'll get to those in a minute but listen so what did he say let's go ahead and start reading and he starts off on paragraph 219 and that's what I tell you don't go to the book and try to find paragraph 19 219 you don't have paragraphs in the old book all right fourthly we have to hurry because it just feel so good to stand here and talk about it fourthly add Temperance oh my we've come to Temperance now you've had Faith first have to have that to begin with then you add virtue to your faith if it's the right kind of virtue then you add knowledge if it's a right kind of knowledge now you're going to add Temperance now watch it Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol here see because the word Temperance can be used to that here either no Temperance doesn't mean alcoholic cure not in this case are you with me now he's saying it see you would think I was saying part what now he's saying it that in this case now Temperance can be used as a stop drinking alcohol but not in this Bible case of what you're studying see what you're studying then is different this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance that's just one of the lust what the drinking one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking talking about Holy Ghost Temperance that means how to control your tongue now what is it in the Bible man has always been has been had the ability to control every animal but what's the thing he can't control the tongue right now that's scripture you want me to bring that scripture it's you can't control the tongue well yes I can no no it's just admit it now here's what I'm standing and saying listen folks if we're talking about that we need virtue then that means we don't have it right or the Bible would say you've already got it if if we need knowledge that means we don't have it right now to say that we need Temperance that means we don't have it when I got born again I ain't had no temper since then we'll get to that in a little bit you know where you fussing and Ste and you know what if I've got a problem with the temperance a temper and I won't admit it where am I at I got a problem right that's problem so the first thing is to admit it so brother Dale if you got a temper this don't push me too far you might find it out but then I can grin because I don't believe it'll work I don't believe you can push me that far I've had professional try I've had some to really get in my face about it but I just say Lord you just take care of that now and it's it's never fled up for to make me hate anybody all right come now watch but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your tongue not to be a tadler how do you control your temper not fly off every time anybody speaks cross to you now get on down in where we live and we can talk about people out there we can talk road rage we can talk those things you know uh problems but get on down where we live get on in the message and see I thought brother brandham said that we're supposed to be able to what bitterly differ no now you know what bitterly different means bitterly different don't say brother kie I want to different you you with me we just going down no it don't mean that it says Bill Carly you're wrong and I'm right he says you're wrong and I'm right that's right right come on to bitterly differ but to love each other that'll go into brotherly kind this morning okay look and watch what he says boy a lot of us now he didn't say I would love brother Brown for that you know brother Brown didn't say y'all y'all y'all he always said us are we right he put himself right in there all the time he said boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started if you think that ain't right it's either in the Statue of f man of Blasphemous night when the guy was challenging him and he said said I told him said leave him alone now I'm quoting him he said cuz I wanted it so bad he was human he didn't have a bad he wasn't mad at him or what but he wanted to let it be known okay that's him listen boy a lot of us are going to fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why the why God is not in his church now may I quote him again one unconfessed sin in a church I'm quoting him almost verb him I'll be glad to find he said will cause the church one he said will cause the church to bitterly fail and he says you will answer for that at judgment now if you need that quote be glad to get it for you he said just one unconfessed sin then we wonder why God is not in his church this doing Miracles and things that he they used to do yes sir and you know may I put it here why have we been here 50 years since the prophet has gone when the prophet himself said the don't thing he saw outside of the you know holding off coming to the Lord was read to the bride so it's evidently our problem right but yet we blame god well God I don't understand how come you ain't doing like you used to yeah okay watch add these things add Temperance to it oh Temperance how to answer in kindness when wrath is spoken to you somebody say you bunch of Holy Rollers down there don't jump up and roll up your sleeves see not that but talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to is that the way you want to be amen when you R upon R not back let him be your example okay when they said if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it and show he was God but he had Temperance Temperance what does it mean Temperance and all of the definitions of temperance that I can find means self-control that's the base is and that's the number I'll give you in a minute it just means self-control all right now when they called him Bells you above he said I'll forgive you for it that right they pulled handfuls of beard out of his face and spit in his face and said come down off the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing right then they come on down the prophecies and rag around his head and hitting him and everything you know so tell us who hit you we'll believe you see Temperance now if you got it like that add it to your faith if you still blow up and CE and fuss and stew and carry on huh you ain't got it you ain't got no you can't add that because it won't add see it won't vulcanize now we're in a day and understanding some of us older ones young kids don't understand it but we were in the day when we used to vulcanize patches onto tires right we had a little device and it stri a match to it and it burn it done because just a little old little old bicycle rub on tube patch it would hold but when it got hot but then they come up with what they call the it was a thing you put that little patch on it you vulcanize that and if it if it went just right it was just or stronger than the other original material but it had to be the same material right you can't put a piece of iron and a piece of rubber together oh they got some wonderful things today they they can do some amazing things with but it still it ain't going to work too good look you couldn't take it take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it just won't work no it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is and when your faith and your Temperance becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had now the same kind he had see that's why it's not as much added it's the same kind he had then it will vulcanize with him you you're added to it when your virture is like his virture then it'll add to it when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to do thy will oh god with the father's word he defeated every devil heavens and earth will away but the word will not see when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize with your faith when you got the right kind of temperance like he had it'll vocalize now there's three times he talks and says his like he had it that's not me and you then right bless God I just couldn't stand it I had to tell them all you ever heard somebody say it like this they say I just I know not have done it but I just told them all and you know what I got it off my mind and I feel better you ever heard that you ever said that oh well I just had to get it off my mind now if I thought it the prophet said I might as well speak it you want some more quotes yeah right I quote on okay look when you got the right kind of temperance like he haded a baniz if you have it just a man-made halfway Saed up belief or Temperance now I say I'm just honest I'm say that's what we have I said we have what is it it's a halfway manmade Saed up belief or temperance cuz then what do you say oh ought to slap him damn ever heard people say I ought to slap but I couldn't do it why would the thought be there why would the a ought to do it why would it come right why would that be any thought in a Christian's mind well I want to tell them off why would that be in a Christian's mind now now come on there's a lot of difference in telling the truth to somebody about something than the other ways right don't try to pull nothing just listen I ought to slap him down but maybe I better not cuz they might put my name in the paper about it that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about don't try to add that it won't work but when you can really with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man can you do that hold your peace let it be gone see then it'll vulcanize you can add that to your faith when no wonder the church is so short isn't that right no wonder like somebody would say that old Antichrist you know you try to tell them the truth and they say that ain't nothing but the devil you know brother R said that God would am allow a person to say something to you to just see how you would react amen now look at him he's saying you're talking to somebody about baptism in name of Jesus Christ and that guy's a stricted you know somebody's a strict in don't believe that said that old Antichrist he's a Jesus name he's a Jesus only Look Out Boy I don't know about your Temperance right now why don't you come say let's reason this together brother brandom I'd like to hear this explained see then come down and listen to it and then it's put right before you and then you walk away see now if it's put before you walk away well we'll get to that just in a few minutes in godliness but when when you fly loose want to jump up at every conclusion now listen that's that's not it you haven't got Bible Temperance yet when you do that how to answer back then if you got all of this you can add this to your faith Holy Ghost Temperance how to control your tongue the word Temperance is 1644 for and your strong concordance it means self-control the virtue of one who Masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetites now you're going all the way through bringing it all the way through everything because it even goes to your sensual appetites which means fleshly of lot of and it can mean too much eaten right okay do you know that Temperance is one of the fruits of the spirit go ahead with the next Galatians 5:22 which is number four but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness Temperance now what against such there is no law there you know why because they're of God so you if you'll read right back before then you'll find that you have works of the Flesh and you know that works of the flesh is Envy Strife seditions murder uh lustful things all kind of thing uh hatefulness you know tattletail tongues all the things but then bring it down to the meekness and Temperance the Bible knows a lot about all of our things don't it okay but look let's read this where you won't misund understand me go ahead with number five because the prophet covered here in statute of perfect man that there's two kinds of Faith two kind kinds of virtue two kinds of knowledge two kinds right and here that now and here's now get this lesson here is what's wrong with the with the I turn on for this here's what's wrong with the brandom Tabernacle you see there's two different kinds of Faith there's two different kinds of virtue as I had it the other day two different kinds of knowledge two different kinds of temperance one thinks it's probation will be you remember the old drinking problem they got that ain't the kind of temperance that God is talking about it's that uncontrollable ungodly listen uncontrollable temper that you got and things of that side fight back for us now as I've mentioned a couple of times you say but since I was born again I don't have no temper well Peter said we needed Temperance so he must have been referring to that we had temper if we needed Temperance right I mean is that true am all right now he calls it here ungodly uncontrollable temper you say well that's just that other number two temper it ain't number one one with me well you you got a point but what don't just be honest why don't we just be honest and talk about Christianity as an honest Point why is it this message has not had the effects upon the people of the world that's right why is it that this message has has not had the effects on your families you see I know now get to meddling then all right I'm the guy that can afford it the pastor can meddle everybody else can't okay amen all right why is it that your family doesn't want the message right uh for heaven help I hope you don't think that they're not predestinated because if you think that way you're predetermining them to hell so don't go that route amen you know that everybody's watching us right everybody at work watches you everybody you your sisters you can go to Walmart and everybody just like that brother down here you know was there and Wade and June was walking through Walmart and and he was going along you know walking and he looked I see and he back back come over and said where do y'all go to church well you know what he pulled up in Gillsville the other day and he didn't recognize me who was it got out somebody inhow he he he just wheed off the road and came straight down in he had a guy in the thing with him and when he did he seen me he said oh okay he said I was just going to stop and ask them sisters where'd they go to church all Peggy said I was going to stop see he didn't recognize her but when he recognized me he said I know where she goes church now well that's that's good you know you sisters you stand out I mean well man just a garbage in a home ain't nothing nice about us but you you Sisters You Stand Out you hire you dress no makeup and the things like that see you stand out well praise God I've been to Israel when you would think the women of Israel would be dressed right and doing right no way they're worst in America as far as most of it never saw a woman in Israel outside of the Believers that had on a dress but you understand what I'm saying could it be that we have put forth something for this message that is not the correct way for it to be put forth but Heaven help you to ever think about somebody that their family is in the message and you think that they something different you ought to think the good you see I know I'm hateful but our kids are here why is it your kids don't want to come well brother tell us the way you preach don't play cuz you can get in trouble playing okay just be honest and say listen I probably failed and I'll go do it I've told you some of you need to go to your families and apologize to them for the way you tried to pound this message into them and tried to change them and make them believe it in the thing you said I don't back up why not tell them I'm sorry I evidently didn't live before you the way I needed to live yes sir there's where Temperance comes in it makes red faces don't it okay all right but is that true see we can take like I said we can say what brother Dale brother Brandon was talking about the two different kinds and he saying that the the uh one that doesn't have Holy Ghost Temperance is the one with the ungodly uncontrollable temper well now he didn't say that right amen he just made a statement and see you justify yourself by saying it he's not talk about me yeah no okay go to number six maybe this will answer it paragraph 87 now I want to say this that there are some people who have a portion of this virtue knowledge wisdom patience and so forth that don't even profess to be a Christian now we just we're teaching Sunday school and that's true there some people have a portion of this that don't even pretend to be Christian but that doesn't now watch his answer that won't do it having a portion of these things without the Holy Ghost won't do it having the gifts without the virtues stumbled and block listen to what he says that won't do it it's like a blackbird trying to put peacock feathers in his wings now he's talking about not two different kind of Virtues but some have a portion of these things that claim to be Christians right he said that's like a peac with a you know the Buzzard the Blackbird trying to put peacock feathers in make him a peacock he only disgraces himself be better to stay a blackbird see when he tries to exercise these things without being a Christian he's just simply all out of place when I started preaching this part when I started with the justification the sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and bringing those things down to the level I brought it it I was expecting a lot of people to probably leave I told it you know I said we probably lost internet people come find out we increase well thank God but how many of you have faced yourself you know you don't you don't face me I'm not in the mirror looking back at you how many of you faced yourself and all this series and said well Lord could it be that I need a new birth now we're coming up to the Statue of a perfect man so it's very easily for us to say could it be Lord I need these virtues because that's definite see the Born Again experience between you and God the definite part we've got to have these virtues that's that's not a question that's definite amen these are required amen y well do we have them well where you at brother Dale I've only never told you but one thing in my life I question God about where I was and this was his statement and you know it verbatim right he said if you'll have patience with the people said it'll prove you got patience amen well and you know what I TR to work on with patience right cuz we that supposed to be okay but listen a continuation from the other on Blasphemous names goes right on through but it'll be number seven of what we're picking up here so let's go to it and end the message with this part cuz it's this is just this directly under where he was saying it on the Blasphemous names about that we had these two he said patience and so forth there's a mockery of it a pretending to be a nature given Faith listen a nature given virtue there's a nature given Temperance all these things are nature given now he's not talking about the New Birth there right that's just nature given right amen and that's good and wonderful look and the biggest part of our faith is mental Faith by hearing the word it brings us to a mental con recognition of God but if this coming from above oh brother if it ever strikes this there's a God Godly spiritual Faith then what does that Faith do that Faith only recognizes the word nobody WR anything else it only recognizes the word you know the word is still God and always will be and when the word itself is pouring into our faith now let's use that right there as a thought let's see how that you get these virtues in case you haven't followed it with the fact of eating and and uh these were the things that Adam is God will automatically add it because all we got to do is bring him the word then he pushes it back out in case you haven't done it just listen to this statement amen and when the word itself now we're talking about Christians now right Christians we're talking about the stature of perfect land we're not talking about this trying to get you born again and you got to have a spiritual Revelation that's wonderful but just bring that up in your thoughts tonight to where we're at and when the word itself is pouring into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation amen have you ever had God to speak to you while somebody was preaching and show you something that is not even the thing maybe he's preaching absolutely amen sir amen you know he's preaching on Daniel 70 weeks or something and God drops into your heart and shows you one God right shows you predestination well you know what brother randam said a preacher was supposed to to do a preacher only breaks the spell that Satan has over your eyes now that's the verbatum almost to where God can come and speak to you you remember what I've always said then when God speaks to you while somebody's preaching just raise your hand and say my family my kids my husband my wife right while it's being revealed to you just speak to him and thank him for it you will see it'll work amen so now what and when the word itself is poured into our faith our mental Faith becomes a spiritual Revelation watch and Upon This Rock I'll build my church see not upon a mental conception of church joining a mental conception of that but upon the Revelation when them streams cuz remember blus names he's explaining the dream of sister Shepherd and how she was concerned whether she had the holy ghost or not and the water was running down and all and if you'll I'll find it for you in there he talks about her being charitable and that but in one statement he makes it he said God accepted her foundation well what's the foundation in other words God was telling the lady she was born again amen right not upon a mental concept of church joining a mental concept of that but upon the Revelation when them streams of Grace has poured into that mental faith that you've got then upon this a spiritual Revelation I'll build my church and the gates of hell can't Prevail against it see that shows they would be against it but it'll never Prevail oh what a glorious thing now see the faith these five streams so do you see it's no point of us trying to play and to try to manufacture something as the prophet said it's just just remain a blackbird is better than trying to put peacock feathers in cuz at least you know what's that you know what it is but see we should be the same thing all the time our familyes should not see us one time and then another time see us with a little hatred a little thoughts about somebody well you know that person they said I just already just told them off well that shouldn't be done in any of our Lives we should put it to the point of saying whatever it takes Lord make me what I need to be right right is that your desire just to what he wants me to be not what I want to be what he wants me to be then the people around you will just automatically see it amen right my family oh yeah they love me as the baby boy and all of the family but they care nothing about coming around to hear us and I pray that I've never made them you know do something because of my own actions and ways but now you let one of them get sick you let them get sick they'll come looking this up you know well maybe that's enough that part of it yeah but I just I just want to be what God wants me to be and being Pastor that puts you in a position see that that you know sometimes you got to speak hard sometimes you got to say things rough and all but I I like what the two you know that's told it one lady said brother R called her a buzzard and other lady heard the same message that he called her an eagle if my holling and screaming at you or correcting or saying something hard that you say well he's talking about me well you know I might not be talking about you I might be talking about the person sitting next to you but irregardless why shouldn't we take it correctly and say thank you thank you for correcting me for telling me you know what I need to be and just say thank you Lord oh yeah I've had people tell me things I didn't like but you know what I analyze to see whether that's right or not and if it is then I say thank you Lord and if it's not right then I just say well thank you Lord for them saying it anyway cuz I needed it like I said about the man slapping my jaws I needed that see cuz I always wondered if I could take that you know but if you ever if you've ever been in a situation I told another another brother one time I said somebody will try you one day to see they're going to try you everybody's going to be tried you know road rage all of that you know why can't you just wave and say thank you let everything's all right you know it's hard to do right cuz on you thinking about what could have killed me they could have done this were you not dead why not think about it as child training you know to help us amen but you see that's where people would take what they want to take about what you're saying and that puts it in a hard position because then you're the one to get blind for it well I have no problems with being blind for what's right no problems with it s I've always said if you got any problem come talk to me don't go talk to somebody else just come talk to me about it and tell me no problem we'll get to that on brotherly kindness and you'll see that with brotherly kindness I have been able to do a lot of things that other ministers don't do you know to put up with people there was a situation here in the church one time years ago and I was praying desperately Lord what what must I do and this is what he said he said I put it in your hands you can do what you want to that's what he told me it's anytime you want to you can do what you want to you know what till this day I ain't never done what I could have done I've never done it you said well that's okay that's me you see that's that's but he just told me he said it's up to you I sure ain't going to put myself in no category but what brother brandom do when that man and woman was hugging and kissing and everything out in the congregation the holy spirit said speak the word and they'll carry them out of here what did he say he said I forgive you you see I believe in a guard like that don't you come on musicians I didn't want to try to put in the next one with you know brotherly kindness and all to try to pack into it one time so we're kind of short tonight it ain't even 8:30 yet all right so we're giving maybe sister Genie doesn't have to sit too long okay she wouldn't have cared all right but you see church maybe that maybe that's some of the patience you know and we have you know because that's we need patience you I've always said there's one thing about it a preacher does one or two things he either helps you or hurts you and if you take the hurt right then you're okay because it'll help you you know all right see let Christ live and you'll see that that your your temper part will go away and you'll see that you can look at somebody and actually love them instead of hating them no matter what they say that you can actually love them and pray for them controlling that tongue cuz you've heard great messages about it hav you from the prophet and by every preacher that you've ever seen in your life has always preached on the tongue and how that's uncontrollable right ever Baptist preacher in the world preached on uncontrollable tongue and there was the one that had the longest tongue in the whole building all right let's St what we got brother 22 just think about it Temperance goes before me and with his loving hand he leads the way right and with each day I whisper iore just be like him you know they call them Christians remember that in the Bible they never listed at all the building the places Antioch I believe right the Bible said they call them Christians why didn't they call up other churches and other thing because they could see those people was Christ Living they could see Christ Living in their heart and they called him Christians would that be an honor a glory to be called Christians anybody have a need I see chm and then I take I just look to him I am when he is each step I take I know that he will guide you love him you know if you love him you got to love me will be taken each step I take we'll send W back to the back he can pass these out to everybody you know and give a take those and just read them and think about it comes what may the way this will to the pr my I know that he will guide me to High Ground he everes me until last will be each step I take just leads me closer Home Step by take my savior goes be Wonder all we got to do is just follow in his footprints he leads just following his footprint breath whisper he didn't have a temper but he had a sternness about him to walk with him each that when they would even do what they do he'd run them out of the temple each step I take I know come on Church the Bible says be angry to Higher Ground and sin not he ever me on you know what that means a Christian until is subject to anger the last step will be Tak just don't let that the Bible said Don't Let the Sun Go Down on your wrath it brother random said Jesus got angry when he drove him out of the Temple but he didn't get mad a lot of difference in it same man climbed up on a cross and died for the people it wasn't anger it a difference between anger and being mad but mad is uncontrollable I hope it'll just don't own you what I'm trying to say we're human beings living in the human world motivated by these things but let's just walk the best we can and then we'll find out all those things will be taken care of down the road and he he'll place them upon our faith and make us to the pl right father we thank you for tonight we just pray that what we said I know that spoke hard than Lord but it Bears down on our hearts and things that where we all are not trying to make something that we're up here and they're down there and all this we're just all struggling Lord to try to find your your will and your thoughts for our hearts and our lives go home with us give us all a safe journey home and let the Wheels turn on the cars and US think about that if we just have you and us that temper will go out and we'll be patient we'll have knowledge we'll have eternal life we love you and we thank you guide us all in Jesus name amen you dismiss Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of all Jesus be the Lord of
