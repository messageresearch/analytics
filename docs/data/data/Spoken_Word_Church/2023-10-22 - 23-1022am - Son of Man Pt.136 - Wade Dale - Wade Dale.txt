to keep on fighting the good fight of Faith so let's bow our heads we're going to go back on the son of man part 135 so we'll get up to statute of perfect man one of these days so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for the day you've give us thank you for an opportunity to speak to the greatest people that ever walked on the face of this Earth Lord I pray that you would be with Lord the ones that are not here the kids and young adults and adults that are coming back from the the Youth Camp Lord I pray that you'd be with them Father bless the ones that are sick Lord not with us today Lord be with the ones that are grieving father I pray that should be with them uh we have a a family back home the Ferguson family just lost their their dad a couple days ago Lord went to funeral home last night and paid our respects Lord we just I told somebody Lord I I I talked to you I I don't I want to see a birth or a wedding or a baptism I'm tired of funerals Lord I pray that you'd help us though that we will destroy death in this end time that's what I believe this message is given you sent that message through a prophet to a group of people to destroy death and I truly believe that Lord and I pray that we would be the ones that see it Lord but if not somebody will we know that you already have that in your plan you it's already in the Plan of Redemption can't be changed you can't change your mind you knew this was what it was going to be and you knew who would be here Lord we're just preaching and praying Lord that that we just all rise up into that faith for the time that we need for the resurrection father just bless us in this service in Jesus name amen the Bible tells us in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh are we not hooked up and that word was made made flesh all right we know that was we know that was back in Jesus's day he was the word made flesh but now if that person is inside your flesh he's made your yes sir flesh the word of God you say oh no that no we ain't got far enough because this flesh right here's got to be changed by what the word of God all right so what's inside of you is the word and then it's being made flesh now and dwelt among us we come today to dwell among each other the word made flesh and we beheld his glory the GL the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you go and be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word John 3:3 I'll continue on Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see or understand the kingdom of God I'm going to background just a little bit for for some of the ones that hadn't been here we believe in this church that we believe in justification ation sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost makes the new birth all right not believing this message not having an emotion not having a come on somebody y'all can amen if you need to okay but he can't see the kingdom of God unless you're born again unless the spirit of God has come inside of you burnt your own nature out and put hisself inside of you that's the new birth all right because remember in this age we have anointed ones that can be anointed on your flesh and on your spirit realm and still be black in your soul die and go to hell that's right that's what the prophet said all right so we believe that the three stages takes you to the New Birth all right and I want to get get me and brother um who was the last one here brother George Quinn were talking about um people being saved and we covered this one time before there's a there's a group of people that's going to be saved all right believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved all right that's not bride that's that's beginning to be bride but that's not bride so there's going to be a group of people that say listen the world's going to have 10 times a million times more people outside the city than they are inside that City cuz only the bride gets to live inside that City with 144,000 is everybody with me so there is a special group of people that that that God sent his son through him he told us you must be born again not you might or you might need to be no you must be to even see the kingdom of God so there's going to be a lot of people though that don't get the new birth cuz foolish version in the end time is a virgin of the word of God but just hadn't went any further our had some false teaching that just said oh just believe the message can't you press play I'm just me I'm just who I am so we part of this we part of the Bride but John 16:12 watch now he's going to separate this and when he separates it that's the reason we're going up to Statue of perfect man because only the holy ghost in your soul is going to take you up that statue of perfect man everybody with me that it's only the holy ghost in your soul because these are not the virtues of a human mortal man these are not the virtues of your DNA that come from your mom and daddy these come from your spiritual DNA from your soul working it it way out right so that we can display them and we'll talk about it this afternoon uh the psych service on adoption that's what we we are we are required we are uh and brother M tells us here in just a few minutes that your new birth and adoption is two different things I'm going to read you the quote we know that but sometimes the people in the message don't know that you receive the spirit of adoption but you are not adopted as soon as you come into to the you're a baby you don't know how to handle the word of God the Bible tells us Ezekiel said I'll give you a new heart and a new spirit and brother R tells us definitely that's not the spirit of God that's the spirit so you can get along with yourself or start getting along with God come to church read your Bible do those things and then I'll put my spirit inside of you all right now we've been through all these things but just background John 16:12 said I have many things to say unto you this is Jesus now but you cannot bear them now all right he didn't waste a lot of time telling them stuff that was going to be revealed because they didn't have the Holy Ghost all right the Holy Ghost wasn't given until the day of Pentecost right everybody that was anointing that was working during that time with Abraham Isaac Jacob Joseph all those different ones and as brother uh was saying here you know he said there there's flaws like brother Bob said there's flaws in every one of them but if David would have had the new birth in his soul he would not have done what he did If Abraham had the new birth in his soul he would not have done what he did all right but that anointing under the blood of bulls and goats they'll be there they'll be in heaven amen right cuz that's the Old Testament but that's under bulls and goats which only covered sin it didn't do away with sin praise God in this time it's just like he was reading such were some of you but you're washed you wasn't washed by an animal's blood though come on you were Washed by the blood of a man the man Christ Jesus and that way he could wash you out and that he's the only one that can impart his soul into your soul that was the problem with with Adam Adam thought he could save Eve he couldn't save Eve he wasn't a savior but it was a type of the Savior coming on down here in 8030 and all the different things and preaching the Ser preaching the message for three and a half years to take a bride out of a group of people so the bride is what we're talking about today there are groups of other people that's going to be saved and and like I said they're going to fill this Earth completely full but there's only going to be a certain group inside that City all right cuz I'm going to read it to you in a minute brother Brown says there be there's Brides brides churches Brides but they'll come one that's right remember God had to divorce many people many groups Israel in the Old Testament he had to put her away brother R said he put the Baptist away he put the Methodist away why CU he was married to them at one time they had the truth at one time Wesley was a church age messenger he had had the truth but not all he had partial Truth All right so we're coming to a place to where as brother Ram said all the Loose Ends will be tied up all right and as brother George was I know y'all know that that was my favorite quote too where brother George was said the m j Malachi 4 will come to do two things number one turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers back to right here and then reveal the seven Thunders which are contained in the Seven Seals these divinely reveal mystery truths what to a group of people not to the world not to a denomination not to an idea but to you and me he'll bring that word and it'll make you make you absolutely be these virtues if you'll just yield yourself to it but remember we preaching the other day brother R said the Holy Holy Ghost is timid even the Holy Ghost you got inside of you is timid right read the sermon doors and doors brother Brown said once you let God in he said there still doors now you know how I feel about it if I was a holy ghost brother Mark I'd be going what's behind that door I got to quit doing that but what's behind that door no the Holy Ghost stands in front of the door he said if you want to let me in you let me in if you don't then but you're not going to live a fulfilled life you're not going to live a life that's that's mandated for this church age all right not another age this age right here Jesus said how be it he he the person the spirit of Truth is come he will guide you into all truth amen it didn't say a little bit it said all Truth for he shall not now see is what we was talking about the other day for he shall not speak of himself you know why cuz when he comes here he's speaking to you the voice now is in the bride he's speaking of his bride everybody knows me but they also know June and June's my bride and she's the one I want you to give all the accolades to not me for putting up with me she does a lot gets a lot of accolades from all of y'all that know me sister Regina says thank you sister bless your heart we're humans but he shall not speak of himself in other words we know one thing for sure Jesus is not here right now in corporal body he's not here right now so where is he if he's here he's in his bride he's not a spook that floats around he's inside of you and when your hand moves God hands move so whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come praise God brother Ram said Revelation is the greatest thing that a bride can get the most powerful thing we have in our hands today is the true revelation of one God the true Revelation there's no eternal hell the true Revelation that we don't have to stand a judgment the true Revelation that that in the end time we're just not going to die and then not wake somebody to get us back up somebody in this age is going to get us out of the ground death will be destroyed in a group of people brother Brown says look you must be born again 1961 you're still what you are until actually you're actually born again of the spirit of God what mean he says it doesn't change you what your Creed coming to church reading your Bible on that don't change you hallu the new birth is an experience something that you experience something that takes place all right inside of you not just an emotion that can you know you'll be here one day and down here the next we have enough of that in the spirit realm but in your soul today you should know that you know that you know that there's something down in there motivating you besides what was out in the world as brother Bob was reading all those different things that Paul had in his congregation come on Paul was preaching that was his congregation that that brother Rob was talking about he said such for some of you but there's a way out you've been washed not by regular water you've been washed by what the water of the word which brother R now tells us that's the bleeding word so it's a bleeding word of God that we have in the end time and brother Brown tells us the reason we're going to have to get back to this statue of perfect man is because man has got involved all right so now remember this Christ in the true church is a con continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church church and defile it make it lukew formal and Powerless remember that word dunamis is the power that Jesus said we should have and that we would have on day of Pentecost it was taken away from the church or eroded by man's ideas I'm saying probably most in the message too they've diluted this thing down to where you can't even follow it anymore somebody say Amen cuz it is you we we fight it all the time all right now here's Jesus in John 17 now now there's a a Lord's Prayer which is for everybody all right that's okay this prayer Jesus was getting ready to go to the cross this is actually spoken Around The Garden of Gethsemane time and he's praying to the father about a group of people not the world cuz watch for I have given unto them The Words which thou gavest me and they have received them and have known surely that I came out from thee and they have believe that thou did send me now listen that wasn't the them 12 that was sitting there in front of they didn't understand who he was and one of them was Judas they didn't understand but after the Holy Ghost fail he did but he's praying a prayer in the future yes amen I pray for them I pray not for the world I'm reading the Bible but for them which thou Hast given me the children of God the progeny the Genesis 12627 of God we'll get into that in just a second I pray not for the world for them which thou has given me for they are thine and all mine are thine and thine or mine cuz it's the same person wait a minute and I'm glorified in you father oh it says I am glorified in them h right and now I am no more in the world in other words I'm getting ready to leave but these this group of people are in the world now he didn't pray to get us out of the world he prayed to keep the world out of us and I come to thee Holy Father keep through thine own name Those whom thou Hast given me that's why the name had to be restored in the end time amen we don't just baptize the name of the Lord Jesus Christ because brother R said do it it was already in the Bible okay all these major doctrines were already in the Bible we just couldn't see them because it took a prophet to unveil our eyes all right everybody with me cuz I know a lot of people said in here were trinitarians yes you were well I wasn't cuz I was nothing yeah me and you keep through n own thine own name Those whom thou Hast given me that they may be one yes now this is Jesus he can't lie right whatever he says the word of God God cuz he is a word of God this is not secondhand information this is not number two talking to number one that they may be one as we are now how was he in the father one I told you before in this message we are the biggest tunist people you ever seen in your life there's Jesus and there's this and there's that and he's coming and oh he's here no he's you yes he said that they may be one now how was him and the father one it wasn't two separate people that's right as we are yes while I was with them in the world I kept them in thy name praise God Amen and those that thou givest me I have kept praise God and none of them is lost except the son of predition that the scripture might be full F now watch and now come I to thee in other words he's leaving the the Corporal body everything's getting ready to leave but he's not leaving in the way we say leave cuz the world saw him leave and they don't know where he's at today we do and these things I speak in the world that they might have my joy fulfilled in themsel he put it right back to me and you that Soul inside of you never had a day that's all inside you never had a bad thought if you're born again today you are God made manifest in another form called a bride so you can't be lost our bad day is in our spirit realm and our flesh just manifest what that is cuz remember God can't change his mind if he ever loved you before the foundation of the world he can never unlove you don't ever tell me say oh God don't love me I'm going through all no that's a lie he loves you you just need to try to love him back John 17: 19 yeah I'm kind of preaching today sorry about that and for their sakes look for their sakes I sanctify myself yes could have had a wife brother Brown said could have had all these different things because he's a human man but he set himself aside so that he could be what an example of the statute of perfect man he is the statute of perfect man not an example he is that that they also might be Sanctified through the what through the truth neither pray I for these alone now watch but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word now that's another group of people that's bringing another group of people in all right that they all may be one now when we all get to Glory when we all get over there in the in the new city we're going to be in the city millions are going to be outside but praise God they got eternal life just like you do all right even a cup of water in my name they'll be given eternal life but I don't want to stand at the white Throne judgment and be judged by my words or that I gave brother Donnie a glass of water and hope that's going to help me no no if you have the new birth today you're already judged how can the judge judge a judge if he's a righteous judge and he's inside of you that's where your judgment comes your judgment comes right here that's why it is a it is imperative that we come to church that we listen to a five-fold Ministry you can't get it out there oh you can get parts of it but you'll never come to that statue of perfect man without somebody looking you in the face and saying you ain't doing this right right or you are doing this right and we praise God that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one what one in us that the world May believe that thou has sent me yes and the glory which thou gavest me I have given themen that's why Paul picked that up Paul wasn't standing there but by the Holy Ghost Paul picked that up and in Romans he said we're hirs yes and join HS with Christ join HS I I brother um hild debrand God bless his soul brother Harold he preached years and years ago and he said whatever God gets whatever Jesus gets you get if you're joint airs he said it's not like this he said you have joint Airship if this is Christ and this is you you get join Airship because of this right here all right cuz you're his yes that they may be one even as we are one that's the second time he said that in this prayer oh we're going to get to a third part right here I in them and thou in me is that two or three people running around no one that they may be what made perfect in one the world may and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them look as thou Hast loved me there's your joint Airship again yes God canot love you that's right right brother R sh on the first seal we know one thing's for sure the brother Ry on that first seal when it opened it was contrary to a lot what he had already preached everybody with me don't get quiet on me he said he would have made a horrible mistake if he' had preached the notes that he had he said on the second third and fourth seal he said this is far beyond what I thought it was cuz he thought the souls under the altar were Christians he thought the wild horse rider was and the or was the Holy Ghost he preached Mighty conquer in 1959 progressive revelation he was brother rown was going through that Revelation and when he gets to the seals though he sees that first seal open and he's like I better be quiet and listen to what this Angel's telling me amen cuz I made a horrible mistake he just jumped down and preached it and it would have been wrong yes sorry about that but it's what he said but now watch this seal though is broken not to the world come on that's right now it's the greatest week of sermon since Jesus walked on the face of this Earth no doubt cuz he's the one that came and spoke it he said here stands a lamb with a book in his hand now where where was he pointing over there no he said here stands a lamb and there goes a white horse rider in other words something was riding off a a revelation that he didn't need was riding away but now watch what he's doing now watch he's he's been talking about church he talks about church and bride's whole sermon all right and then all back before church and then bride but watch he comes down to the opening the seals he said oh there's a different group of people here I've been preaching church and bride together he's fixing to separate it right here all right broken to who not to Christ but to the church now watch what he does but to the church notice now and he stops he's says oh my that just makes me tremble what he got a revelation right there I I I I hope the church truly understands it see what I mean you people I'm going to call you bride see that you'll understand so only the bride is going to understand the opening of these seals and even the bride that was there didn't understand them I'll read you a quote in just a minute and this is my quote never since Jesus Christ was on this Earth has Satan had such a form able opponent as the bride sitting right here today and the bride around the world brother BR said we have Satan's answer that was in the 60s we ought to be mature enough to have his answer now where he won't know what to do with us or how to or how to deal with us brother Ramy 1965 the rising of the sun now he continues now this is after the seals but he's the seals have been opened so he knows there's a bride and he knows there's a church cuz there's been churches churches look Bri Brides brides churches Brides brides wow but there has to come what Hallelujah there has to come a real bride now not the other ones were false they just didn't have all the Revelation there must come one that not only has got the mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes that church live moving the power of's Resurrection until we come to that place until we find that place look so you got to find it right it's not automatic until we find that place sir what good does it do to polish the hubs that's right amen Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing what now the word so the word of God in power is what separates things yes the word byself there's not it it's dead letter like I said the other day cheapest thing you can do is take a white piece of paper and put Black Ink on it that's cheapest thing you can do but you make that live that's on that page yes sir the devil can't do anything with that for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing aunder of Soul and Spirit so God sent us a prophet to divide the soul from the spirit and of the joint marrow which is your flesh amen and is the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so let's break this down just for a minute I know we've been through this before but let's just background for a minute let's look at the soul you have a soul you are a person everybody that's born from a womb has a soul yes right that is a human all right now animals do not we know that and thank God the brother Ram told us that that's right that they have a nature and they're part of Nature and and but they don't have a soul to discern good from Evil that's right all right we have a soul and that soul is what to do to for you to come to the age of account ability and discern right from wrong good from Evil all right so Genesis 126 you know that's all of you know that's my favorite scripture genis 126 is where let us make man in our own image here we go back to the same man come on I just got this that's the same man that was talking to us in John 17 he was talking about that Genesis one man not Genesis 2:7 Genesis 126 at Genesis let us make man and our own image right and after our likeness and let him have dominion over the fish of the sea and foul of the air everything that creep is on the earth God said let us make man our own image God said you're perfect God said you're blessed before he put you in flesh this is before flesh this is in the mind of God this is the Genesis 126 man that's in the mind of God before the foundation of the world and when took that Genesis 126 man and put it in the 27 man he knew Adam was going to fall yes he did but to make his plan and purpose work out he had to let that happen cuz you know why God wanted hisself in human flesh we're not going to live we're not going to be Iron and Steel our new body which is this body made new yes our glorified body is not going to be Iron and Steel it's going to be flesh you are going to have flesh cuz you are a human that Genesis 1:26 man is that picture that God took of you before the foundation of the world when you were 18 to 20 years old right y'all think about the other day when Billy Paul passed away there's another Vision fulfilled I was reading it yesterday day before yesterday brother brandom on the Buckboard riding with either one of them hope or whichever one he was riding with and he pulls up to this beautiful woman his daddy she said he said who are you she said I'm Sharon Rose I'm your daughter said I'm waiting here for who Billy Billy that was in another dimension so that Vision has been fulfilled she ain't got to wait on Billy no more Billy's there we're getting close to the end folk yes sir if you don't feel the pull the end time I mean they got one and we got one pull the end time like brother Bob said pulling you away from everything that's Godly but there is a God that's pulling you John 17 said it was he's pulling you toward him back into what Fellowship like it was back in the Book of Genesis before the fall happened praise the Lord that's what he wanted he wanted you in human flesh we didn't come here in human flesh by mistake no sir no sir and that's I've said many times before your flesh don't sin right your flesh is born in sin it's dying because of that but your flesh only does what the inside Gody tells it to do so don't blame it why it's just my flesh I'm just human now there's something inside of you that could be different and it can motivate you to what you used to look at you don't look at no more that's right brother amen same hand that used to hold a beer now it holds a Bible same one amen where was it washed not this wasn't changed this was changed that's why the new birth is important most important thing you'll ever get and hold on to cuz Satan hates to lose people he hates to lose his subjects he feels comfortable inside of you if you're not born again I don't even want him comfortable in this building I want him to be the most uncomfortable person ever cuz when he goes to Lake of Fire he will be the most uncomfortable person ever and I hope that cancer demon sitting right in his head on his head amen I hate that thing Grace and peace be multiplied un you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according to his divine power we've been through this before but just bear with me trying to get everybody caught up according as his divine power now listen you have nothing inside of you that's Divine without God that's right you can call the Divine Miss whoever or Mr whoever or whatever they're not Divine only one Divine person that's God but now when he puts himself inside of you come on John 17 says then we become one according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that has called us to glory and virtue you got to be called whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises brother Bob was reading this this morning look that by these brother R said these promises you might be partakers of that divine nature that is the divine nature of God yes it is having escaped praise godall having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust now that word divine is Theos godhead of Christ spoken of the one true only true only and true God now watch look whatever can in any respect be likened to God Amen second John 17 Romans 8 ver14 for as many there are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God this is Paul preaching he's beginning to tell us how to come to adoption he's beginning be but you got to be born again first I'll read your quote here in a few minutes your new birth is not your adoption right it's separate listen you can have I I'm going to say it again you can be born again and not be adopted but you can't be adopted and not get born again pretty simple you cannot live this without the guy that is that living inside of you you just act like you own s for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but look but you have received the spirit of adoption but remember adoption is not crying so this whoever this whatever this part of your journey or the plan is get born again and you'll receive the spirit of adoption in other words puts you in the family we'll talk about this afternoon listen just like brother Dale's always said God's not going to adopt Satan's kids he adopts his own children but you got to be in the family if you're not born again you're not in the family that's right but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy amen when we first get born again it's a new thing cuz it talks about a new creation a new creature your old nature remember you that's why you can't divorce it brother Brown said or hang it up in the closet it's got to die cuz if you don't it's going to come back every time it's going to raise up every time but when the thing's dead see when it's dead ain't going to bother you CU remember we're dead in Christ we died in him but we receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry daddy daddy the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit that what that we are are the children of God yes look and if children here's Paul picking up the thought from John 17 and if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Christ listen when Jim's mother passed away she didn't invite Gary CR to come to the F to the U you know the lawyer didn't send brother Gary CR raise your hand up I'll tell who you are that Brother Gary CR they they didn't I don't know why I did that I know you hate that but I'm sorry I'm sorry you'll get used to it you'll get used to it I'm not saying nothing else but anyway the lawyer did not call Brother Gary CR to come to our uh to not our but their family you know reading of the well right did you get one brother Dy oh why why didn't you get one you wer part of the family only family members get to come to the reading of the well unless there's some circumstance where you like somebody else you want give them something else but today we have come to what we have come to read will yes cuz his will is his word this is the will this is what we get open it up and read it sometime or by the foolishness of preaching let him tell you about it sometime and if children then HS HS of God and join HS with Christ why he calls us today to this reading of the well because we're the children of God if you're not you're sitting close to one so just receive the spirit of God if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together so what he put that in there that we're HS and Joint HS with Christ we're in the family we're his kids now we know we were before the foundation of the world but listen you were lost when you got here yes sir they was nothing holy about you that's right they was nothing holy about me and what did Bob just read Hallelujah brother Bob said some of you were what hor mongers effeminate boy just read that whole list such for some of you well that ain't Holy Ghost filed people they are now but they weren't then that's why the new birth is God coming inside your soul and burning that thing out Hallelujah and you become a new creature am yes sir why we believe in the new birth in this church more than anybody you'll ever hear we believe in an experience with God 1 Peter 2 vers1 says wherefore laying aside all malice and G now we're still on the new birth we're still in the soul cuz listen your new birth is in your soul yes you don't get a new birth in your spirit you get a new birth in your soul then your spirit then is what it is motivated by the soul to live these virtues all right cuz they're already in there the prophet of God say you get everything you need for your journey well guess what guess what Hey sister Rebecca bring a visitor will you hey man God bless you enjoy yourself I may holler at you in a minute I just forgot my thought what was I talking about y'all weren't listening to either of you that told me what I was talking about huh talk about the new bir but oh now okay thank you but you got everything you needed when you started your journey right well why do we need this preach to us brother why do we need this preach to us really really give me c keys come here David come here David come here buddy this is Brother David M let's said give come here here I want you to drive your parents home today okay you drive the car and you be careful but drive them home because listen he's a human being is he not does he not have all the faculties that he needs for his journey but he's a baby he's not a baby now but he is not able to drive that car give that back to your daddy if he does we need to clear the lot first but that's an that's just a prime example we get everything you need at in New Birth but you got to grow up then then man I say man teaches us that when we get 16 or 17 we can drive a car I kind of doubt that myself already too where's Abby Grace oh she's in the back running the thing all right lay hands on the sick and they shall recover I hate this thing we'll get it changed but look the Bible tells us though look as newborn babes right here desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby there's a desire put inside of you to eat so Brother David when he gets Michael's age or or close to it he can drive a car he's a human right he has five fingers on each hand toes eyes but what's the problem his maturity has not come to a place where daddy can hand him the KY and say here drive us home that's right cuz it'd be a wreck it'd be a disaster God knows that about you too we're all a wreck and a disaster without God but as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that you may grow thereby if so be that we have tasted that the Lord is gracious once you get born again you absolutely have a thirst for God that you never had before or you didn't get it or you didn't get [Applause] it there's something inside of you just like a human being you say feed me amen yes then when you get Michael's age your mama has to get three jobs to feed him but he's still a human but he's come to maturity you know what he's come to now where he can get buy his own food if he needs to we used to depend on Mom and Daddy for everything right but we come to maturity well some cuz see like some Christians won't come to maturity newborn babes Desiring send mle of the word now here here God here the Lord is in your house but you got that door locked of Pride you got that door locked of this you got that door locked of this you got that door locked of this and you say hey don't mess in my business but you're still a son cuz we're going to talk about adoption this afternoon where there's several sons in the family but really only one gets adopted cuz he is Head and Shoulders Above the Rest he gets a good report well that's the same way with the Holy Ghost with us and we'll read it this afternoon where brother Ram um dramatizes that the Holy Ghost you know is your tutor and he goes and sees you and he turns around tells the father said hey he's not doing what you said to do he's not coming to church he's not reading the Bible oh man well I can't use him check the next guy out so the next son you know he he does everything you know he does everything the father ask him to do he U he gets into the will sees what's his and says hey that's mine well then the Holy Ghost is going to say hey you going to be proud of this guy chip all off the old block is what he says we'll read it this afternoon but that's coming to adoption coming to adoption is not just coming to church and saying I'm born again I believe the message of the hour I got nothing to do with it because it's two separate things that's right to him coming as a living Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious that's us we're still on the soul because the soul is different from your spirit abely your soul has Faith or doubt that's it that's it you're not half born again your sisters never get half give half birth to a child did you no you birthed a child just TR you can't give them back can't give them back you got to keep them they're yours that's what God says about us sometimes he they're mine I'm ashamed of them but they're mine praise God brother Bri says look when a man is Born Again of the spirit of God God gives him a checkbook now look God gives him a checkbook that'll last him all through life journey and at the bottom of each check has got Jesus's name signed why you're still a baby yes he can't trust you with everything he can give give you the check my name signed on it but I got to make sure this is right but there's going to come a time in adoption where brother Brown say he gives you the checkbook and you put your name on it all right so that's why this church has been built on and we believe in growth development we don't believe in just coming to church and being a message believer that's right my dad has fought for years to get people to see that there is a growth in this message all right and it's all in the Bible it's not some you know Samuel Dale Theory my dad and at the bottom of each check has got Jesus's name signed to it you just filling out for whatever redemp Redemptive blessing you need it's yours already prayed paid for and prayed for now surely you're not afraid that it won't be cashed if you're afraid you just hold that book in your pocket brother BR was talking about fixing to do a prayer line so now let's go to the spirit realm because remember in your spirit realm there's what five senses memory reasoning conscious n affection and Imagination contrary to God from the get-go amen what's hurt what hurts you more than anything your memory I can remember what I did praise God God can't that's reasoning sure the Bible says come let us reason together but there's sometimes we reason oursel away from the word of God and our definitely our conscience is not of God you ought to see all the filthy thoughts that goes through all our heads not me well you're lying so that's another one you got to get rid of all right memory reason conscious affection which is just what fio love right not agapy love fio love and then imagination is there an imagination in God Lord no well I imagine no God says this is the way it's going to be and we have to as brother R says we told the line amen so second of Peter 1 verse5 we're moving into the spirit Realm of the person and besides this besides what besides the divine nature besides the new birth giving all diligence add to your faith it says now it's your faith Right add to your faith amen virtue and to Virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity brother Ram said some of these virtues you can just naturally live but these are god-given virtues that make you act like God not like the world all right Ephesians 4:14 says we henceforth be no more children so we move from that heirs and Joint airs we move from that crybaby stage right somebody with me you move from that crybaby stage you've let God work inside your spirit realm you've opened all the doors that you had closed let him start working through what by the word of God Amen that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro the look and carried about with every wind of Doctrine wow by the slight of preachers men and cunning craftiness whereby they line weight to deceive Satan's still there because remember Satan's playground is your spirit if he's in your soul you're not born again so you not even in the will that's right but if you're born again if you're born again child of God your soul is sealed your soul is sealed he sned in sealed in Satan sealed out but you got a spirit realm where Satan Works through your memory your reasoning your conscious effect imagination that's the greatest battle ever fought it's not in your gray matter or your head in other words it's not physically because you got a brain it's because you was born in sin that's right with a carnal nature and that carnal Nature has to be killed by the word of God that we henceforth be no more children all right we're moving up getting a little more um uh maturity talks to and fro carried about with every wi of Doctrine listen we should be to a place now to where where false Doctrine doesn't bother us and it's out there by the slot of men and cunning crafs will by their line weight to deceive look but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in what some things all things which is the head even Christ all right is everybody with me got to rush through this real quick 1 Peter 2 verse1 ye also as Lively stones are built up everything's building up am to a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ wherefore also is contained in the scripture behold I lay in a Chief Cornerstone elect and precious cuz remember the headstone was rejected so this was taken off that's what the Bible said The Headstone was rejected but he became the chief of the Chief Cornerstone and it's just a little bitty pyramid he started building his church on him but they couldn't get all the way up there because of their ideas behold I land Zion a Chief Cornerstone elect precious and he that believe on him shall not look here's something in your will amen that he that believeth on him shall not be confounded that's right amen unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient the stone which the Builder disallowed is made the head of the corner he's going to start building his church regardless of whether you like it or not regardless of whether Satan likes it or not God's going to have a church and now he calls her bride right which is Revelations 19 it's not a bride anymore it's a wife his wife has made herself ready not the bride you're know June's not my bride anymore she was 44 years ago she's my wife now I tell people brother Mark that I've been married to the same woman 44 years and she'll stop me real quick and said no you're not married the same woman that you were 44 years ago we've all grown yeah praise the Lord you got that right for me for me for me sister Junior for me have to be careful when you say stuff and a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble look at the word taking it right back to the word right back to the will you're stumbled at it because you don't understand it being disobedient that's why we're disobedient where to also they were appointed but you are a chosen Generation Now genealogy is a generation so we must be in the gene ology of God to be in this generation chosen generation a royal priesthood holy nation peculiar people that we should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness praise God Into His Marvelous Light then you become the light amall which in times past were not a people but now yes sir are now the people of God which had look not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy 1 Peter 1:22 say look seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit and under unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently as brother Rob was talking about tat you a perfect man when you get up to brotherly kindness It's not loving somebody that loves you that's right H you got to love your neighbor as you love yourself I know most of y'all don't like your neighbors well we do cuz we're all family but I've got two gay guys that live right beside me I got to love them just as much as I love me or that ain't brotherly kindness I got to love people Jesus stood up one day and said love people that hate you really do it now not just say well I like them a little bit no you got to love them you got you got to have love for their soul because they're not born again maybe they'll see that through you if you'll project that unan love of the brethen see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever that word being is ongoing amen now there's a birth we have a birth but there's a growth birth which is virtue knowledge Temperance patience godliness because brother R said these virtues are birth into you all right Hebrews 5:10 say called of God and high priest after the order of mzc of whom we have many things to say and hard to be utter seeing they are dull of hearing Paul couldn't preach to a lot of people amen they didn't understand him hey even Peter that's right Peter the Holy Ghost filled Peter that wrote some of the Bible that we're reading right now he said Paul says things hard to be understood for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God just like brother um that was here the other day we were talking and he said you don't have to tell the Holy Ghost filled person to keep to come to church amen you can just slide that out of the way you don't have to tell the Holy Ghost person to read the Bible you don't have to preach on the Holy Ghost filled woman to not cut her hair if you're not you're not born again okay just admit it and start from there at least you start from somewhere right amen cuz remember the word is what here to divide right be the first principles of Oracles of God and are become such as have need of milk and not strong meat Paul's looking at a group of people saying Hey Y'all ought to be more mature than this amen right remember he never preached this to the Ephesians the Ephesians brother it was a mature Church they could take this predestination they could take chosen in him before the foundation of the world and that was a big old strong Mighty Church 12 people but hey it was 12 people with the Holy Ghost mature for everyone that uses milk is unskillful that's where we get in trouble we become unskillful Brother Gary CR again sorry but he is a master builder I mean look he is a Perfection is for bu I can't do that so that's his profession his brother colie was in that's his profession leave it alone get in my position that's what we're going to talk about this afternoon my position is is not that I know that I want us to know where we're at know our position know what we're put in this body for if you're fingernail have you ever took your fingernail and hit it with a hammer yeah that thing hurts but you need it cuz everywhere you move you touch it it reminds you that you did something stupid like I did where I drove nail through both them fingers with a with a nail gun for he is a baby but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age in other words Paul says there's a group that's going to St down to a buffet of steak b potato amen that's what he's saying but strong meat belongeth to them yes that are of full age even those who by reason of use that's the whole deal have their senses exercised to discern good from Evil today right now you're Discerning good from Evil yes all right there's a fight going on there's a battle in another dimension right now thank God we had a prophet that could explain that he could see streets of black going from one to the other what it was it was a demon screaming at another one all right he see the demons he said hanging on the Rafters that's real remember he said I wanted to see one of them it looked like aloop the the cartoon some of you young kids don't know that we used to have cartoons and they were black and white that's right now they got HD huge devil praise the Lord Ephesians 1 ver4 says according here's Ephesians got to have got to be funny a little bit or you go crazy according as he has chosen what Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love we weren't yes we were Unholy we were unlovable that's right that's right but now because of this chosen that we know that we were chosen we receive the new birth yes it's made us holy and Without Blame if you're born again today you will not go to the judgments you'll not go to the white Throne judgment sure there's a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body Paul explains that but you not go to the white Throne judgment praise God that's a good enough Revelation for me right now but if you're not born again don't claim that Revelation cuz you ain't got there yet look having predestinated now remember we know in this church predestination is not just setting Stone God's going to pull you through a tube cuz brother Ram didn't believe that cuz Paul explains he's by for knowledge those he forne he did predestinate so by for knowledge he knew what was going to happen saw you do it or not do it therefore he could predetermine your destiny only by for knowledge cuz listen you're still a free moral agent today you're a free moral agent the time we come to the change of the body you're going to be a free moral agan you can't take that away cuz that's the soul part the soul makes you a free mo Asia all right having predestinated us into the adoption of children now look he predestinated us unto adoption not adoption to adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the pleasure of his will adoption series brother Ram said look now what is adoption we'll stop right here what is adoption now let me get this now I don't know whether or I won't have time to get through this but I'll hit it if there's a question you can ask me a little later on something in the message listen your adoption is not your birth pretty plain isn't it that's black and white well with a little bit of yellow and a little bit red your adoption is not your birth your adoption is your placing so he's pulling it apart he's rightly dividing the word of Truth when you were born again St John 1:17 I believe when we were born of the the spirit of God we are sons of God all right put in the family but we were predestinated now here's what I'm trying to get to you for this sons of the last day we were predestinated unto adoption so only in this age could we come to adoption only in this age CU to be adopted you got to have full word all in line precepts from precept line upon line everything no false Doctrine that's right you say how can you do that we can't do that you believe this and I believe that did Jesus have a problem with his Doctrine did the father have a problem with his Doctrine where is that person where inside here is inside of you I read you where he said if you'll listen to what he's saying he'll lead you and guide you into some truth all Truth All right so let's read this real quick and then we'll then we'll stop right here and start this afternoon take a Peter 1:8 for if these things be in you and abound U brother Bob read it this morning for if these things be in you what if these things be in you and overflow abound means overflow when brother Bram had to dream sister Shepherd had a dream brother R interpreted the water was flowing out of the pyramid am but remember what was in that water sticks stones in other words when you get born again you still got trash it's called a spirit realm but as he pours the water in he said the stins came up to the top and run out that's what that right there is so because when we come to adoption listen the adoption is when when God is going to place everything in your hand and he's not going to back off no no no no no when
