just to see him no that's the main party they men good to see everybody in the house of the Lord we're glad to have our visitors with us they're from brother Simmons Church in Georgia singing there that's why I got tied up and didn't get my microphone on because I was interested in what was going on but we appreciate them coming and visiting with us we say to you welcome put up with us the best you can because we have to do everything and try to keep all the seats running this way another way but that'll work okay okay we're going to remember the youth will be practicing 11:45 12:45 12:45 and just keep that in mind and that do that part and the Lord willing brother Aaron will be ministering Forrest Wednesday so remember that keep all these other announcements and the times and the things in view we will be having a little different services top today because we're going to go through the service and then there will be a little on our time for a nanny to have a little birthday party and then we're going in to the youth will be what the adults will be taking some of them the youth to have a thing this afternoon after the evening service so this be kind of a hard day around here but this prayer to the Lord would bless I mean if you like turning your scriptures turn to the visions one seasons one that's going to be a very very odd my wife asked me something about what are you going to preach on beans you finish the series I said well I don't know might start another one so we may get into something and doing but it's going to be a very odd approach to doing you know when once we get into it so just bear with me and and listen to what I'm trying to say okay so we'll go to Ephesians 1 Lord Jesus we thank you for an opportunity of being here today thank you for your love and your understanding thank you for you we pray that you just bless each and every one of us remember the sick among us Lord in each time each one in deliver you got an order remember brother I own brother die old sister marry their Lord sister Johnny sister Jean and Lord all of these others that are sick among us and all remember a wife Lord with their back and their problems and all and just let your loving grace be with all of us we love you and we thank you forgive our sins and lead us by thy grace keep us in jesus name amen we're going to verse 1 Ephesians 1 Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings were not in heavenly places in Christ and once according as he had chosen us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will amen you may be seated Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now I want to try to it may run into a few services maybe we won't try to me but it may run into a few services on predestination I haven't decided totally which direction I'm going in but I want you to think about what is being said in the scriptures because that's the main thing you know take the scriptures and read them for yourself and see what is being said in those scriptures and and you know then that way you can can see things and and we read here in Ephesians it says we were chosen and that he chosen us in him will see we were we were like we've always been coming up to than the churches and I see we thought all of our life that we sought God we sought God come find out is God seeking us you said well I thought oh god that's what I want to do today I want to throw something out to you that's gonna go this way and then it's gonna go this way so now you're gonna have to pull them together alright see when you say well the Bible says no man salt God at any time you said what Brody Dalle I remember when when I cried and I prayed and I fasted and I've done a lot of things and in all and and I saw God for four years you know well now that's not meaning you didn't do that when the Bible says no man salt Gardena it doesn't mean that you did not go through them he's not denying that you cried you prayed you fasted you you've done everything you could do trying to find God because we know we did and and that's true but the point is to not put the emphasis upon that but you know of us trying to search for him or seeking out him he was seeking us did we look back and I won't I'll try not to read too much today but this get some thoughts to what I want you to think about a little bit see in the Garden of Eden when man fell it was not Adam running around hunting God it was Adam running around hiding from God right he got among the bushes and the things and he he was hiding it was God searching for Adam but if you were to ask Adam now Adam what you do well I realized there was something wrong guy and I I do it and in and out a little bit problems with you know facing God so I run in head but I really wanted God well that's the truth to that now that's the point I want you to think on listen to what I'm saying don't try to figure out what I'm saying listen to what I'm saying to where that'll come to the right point see the Bible's right no man saw God at any time the Bible says the goodness of God is what leads us to repentance so we say no we were repented and that brought God to us that didn't bring God to you to her for you to repent you say yeah I did he brought God I repented and he come to me no he was calling you the whole time see we'll get it all mixed up get it into the wrong point and then we can't do it see it wasn't you choosing God you said yes I did brother Dale now I chose God I remember what I done all right that's what I'm saying don't be so over when you call it don't don't run out the wrong end of the show on me and get the wrong idea see God chose you and I we didn't choose him we had nothing in us to choose him with right see now keep that in mind and you'll understand the point see you say but I did brother Dale I remember when the preacher preached the message you know and I prayed and I cried amen you done that no one is denying you the Bible's not denying the prophets not denying it when he would say no man salt God at any time the Bible is not lying when it says that but he's not saying that you didn't cry out and pray and search for him can you get that straight because that's that's the that's the part that seems to be confusing into the mind of man is car you say now you never saw God yes I did now it might not have been the rest of y'all but I saw God now I remember what I done oh yeah I can remember what I done I prayed and cried out to God for two years seeking the baptism with the Holy Ghost that was after I come in this message well see most people would say you come into the message that means you had to hold a ghost when I heard that prophet talking about the Holy Spirit in the way he talked about it I knew not real quick I didn't have what he's talking about but now how many people overrode that and said well you've got to have the Holy Ghost I've been told that by preachers you got to have it because you come to the message and a lot of you wonder about it doing it and the sisters other day said she tried it but for two years I studied this message and I forgot the whole world I have read six books in one day and listen to two tapes I just put my whole life sister the other day Cohen told me said I tried that what do you try it try studying that much my point or emphasis is one thing see you said what brother Dale you were seeking God well I thought I was well yet I could read what the Prophet said and the Bible that said that no man sought God at any time I just couldn't get it together all right now here's the emphasis I'm wanting to get see don't think that the Bible or anything is telling you that you didn't cry well I remember when I did are you telling me I didn't cry and pray for God no no no I'm telling you you did and I'm telling you that God honored those things he honored your prayers and your crying out to him and it brought God to us yes but that's not the point the point is something else calls us to come to that position to desire him go we didn't come into the world with a desire to serve God we come into the world with a desire to serve them the devil and he's doing and that's what we served right go we went after him and his wife all right but you see then something happened you heard your prophet say he said there's a little something different about you all the whole times and you know you remember that well I told you I'll fit it and I don't lie I was out in the world and sin and I'd come home at night I didn't I'd sit down and have a broken heart over the things that I had done most people don't say it that way did they come home happy about what they've been doing they had a good time doing I did and there was something different something was there that was dealing with me but I didn't choose him I wouldn't search him for God it was God searching for me now so you see what I'm saying I don't know where the right wording - you - but you see this two-sided is part of what you're looking at one side of you you were crying out for God you were longing for God you were searching for God you know fasting praying and I the other side of you was going the other way let's see then what is it then that caused you to do what you done well he God loved me you know God loved me now don't get that away I mean malece be honest enough to be sensible and straight don't get no good things in your your doing to think that God calls you because of your goodness that's what we're gonna finish up if I can by the end of the message I want to get into something that's what I said it's gonna go this way that way you gonna have to hold on because you know Paul and Peter we're both preaching the same time do you agree with that you agree that Paul went into the backside of the desert and came out preaching the same thing do you agree that the Prophet said that Paul and Peter had no difference in doctrine do you agree with that you have to because it's true but do you know and realize that mankind has always looked at Paul as being the Calvinist there in talking life now I've come laughing at him because he didn't know what I was gonna preach on today and we got into Calvinism and Arminianism you know but see people think Paul was a Calvinist in that it was okay for this okay for that God chose me and it doesn't make no difference I'm a Christian and they thanked James I said Peter I'm in J James instead of James that he was a legalist an Armenian dealing in his what he doing and didn't do but you know what now you gonna catch on if you listen you know that Paul and James were both teaching the same thing there was no difference in their doctrine yeah Apollo them dumping now see that's what you're reading you're reading what you mankind was reading what Paul said and mankind put it to saying Paul was saying one thing and James was saying another thing when they were saying the same thing it was the way they were saying it I'll give them to you if you want he said we've got to bring it to the middle yeah but brother Dale Paul was looking at it by faith James was looking at it this works that we do they were both right they were both in the Word of God the new Brennan said Calvinism is right as long as it's learning the Bible Arminianism is right as long as it's in the Bible that doesn't mean everything we think about it is right that doesn't make it right to say well are you a Calvinist Armenia are you an Armenian I'm both because I've got it in the middle of the road to understand what these men were doing now you know the story you've listened to on it where brother Branham said James was what man looked at in the works he said Paul was in the basis of what God was looking at well you know what both of them drive so what I said it's gonna be an odd service and you're gonna think and you're gonna think man I don't know what in the world that men talking about well hang on long enough maybe you'll get to the point you'll see what I'm talking about it because answer me the question what was it what was the good thing that made God choose you you think of any good thing that you've done that made God choose you know I can think of a lot of that that he had ever justifiable reason did not like me at all right but for some reason they now stone says what don't don't there's no reasoning in anything that you could think of to cause God to come to you and save you or anything yeah but I believed him the Bible said the devil believed and trembled about what he believed no I'm sorry that's where I talk but it's the truth right see we want to put it on something that we done or something we didn't do all right now if you're gonna put it on something you've done or didn't do you're either an Armenian or a Calvinist you're admitting what you're admitting you're one of the other you're either Armenian if you're doing it on works if it was something that I'd done that caused God to come down and save me then that's Arminianism the Calvinism as to the point where God saved me don't make no difference what I do cuz he loved me so much but think about it now and you'll see the secret is in the scriptures that holds the key because we've got to be brought to the middle of the situation we've got to come to the basis of seeing the Calvinism now listen Paul was not a Calvinist James was not an Armenian they were born-again Christians who had the Word of God lined up correctly see what man done man took what Paul said and called him a Calvinist man took what James said and called him an Armenian Alika list but he wasn't seen there you're gonna make the Prophet lie because the Prophet says Peter and says James and Paul had no difference in doctrine well there was this for now come on now don't try to play games with me I don't I won't play with you if be honest within your own self there's not a person sitting in here that have salvation today that didn't think of one time or another a little bit about Arminianism or Calvinism in other words you thinking well God saved me because that that I loved him all right you're a Calvinist or he saved me because I didn't live like brother Dale I lived a good life now you're Armenian what you see I take the statement of what it just said and show you that there is a truth to Calvinistic teaching there's a truth of the Armenian teaching of it just don't take what man says about it over other Schrader I remember him years ago telling it he said he listened to a man explaining Arminianism and he thought man he's got it he knows what are you talking about boys got a right to the tape he said he turned over and took another message for somebody else and listened and that man was a Calvinist and he said no man I'm confused code I don't know which one of them's right and I'm sure I messed up but now listen now you can like this lump it do what you want to paint a person in this building and it doesn't didn't have to begin with some little thing that you thought was the reason God saves you you tell me that um they say hey you lied and I didn't and then you'll take brother Browns message see to try to back up what you're talking about and when you do you make him a Calvinist or an Armenian but random wouldn't either one we get he was a human being he'll tell you over and over no man thought God but he'll tell you all the time about he cried in the woods head and how he done this and how he done that and how he prayed out and how you've done all of these things trying to seek God for some answer to what him to do it cuz of a human being he's got I don't I don't brother - he you telling me I was a legalist at one time ever born to getting believer I'll say this and not back up what the code has been in my life is in your life it's all ever born again believer starts off their journey as a baby right you know what a baby is a legalist best way to put it legalist why because he thinks he's done something or didn't do something yeah I'm trying to find an answer to what that Paul said when he said where he's chosen us in him we didn't choose him he chose us in him him who who's the him come on are you reading blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ that's a blessed us with all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen us in him who in Christ right when before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love see we want to go to the predestination we want to get to the pre determining factors and things of predestination and we want to get some kind of a line in our thoughts but you're going to have to get one thing straight who done the choosing and who was it doing the choosing it certainly wouldn't a father that chose us in the son we're not Trinitarians see you never chose him the Bible finally tells you did he chose you will brother Taylor call all that but but they had to be something we'll get on predestination maybe we'll find out what that is but how does God choose he doesn't choose by your good works as a matter of fact it seems to be opposite it seems to be the basis that he loves those who had no reason whatsoever to love him come on are you listening do you have any reason for him saving you do you have any justifiable point of the word that he would choose you to see he didn't choose you you say he did go flip flop see he did he shouted no he chose you in Jesus Christ he never chose you let's get that one thing straight he didn't choose us in the basis you said wouldn't you just said to start with that God shows up right but he showed us in Jesus Christ there was more to the story I told you how to hang on and listen see because we could say all day long when the scripture that says the gifts and callings of God listen Colleen of God is without repentance when I repented everything the Bible says the goodness of God is what leads you to repentance brother Branham I was looking there's ice night in this morning on he said if we can just get these things straight would be the happiest people to realize what the whole story is see we want to run the story like we wanna run as I said about Arminianism and Calvinism Paul was not a Calvinist James was not an Armenian it was a born-again Christian but run said they had no difference in doctrine not one iota between James and Paul in the doctrine Arminianism is right if it's in the word works is faith expressed right that's why pop James would say show me your faith without your works and I'll show you my faith by my work what do you think Paul wasn't living a Christian life and that he was beaten James to death about the way he thinks thought it was doing no Paul and James was both right they both had the truth pull it together in the middle of the road and you'll see Arminianism is in the Word of God because we're supposed to live a Christian life we're supposed to be good people not because we have to we're supposed to because of the love of God that has saved us from the things of the world the Calvinism is okay as long as it's into Word because our lives prove what we are what is it just what the scripture says every which one we yield our members to you understand see it's not you choosing when we get into the predestination leave that out of your predestination it's not you choosing okay now flop it back but there's one thing about it if you didn't choose you ain't gonna get saved right if you didn't choose you're not gonna be saved because God is not gonna override your free moral agency and make you get saved no no way you ain't gonna make you be saved he might make you wish you had but you didn't go to Mikey because he leaves it into your hand is a free moral agent to accept or reject just remember one thing I hope this was well deep enough in there because according to what we read he's chosen us in him before the foundation of the world when did he choose you before the foundation of the world we don't want if that's right brother Louise that he chose me before the foundation world then I don't do it because I wasn't before the foundation of the world he wasn't back there before the foundation of the world and some form of a human being or a part or something or some kind of a nature I mean a ways or whatever no maybe it can't be us having anything to do with it so it's put back before the world it's where he was that when he done the choosing now you're not Armenian are Calvinists your born-again christian trying to live the life of christ because of what he has done for us sure we can go through the whole story we could go through the pre destinations with a even reading the Prophet were that God looked down through time and saw what you would do and no Jew would choose this and all and he had everything exactly right in line for you to receive it amen but you didn't do it that's the whole story we were chosen in Jesus Christ before the foundation world so it's not whether or not I was chosen that ain't the key it ain't the key of me being chosen the key was whether or not he was chosen we know for certain he was accepted we have that in the right line that he was accepted then he just applied that we'll get back to those words later he just applied that to you and I in our Christian journey what are you following Lee if there was any part of Armenian ISM and Calvinism all right food either part without bringing it to the correct order I'm a point of the middle then you're you're you losing your own case because see you you if you're in our meaning or Calvinism it means you doing something here are you following me Armenian Calvinism whatever whether you talk about it being your works whether you talk about your goodness and whatever you're still making it to be here it was not here when he made the choice he didn't make the choice I do you got here he chose before we got here what he said to Jeremiah but I know Dean before you while you were in your mother's wound he didn't say Jeremiah now this what we want to talk about we want to make it some Calvin is we will say now Jeremiah what it was your mouths up in the mind Oh God be careful be careful how far you go into mind what about predestinate in your own self out of existence well you're crazy about it do you believe that his name was Ella him that we tried to go through you know the hello him being the self existing or existing alone come on now I'm quoting brother Adam he said we wasn't back there he said the only thing we was was in God's mind not that we were back there only in God's mind all right see we make our choice we make our parts being here in life and not realizing God was already before the world of a god he knew the whole thing before if not then he's not God he didn't have to wait till we got here to choose he didn't have to wait till we got here to find out whether we'd be good or not her except him that's my brother's idea of Methodist minister his idea is that God just got fed up with all of the things he tried to save mankind behind he could never save nobody so he turned around and just said I'm gonna do it and he done it before we ever even got started that's what it sounds like but just remember whatever you do just don't go back too far how about predestinated yourself out of existence you're crazy now it's back there I can remember it yeah so does old poll to Napoleon you know that had he stuck his hand the thing the shirt or whatever he done claimed you know how far back darker you want to go because if you go too far you predestinate your self out of existence if you go back to her he self-existing then he's got to be existing along then there's no way you'll go back there is that simple would you know what that takes it takes a little bit of Calvinism and a little bit of arminianism and brings it together in the middle of the road and says we were chosen in him not now listen it didn't say we were chosen of him and when you flop it into your Calvinist we were chosen in him then I can walk through life and and realize one thing for certain somebody else is running the show it's not what I've done or didn't do that saved me nor kept me from being saved could you see your flopping on one side of the other he [Music] never accepted you because of your goodness he accepted you because of his goodness he chose Abraham and I like the way that brethren said it about Abraham he said he chose Abraham and he said cause he knew Abraham was teaching his children I like that you realize that's your life that you're living has something to do once you are okay now we're flopping I mean in Islam Calvinism huh got hold it in the middle of the road he chose us that puts it right down the middle of the road but I must accept what he has done for me before he can make that applied to me but already before the world he saw the what he was going to do but just remember it's got to be a finished work on earth before the world God existed alone you agree self-existing all right the only thing could be back there would be in his mind not a bunch of people we're not little bitty identities or something that was running around in God you know before the world waiting on a chance to get here we're in his mind but what he knew would take place when we got here sure it's what I said you've got to balance the story out you got to balance it out to the basis of one thing you cried you prayed you saw God youyou went out for days months weeks years whatever seeking after God crying out and praying and God says you never sought me now what's it gonna tell us you see but I but God now you know what I done he's in Yale but said I know what caused you to do that it was my goodness that caused you to cry out for repentance that's what got me out I'm sorry I'm not against any Church any people anything I've never been it's not it's not a place here to pick on other churches and what happens to the rest of the world and not other churches it's none of my business I have nothing to do what they do over in that church I have nothing to do with anywhere in this makes it I'm in this mess I'm in this church here and I preach to here let's see I try to get you to see what the truth of it is see then to realize that our minion ism is in the word well order want to live right Calvinism is in the world we love God and what he has done for us when he never shows from neither side because he was not an Armenian or neither was he Calvinists he was Almighty God I thought we believed what is the new birth brother branham cross mister of God reveal about page 45 I guess what is the new birth he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you now what your pastor says not what the preacher said no what mama said what daddy said what anybody said anything it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally you a revelation revelation is faith it's been revealed to you what happened you understand see then you realize that I was the whole time I thought I was doing what was right I thought I was crying out before God and heaven help don't ever think that I'm telling you not to cry out don't think that I'm trying to tell you see we could old babies had one in there that was there was went back so far they wouldn't even have a revival never heard about that there were the people in the Baptist and especially the free wheels and independence won't buy they wouldn't even have a revival you know what because they're afraid their kids might get saved when God didn't want to save them you say that's stupid that's what they believed that's how far they had it twisted between Arminianism and Calvinism the truth and none truth that you wouldn't have a revival see we know that's not true but that's what people have based it on see the only thing I can base it on is what the scripture says that he chose me yeah all I do is accept a gift what is the gift of God eternal life through Jesus Christ see if you ever do see it correctly you realize what your father was doing then you'll realize what your profit is talking about have you ever walked knowing you by yourself knowing there's nobody around anywhere and you're just walking along and all at once it's just the presence comes that just you you just begin a little bit of feeling it and then it gradually gets more and over more and more until it just engulfs you you realize there's something supernatural right there flip-flop say one time say another thing bring it together in the middle you realize now listen listen everybody whip women you realize that sometimes you pray too much no no wait a minute now brother brother brother dad I got one save it come on I don't do I'll call it for you the run said wins there's one thing we don't do we don't pray enough you ain't listening what I'm talking about you know that prior sometimes means sat down shut up and listen I want to talk to you right sometimes we're running our mouths when we ought to be sitting listening you ever pray and just stop for a moment in pause and say Lord is there anything anything you'd like to tell me or anything I need to do and what's going home see we pour out our prayers to him as our needs and things and and wondering why in the world he'd get in this satisfied and come you know come forth and do them sometimes we maybe need to just say lord help me and just come on the same Lord let me just shut up and listen let me listen to you D backwards and forth the middle-of-the-road prophet says we pray we don't pray enough then I say we pray too much brain to the middle of the road of what sometimes just shut up and listen just sit there for a little while and meditate you might find he can give you a lot of answers that's the middle of Road that's what I'm trying to get you to see between Arminianism in Calvinism there's a middle of the road that both of them are saying the same thing now I keep repeating it over and over Paul was not a Calvinist mankind took what Paul done and said and called him a Calvinist he was not a Calvinist he was a born-again Christian he knew exactly what Peter was talking about and Peter knew exactly what Paul was talking about can you go with me can you go with me on that if it riff if it's not true then you got one I'm saying something the other didn't agree with and you got brother branham wrong when blood runs said they both said the same thing he said there was no difference in their doctrine he said only their actions or character you know do it sure Paul was in the hook-nosed you you know we're talking like that lies not in the Bible study a little brother brother said he was to hook-nosed do you know what he was pretty Stern he's pretty Stern he told what was never dim yet which one it was with either John Mark or one of them you know Paul Jones and get out of here I don't want him to do do you leave me alone yet you go your way and I'm going my way you remember that I just put in my words okay one of those guys there was two of them on different occasions and one of them he never did reconcile back as far as it's telling you know to come back together and be with the other one rotor run said and the Bible says it Paul said tell bleed he said tell mark he said tell mark to come with you he said because he's a very needful don't you think maybe Paul and kind of got a little arrogant maybe in his thinking and then when he could thought it all over he thought well you know mark was right maybe man him needs to get back together and they did we were talking about life night you know that you you are you know I wasn't Rachel where is he you know you like them but you don't love them you know that's just kind of the way things are you lock on but you don't you know the actions of some people some people you don't like to be right on right so does their actions reaction but it's not the fact that you don't love them you love them you know but you just don't like the way their actions are mmm but that's fine with all of it but not listen let me get this and we'll get through so how does God predestinate that he doesn't run aground and that though how does it say it in the scripture that the Thames form can't say why did you make me this way they all right so you can't do that you can't go to God and said you made me wrong my brother's ministers Methodist minister he says that God made me the way I am and said he can't condemn me for being a sinner he said he made me one I said he didn't make you a sinner how would you like to sit under a good old Methodist minister preaching that he said something one day and I said there's one thing for certain him old Methodist would have put you out the door I said to her your belief and thing was he says God made me the way I think he didn't make you that way I said you made your own choice you went into sin with your own choice God never made you a sinner what's the according to him he made me Center so he can be my pouring what you got Calvinist you got Arminianism but in the middle you got a truth both of them are telling truth but not the truth truth is wonderful but I won't be truth I like to wait it under way the truth and the life I won't the truth I want something that I can sit down and think over and I don't have to throw it away or wonder what it is I believe in good works I believe we ought to be Christians but I also believe that God saved me no one made it I do like order to do he knows what you gonna follow him a lot but he knows too if he ever nails you down on your hot little you get running back you understand you'll come running by you know you won't get ride and get straightened up you know cuz he knows how to do that he's a good daddy he knows how to spank us sometimes and take urethanes but listen you following the story the Bible says in first Peter wanted to that we're elect according to foreknowledge well that's it right there we're over four dollars and we're elect according to foreknowledge his foreknowledge knew exactly what I did that's good the predestinate spies foreknowledge those who he foreknew he did predestinate but remember his predestination and his pre determining factor of anything you want to try to make it or something in it you better be careful where you place it because he's before the foundation of the world in his foreknowledge come on are you following that he was before the foundation the world in his foreknowledge those he foreknew he did predestinate not those that was backg are setting the side of him and and they come down but yet we're human beings not as souls not as being one but God before the world knew what he was going to do trying to explain salvation salvation of one thing did we choose him no he chose us did we accept him no he accepted us was not whether or not I what I do or have done or didn't do it's what he does it's what he does what he's he knows then you can go back into his mind and go back to a place of pre existence we'll get into that on predestination cuz if you're going in predestination you got to go back to pre existence because you got to have something predetermined from all right we'll get into those things try to bring out a few points but the main point of what I want you to see today is one thing it wasn't that we chose him he chose us it's whether or not he was chosen we know he was because he was the chooser he was the one that wrote all the rest of the book he's the one that said my goodness of brandy Dirr repentance he was the one that wrote the gifts and calling of God are without repentance he never repented to get a gift follow me he predestinate spy his foreknowledge he chooses by his election so then the scripture says make your calling and election sure I want to rest in the basis of what I know he's done not in the basis what I did or didn't do so you could stand up and tell me all the days or I could tell you and I could say well listen it's it's you know I've done this and I've done that you didn't I remember brother Colley he got onto me one time years ago and and you know because I'd said something and I said well you know I'm the chiefest of sinners well he was defending me as a brother he said brother they'll don't understand I knew what he meant because he knew in my life of what I'm doing it was I don't say I didn't do this I didn't do that I didn't do that I didn't drink I didn't smoke I didn't do this there's things I can say I didn't do and his point was hey we've done all of these things brother Dale didn't do any of these things so how can he be chiefest of sinners that's what Paul said Paul was the chiefest of sinners how because he was a closest to the truth Paul was a Calvinistic Armenian he had it together in the middle of the road he knew what Calvinism was he knew what our median is and was we'll find out one of these days it's not what we do or don't do is what he says Romans 11:29 without repentance chosen us in him not by him but in him well see then I'm not concerned whether I'm gonna fail I know I'm gonna fail no problem I know I'm gonna fail I've done that right up front I know I'm gonna fail well brother there you gonna go out and do right no ain't gonna go out and deliberately do wrong no no we talked about that there's those things that we get back to telling the truth we know we're gonna do it but we know we don't have to do it we can get by without having to do it it's like I've always said come on use it I've always said this much I don't blame the devil for everything and I did well I don't devil he just I don't blame him for everything I do I do it myself I'm the one that's guilty of doing it it's not the devil sure he leads me and guide me and pushes me now but yet listen it's Christ in you the hope of glory if there's anything whatsoever that you and I should consider it's the fact that we should be happy that God did choose don't you think about that good away from all of our goodnesses we thought the reason of him doing it and get out of the basis that we know he did come on I'm glass for raising hands on this asset like this Hemi has the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know what if you do God chose you I slump that's a great thing he chose me all I done was just said thank you thank you Lord for saving me I'd sermon I'd thought I'd point but getting the whole point all was not a Calvinist that's what man said he was James was not an Armenian that's what man says they were what are you and I say about the Bible the Bible tells me I'm perfect man says I can't be right come on the Bible says be ye therefore perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect therefore leaving the principles of doctrine or not let us go on to perfection but man says we're not perfect it's perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect all right ain't know why we'd be perfect brother Dale I don't like the sign on the back of the car that says I'm not perfect I'm just forgiven now that might sound good to you but it don't to me I've got a little sense to know if I'm forgiven I'm perfect if I'm forgiven I'm perfect told you your son is not telling you what you see Church salvation is of the Lord jano to know whatever it be wherever he made what choice he done whatever goes with mankind we should be happy to understand the Word of God that tells us that proof that we can jump rejoice and glory in the fact of what that he has done for you and I that he chose us then when he chose us he had to come down and mic away he didn't send somebody else he came himself to make away let's tan well you gotta bring sand in somewhere geez what about it and understand in somewhere you find you I hope you understand we cried out we pray we start after God but it should not us it was God pulling us [Music] it was God trying to get us to this to slow down long enough and set out and shut up yes [Music] about it anybody have a need [Music] remember now the children are to practice at 12:45 getting ready for a surf this afternoon to have some singing and bang so remember that probably one for another that the Lord would bless our Father we thank you we know that what we tried to say today it's been in their mind for a week now or two trying to get away to say it I know I don't say it right so you say it you come down and speak to our hearts and let us know and so to see that Lord you chose us you chose us in your own self because that's the only way that we could ever be pure the only way a human being can never be perfect is to realize he's resting in God there's God inside of him making the way just have your way with it each one of us keep us in Jesus now you dismiss right one for anything [Music] I shall [Music] [Applause] he'll buy the prints of the nails Hey and standing somewhere the shadows [Music]
