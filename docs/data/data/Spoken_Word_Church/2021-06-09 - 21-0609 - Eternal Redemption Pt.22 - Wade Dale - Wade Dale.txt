and fourth this will be for the father's day trip the only one the men needs so anyway just saying and then remember if you're going the sign up sheets downstairs um terrence announced that we're going to pull it down uh i think about everybody's going to go but you need to let us know really you don't know how stressful it is to for somebody to show up that's not on the list and then you've got to feed them and you didn't really well they weren't coming so i don't try to have extra food so we can take it all home i try to make it where we got enough eggs for everybody and enough this and that and the other but if another two or three hungry men show up um that's why we are so adamant about coming or not coming you've had a whole year to figure out if you're coming or not so we want everybody to come but uh if you're not if you don't sign up don't come but we're going to be there wednesday at 4 00 p.m is when we're checking into the into the lodge it's the same lodge we went to

july the third and the fourth meeting remember that brother joe forney and brother um mike ulti will be speaking at that one also um i was chastised sunday afternoon by someone that heard my comment i made and i took it a little bit out of context and i want to apologize for that sister christine had made a comment that i made the comment that it wasn't exactly the way it was and she's right so but she's um she's gracious enough to laugh about it but uh she said if we were having the 50th if church was having a 50th anniversary you'd want to be here and i just said you should be here or you need to find you another place well you do i mean so this is your home church that's me saying that so okay we good christina okay you good okay can't tell if her face is red or not also brother paul just caught well he sent me a text and said to tell everyone hello they made it to minnesota they're on their honeymoon for a couple weeks up there why are you going to minnesota on a honeymoon i don't know but they're coming back they're going to be living they'll be living down here so don't get uh uh don't get so sad they'll be back but they were married and they've gone up there to to uh work on his affairs and get all this stuff moved down here so he's gonna be a georgian we just got to work on his talking make sure he can say his words right but he does a real good job playing it's good that we've got all these now more musicians and more musicians and more musicians it's just wonderful that we have those and we've got extras because there was a time in this church when it first started there was no extra daddy led singing joyce played the piano daddy let's sing and joyce played the piano then he let and joyce played the piano and then daddy come out and preach he just kind of worked himself right into preaching so but we've come a long way from there and thank god for 50 years of being able to for god to multiply god did this it wasn't it wasn't a man it was god that did it a man can't do this right but god through a man can do it so we honor we honor all that but paul said tell everybody hey and that he'd see you in a few weeks so let's bow our heads any other announcements i think we're good with that if you have any questions about the anniversary meeting please ask someone we will be meeting later on about that we've still got a few weeks left we've already got the facility we've already got the food lined up we know kind of what we're doing so so thank god for that let's bow our heads to heavenly father thank you for this day that you give us we pray now that you would sanctify us lord settle us down lord now we don't have to think about anything else but you for a few moments lord all the cares of life lord we need to just leave them at the door so we can sit down and hear from you tonight so it will not be a meeting that will be wasted there will be a meeting that will carry us up the statue of a perfect man that'll draw us closer to you that'll make us better christians in this world father forgive us of our sins and our many mistakes that we make lord we pray that you'd heal the sick be with the ones that are not here lord we ask you to sanctify them lord as they're traveling the uh young youth that are going to be for it lord we pray that you touch them lord and give them a powerful service father we pray to you that you would just be with the church here lord bless each one give us this day our daily bread lord and forgive us of our sins in jesus name we ask these things amen hebrews 9 verse 11 but christ being coming high priests of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us you may be seated in the lord as blessed i'm going to read romans 11 25 for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery lest you should be wise in your own conceit that blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles be come in so that's where we're at today we'll we'll pull the chart up in just a minute but i want to read here in isaiah we have a promise of a messiah and that messiah we know was jesus christ it says therefore the lord himself can give you a sign behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name emmanuel we know that to have this plan of redemption you've got to have two things you've got to have someone that is lost and then you've got to have somebody that's able to redeem them if boaz had not been in the position he could have never acted the right or had the right of redemption toward naomi and ruth if he was just number one he had to be kin to him number two he had to have enough money and property and he had enough enough prestige that when he went before the council in other words they didn't say no you're a drunk you can't do that no he was an upstanding man so god came himself the only upstanding man there was that could redeem us and it was an eternal plan that he didn't develop when he got here it was already developed before the foundation of the world amen and he was down here playing his come down to play his part through a virgin that conceived and brought forth a son and as we were talking about last sunday this man you know we just for a minute for the ones that are that are here that wasn't here sunday you know you you look at jesus's life and we think we have problems right he didn't have many friends his friends that he had didn't understand him they they didn't no one understood this man this man named jesus was so peculiar and so different than anything else in the world until they called the lord jesus christ himself they called him a devil they called him belgium of not just the devil they called him the prince of demons they said you're just a wine bible why are you sitting around with sinners and and publicans and why are you doing this and why are you doing that and i like what jesus said he said you don't need a physician if nobody's sick he's in other words so he's telling them the physician was there for those that were sick and he was also telling them self-righteous pharisees that he can't help them this is the doctor i'm doctoring this group of people i'm not doctoring you because i know who you are where you come from remember because he told that same group he said you are of your father the devil amen now when are we going to look at the same thing like i said sunday i want us i want the devil i want the devil to be so uncomfortable in this place from now on i want him to be so uncomfortable in your place i want him to be so uncomfortable in your mind i want it to be unfamiliar territory that he's charging through when we start talking about the word of god and start talking about the mysteries of god and start talking about living right and doing the right thing in the world because listen jesus never prayed us out of the world he prayed for us to stay in the world but to sanctify us while we're in the world so he gave us provisions to make it into this world but this man even from a child his even his mother didn't hardly understand who he you know who he was she she lost him at 13 years old and and had to go find him in back in the temple you know and and left him at the feast of pentecost the prophet god tells us and she had to go back and find him and when she found him she said in other words your father and i well that wasn't his daddy brother brown said she let the bar down she left the bar down on that one because the first thing that little 13-year-old kid turned around and said i'm about my father's business i'm not in a carpenter shop so he was coming to a position now kids don't y'all try that with your daddy mama okay unless you really know that you're about your heavenly father's business don't use that one okay that won't it won't work because your mom and dad's gonna say prove it but see they knew she knew though but listen when you look in the bible i like when you read the rest of that scripture it says that jesus was subject unto them for the rest of the time amen he wasn't a rebellious child he wasn't someone that said bless god i'm god almighty why are you in here bothering me no he just told him who he was told him what he was doing there and then the bible says he left with him and he didn't go kicking and screaming he was subject unto them for the rest of the time until he come to the age of the 29 and a half years old to be to go to the river jordan for his ministry amen so let's all take that we know they called him bills above and if they call you that that's okay yeah because he called they called jesus down but see the to be in this eternal plan of redemption that's how jesus had to come he couldn't come any other way that's my point he couldn't have come any other way if he would have come a different way then the pharisees all would have accepted him they said oh you're the you're the main man you've come right here to this temple and you've you're right here in this church and you're here with us and well you know we got a place for you and you can sit right here next time i like what brother baby says right next to dr jones right here you can come sit right here no he was unfamiliar in their place so i want the devil though to be unfamiliar in this place i want us to say things that he don't understand right i want us to know things that he will never know and we're guaranteed if we got the baptism of the holy ghost that's exactly what we're doing because he can't have the mind of christ but you and i can't you and i can know what to do with the word of god when he gives it to us satan does not know how to do that right that's right he has a problem with following the word right i don't know how i got up on that but let's go back to isaiah 53 verse 8 and read this he was taken from prison and from judgment and who shall declare his generation as we were talking about sunday jesus never had a group of children as far as natural children because that's not why he came he came for eternal an eternal purpose to get his children that he had saw in the mind of god that would accept him but not from the loins but from his mouth a spoken word seed bride amen because that's what the sower went out to sow if the sower with the son of man you know he wasn't physically throwing in the parable he was but it you know brother dale's not physically throwing seed brother matthew all the different ministers are not physically throwing seed no they're throwing you the word of god and you've got to make sure it lands in good ground or you can kick it out or you can let it go by the wayside see you have an opportunity to get the word of god and put it in the good ground so it can produce 60 80 and 100 fold but that's your job to do that right it's our job to plant i go out and plant my garden and it's coming up but you know what i can't make it come up i just have to put it in the right environment so that god can work on it through nature to get those seeds out of the ground amen same way with brother dale and all the ministers of god they're sowing spiritual seed and they're bringing forth spiritual seed word children amen and that's what jesus came to do so in isaiah 53 they're asking a question says look he was cut off from the land of the living who's going to declare this man's generation i was saying telling everybody sunday i said look jesus as a normal man when they saw him hanging on a cross i'm sure caiaphas and all them people said we're finally through with him we don't even have to have a son he doesn't have a natural son he doesn't have a wife he doesn't have a progeny on earth or a genealogy on earth once we get rid of him buddy we're done we ain't got to worry about none of that but they just don't know right right that about several days later on the day of pentecost when it was fully come that a bunch of children a bunch of jesus got born on the day of pentecost but he was made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth what about the god of the universe didn't even own a pillar didn't even own a place to put his head and didn't even own a burial site but he fulfilled every scripture in the in the bible when we gonna start fulfilling our part of that scripture in the bible yet it pleased the lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed he shall prolong his days and the pledge of the lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see of the travail of his soul and be satisfied that's where you were you are identified in the soul of god because you weren't in the body physical body you were in the soul of almighty god because that soul was the only soul that can come back on the believer and make you god almighty in human flesh called the bride the only one that can do that so he's that's the key pin of this whole eternal redemption plan is that jesus had to come here to release that life so that you and i can be born again because that's what he told nicodemus you must be born again nicodemus said if i got to go back and get my mama's want see he was carnal because he came here by an act jesus didn't come here by an act of man he came here by an act of god so he was telling us that no nicodemus you need to be born white from above and that's the part of this eternal plan and we'll get to that in a minute in the resurrection i love what what the prophet god said about resurrection he said this whole plan is hinged on resurrection if there's no resurrection there's no plan so we'll get to that in just a second let's go to john 1 verse 11. because we've got to tie this in he had to give israel a chance because israel was his chosen bride in the old testament he had to give them a chance first because you got all those people in the old testament that was depending on jehovah to become the messiah to come and save them from all that roman stuff that they got their self tied into the problem they didn't the problem was they didn't realize god didn't put them there they put their self there they disobeyed god they went whoring we're going to read that in just a minute in jeremiah where he had to put her away he put all israel away because of the idols and the idolatry that they followed but he came unto his own and his own received him not but i like this scripture because see this opens the door to everybody but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god so now everybody's got the power to become sons of god even to them that believe on his name which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor the will of man but of god in other words your new birth is what's going to carry you into this eternal plan your natural birth is going to carry you to a grave believe me you're going to go one of the two are you ready for both that's my question you're going to meet one of them are you ready for one of them and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory is the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth let's go to jeremiah 3 verse 6. jeremiah you didn't know johnson was a king did you that josiah oh just like canada what says josiah in the days of josiah the king but now what happened to israel they backslid so he had to put him away she's gone up on every high mountain and every green tree and and there played the harlot now we know what a harlot is as an ill-famed woman if they would have stayed married to jesus christ they would she would have been their his bride right yeah but they did not they went whoring and now remember after she did those things and see i said after she had done all these things after you can't take her back that's right see in case of marriage and divorce you have to be careful if your wife goes out and commits adultery you can either bring her back or you can you can kick her out and that's what god did i'm not going to get into marriage and divorce because we should know these things turn thou into me but she returned not right he gave her a time to repent and she wouldn't so he had to put her away when for all the causes verse eight whereby backsliding israel committed adultery i had put her away and given her a bill of divorcement yet her treacherous sister judah feared not but went and played the harlot also so now as we said before let's read the romans 11 verse 25 if if this had not happened we we as gentiles would have never come into the plan of god but listen being part of the eternal plan of god where he foresaw a gentile bride this had to happen he knew the provision was already there that israel was going to backslide because in daniel 9 we'll read in just a minute listen he gave him 70 weeks and he wanted that when he gave him that 70 weeks brother bob he wanted that could be a continuous 490 years because he wanted to redeem him he wanted to get him back he wanted to buy him back out of the pawn shop but what happened was he knew there was a gentile bride laying there that he had to let out because she's part of the plan and as a prophet of god said and has to be made known amen so in order for us to be made known listen god can't be married to israel you can't be married to two women at the same time you can't have two living wives so he had to put he had to put her away so he could marry a gentile bride but now not only did he put her away he blinded her just for me and you he blinded her eyes for several thousand years just for me and you listen all that turmoil they're having in israel right now is because of me and you right yeah that's right because when we leave god's doing what he's going over there because listen he can't be over there and over here at the same time he can't have two wives like that right he's already put this one away he's going to restore her but not back to the position she was she will not be bright again but he can't forget her see he's got to go back to his own scripture and i didn't bring it but i was reading it not too long ago where he said how high how many stars can you count how many sands in the sea on the seashore can you count them and some and you know he said no you cannot he said i'll never forget israel if you can count them i can forget them you can't count them so i can't forget israel right now because they're part of the plan because there is redemption included there is resurrection included in this plan and israel has been they've already went through one resurrection jesus's resurrection the bible says when the graves opened and some of them came out of them out of the ground all right romans 11 25 for i would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery see now this is a mystery because most of the denominational world don't know have a clue what daniel 70 weeks is don't have they know one thing's for sure though they do know that god's dealing with us and then he's gonna deal with israel but they don't have no i you know i say no idea they might have a clue but we know exactly that's why i said about sunday about if this prophet is not a true prophet we how are we going to find something better right and it's like the analogy that i use i work for the post office and we don't do things very fast because we're government but um anyway but me and the ups driver was talking about a year so ago when amazon got real hot and you know everybody was ordering from amazon and they were given and now in certain places they have the amazon grocery thing that you can order in two hours you get your groceries two hours delivered to your house you can't beat that that's what me and the ups driver who is gonna come out of all this and say i'm better than that you can't well that's what i'm saying about brother branham how are you going to send us somebody better than what he's already said there's not anything better except jesus christ and a bride that's the only thing that's better is god being here in a bride but we're going to be here because he sent a prophet amen to open our blinded eyes because you know what we were blinded by denominations by sin by all the stuff that we did we were blinded but we blinded ourself there's a there's another quote where brother brown says he said he said now god blinded them god didn't blind you it's all on you now god didn't blind said no i'm going to blind you and you you can't come in no not gentiles but blindness in part has happened to israel until the fullness of the gentiles become end you know that's not the first stage that's not the second third fourth fifth sixth it's this age it's when the fullness of the gentiles excuse me there is no other gentile age after this one this is it right here we're in the end time so all israel shall be saved that is written there shall come out of zion the deliverer and how's he going to come out he's going to come out and two prophets moses and elijah which is probably already over there waiting the two men okay i think it's that close listen they're not going to be babies they're going to be grown men when god enters them and anoints them with elijah and moses ministry we're going to be gone but they're not going to be little children they're going to be adults for this is my covenant unto them when i shall take away their sin now how is he going to do that through daniel 70 weeks through the six-fold purpose we're going to read it in a minute he's going to do that as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sake now look enemies yes they don't like us we're gentiles we're club carriers we're we're heathens they call us yeah but you know why they're our enemy for your sake my sake but as touching the election they are beloved for the father's sake in other words i can't forget them amen so now let's go to daniel 9 24. 70 weeks are determined we'll just run through it real quick upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do six things this is gonna this is gonna parallel we already done it several times with the six seals because six seals finishes redemption christ is the seventh seal we know that so to finish the transgression whose transgression israel not yours exactly your israel to make an end of their sin to make reconciliation for iniquity now you can do that too in your justification and your sanctification and your baptism of the holy ghost that's exactly what god does in three stages he gives you the new birth through justification sanctions baptism holy ghost he's going to do the same thing within finish the transgression make an end of sin make reconciliation for iniquity then look bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision in prophecy and anoint the most holy we know how that happens we're not going to go through it because we've been through it before but know therefore and understand that from the glory forth or the commandment to restore and build jerusalem to the messiah the prince shall be seven weeks and three scoring two weeks so what's 62 and seven somebody say 69 thank you brother and what centennial that would be 69 well that's 69 weeks not 69 and a half not 68 in the third or 68 and a half amen 69 weeks all right seven weeks and seven weeks and three score which is two times three is six sixty two the street shall be built again the wall even troubles times we know that was in nehemiah and um the edict that came from not cyrus with so with the cyrus or one of the two all right but after three score in two weeks shall my side be cut off now see this is where you and i have to come in because why was the messiah cut off not for himself that's right but not for himself he was cut off so that me and you could come in he was cut off because we're going to read here in luke he told them to go to the upper room because they were going to be endued for with power from on high and then another group of people was going to come in 3 000 downstairs and then we're going to read here in just a minute whereas the gospel keeps moving paul stands up one day and he said i've had it with you jews lo i turn to the gentiles so that started in there started that gentile dispensation that you and i are in now but you know what we're at the closing of it we're not at the first of it they were at the first we're at the closing of this thing and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary that was titus in 80 70. he destroyed the city and took all the menorah he took the holy of holies he took everything back to rome with them we know that rome has all that that's why israel is going to make a covenant with them so they can get that stuff back amen this makes sense and then therefore shall be with the flood until the end the war desolations are returned determined and look and he shall confirm who's the he the antichrist because he's going to break it so it can't be christ right christ never makes a covenant breaks it mean you make covenants we break it the devil makes the covenant he always breaks them and he shall confirm the covenant with many for now if you had 69 and you need 70 weeks to finish daniel 70 weeks to restore israel and the city there's that one week left and it comes after the rapture takes place right ma'am just really simple and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week who does he who's he the antichrist what i just said rome is going to make a covenant with the jews and said if you'll do this i'll give you your menorah back i'll give you your ark back i'll give you all these things that i'm holding i'll give them back to you but you got to go into this covenant and then for three and a half years they go in that covenant but during that three and a half years that's when god is going to send moses and elijah the spirit of moses and elijah and two men two prophets that go to israel or don't go to israel they're already over there and they're going to preach jesus christ not the ark and the menorah and all these things and the pots and all that stuff they don't have anything to do with building any temple they're not part of that temple mount people right right they're just not and they're definitely not going to be because they're going to be killed and they're going to have a resurrection amen for the overspreading of abomination in other words in the midst of the week he's going to cut it off and then armageddon's going to happen but you and i are going to be in a glorious time right somewhere else we won't be here and it doesn't matter because we're in eternity anyway because we've already went through a body change and we'll look at that here real quick let's go to luke 24 46 and he said unto them this is jesus thus it is written and thus it behoove christ to suffer and derives from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name look among all nations beginning in jerusalem beginning in jerusalem but to all nations and ye are witnesses of these things and behold i send the promise of my father upon you but tarry in the city of jerusalem until ye be endued with power from on high or dunamis from on high which is power but i went to that word endu that word endued means to sink into let's look at the next one and that's what happened on the day of pentecost there was tons of fire on every one of them and then what happened the holy ghost just sank right down into those people to sink into or clothed in or arrayed in see that's when they got their white robes brother dale's going to cover this probably a little bit more but we don't have to go get a white robe see that's why we don't have to stand before judgment why would we stand the judgment with white robes already on right we stand in judgment with those white robes on which is what the white robe is the what the righteousness of the saints when you get born again here folks there you get your robe because that's the holy ghost that's that holy ghost veil that god's putting back on you that was taken off of adam and eve not taking their holy ghost away from them but that veil to keep you what straight to keep us straight the holy ghost is put here to keep us straight and to get us out of here but see he's already veiled me and you we don't have to get white robes you already got them if you're born again amen so don't go looking for a boy wait when i get my white rum no you already got it it's your theophany it's your glorified body it's all those things is right there and you already got it you don't have to go somewhere to get it right see thank god for a profit they put all that together for us so we don't have to worry about well when do i get a white rubble when do you think we'll get a white rubber i don't know do you think you will get it over there no i think we might get it over here no no we're going to get it right here if you're born again you already got it had enough of this bickering why bicker when he's already told us the truth the first time amen god told us the truth man's been telling us lies and then god sent us a man to tell us the truth but it was a man that was vindicated by the bible amen all right let's go to acts 2 verse 1 when the day of pentecost was fully come there were all with one accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting there appeared unto them cloven tongues like as a fire and it sat upon each of them and then what then that fire just went right down in them they were endued with power from on high cause listen they didn't walk out of that upper room and this little flame still on their head right you know you see these little catholic pictures of jesus you know even as a baby and you got this little flame sticking up right here or you see that little glow that was around him now listen if there had been a glow around him the whole time the pharisees and the sadducees may thought he was somebody no he was hid he was hid from the world he was hid from those people and they were all filled with the holy ghost in other words they received their white robes and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave the mutants now way down there a little bit further in verse eight how we hear every man in our own tongue wherein we were born parthians medes elamites dwellers in mesopotamia judea cappadocia pontus asia why are these people all there right because it was the day of pentecost it was a feast time it was a feasting they all came to eat and boy some of them got more than they're bargained for because they left more full than they got there because they got filled with the holy ghost while they was there and then they took the message if you'll look at some of these on the map asia egypt libya rome cyrenes cretes arabians the word of god spread glory but now let's go back to jerusalem for a minute because that's where the center of everything was that because jesus told them said go to jerusalem and you'll be endued with power from on high so that's where it all got started from acts 13 verse 46. when we get finished with this brothers if you'll pull the chart up we'll take a look at then paul and barnabas wax bold i think it's about time we wax bold and said it was necessary that the word of god should first have been spoken to you talking to who jews but seeing you put it from you and judge yourself unworthy of everlasting life lo we turn to the gentiles there was a door opened up and paul stepped in that door we know peter had a little bit to do with that we know peter was the spokesman on the day of pentecost we know peter did go to the jews but listen he wasn't the prophet that opened the word to the gentiles paul was a prophet he was the prophet messenger of that first church age so his word is what that first church age was built upon everybody got that amen for so he for so hat the lord commanded us saying i have set thee to be a light of the gentiles now that's the scripture in the old testament see the jews know the gentiles are going to be included in this but see they're thinking they're the bride and we're the lesser servant but it's just opposite because see remember they don't think messiah's come they don't think they went and they don't think god's put them away that's how blinded they are but when their eyes are open according to zechariah when they see these things they say oh man we're in trouble we killed the messiah we've been wasting 2 000 years and remember what they're going to say don't worry it was done to preserve life in other words it preserved us and it preserved them and when the light of the gentiles that thou should be for salvation see to the ends of the earth because jesus told the disciples he said go into all the world and preach the gospel and then the end shall come this is the only time that it could be in every country simultaneously right now they could be listening to this service in every country on the face of this earth every country because we're in a hundred and something countries ourself already people you know clicking in and listening listening to us and watching so that's being fulfilled but you know what he said he said once that happens he says the end will come then the end shall come and it's here and when the gentiles heard this they were glad and glorified the word of the lord and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed jesus every time he would see a a gentile and something would happen like the syrophoenician woman the the um the centurion every time he walked up to a gentile he said i've never seen no faith like this because remember jairus is grabbing him by the hand hey you got to come touch my daughter hey you got to come touch even the little lady that touched him of his garment if i can just touch they had to have a touch and a field they had to have a sign they had to have a wonder the gentiles just said hey that centurion said look i know you're a man of authority i'm a man of authority whatever i say goes he said okay whatever you say go see that's the faith of the gentiles right see we've converted back to the israel part where we need signs and wonders and touching and feeling all right we're all through the new testament he said i've never seen faith like this before call one a dog and she said but sir dogs have to eat just throw me a crumb you know you can give them them ten commandments all you want to just throw me a crumb of your grace just give me some of your grace that's all i want i don't want a full course now four courses coming this end time but that girl was sitting there saying i just need one thing from you one thing a crumb and that believing of that one crumb broth zach it healed her daughter one crumb didn't jesus stand up one day and say that if you have the faith of a watermelon seed you have the faith of a pumpkin seed if you have the faith of a peat seed that's even bigger that's this big no he said a grain of mustard seed you can just go and mustard is gone you can't even see it you have the face as the grain of a mustard seed you can move them out and that's to the gentiles because when the gentiles heard it they were glad and glorified the word of the lord that's what we're supposed to do every wednesday every sunday glorify the lord the word of the lord that's come to the gentiles it's this is all supposed to been to jews but it's to us because we believe without having signs we believe without having wonders let's pull up the chart if you don't mind please everybody all right it's only 8 o'clock don't fall asleep yeah everybody's doing good but here's the chart we were looking at um julie's not here okay let's get julia chart she said she can't see this so i know some of y'all can't tease can't see it cause you got his eyes out like that yeah okay but here let's go through this it's okay can you can you pull it to right there thank you that's good can anybody see that kind of now all right so listen we're talking about jesus christ now look matthew 27 verse 51-53 we're looking at luke 23 verse 46 matthew 27 50. look at all the different ones this is jesus when he resurrected and this little dot dot dot shows where jesus when he died where did he go first place he went was to hell he wasn't in his he wasn't in his completeness to be on earth to do the teaching he had to go in his theophany to hell to another dimension to preach to the souls and to what be a witness i'm the one that you turned down way over here right at the flood you turned me down way over here and you've been waiting not in paradise you got to keep on going down further on the chart there in that fifth dimension and he went to the souls in prison there we go those who turned god down jesus preached to the ones who turned god down in first peter 3 verse 18 and 19 but thank god he didn't stay there brother jeremiah because you was with him you don't have to go to hell anymore son you don't even have to worry about that you don't have to worry about hell no more why would you even worry if anybody says hell just say look don't need my place been there already what do you mean you already been there yeah we went there in jesus christ amen the soul of jesus went to hell to preach to those people well where is the soul of god today by the baptism of the holy ghost it's inside of you so you went to hell brother brown said you were on the shores of galilee you died with him you prayed with him yes do you believe that amen you should if you have the mind of christ then that's why that's why without the new birth folks you're not gonna be able to understand right the bible must less the message if you have a problem with the bible with the message get the new birth it settled a lot of things for me like helps me like helps me teaches me what's going on because listen if if i have inside of me what wrote that or wrote this how can he deny and how can there not be a connection you know what the problem is you're over here you're the devil trying to connect with god ain't happening but if you take god and you take god now in human flesh and a bride it can do nothing but connect it can do nothing but connect i'm sorry if i hurt your feelings i'm sorry but listen we're at the end time we should be in college age not in kindergarten and you say well i don't know nothing well that's your problem because my bible tells me that that if i ask anything in his name he'll give it to me so i ask lord reveal to me right this message yes reveal to me what's in this bible don't reveal to me what so-and-so said don't reveal to me what this revealed to me what's in this bible and then if that same person that wrote this is inside of you he's got to open your eyes of understanding he has to or you can take him and say look you blinded me and i'm not israel be bold right thank god you promised me i could understand this you promised that you sent a prophet to not make it complicated but make it simple simple god in simplicity it's the devil that's complicated this thing man and the devil through man has complicated this thing but listen god and god through man is bringing it right back to where it's supposed to be amen so jesus preached to the ones who turned god down now he's going back up he's going through paradise he's picking up the old testament saints and he's going to put them in a position because look the old testament saints you can you can make this any way you want to but the old testament saints can't be put in the sixth dimension they have to be somewhere else because prophet god said only the sixth dimension is the born-again believer perfect faith now they're somewhere all right but they're not in the sixth dimension because the prophet of god tells us that paradise was emptied out so there is no more paradise it's under the blood of jesus christ and he has put them in a place of waiting of holding hebrews 11 40 they without us cannot be made perfect all right so jesus resurrected told them said you'll be endued with power from on high i read you the scripture there luke excuse me then he ascended in acts 1 verse 3 through 11 his ascension was in a cloud right we know how all that is but look how do you know this brother wade why because remember we already been through this the feast day he fell right on that feast day of passover and from passover to pentecost it's 50 days why did brother brown say that jesus was around here 40 or 50 days it ain't in the bible but he can count because the bible says when the day of pentecost was fully come it had to be 50 days and and when jesus spoke that it was a 10-day period that you tarry because he ascended and then 10 days later he came back on the day of pentecost acts 2 verse 1 and entered into a group of people which stopped the 70 weeks of daniel 69 weeks were finished the messiah was cut off but not for himself for who me and you to insert this bride church age everybody got that say amen so now jesus himself he comes as the baptism of the holy ghost and now he's in bright form whatever he's doing he's doing through the bride everything he's doing he's doing through the bride the six being healed the dead's being raised the preaching is being done the people are being saved god is being magnified through the bride through people that accepted the new birth then john goes to patmos and leave that up there because i'm going to read it because it says and in the midst of the seven candlesticks see he morphed this is the son of man right if i understand that this is the son of the son of man this is jesus in human flesh john 1 14. and the word was made flesh dwelt among us that's the son of man everybody got that amen now he came back on the day of pentecost as a son of god because he was what a spirit right this body can't be here while this body's here right can't do that he'd have two bodies that's right he in morphed went up where wherever seventh dimension immortal sends back the holy ghost in morphy into a bride right and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one likened to the son of man clothed with a garment down to the foot and gird about the paps with the golden girdle now look this is not about the paps that's over this way pabst is this way and what's pap's breasts bright form amen his head and his hair were white like wool what judgment listen judgment began when the bride started coming on the earth oh yeah when you go to the white zone judgment not any of you i'm praying not but when somebody goes to the white throne judgment the reason they're being judged is because they met somebody that was bribed think about it you say i'm not well i'm just telling you the bible says the saints will judge the earth even angels right so that's why we had to be dispersed all over the world so that the world could be judged by the bride of jesus christ because there's nothing else to judge by you're saying oh we got the word where's the bride come from the bride is the word amen amen the bride is the word for her age you and i though are the word for the full age for the full time that's here gloria amen we get the fullness all seven courses but listen to this and his feet was like fine brass as it burned in the furnace in his voice as the sound of many waters what is waters people there's not just one bride there's millions of gentile bride that have come through these church ages and he had in his right hand seven stars everybody got that if you walk outside tonight and look between the two restrooms you'll see that very sign you see jesus standing there with seven stars in his hand and the seven messengers around him everybody got that so that's what i'm telling you if if william branham was not sent to give us a message we're looking for somebody else right because god promised seven we've only had six if he's not the one right that's right right and he better send him quick because we're already right at the end over here we got a lot of stuff that's already fulfilled thank god we had a prophet though because you know what we'd be just like david david stood one day and passed judgment on himself remember when he had committed adultery with bathsheba and then nathan walks in and sly nathan of course we know it was god making david confess but he said david there was a man had all kind of sheep and said he just wanted one he said he took that sheep in other words from his best friend i bet david jumped up and he threw them all hands on the desk and he was blinded at that moment too i'm sure because he wasn't thinking what nathan was thinking nathan knew what he'd done god had already showed it to that prophet what he had done he said oh he said bring him here we'll kill him nathan said thou art the man david you put your best friend to be killed and you had his wife and committed adultery you should have been that man but what did nathan say but david you won't die i believe that's what the prophet of god told us in the end time not in so many words but in 1100 sermons he said you have a chance not to die you have a chance not to die because of this message of the hour you have a chance there was no chance in the other six church seven six church ages in the first or the seventh pentecost you're the only one so our nathan come on the scene and said you won't die do you believe that oh it's easy for bella to believe it she's 13. 14. what about sister cletus she's 45. i wasn't gonna say 94 i'm not telling him you're 94. i just did but listen if we don't start believing we are going to die we've got to start believing what's already been sent we're not preaching some new doctrine we're not preaching some new thing we're not finding a new tape we're not uh um we don't have you know 10 books that nobody else has got and that's what we're preaching out of because we got this little secret no it's all been put in the open it's all been out there where we can see it we've had our nathan come on the scene you know david repented god accepted his repentance and he moved on what are you going to do he had his right hand seven stars and have his mouth one what sharp two-edged sword in other words what a word for that age and his countenance was as the sun shine us in the street and when i saw him i fell at his feet as dead and he laid his hands on me saying unto me fear not i am the first and the last i am he that liveth and was dead and behold i am alive forevermore and have the keys of hell and of death write these things which thou has seen and the things which are and the things which shall be hereafter the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand and the seven golden candlesticks now see god almighty is going to tell john the revelation so john's not going to have to guess because john was just commissioned to write what he saw the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven candlesticks which thou saw us are the seven churches now not churches building because if you did you only had one at ephesus one at smyrna pergamos one at tita one at sardis one in philadelphia and one at laodicea where was it no it's us it's the people it's the voice of many waters it was the voice of many waters let's go to the that uh word where we see star the prophet of god the star and the angel look what the greek lexicon tells us that it is a let's go ahead and go to that if you don't mind brother brother joe because we're going to read some quotes here in just a minute give him a second it takes a minute to get that up and get it off but the greek lexicon says a messenger is one who has sent a messenger from god so we were promised a messenger from god not just a norm listen we've had messengers there's been some really good people that brought messages down through the ages but we've only had these seven messengers from god that brought a specific message for a specific time and for us specific area listen really until now martin luther wasn't known in africa when he was alive he wasn't known in the united states but he wasn't the united states yet you understand what i mean but now in this end time there's full access to this last messenger with marion branham every nation on the face of this earth has an opportunity to listen to the voice of god for this age now luther now can be heard because some of his writings have been put in the book but i'm talking about when luther was alive there was they were just starting to produce bibles much less produce messages of somebody but we have a messenger from god that we have every one of his messages amen every one of them digital you can put them on your watch now and take them anywhere you want to we have no excuse none whatsoever so let's listen to this quote on the spoken words original spoken words original seed because remember behold i will send you elijah the prophet so he sent elijah the prophet to me and you he gave us an opportunity to hear the voice of god for our age now watch watch this right here spoken words original seed the messenger of malachi 4 will appear at god's appointed time we are all looking for him look how humble we believe he will come that is according to his word it will be at the end time which it is time now for to see it he will be correctly dedicated to the word as they have always been indicated by god's word and are vindicated god will vindicate what he preaches i don't see how they can't see that right he's been vindicated by what he preaches no doubt to be the truth as he did elijah for it is elijah coming making ready for the mount zion rapture the rapture can't come in any other age but this age listen to this number two let us in church age we kind of quoted it i believe we can all quote it without even looking at the at the quote but now this messenger of malachi 4 will do two things revelation 10 7 because he had to bring both of men is going to do two things one according to malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and what did he do he took all of the doctrines that was lost during the church ages of the no eternal hell the no father son holy ghost baptism the no trinity that was not in the first two or three church or one two and three church age almost because there was no denominational set up during that time so what he had to do though is he turned what the hearts of the children babbling pentecostal babies he said back to the faith of the fathers all right that's still not going to bring a rapture because it didn't the first time right everybody got that i'm gonna be a little slow here wait a second and then we'll finish so he had to do two things he had to have two messages number one caught the attention of the people number one he said was the healing campaign number one is when he started you know the the um discernment everybody got that but that was not the message that was to turn the hearts back and get what the loose ends straightened up god's not going to come and pick up a bride that's got a bunch of loose ends but he's going to come back and pick a bride up that knows the voice of god two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders don't let this trip you up it's just it's the voice of god revealing the word to you that's what the thunder they made it everything in the world but just simply god speaking to you through a five-fold ministry or speaking to you personally telling you where you are what you're doing here and where are you going cause you go out there and you ask 99 of the denominational world who they are yeah we're the church we're baptist we're methodists we're pentecostal right but could you are you bride brad i don't know about that bride thing business i don't know if i can be bright or not but i know that mama made it so i'm gonna make it right had a lady tell me old lady there to a neighbor of ours and her son is just as good as gold spoke highly of us he was a banker but he ain't darkened the door of a church since he was a little boy but his mama told us that i'll know he'll go to heaven because he went to church when he was little remember jim she told us that sitting in her house and he never darkened the door not one of a church we just said okay just smile you smile at him what are you gonna do you ain't gonna ain't gonna say anything about it but listen we know the truth we can't plead that right my son's not gonna make it because i come in the message my son's not gonna make it because i'm a preacher that's right that's right no you gotta have it yourself oh dad no no no daddy's gonna make it so i know i love my daddy you better love your daddy that didn't birth you the first time if you love that heavenly father you don't have to worry about the other father a lot of that stuff will work out if you'll love the heavenly father first two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the seven seals we've already been what is the seven seals redemption glory not a cloud all right all right come on not earthquake not polygamy not everything man's made it it's this whole plant eternal plant of redemption that was laid out before us and thank god some people have been preaching it for a while and one day we'll get it amen which are the revelations contained in the seven seals it will be these what divinely divine you've got to have the new birth to be divine to be connected to divine you got to have some divine inside of you amen i started to say divinity but that's the candy you got to have some divinity inside of you which wouldn't be too bad right pop loves divinity amen see what i mean it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths okay look this is a promise that they will be revealed revelations 10 7 says in the days of the voice of the seventh angel these this mystery one mystery will be made known now who it's got to be made known to somebody listen this is a two-part deal you got to have the redeemer and someone to redeem the plan of redemption includes people so it would be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally what is literally a preached on this a long time ago literally is not a type literally it's not i'm going to just turn this away just a little bit and then i'm going to turn back no i'm samuel wadedale jr the second or ever how you want to call me i'm that literal person right i'm not a i'm not a copycat right i'm not a second person i'm not an imposter mama tell you they named me but you know what see i had something to go back on i had a witness of who i am you got a witness the bible says the greater cloud of witness right amen that's what i said you're not a type right everything in the bible types me in you so that makes us literally jesus christ in bride form on the earth adam and eve were one person literally one person you say no brother they were two people walking around but they had the same dna through that great mystery of genesis 1 26 god divided them but yet they both were exactly the same bone of my bone and flesh in my flesh literally turn the hearts of the children to the pentecostal fathers exactly so thank god for that right so this whole plan is based on resurrection real quick before we close this whole plan of redemption is based on resurrection but it's got to have somebody that can get us up right so there's got to be a higher power that has already went through all these things he's already been through resurrection now listen to this let's look at job 14 verse 12. we'll read a few scriptures and then we'll close that's all right so man lies down and riseth not till the heavens be no more they shall not await nor be raised out of their sleep seems like there's no hope oh that thou would has hide me in the grave not a bad thing hide me hide me in the grave that thou would just keep me secret until thy wrath be passed that thou would have appoint me look a set time and remember me jesus remembered lazarus he knew who he was and he knew where he was and that connection even that earthly connection between jesus and lazarus drew him four days to go see his friend lazarus so don't worry folks he's not going to forget you that's why death that's why all the sting of death has been taken away of that's why all these mysteries that well we don't know where we are are we still laying in the grave are we sitting there with the coffin we can't get out of the coffin are we are we over here in this place or we over here in this place even even the prophet of god explained to us there's not even a burn in hell yet that's right i mean who teaches that most of the denominational world that you're going to you know that person's just burning in hell right now eternally no oh that thou would have hide me in the grave that thou would has keep me secret until thy wrath be past that that was to point me a set time listen there's been seven appointed times seven church ages that have passed on yes even some of this church age has been already passed on and remember me if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will i wait till my change come he knew there was going to be a resurrection and a change right he knew he wasn't going to come up the way he went down corrupt he see man go down he don't see man no more but look thou shalt call that's my whole point there has to be a resurrection call right it couldn't be in the first church age one through seven couldn't happen why you keep saying that by the way because listen we're not in a church age i thought we were in the eighth day i thought we were in the manifestation of the eternal word of god in the eighth day sure we're living in laodicea we're living in a seventh church age seven church age goes all the way through the millennium exactly but not for the bride amen thou shalt call and i will answer thee thou wilt have a desire to the work of thine hands let's go to first corinthians 15 verse 20. but now is christ risen from the dead and become the first fruits of them that slept for since by man came death by man came also resurrection of the dead there had to be a man die and pay the price and that man resurrected without that we're like job we just stay in the ground but thank god we know what jesus christ went through and look for as an adam all die we blame me for a lot of things that goes on in this world but the bible says in adam all die because he's the one that sold us out adam's the one that sold us out even so in christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order we're not first church age listen we're not on the first church age we're not under second church age we're not under the third sure we got the anointing of all those ages but this anointing for this end time is a body change in a rapture and a resurrection amen and we'll tell you that ordering just real quick if that's okay afterwards they that are christ at his coming but every man in his own order christ the first fruits in other words he came up first afterwards they that are christ at his coming revelations 20 verse 4 and i saw thrones and they stay that sat upon them and judgment was given unto them them us and i saw the souls of them were beheaded for the witness of jesus for the word of god which had not worshipped the beast neither his image neither had received his mark upon their forehead or in their hands that they lived and reigned with christ one thousand years but the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand years were finished this is the first resurrection this is the resurrection you and i must pinpoint it's the first resurrection listen if you're born again you'll come up in the first resurrection if you're not born again you're gonna have to wait to the second resurrection and that's just pretty simple because look blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection now hold on just a minute he said i'm not gonna die that's okay you can be a part you're gonna be a part of it still there's got to be a shout a voice trumpet right got to be somebody that announces this part blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection you know the whole bride that's alive and passed on is going to have part in that first resurrection amen on such the second death hath no power glory oh my but they shall be priests of god and of christ and shall reign with him one thousand years a couple more scriptures will be done because we gotta get to first thessalonians and let's see the order of this first thessalonians 4 13 but i would not have you be ignorant brethren concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not even as others which have no hope and that's the truth a lot of people don't have hope they don't know where they're at they don't know where their loved ones made it they don't know how they got there or where they're going or how they're coming back here but we do we know the whole order of this thing for if we believe that jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in jesus shall god bring with him he didn't say anything about death sleep with jesus in jesus for this we say unto you by the word of the lord that we which are alive and remain wow that's me and you are you alive tonight some of you are some of you are not or you're either collect your eyes closed anyway yeah but if if you want to put yourself in a scripture an updated today scripture that's it that's it right there [Applause] updated today every day you live it keeps updating to the day that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout voice of an arch angel and the trump of god now we know there's we know what happened not a hype but a message but but listen that message did once you saw the message of the hour it's like somebody said hey and what'd you do you turned away from what that other little bitty voice was talking to you and you heard that voice the voice of the archangel and the trump of god and the dead in christ shall rise first first let's don't worry about a body change let's don't worry about the day of a rapture we got to get the dead saints out of the ground first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the lord in the air and so shall ever we ever be with the lord wherefore comfort one another with these words i'm gonna back these scriptures back up next week let's read first corinthians 15 47 and then we'll close right here musicians get ready to come the first manners of the earth earthy i'm looking at it right now this is the earthy man we were all born earthy men and women the second man is the lord from heaven glory your second birth is what you better be depending on because your first birth will kill you your second birth will kill you but give you eternal life because it destroys the old man remember as is the earthy such are they also that are earthy we've seen some of them right there's some earthy people they love this earth they love being here they love doing stuff on this earth so do i but not none of this junk that's going on now and as is the heavenly such as they that are heavenly and as we have borne the image of the earthy looking at it now we shall also bear the image of the heavenly if you're born again now this i say brethren that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of god neither does corruption inherit incorruption everybody got that you sow flesh and blood the corruptible part this has got to be changed it's not going to be done away with and you get a new one he's going to change this one from what from corruption to incorruption behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep amen you want to put yourself in another scripture there's another one we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised what incorruptible and we shall be chained and we shall be changed so they got we got to have a resurrection first then we'll be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption what a promise and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the same that is written death is swallowed up in victory o death where is your sting o grave where is thy victory the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ thank god musicians come but we know somewhere in this message not james dobson not joel osteen kenneth hagin kenneth copeland i hope they called me when i if i since i announced their name online i hope they do but then listen are you ashamed of what you believe no sir i'm like brother dale i'll challenge anybody amen own this word of god but they don't have the shout or the voice or the trumpet they're not included in this if they're not bribed you're not included yes this is inclusive yes it is segregationalism but it's god doing the segregating right he wants us to segregate from the things of the world get out of that stuff that we're in the world is waiting for that shout and a voice and a trumpet because they'll preach it but you and i have already received it see to us i don't mean it's old news but to us we know what that is we know where to go to get it oh glory they do not right they do not they're wandering stars they're wandering out wondering whether well what shout is it is it a hey no it's a message that was sent to get your attention right and then you heard from the voice of god you didn't hear the voice of william brown you heard the voice of god the shout the voice and brother brown said that was a resurrection trumpet and i believe we're getting ready because it's got to come first that's the next thing we're looking at is the dead and christ shall rise first and then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together but thank god this whole plan hinged on one person saying destroy this body and i'll raise it up in three days he said well man some you know they said one man never spoke like this before no they know ever there's never a man said i'm gonna die and three days later you're gonna see me again and he said it lazarus didn't lavish just got sick and died he didn't know what was going on yeah but jesus stood up one day and he said you destroy this temple in three days you're gonna see it again they said well what are you talking about he said ain't talking about that i ain't talking about that temple out there i'm talking about this temple right he said oh no you ah you can't do that he said just watch you just watch he proved who he was the prophet of god said when he resurrected he proved it but they didn't believe it can you believe it can you believe that you're resurrected sitting in heavenly places already got your white robe on and ready to go amen i hope you do if you don't the altar is open let's sing a song god bless you great and all my sin is the blood that still sings [Music] me free do what to praise him i know the bloods do you know today do you know that the blood's been applied to your life i hope you don't walk out of this building without knowing that get a prayer claw for scotland all right [Music] it'll touch his body but lord stir his water for salvation lord just make him lord to where he has to look to you lord and that he'll come to you father we know that's a mother's wish we asked it in the name of jesus christ [Music] [Applause] amen that's right greater than all the blood of the land sing it to him oh he's greater than [Music] it's the grace that still says to praise brother ernieville nueva just passed away don't know any details we just got to got a message sometimes you don't understand things but who's in control god's in control we never questioned it was his time and i'll guarantee you that man was ready they probably had to get out of his way going into that sixth dimension and we can laugh about that because we know where he's at we know where he doesn't change he's the same brother ernie he's done running tiptoes up against somebody knocks him down probably saying hello first time i met the man he about knocked me down but we don't know the details maybe we'll find out later it doesn't really matter he's passed on so uh let's remember the family i don't know if any of his family is alive is it mama or daddy or something but but we all love brother honey amen we'll see him again we won't see him in that old body nope sure they're going to plant it in corruption but it ain't going to stay there it's going to be raised in corruption what brother ernie preached is going to come to pass amen because he preached a resurrection message and a positive message and even in the light of all this we still need to be positive for him for brother ernie he just talked to dad not not too long ago we were going to try to get him to come come down maybe a little bit later on this year but um god bless you don't let this mate don't let us be sad we're supposed to rejoice sorry oh my lord that's why he maybe it's when he's two he knocked down but uh brother ernie liked to jump and hug he jumped and then he hugged you you just mad make sure you caught him when he hugged you but uh we're supposed to rejoice when this happens but i guess being human beings it ain't happening right now for me but uh but we know he's happy he's met what he's preached he's met the people that he's preached to this went on he's meeting with him right now and that should be a joyous time because he'll never have no sorrow no more he'll never have to wear them silly boots that he wears for all that um stuff in his legs his neuropathy i was thinking when i went and let your dog out couple days ago you know you're welcome but the last time i saw brother gary standing up was on that porch not when it was in you know but when it was just a regular porch and it brought back memories but you know what they're good ones anybody you've met that's the bride of jesus christ they can't be bad memories who in the world could think a bad memory of brother ernie find one but don't waste your time because you ain't going to but uh god bless you um like i said maybe we'll know some more about it later on but really doesn't matter we just need to pray for the people in cloverdale i don't know if they were able to i know canada was locked down tight i don't know if they were able to go across the board or any at all to go to brother biscuits and i don't know if brother biscuit can come to washington to to do the funeral so but maybe god will make a provision because he loved his pastor there's no doubt he loved brother he loved brother uh biscuit with all of his heart and now brother biscuit is gonna have to do his funeral so um god bless you we love you let's sing that one more time and it will be [Music] dismissed my sins it's the blood that still clears [Music] me
