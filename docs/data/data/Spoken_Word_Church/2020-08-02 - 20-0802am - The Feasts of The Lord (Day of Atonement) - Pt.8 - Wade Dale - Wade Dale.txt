boy um all these other people goodness gracious i'm just reading brother um that scott's request list and it gets longer and longer and longer and longer there's a lot of people in the message that are that are infected and affected by this virus and brother daryl ward his whole family's got it so i talked to him yesterday takes back and forth and he's a real trooper he's asking about mom and not worrying about himself i said hey how about you he said i'm on day eight and he said it ain't good so just remember him in your prayers there's a lot of uh other sicknesses going around that we need to remember also i know we pray uh thank god for the uh that we can get uh this information out i know somebody don't people don't care much for social media but it gets it out there pretty fast so that you can begin to pray and um let's see oh here we go wednesday bro zach black brother bob black brother boyd or josh brother joe canada brother richard brother terrence myself brother luis brother josiah brother danny brother tony and esther uh brother gary krantz brother ryan brother anderson brother aaron will be here wednesday night so the rest of you um keep us in your prayers and then we'll turn back around and make another list for sunday so for those of you that travel a long way on wednesday i was able we're going to kind of let you stay at home for a little bit you know but uh please remember this we're praying that this is just temporary right amen that we can get back to the service and and uh remember dad also um he's still a trooper still standing right there amongst all that that's going on and we will pray that the lord will continue to be with him i want to address one thing i i hate rumors and you hate rumors too and i hate rumors especially when they're lies so there was a rumor started yesterday that sister um frieda duncan had or freda roberts sorry had coveted well that's that's not true that's a lie so i want you to consider the source i don't like rumors anyway but when it comes to this disease or this virus if that gets out in the airwaves everybody goes ballistic i hope she don't have it because she's sitting in my house today right now with sister jim watching the service but she looks very well from to me she's been checking her temperature and just make sure uh but there was a rumor started yesterday and uh wherever the rumor came from was a lie and we don't need to start rumors that we don't know now if if i come out here and say sister dale's got coven then you can we can agree that that's not a rumor that's the truth but when you start rumors that somebody's got something and they don't have it and that goes with everything you need to um there was a there's a wonderful philosopher that was on tv a long time ago and i always use his statements andy nip it at the bud for those of you that don't know that that was barney five he's always saying andy nip it at the bud so nip it at the bud don't go starting rumors that you don't know nothing about especially with this virus because it gets people nervous that we shouldn't have been so so let's let's um be cautious all right be cautious about what we do and and and you know if you don't know it don't say it if it's not the truth all right so it was not the truth since frida does not have coven 19. she's fine like i said as far as far as i could tell last night when she came to the house and then this morning she's fine everything's okay but just keep praying that that we will that this thing will be done away with and that um we'll get back brother uh when i got a message i know some of you know brother howard carroll he's in his 90s he's been in the hospital with it but they say he's on the mend and ready to come back home so we praise god that that um that brother howard there at that age is able to fight that thing it's a fight life is a fight i think yesterday you know everything's a fight you fight off disease your body's fighting disease every day and you don't even know it some things come across through the air through the food how many times have you asked god to bless your food you should every time you put something in your mouth why because there may be something in that food that will affect your body but if you pray to god that that thing will destroy it the demon before the virus before it gets to you so but we still want to be cautious we still want to do the phase one we still want to wear a mask as we leave and downstairs talking make sure you wash your hands and stay six feet apart unless your family members which you hadn't been six feet apart at your house so um but we thank god that um he's give us an absolute and that's jesus christ and that's what we're going to talk about today on this day of atonement there was two goats one is released on the day of atonement and one's killed and we'll see what that is in just a little bit so god bless you um i know we all have unspoken requests again that we have in our heart that whole list like i said brother david siler brother daryl ward um brother richie douglas is coming out of it and his wife all the different ones so it's not just we're not just uh singled out it's all over the country i talked to brother claude last night and there's some brothers in new mexico that really got hit hard and they've had to shut the churches down so so it's it's it's going through but we pray that it goes through and then leaves us right right and that's the way we want to look at today in this day of atonement let's bow our heads dear heavenly father thank you lord for this day thanks for the opportunity that we have to come back to service lord this is truly a feast and it's the feast of the lord and we come to these feasts lord and uh not per se so much as israel would do but lord we go through all these feasts in our life of the passover and the unleavened bread all the different ones lord we live through them as christians every day and now the prophet spoke and told us lord that we are now feasting under the feast of tabernacles which lord is an indwelling lord of the holy spirit in the lives and hearts and the very soul of an individual this is not just a festive good time lord but as we come now to this day of atonement we see that you even told us to afflict our soul all the way down to the very heart of man you haven't required that before in the feast but lord today in this day of atonement you have required it lord and we want to see lord you being our atonement or our ransom or our sacrifice lord you're the ultimate sacrifice you gave your life so you could do away with sin and do away with all these heartaches and troubles that we have lord we're dependent on you to come today and speak to the people be with the ones that are sick the ones that are not here the ones that are here lord we pray that you'd be with us and lead us and guide us by your holy spirit in jesus name we pray amen um feast of the lord we'll talk about today the day of atonement this will be number six it's kind of strange how number six comes into the feast of atonement and it shows right after the feast of trumpets and we'll see that maybe i want you to be able to see and we'll go back later on with i think about last night we're going to go through the plan of redemption because the plan of redemption the seals of the plan of redemption if there's seven seals there's seven trumpets seven vials this is the day of atonement this is number six where israel is going to realize what they did all right and they're going to in symbolic form god told them to do these things so let's read in leviticus 23 verse 26 and the lord spake unto moses saying also on the tenth day of the seventh month now we went from the first day a blowing of trumpets now we've come to the seventh month on the tenth day so ten days later there shall be a day of atonement it's one day it shall be in holy convocation unto you and you shall afflict your souls how deep is that you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made by fire unto the lord and you shall do no work on that same day for it is a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the lord your god for whosoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted on that same day he shall be cut off from among his people and whatsoever soul that be that doeth any work on that same day that soul will i destroy from among the people listen on that day between christ was put on the cross it was one man he did all the work he's not required that you do any work you just got to believe what he done you shall do no manner of work it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations in all your dwellings it shall be unto you a sabbath of rest and you shall afflict your souls in the ninth day of the month and evening remember it starts at six o'clock from even to even or evening to evening shall you celebrate your sabbath you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of his word so now this is the day of atonement if you will pull the chart up please and we'll kind of put this in pres in perspective and look at it real quick and that way i'll show you exactly where what we're uh where we're at everybody have a good week amen it's been a good week it's been a trial but it's been a good week we made it to church and it was there now it is okay all right so now we are now on the day of atonement which is right here which is a fault one of the fall feasts we'll go back and talk about trumpets just a few minutes because these two tie together and this is your last one here so we're going to take the trumpets but this is one day on the 10th day of tesory which is october we're going to see that god told him one day i want you to i mean go all not just not just afflict your body i want you to mourn i want your soul to know what i did for you because what it's doing is looking back on the day of atonement you're looking all the way back to when it began right here because without this passover lamb being killed you don't have anything to atone for there's no atonement unless you've got the lamb that's killed all right does everybody understand that so that one day of atonement is an important day it is one of the most holy days in all of israel all right so now let's go to and back up now remember the feast of trumpets was on the first day of that month of october october the 1st the 10th and the 15th right in there you got a lot of things going on and it is our what it is our fall harvest month most of our crops even our crops are harvested in october and november somewhere in there so it always coincides with that with that even in our calendar but remember because it's going to be important in just a minute this is the first month of the what religious calendar this is the first month of the jewish religious calendar and it goes 12 months now the civil calendar or the calendar that the jews day by day go by their daily calendar like our daily calendar starts in october all right so that's their civil calendar goes from here to here all right their religious calendar goes from here all the way around to here and it shows these feast days why because the feast days need to be lined up you can't have the spring feast start over here amen and obviously you can't have the fall the fall feast starting over here so god set it up but now remember man said october the 1st god told moses we've read it many times that this is the first month for you when they were coming out of egypt when they were there in the book of exodus god said this is the first month this is the first day of the month this is what's going to happen then on the 14th of that same month we're going to have a passover all right everybody got that say amen all right so we've been through this so passover is what they killed the lamb and they were leaving egypt a type of you and i leaving the world and starting our journey all right now what we're going to do is is we're going to i want you to just kind of put this in the back of your mind that this all coincides with your new birth okay how many you got you got how many stages you got justification sanctification what's unleavened bread cleaning the living out of your house sanctification baptism of the holy ghost you connect these two together the word comes the trumpet blows you come to the message of the hour if you're born again today and you hear the message of the hour you got to come now this is not the holy ghost okay the message is not the holy ghost the holy ghost you can get and receive by listening to the word of god or repenting of your sins and asking god to forgive you and you go through sanctification and then you go through the bat then you come to church and god quickens something in your heart or he brings a minister to say one little thing then then you get the new birth but as you but when you get the new birth it's going to turn you then you're going to hear a what a gospel trumpet you're going to hear the last trumpet you're going to hear the last trump because this is the last trump we're going to talk about that in a minute then you're going to realize to me that day of atonement it makes me realize that that's now in me and then the tabernacles is when we're going to leave all right everybody got that that's the change of the body for us and it will be the change of the body for the jews and when they go in their rapture all right all right so don't fall asleep we'll be all right so let's go to the trumpets because i i we still didn't get finished with the trumpets the other day let's go to leviticus 23 verse 23 and the lord spanking to moses saying speaking of the children of israel saying in the seventh month and the first day of the month shall you have a sabbath a memorial of blowing of trumpets and holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein but you shall offer an offering made by fire unto the lord now let's go to isaiah 58 1 because remember the bible speaks of trumpets being a voice being that there may be a natural trumpet sound as we were talking last sunday there may or when yeah last sunday that there's a natural trumpet sounds but there's a voice behind that i mean there's something that even tells you to retreat to move left to move right all the different sounds of a trumpet but we know that the trumpet that's sounding now is not a to do to do trumpet it's a trumpet that is voiced out because watch cry loud spare not lift up thy voice like a trumpet and show thy people their transgressions in the house of jacob their sins that's where uh that i received my commission i believe to minister the gospel was right there in that one scripture and uh because that's what you're doing we all hate it it's a trumpet but listen we're all trumpeters but we can't be blowing c note over here and d note over here and f this and e flat and all these different things you got to be in the same mode of music you got to be able to to we hear luther's trumpet but now luther's trumpet is not my trumpet to take me up that's right amen wesley's trumpet is a trumpet and there's a group of people heard that trumpet they rejoiced under that trumpet and they went up under that or they're going up under that trumpet now they're all in the grave now but they're going up under that trumpet of martin luther john wesley pentecost and now the message of the hour is the last trump it's the last trumpet it's the last thing you're going to hear but now it's not the last thing that israel is going to hear because those trumpets are going to israel to not sound a different sound all right they'll be okay with that all right let's go to ezekiel 33 and that's what we were looking at sunday son of man speak to the children of thy people and say unto them when i bring the sword upon a land if the people of the land take a man of their coast and set him for their watchmen so we're talking about ministers we're talking about fivefold ministry we're talking about now you remember it's not an actual watchman in a tower it's somebody that watches after hebrews 13 tells us is somebody to watch after your soul okay we're preaching to souls today not preaching the bodies that's happened a lot of times they beat you to death and make you do this and make you do that and make you not sisters not cut your hair and your men not do's and don'ts but if you ever get that soul born again now don't say there won't be no worries there will be worries and there'll be troubles and trials but you won't fight what the bible says you won't fight it when it says not to do this and don't do that all right so the watchman is set to do what when he seeth or understandeth the sword come upon the land or the word he blows the trumpet and warns the people then whosoever heareth the sound of the trumpet and taketh not warning if the sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head brother dale's responsible for your soul but if you don't do anything about that it's your problem at the day of judgment it's your problem at the if you don't you understand we can just make a long list it's it's your problem but now remember though if you have a watchman that's not right all right who's ever here at the sound of the trumpet takes not warning a sword come and take him away his blood shall be upon his own head he heard the sound of the trumpet and he took not warning his blood shall be upon him but he that taketh warning shall deliver his soul in other words it won't be on the pastor it'll be on you but if the watchmen see the sword or the false word coming or the enemy coming and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned that's why we're still here right 50 60 years after the prophet we have not been warned by a proper trumpet and i'm not saying there's not one this is not a one-man job you understand what i mean brother branham was one man we got filtered through him he was a trumpet and we heard what he said but now there are many trumpets but they got to be sounding the same music that's right amen but if the watchmen see the sword come and blow not the trumpet and the people be not warned oh it's all right you can do what you want to if the sword come and take any person from among them he is taken away in his own iniquity iniquity is what knowing to do right or not doing it but his blood will i require at the watchman's hand so it will be that's why there'll be many people we read the scripture where the bible tells us that many will come in that day and say lord lord have i not cast out devils have i not spoken tongues have i not done these great mighty things and you know what god's going to tell them he's going to say look you were the wrong trumpet you were sounding your own message or you were sounding this and that and the other and you were not proclaiming my message and we see them now they just leave the message they don't proclaim the wrong trumpet they're just leaving their people are throwing the trumpet down well they never had the right trumpet to start with they never had the right trumpet to start with if they had the right trumpet this trumpet takes us to the body change this trumpet we're sounding today in the message of the hour around the world will take us to a body change it will not take us to false doctrine right amen so in the feast of the trumpets it was a blowing of trumpets but now remember don't get it wrong with the seven trumpets of revelations eight because they will sound with seven different angels sounding trumpets that's not to us don't worry about that we're not gonna be here remember brother branham was gonna preach the feast of the trumpets he are the seven trumpets seven vials seven plagues and then god told him said you preached him supernaturally what in the sixth seal which what is the sixth seal two prophets going to israel taking them the message and then the plagues falling on the earth but we're gone we're not here that's why brother brown said they're not to us the trumpets of revelation 7 but now this feast of the trumpets is to us that feast of the trumpets that you've got to hear that trumpet sound every day and you've got to determine by your filter whether it's right or wrong whether it's the right sound or the wrong sound all right let's read here first corinthians 14 verse 7 and even things without life giving sound whether pipe or harp except they give a distinction in the sound how shall it be known what is piped or heart in other words how do you know that what i'm saying today is right how do you know that what brother branham said was right how do you know that because that trumpet gives a certain sound and a certain tone or a certain ring and what it rings inside of you as we were talking before last sunday you'd be sitting in a congregation and and this preacher gets up and he's preaching all these false doctrine and all these people are shouting and praising the lord and you're just sitting there why there's something about that sound you're hearing that's not right amen we've all been there if not get ready that's right you will experience it somewhere in your life for if the trumpet given uncertain sound who shall prepare himself to the battle now the whole deal with the watchmen here the whole deal with that watchman he don't just go up there and blow through a horn he's trained he's trying to give you the note give you the sound the sound of retreat is a certain cadence the sound of charge is a certain cadence but you know what you got to learn that before that happens you don't learn on the day of battle brother don he was in the military some of you were in the military you didn't learn now that was a lot of things you learned on the fly that's for sure but if you were out there in the heat of battle they trained you before i like what brother harris said brother harris said that drill instructor i hated his guts and he said i was physically so he said i so hated the man he said i wanted to survive vietnam and come back and kill him he said the drill instructor said that's exactly what i want you to do survive if you want to come back and kill me it'd be me and you but he made him survive out there with a will to live to get back home and that's what's happening with all of us with all this going on with all these uncertain sounds going off there is a true sound folks it this is not something that god was caught off guard he knew this was going to happen he allowed this to happen i always go back to job here's job living the life of a king on earth everybody loved job job was a great man god said um hey devil you ever considered that guy over there he said well now god you've got some prayer cloths over the doors and all jobs cars or donkeys whatever it was in what cars was it you've got a hands around him you got all these he said okay i'll tuck him away i'll take him away he trusted job right so much until he lifted it up just a little bit so that the devil could get in but you know what it done it gave glory to god not the devil because the devil lost that battle there's no doubt the devil lost that one amen because what did job do he got restored double what he had before seven children in glory and seven children on earth fifteen thousand or whatever it was of cattle that he had only seven or eight thousand he had double that so in the end job was more blessed than he was in the beginning but now while listen while we're going through this and while job was going through this job probably probably in his humanity thought man this can't get no worse than this and i don't that's why he said he then job pops up and he says oh that i was never born that i never that i died before i took one breath from all that's coming on me but you know what elihu comes on the scene and he just tells job stand up get off your heat stand up and i'm going to tell you what god's going to do for you job says i know my redeemer liveth and you know also job says in job 30-something i think it is job says i found a ransom well you know what ransom means atonement we're fixing to talk about that ransom me in other words job had found an atonement for what he had done and the things in his life so okay we'll get to that i got a little ahead of you first corinthians 15 verse 51 behold i show you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last trump for the trumpet shall sound now we've heard that that is a gospel trumpet that we are hearing now we're not going to go out in the grave and all get horns and go no there's going to be a sound let's think about this there's going to be a sound that that sixth dimension has never heard in this dimension before something's gonna sound and say hey death has been destroyed in a group of people don't be afraid to come over here oh come on people that's as true as god's won that'll happen we're looking at it right here we're not looking for well we're going to just we're going to bank on brother branham's trumpet being part of no it was the last trumpet and the trump the trumpet that the last trump brother branham brought us to trump to shout the voice we saw we'll see that in a minute for the trumpet shall sound where is it sounding in the people columbus trumpet sounded in the people luther's trumpet sounded in the people the prophet's message is sounding he said rapturing faith lies in these books and tapes we've just got to get all the uncertain sounds out of the way for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruptable must put on incorruption and this mortal must put on immortality so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this mortal shall have put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the same that is written death is swallowed up i like that death is swallowed up in victory because we caught the last trumpet's message and we not only just heard it we became it that's our whole deal we've got to become that because watch this revelations 4 verse 1. now we know revelations 1 john was standing he heard the voice of the trumpet and when he turned what did he see he saw the bride in the church ages one like the son of man with his hands out like this with the church ages which is what in bride form gerd about the paps now here's another trumpet not a different one but this one that makes a sound for us to leave the place after this i looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice i heard as it were of a trumpet talking to me which said come up hither and i will show you these things which must be hereafter immediately i was in the spirit behold the throne was set in heaven and one said on the throne so john was caught up in a voice like a trumpet which was no other trumpet than the one you're hearing now the one that we're hearing now that we've come in under this last trump for the trumpet shall sound time shall be no more for me and you but now remember we were reading the commentary now just for a second and you don't have the one for the feast of the trumpets because i want you to remember something there is a trumpet that is connected to the day of atonement so just hang on just a minute but the feast of the trumpets begins 10 days of consecration can you pull the chart back up please begins 10 days of consecration and repentance before god so when that trumpet blows it's not just that well we're we're done we no there's 10 days that goes by that they're blowing that trumpet and there's 10 days because you know that on that tenth day listen god required on that tenth day a day of atonement not only to reflect but you couldn't eat you had to fast you couldn't do no work you couldn't even go into your wife no relations that whole day that day was an affliction of your soul that you were going to reflect on what god has done for you and we'll read that in just a minute but on the feast of the trumpet see so we've come through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost we've got into the word and what we're hearing now a trumpet a trumpet has sounded and you and i have going we are heading toward the day of atonement just like israel we're going to see that too we are in type they are in reality even one of the commentators says that israel now does not like the day of atonement see they have no sacrifice to make right so it's just a day that they can't do anything and even nominal jews are not supposed to do anything and they don't like that why well they're not born again they don't know god they think their god's coming all right they think they've got to go way back over here that's why that when the two witnesses go to israel and they sound their trumpet it's going to bring them to the day of atonement we'll read it in just a few minutes then they're going to take a tabernacle change and you and i are taking a tabernacle change to me i think now i was thinking the other day what greater time to be under the day of atonement i know we're feasting under the feast of tabernacles we're feasting but what about a day of atonement where we have all this sickness and we have all this trouble going on in the uh just in our ranks why not have a solemn day right why not have a solemn fast don't declare it remember don't like brother don't declare oh i'm going fast for the no just silently one day take you a day doesn't matter what day it is but afflict your soul because my soul sure my body hurts i'm getting older but my soul grieves for the people that are in the hospital for the people that are in this message that have tried their best to serve god we've tried together back together it's done uh people's having weddings and people having meetings and this thing has come back among them and you're wondering what in the world but i always go back to the thing with the prayer cloth we were protected and then all of a sudden god says all right devil let's see how they'll react you see how they'll react because i know how they're going to react because i know the end of the story the devil does not know the end of the story that's why he keeps fighting but on this feast of trumpets it's the beginning of 10 days of consecration and repentance before god now when is it though it's at the harvest time we're not supposed to be getting more likes folks we're supposed to be getting more sincere we're supposed to be heading towards something that i'm telling you when brother branham said cancer would be a toothache compared to what's coming it's here right it's here cancer is bad but they've had a lot of progress in cancer but if this thing ever gets you and it doubles on top of something you're in trouble a pre-existing condition you understand what i'm saying but listen this means a shout or a blowing it commemorates the end of the agriculture and festival year so now we're coming to the autumn of our year we're getting ready to be harvested jesus said hang on don't harvest right now wait till they mature in the harvest season and then you'll know the difference between the wheat and the tares because really when you first start your garden i was thinking yesterday when i was up there pulling up corn in the garden you start out and truly weeds look the same as plants when they begin because you don't know which one to cut down and i've inadvertently cut a few plants down hoeing my garden but if you let them get on up a little higher let them mature a little more you'll start seeing the difference between a weed and wheat or the weed and a piece of corn i also yesterday talk about you talk about multiplication just getting off of this for a minute but i we got close to 800 ears of corn off of our off of our garden and believe me i know there's that many we counted them but i was up there and it's probably what t twice the size of this room maybe the just where the corn was at and i pulled them stalks up the other day and i pulled all of them up last night yesterday day before then big old stalks that already took the ears off of it and there's piles this high of corn stalks i'm making a point here you know what that came from all those 800 ears of corn we put up giveaway sold and done everything else with we've got all that food in our freezer in our refrigerator we've got all these stalks that the corn the cows are going to enjoy once we give them to the cows there's there's about three piles no three piles this high and one pile this eye what's my point every bit of that all of that came from one seed and let's just put it more like this all that poundage hundreds of pounds i bought in a bag of seeds to plant the whole garden about this big so see spiritual multiplication is the same identical way god can take nothing he can take one seed he was what he was the first fruit the first seed to come to maturity which meant there was more of us coming that you and i come to maturity because of that one seed because remember that one seed is who christ and then you and i if we have christ inside of us we're that one seed and think of think of brother danny if we took all them 800 ears and let them dry out how many hundreds of thousands of seed we would have off of that one off that one little bag of seeds so see spiritual multiplication is the same way you've got to hear the trumpet you've got to get under you've got to get under the sun s-o-n you've got to get the rain former ladder rain so that's what we're coming to we're cut we're not coming now look some are here some have just received the baptism of the holy ghost they're that 11th hour worker that's going to get paid just as much as the ones that started all the way back here a long time ago amen thank god for that thank god for that parable that people are not left behind i don't know why in the world you would make a christian movie called left behind think about that one we don't leave nobody behind god's not gonna leave him god's not gonna we're not gonna take a rapture and god's gonna go missed one no he's gonna take everyone but it's up to you to get ready and we're going through these feasts listen folks we are in the evening time we are in the harvest the evening time we're we've we've been through all this and some are coming through this but you're going to come to it fast we've heard the trumpet we're coming to the day of atonement and now we're feasting under the feast of tabernacles which is god tabernacled in human flesh the commentator says here there was an alarm of sorts and can be understood as a call to introspect and repentance in the new testament we see the lord's second coming will be accompanied by the sound of a trumpet now most of the world thinks it's going to be the sound of a trumpet no the gospel trumpet you're hearing now this is the only sound this world is going to get unless there's two witnesses going over the two witnesses this is it there's no other sound and thank god for the for the different ones the you know you got hagees and all the different ones out there that are trying their best to preach the gospel but they do not have this last gospel trumpet you and i are the recipients and the hearers of this last gospel trumpet all right amen i'll clap myself too because thank god because you take a you take a tape and and you take a tape to some of your buddies and you you let them listen to brother branham and and what happens to us when we when we press play which is okay to press play but what happens we turn our attention to that we know that sound we know that voice but more than that brother kern we know what's behind that voice it's the voice of god now the hagies and i'm i'm saying it but john hage you know they do the best they can they're trying their best but they are not the last trumpet they're not one of the seven stars they're not one of the seven spirits they're just not that now they could be anything else uh like um um a billy graham and oral roberts they had a trumpet they went down to sodom and declared brother brown said they blinded those sodomites that's their trumpet but now i can't feed off oral robbers trumpet we can pick things out of it yeah we can pick things out of billy graham but that's not our trumpet folks but now listen this is what i'm leading up to because when we realize that god as brother dale's talking about being we've chosen in him before the foundation of the world our names were written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world because of god's foreknowledge knowing you would hear that trumpet sound and you would respond different right than your neighbor that's right amen amen because see they may hear the hagies and the different ones and and and gravitate to it copeland's not you know all the big name guys and they may well now i don't i don't i don't search out to listen to these folks now they do good for the people that hear them now don't get me wrong okay but because there's a lot of foolish virgin out there there's a lot of people that's going to come up so high and not go any further but remember they're not part of this harvest they are not you are the only ones that's a part of this harvest right here and see when i do that it doesn't make me feel so high and mighty it puts me right here then i mourn for those that can't hear it and i mourn because god you chose me you know i would hear that sound and the way i would respond you've done all this for me see that puts me that afflicts my soul that goes all the way down deep when you know that how many times brother zach how many times listen just walk through the world they hear no sound except politics talking heads this talk show that talk show all their rapper stars and all their movie stars you see what satan has just he's expanded his kingdom and he's given you so much noise noise that's right and that's what he's done god has given us the trumpet amen for us to respond to satan has given a trumpet to the world and whatever it is rap rock and country and all these different he's just throwing it out there but let me tell you something folks you being a crowd of people you let danny fountain get separated from ellie in in a crowd and they might be screaming they might be shouting they might be uh you know cursing and yakking and talking and screaming but you let ellie say what she call you granddad grandan what he don't hear no other noise right i can tell deanna's voice from anybody don't even have to look same way with god that's right all this noise brother zach was going on this whole world there was noise going on and all of a sudden you decided you decided to say father i need some help i don't believe god he never heard any other voice there was no other voice he heard but zach black's voice now what about a god that created the universe brother boy created this everything and all of a sudden he goes what do you need what do you need to me that's the atonement what do you need right i'm here for you and you go god what's the first thing you say i'm not worthy that's right all right huh amen god i'm not worthy to be counted among god i'm not worthy because my sin has piled up and piled up and piled up but god says i hear your voice you've heard my trumpet and not only has he saved your soul he's brought you to an endtime message he's brought you to the very last trump that only will bring a resurrection only the others will not bring a resurrection this will only bring a resurrection oh what a day of atonement where you just and yeah we ought to be happy but you ought to be inside you you want to thank god why me and i'll promise you he'll tell you why he'll tell you why because john knew that voice of jesus and when he said it said it sounded like the sound of a trumpet he said when i turned and looked i didn't see jesus i saw jesus in bride form so the bride was connected to him amen so you and i are connected listen we're the body we're the body he's the head we're the body right the whole bible tells us we're the body of christ so he has no body without me and you that's right amen well what a day of atonement but let's let's get into the day atonement real quick leviticus 23 26. i want you to think about these trumpets now hold on just a second for 10 days they're going to sound for 10 days working up to this one day where everything's silent silence in heaven silence a day of atonement no work you can't even cook can't go anywhere with your family nothing one day to reflect on what god's done for you day of atonement leviticus 23 26 let's read it excuse me and the lord spake unto moses saying also on the tenth day of the seventh month now remember that's the tenth day there shall be a day of atonement it shall be a holy convocation unto you and you shall afflict your souls and offer an offering made of fire unto the lord and you shall do no work in that same day for it is a day of atonement to make an atonement for you before the lord your god all right and we're going to read what's going on but let's look at the hebrew lexicon and see what this word atonement means to cover to purge make reconciliation the bible tells us oh let me tell you something about atonement it's mentioned 70 times in the bible 69 of them in the old testament there's only one time in the book of romans the bible talks about why you don't need a day of a day of atonement once christ died you don't need that day anymore there was a day of atonement but you don't need that day ever every year remember in romans 8 it says the sacrifice being made every year would make the comer there and two perfect you don't need to sacrifice again if it makes you perfect but it only covered but then paul talks about a ministry of reconciliation to reconcile us back to christ to cover over with pitch you can ask noah about that what carried noah over was what he pitched um to cover over pacifi pacify propitiate to cover over atone for sin make atonement for so something has got when you come to the day of atonement atonement means that we're going to cover over now remember that was in the old testament it covered your sin right that blood of that animal and the blood of that goat whatever it was it at the time it atoned for your sin you were covered but your sin was still there but now when christ come takes it completely away all right to cover over a tone for sin and like i said before uh the other definition is ransom see because remember brother brown said you got yourself put in a pawn shop now to get something out of a pawn shop what happens you got to pay a ransom or you got to pay a fee but it's a ransom because what it does it redeems what was taken to the pawn shop so that's what god does he went in and paid your ransom he made an atonement for you he didn't just to cover over he atoned in other words he took your place because what we're going to see is in just a minute what happens on the day of atonement all right so let's read now uh this is kind of what we've been we've been staying with the uh questions in the bible or or gotquestions.com and it it seems to me to be really close to what the uh what we want you to see so watch this right here i'll get out here when i read it the day of atonement leviticus 23 is also known as yon kippur now yam means day and kippur means like first of the year so this would be like i said before this is the first of the year for their civil calendar you got to remember that because i'm going to read you something in a minute that's going to help you with um leviticus 25 8 all right seven sevens 49 years was the most solemn holy day of all the israelites feasts and festivals occurring once a year on the tenth day of test read the seventh month of the hebrew calendar which is october for us on that day the high priest was to perform elaborate rituals to atone for the sins of the people now what happens is is as we read this aaron when he goes in daily or weekly and does the sacrifices he's got on the epod he's got on the colorful things when he goes in on the day of atonement it's pretty much all white clothing he's just plain okay he's approaching god because he's instead of god and really he was he went for the people but now he's going in not just to make an atonement for israel he's going to make an atonement for himself and make an atonement for even the holy place or the altar watch the most solemn holy day on that day the high priest was to perform elaborate rituals to atone for the sins of the people described in leviticus 16. if you want to read that save time the atonement ritual began with aaron our subsequent high priest of israel coming into the holy of holies the so the solemnity of the day was underscored by god telling moses to warn aaron to not to come into the most holy place whenever he felt like it see now i'm talking about old testament now that's not us you and i now are to come boldly because the thing has the the curtain's been pulled back but it had to begin somewhere in type all right this olympus olympia the solomon entity of the day was underscored by god telling moses to warn aaron not to come in the most holy place whenever he felt like it he could only come on this special day once a year lest he die this was not a ceremony to be taken lightly and the people were to understand that atonement for sin was to be done god's way before entering the tabernacle aaron was debated and put on special garments then sacrificed a bull for the sin offering for himself and his family first all right me and my household the blood of bull was to be sprinkled on the ark of the covenant then aaron was to bring two goats now here we come we're going to read what brother brown says about this but there's two goats one's a goat this sacrifice and one's called a what scapegoat all right the other goat was used as a scapegoat but whatever its blood was sprinkled on the ark of the covenant the other goat was used as a scapegoat aaron placed his hands on his head confessed over it the rebellion and wickedness of the israelites what about all that aaron was transferring that to the animal as a covering though not to do away from because you know what he's going to do next year he's got to go back in and do the same thing all right but christ does not have to get back on the cross he's done he's finished he doesn't have to do that we've just got to look in our day of atonement and look back and see what he'd done for us aaron placed his hands on the head confessed over it the rebellion and wickedness of the israelites and sent the goat out with an appointed man who released it into the wilderness the goat carried on itself all the sins of the people which were forgiven for another year the symbolic significance of the ritual particularly the christians is seen first in the washing and cleansing of the high priest the man who released the goat and the man who took the sacrifice animals outside the camp to burn the carcass because remember jesus was crucified where outside the camp all right israelite washing ceremonies were required often throughout the old testament and symbolize the need for mankind to be cleansed of sin just like you and i we have sins that we have daily sins as christians we ask god to wash us not by natural water but by spiritual water washing of the water of the word but it wasn't until jesus came to make the once for all sacrifice that the need for cleansing ceremonies ceased the blood of bulls and goats could only atone for sins if the ritual was continually done year after year while christ's sacrifice was sufficient for all the sins of all who would ever ever believe in him when his sacrifice was made he declared it is finished he sat down on the right hand of god and no further sacrifice was ever needed the sufficiency and completeness of the sacrifice of christ is also seen in the two goats the blood of the first goat was sprinkled on the ark ritually appeasing the wrath of god for another year now what did the second goat do they had to have a second goat because christ just christ died and took away all the sins of the world right but there has to be a daily atonement still even us remember brother brown says the world is covered in the blood of jesus christ and god can hear us through the blood even as christians right the second goat removed the sins of the people into the wilderness well they were forgotten that person whoever led that goat into the wilderness had to take it so far away that he couldn't make his way back what a job the second goat removed the sins of the people into the wilderness where they were forgotten and no longer clung to the people sin is both you know what about an israelite in that day you had no way to clean yourself you could wash in water or tons of water if you were an adult or you were still an adulterer you could wash yourself in holy water whatever you want to do but me as a person as a devout israelite i'm standing there at the door of the temple when that guy leaves that goat leads the goat out with the blood all over him and as he's leading him out if i'm a devout christian or israelite of the day what a day of atonement knowing that my sin whatever it was in symbolics now this is just in symbolics what about now with the blood of jesus christ taken away and eradicating sin but i'm standing there you know talk about a joyous time because i'm believing my high priest has done his job inside that holy of holies and that blood that's on that goat there had to be a goat dye to put that blood on that goat and then that man and you just keep seed until he just he disappears over the horizon there goes my sin i don't have to deal with that that sin no more but what about god though because there could be a chance that that goat might find his way back into the into the congregation but not with jesus christ he said as far as the east east to west there is no pole from east to west as far as the east is from west he said i'm not just covered your sin out there in the horizon there's a sea there's a sea of forgetfulness that that thing will never never amen in no way will it ever be brought up against you again amen what that man did for us but look at the symbolics that we can see now the israelites depended on this you and i don't depend on this written word we depend on what christ has already done for us and we don't have to go through this ritual once a year we don't have to what if we just had church service once a year that's kind of what they did they had this big thing one time a year and the priest would go behind the veil and he would do all the things he would come out and he said your sins are forgiven. well man they just went off and you know the whole year they did something else went through these rituals that's why god finally said they're stinking my nostril your holy days you've all just made it a bunch of feasts you've made it just um something to you have to do not something you want to do he said but i'm coming i'm coming i'll write all this and i'll make this will be a type but everything you're doing i'm going to take it all away sin is both perpetuated and expediated god's way only by the sacrifice of christ on the cross perpetuation is the act of appeasing the wrath of god while expiation is the act of atoning for sin removing it from the sinner both together are achieved eternally by christ when he sacrificed himself on the cross he appeased god's wrath against sin taking that wrath upon himself what that scapegoat he put that sin on top of him now there's many people if you'll read some of the commentaries they they talk about that second goat being the devil there's no way that i put that he's going to do away with my sin no but have christ be that second goat that that goes off and puts it in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be when he sacrificed himself on the cross he appeased god's wrath against sin taking that wrath upon himself since we have now been justified by his blood how much more shall we be saved from god's wrath through him romans 5 9 the removal of sin by the second goat was a living parable of the promise that god would remove our transgressions from us as far as the east is from west that he would remember them no more and jews still today celebrate the day of atonement which falls on different days each year september and october traditionally observing this holiday they have a 20 they take a 25-hour period they take a 24-hour day and add an extra day extra hour just to make sure intense prayer jews also often spend most of the day in synagogue services now let's go to leviticus 25 8 real quick 11 30. and thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee seven times seven years and the space of the seven sabbaths of the years shall be under the forty and nine years now we've been over this time and time again this disconnects in with daniel 70 weeks and it connects him with the year of jubilee which listen the year of jubilee has never been established in israel but this is what they were supposed to do then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubilee to sound own the tenth day of the seventh month which is the day of atonement there's supposed to be a trumpet blow in the day of atonement and shall you make the trumpet sound throughout all your land they just didn't do that they didn't have a they didn't have a 50th year what was happening is on that 49th year on the 10th day of the 7th month which is the beginning of their year civil year this is the this is the jubilee year you're going free they never did that because that jubilee trumpet sound everything went free all debt was cleared everything went back to zero and as i've told you many times before even in many commentators they'll tell you that it was never ever ever the year of jubilee was never established in israel because a jew ain't gonna give his money up and if you owed you 50 i don't care if it's 49 years you're going to pay my 50 i'm talking about natural but spiritually see we the jubilee has sounded for us we're not in a 49 anymore because the 49ers seven seven seven sevens that's time you and i are in the jubilee year we've heard that trumpet sound that's right on the day of atonement and make it sound throughout what all your land listen i'm proclaiming today i'm free when you got the baptism of the holy ghost you became the freest person on the face of the earth because let me tell you something you can talk about slavery and all that stuff you and i everyone are slave we are all in bondage unless we're in christ every person i don't care who it is you are enslaved you were i was all of you were you were enslaved by the devil but you heard a trumpet sound amen on that day of atonement you said thank you god listen how many of you really believe that god can do that how many of you really believe that god can take every sin you ever committed put it on that scapegoat and not just send it out there in the desert but push him off over in the sea of god's forgiveness never to be remembered again he can't remember what you did but you got to believe that that's right because the devil don't he shows up he shows back up and says yeah you did it here's where you did it here's the day you did it and you probably still got pictures around the house where you had on your shorts and your long hair it's a lie i don't care if you got physical pictures it's a lie devil that ain't me no more that's what you did to me but when i accept what god did for me brother brown said god took a picture of you before the foundation of the world that's the picture i'm depending on listen you can forget you can put on ten tons of stuff to make your hair look different have all kind of facelifts we still old but in god's eyes we never got past that 18 years old because i believe when my soul was redeemed and i received the baptism of the holy ghost that turned me back to a young man now that thing inside of me is 18 years old it's not fit 60. it's 18 years old because i'm born in the image of him not in the image of my mom and daddy that came because of sin but it came to fulfill the glory of god because there's no redemption if we weren't didn't come that way there's no redemption if we came already eternal we came lost we came dead joke says all that i do not took a breath he realized that i was born in sin david said shaping an iniquity man had 500 wives he ought to know what he's talking about boarding sin shaping and iniquity spouse in my mother's womb a liar doomed and on my way to hell not in hell on my way to hell but something happened there was an exodus day there was a day that god said you're getting ready to leave egypt that's right the passover lamb was killed for you 2 000 years ago all you got to do is accept it all you got to do is is come to my feast of unleavened bread where you getting out the line and the bad temper and all the come on people you say i got born again i know i'm born again because i don't have a temper anymore i don't mean nothing i don't mean nothing why is that temperance up there for that's right that's why i'm telling you one more time and i'm going to shout this again sanctification is a good place to be but it's the worst place to stay you understand what i'm saying it's a good place to be worse place to stay because then the devil come back with his other seven amps and they'll say oh you beli you press play don't you you read quotes yeah but you live like the devil remember your life is ten times more loud than your trumpet day of atonement to realize truly realize that god almighty in human flesh died for you you can't get over that brother brown said you can't forget calvary if you're a christian there's no way you can forget calvary we can talk about seals and plagues and vials and all these different things but if you forget calvary then you're done to me the seven seals turns me to calvary shows me what that man did what he redeemed and how he did it what we're doing here and where we're going amen you love the lord all right let's read all right we're finished with that let's go to romans five this is the only time in in the book in the new testament but it's referring back to the old testament says much more then being now justified by his blood we shall be saved from wrath through him for if when we were enemies we were reconciled to god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life many people know jesus died on a cross a drunk can tell you that you believe jesus is the savior of the world a prostitute can tell you that that's why brother brown says it says talks about some people can't get christ off the cross oh he died for me two thousand years ago and they see him hanging up there i like the empty one i like these empty ones even the two thieves because they went somewhere but i believe that that thing's empty the same way as the tomb the tomb is empty for if we when we were enemies we were reconciled by god by the death of his son much more being reconciled we shall be saved by his life and not only so but we also joy in god through our lord jesus christ by whom we now have now received the atonement one time not every year but you and i as a christian should be in a perpetual atonement every day should be an atonement for us to realize what god did for us so let's read a couple of quotes let's go to making away 1956. then we'll get to the part on daniel 70 weeks make it away we find out on the day of atonement god in time foreshadowing what he would do in the antitype when he came which was christ the high priest would was commanded to take two goats little goats take them in for atonement an offering and a bullock for his own family and many of you read us here in studies of the bible know now just how that the atonement was but then one goat there had to be a lot cast a lot fell on one goat it died then the blood of this goat was placed upon the other goat with the hands of the high priest confessing the sins of the people upon the living goat and then a man who was worthy couldn't be just somebody that walks out there about halfway out in the field and goes shugo no got to take it far away a man who was worthy taken the living goat under his arm and went way out into the wilderness where the goat would have to perish and go into an isolated out of the way place never no more in that state to come back into the family of his own again but to be isolated forever bearing the sins of the people away now i know many scholars perhaps are sitting here and especially adventists they say that one goat was christ and the other was the devil now brethren i have to differ a little bit on that we can't sacrifice to the devil okay pre-plane that one sentence proves it all but watch both goats represented christ both of them was christ christ is or he bled for our sins and he bore them himself away devil can't bear my sins christ is our sin bearer get it straight then your faith won't move christ is our sin bearer and the sins of the world christ was the dying animal on the cross the lamb slain from the foundation of the world now let's get into this real quick because i want to i want to bring the chart back up when we get finished with this because this is this is now let's switch gears you and i this is in the six-fold purpose of gabriel's visit now what's the six-fold purpose is god is going to take this six-fold purpose and redeem who israel not us israel everybody got that say amen just a few more minutes a six-fold purpose and this is in zechariah i wanted i was going to read zechariah and i come across this quote i'm going to let the prophet read it to you and let him explain what's going on oh we got to stop here just a minute now look we've left the earth because remember the daniel seven of weeks is not to the to the gentiles just to the jews right everybody got that say ma'am okay all right 70 weeks of daniel and to finish the 70 weeks of daniel there's got to be a six-fold purpose because daniel 70 weeks is not to redeem us it's to redeem the jews that's right everybody got that pretty simple we're gone we're already gone we're already in the glory we've already heard our gospel trumpet six dimensions already come here we've all had a body change according to thessalonians and corinthians and we have went into another dimension away from this world because this world is fixing to get plagued they've got the sixth seal coming up they got the two prophets they got the seven trumpets the vials all these different plagues i'm telling you again thank god the revelation that you and i don't have to go through that because most christian world out there believes we've got to go through those no we're out of here now the foolish virgin the sinner and part of the jews they got to go through it why for cleansing you and i have already been listen they're they're they're pulling their goat back everybody understand what i'm saying see they we don't we got a free goat that just goes to the sea of god forgetfulness and all they're doing is yeah they're fishing in the wrong sea right thank you brother boy they're fishing in the sea of god's forgetfulness that's what rumors and all are but they're wanting to pull him back and go through a tribulation period no please let it go our trumpet gives us 100 deliverance amen oh we got to stop here just a minute let's start over to zechariah the 12th chapter turn with me now to the book of zechariah the 12th chapter of zechariah maybe i'm taking a little too much time starting to preach on this but i hope not i want you to get it so bad zechariah let's get the 12th chapter of zechariah and see what it's going to say now when we stand before his brethren when he stands before his brethren now this is the scene is we've left the two witnesses and i'm going to tell you a little story about that and it's really exciting brother claude told me about it last night and i finally found it the two witnesses are over there and they have declared that their messiah had already been killed and it's not come he's not coming he's already died all right so now now he's speaking here of the remnant the siege of jerusalem the beasts and the armies is took away and so forth all things are become to the end now this is almost to the millennium fixing to start the millennium right now all right remember the six fold purpose is redeeming israel and redeeming the city so you got three end of sin reconciliation for iniquity and then bringing everlasting righteousness seal up to vision and prophecy north the most holy boy sometimes i get them all mixed up but thank god we're right here toward the end he's getting ready to what and i will pour upon this is the scripture and i will pour upon the house of david which is who jerusalem and upon the habitation of jerusalem the spirit of what grace amen amazing grace upon the house inhabitants of jerusalem daniel's holy city remember is to restore the people and the city pay attention watch the spirit of grace and the supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced now jesus is not standing there but they hear the voice as the sound of a trumpet like john did they didn't turn to see a bride they turned to see christ they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one what afflict their soul on the day of atonement as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is bitterness for his firstborn listen what a morning they'll be not not early morning but mourn what a morning there will be when he stands there making himself known to them like joseph did what the two prophets through the two prophets and in that day shall there be such great morning in jerusalem as the morning of hadadorima in armageddon and in the land shall be mourning every family apart what i just say the day of atone the natural day of atonement you afflict your soul you separate yourself from your wife you separate from your children you separate from your job you separate from your eating all right and then the land shall be mourning every family apart the family of the house of david departed and their wives apart and the family of the house of nathan department their family is a part of the house of levi their wives and families apart and simeon and theirs apart all the families that remain every family and their wives apart they'll be so ashamed of their self when they stand there and see that that very one that they crucified in the night standing there their own precious joseph there'll be such a mourning they'll say where did you get those scars those two prophets are going to preach so real jesus christ just like you realize christ died for you you didn't see the scars but you realize they're there okay you didn't physically see jesus but through the preaching of the gospel christ became so real to us that we accepted him in our heart we accepted what he did at calvary he said where in the house of my friends see what i mean to make an end of sin of unbelief that's what he's coming for now i didn't understand this until brother claude made this clear to me now go back to the to the chart please just for a second we'll be done musicians get ready to come okay we're right here you and i have took a rapture we're gone but the two witnesses come back and they preach what christ remember i said christ fulfilled all these right but they missed it the jews don't believe any of this happened right the nominal jew the orthodox jew they're looking for their messiah they're looking for their messiah to come we've already seen it we've been raptured so take us out of the picture but two prophets come on the scene and literally on this day of atonement listen to what happens you've got the da you got the sounding of trumpets and then that day is silent all but one time once in the morning and once in the evening there's two special silver trumpets made out of the same material sound in the morning and sound in the evening two prophets to israel two special silver trumpets the two witnesses sound on that day of atonement and it tells them what happened and they go all the way back and said where did you get those cars he said in the house of my friends this is where they crucified jesus christ right here the two trumpets two trumpets literally the shofar is sounded shorter there's a shofar sound shorter and two special silver trumpets announce the sacrifice oh hallelujah about about throwing my phone out in the yard when claude was we were talking about that but there's god you there's nothing said about trumpets in the bible but if you read uh look up shofar s-h-o-f-a-r and you'll get this very quote right here when the trumpet sound the signal all the people who were within the sacrifice prostrate themself stretching out flat face down on the ground where did you get those scars and he'll say in the house of my friends and they're gonna mourn and weep and say we just like when they told joseph they said oh we remember joseph's brothers all said oh man he's still alive we we thought we killed him remember they throwed him in the pit joseph in the pit joseph said oh don't worry it was done to preserve life you two witnesses come on the scene right here to tell israel not that christ has got to come and die again but on that day of atonement those two silver trumpets for three and a half years they're going to stand there morning and evening and they're going to declare the day of atonement and then what's going to happen with 144 000 they're going next right god's going to give them the baptism of the holy ghost and then they're going to exit the building just like we did but two trumpets why two why two special trumpets that are silver not gold because we're gold silver trumpets made out of the same material moses and elijah because they preach the same message oh thank god magicians come day of atonement if you're a christian you've been through the day of atonement if you haven't you sure need to try it sometime have a fast fast for a few days fast for a day fast for three days do without something that you normally wouldn't do without and see and do it for the lord don't do it for everybody around don't sound the trumpet jesus said he said don't sound your trumpet and say i'm better than that guy over there i give 20 tithes remember jesus told him he said you worse off than that woman that gave all right so let's don't sound our own trumpet we're not here sounding if i sound my own trumpet you don't listen to it but if god sounds that trumpet and it gives a certain sound we know what's coming we know how to fight we know the battle is going this way charge in this direction we are going to win this battle let's stand our feet we're going to win this thing i promise you it's spoken in the word of god our sins listen our sins not what's going to keep us here they're done away with it's our unbelief of right here because if you're born again in your soul you can't sin but we sin in our body and we sin in our spirit let's sing song flowing
