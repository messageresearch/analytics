Lord to get off of it the great physician takes care of us and I was so glad that I was able to get rid of that so praise the Lord every every battle and I know there's other ones that are battling it I think brother Isaac and different ones fighting that thing hey you know what I got I I feel like I feel like brother Bram when you know he saw Sharon rose that man in Jus and those crossed eyes and you know he never he never backed down from that every time you saw a a child had crossed eyes you know he went back to seeing Sharon Rose in that condition and you know they said never a child come across platform across eyes they didn't come across whale God delivered every one of them and you know he had to go through that for some reason and it and it brings us to the place that we need to be and I thank God for I don't I don't like battles I don't like scars but you look back over them and you thank God for them amen everything you've been through you don't you don't thank God too much when you're going through them but you look back over all your life and you see things and you think God for what what you've been brought through what you've been delivered from and uh um when brother I want give a little short testimony and I don't want to keep you standing for too long but I just want to give a quick testimony when brother Andrew Glover was here and brother Wade and I we prayed over a prayer cloth for a young man that I'm that I work with and he's going through his second round of rehab he's he's had he's had a rough life there's a lot of a lot of things that's went on but he's trying to get right with God he's trying to get straight in his life he's got two little girls he's trying to he's trying to live a better life for them and he was in he was in this rehab facility and it's a 12-month program that that he was going through and he went through about four months of it and you know he's already been through through one rehab this is his second time this has been a number of years ago and now he's in this other and at the end of last year there was a lot of stuff that went on and he was telling me about some of it I was just like I don't understand it and he was he was very worried about it he very concerned about it and I told all we can do is pray about it and put it in God's hands so we got a prayer cloth and I give it to him and he had to go because he got kicked out of this second program he got he had to go see probation and all that and judges could have and the judge could have revoked his rehab and all of that seen him to jail and I was like well we don't know but you know we're going to pray over it and trust God and we don't know why things happened but they happened for a reason and so he was very concerned but he was really appreciative of the prayer cloth and I said so we keep praying for him well he went they give him two weeks a week and a half passed and he got into a new rehab he's in a rehab that he was in the first time so now he's he's already completed 12 12 months in this other one and I was like when one door closes God will open another one but you don't see why it's that way and I said but God wants you to trust him we had a meeting in this other rehab that he's went to he's already been there 12 he's already completed several years ago he completed 12 months he got in this one and he had a meeting and they told him because you done so well the first time you went through this 12-month program and he gets like credits I guess because he went through this first one they say he can complete his second rehab in 6 months and I told him I said see I said you thought because when he got before he got kicked out of the second one they wanted him to do six four more months so he would have been 16 months in that and then they kicked him out well then I said see if You' had original 12 months if you complete the next 6 months with the four that you've already done that's only 10 months so you'll be done instead of having to wait till next year I said by the end of the summer you can be finished on this one so you know it's like that's God working and y'all and y'all continue to pray for him you know he's the one that come to me and and I was like if if I had $5 do you believe I'd give you $5 and he said yes I said well you don't know if I got $5 but you trust me enough that but if I had it I'd give it to you because you take me out my word I said the creator of Heaven and Earth came down and took on the form of Flesh and died in your stead to take away your sins and it's a free gift all you got to do is believe and I said that is the same God that's standing right here in the M between you and I talking right now because you say well I've done too much no listen there as long as you're drawing bread and you believe what the Bible says there is nothing going to stop you to receive the Forgiveness of God he will cleanse you he will forgive you you got to have faith in what God Said right amen and see the devil wants you to stop believing what he said am he's going to put everything in in your way to stop you amen but I I I believe it just just as much as the ground I'm standing on and you know it's so simple we got to because it's like you can't worry about what went on in the past you got to realize this inexhaustible Fountain will take away all of that amen and if you believe he said he put it in his SE of forgetfulness never to be remembered anymore amen so y'all just continue to remember him and uh he's he's still got his daily struggles look like we all do but i' start I've starting to really see a change in he's trying to read the Bible and he's uh he's like he said there's a lot of things I don't understand so I give him the uh I give him the uh the children's version sometimes so we talk about people in the Bible and I just I just break it down and I tell him like a children's story and I just give him people's names and he's like oh I ain't never read that before and I was like well sometimes it's easier if you just go find a kids book that tells the story and gives you everybody's name and tells you the highlights and you catch some of those things while you're trying to read in the Bible I said I don't know if they ever made cliff notes for the Bible but if they did you could cut the synopsis of some of this to help you with some of the stories but I mean it's really but you just keep praying and keep pressing on and and the Lord will bring you through amen well let's just uh speak to the author before we read Exodus uh chapter 13 I appreciate you your patience with me this evening but uh let's just all bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you this night Lord for to gather in Lord that we're able to put away the things of the world for the short period of Time Lord just come look unto you for all that we have need of Lord and we thank you for your many blessings on us Lord Lord we just pray that you just come tonight help us get out of the way Lord be in one mind and one Accord Lord just speak to our hearts and our lives Lord Jesus from from your word bless each one that's here Lord each hand that's been raised every desire on each heart those that couldn't be with us tonight Lord wherever they are Lord there's many sick and Afflicted we just pray pray that you just continue to hold them up and Lord we're just so thankful Lord that you're with us always and you just show us that you're there and you care about us even even in the Small Things L we just thank you for all things we just Commit This service into your hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen Exodus 13 and we're going to begin at Verse 18 and it says but God led the people about through the way of the Wilderness of the Red Sea and the children of Israel went up went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt and Moses took the bones of Joseph with him for he had straightly sworn the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and ye shall carry up my bones away hence with you and they took their Journey from suth and encamped in ethm in the edge of the Wilderness and the Lord went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud to lead them the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them life to go by day and night he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people amen and we go to Ephesians chapter 6 and beginning at verse 10 I think I think actually I think I might have said 11 but if that's all right we'll just we'll just read 11 yeah verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord in the power of His might and it says put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take unto you the whole armor of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand stand therefore having your loins G about with truth and having on the breast plate of righteousness and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace above all taking the shield of Faith where wherewith you shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God Amen God bless you you may be seated tonight I want to take this little thought tonight on a mighty Army of God and here in if in Exodus we go back Exodus chapter 13 here and it's speaking of the children of Israel coming out of out of Egypt and the the scripture says uh one thing I I've always when I read this uh something always kind of stands out to me uh where it says they came out harnessed they came up harnessed out of the Wilderness and you know if you go back and look at the word harnessed it actually means to be equipped for battle they actually had on their armor they were actually armored to go into battle when they came out of Egypt now other translations if you look at other translations it'll actually say they came out in battle formation they because they were ready to battle when they came out of Egypt to March out but if we go back and look at verse 17 of of chapter 13 it it says and it came to pass when pharaoh had let the people go that God LED them not through the way of the land of the Philistines although that was near for God said lest pre Adventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt now we we see here that when God is bringing them out and you see that the children of Israel all the things that you know they had been through and all the things that they had seen and God had done all the Miracles and you know they were in bondage all these years and they they saw the things that took place and you know when when you see these things that they're coming out with and the scripture says that they brought the bones of Joseph out of Egypt with them now here they are Liv seeing the bones of the man that that God used went in a time of famine to bring and preserve life when he stood there and told his Brethren he said y'all sold me and and treated me bad and all this for evil but God done this p preserve life and here they are and and all the things that God had done for them and all the things that took had taken place in Egypt all this had had happened and here they are to see all the things that they had been through and you know all they could see is the you know all these 400 years of bondage and and all of the task Masters and all the Death and All the destruction and all those type things but here God came and told him in a time when he sent Moses to him and he told him he said I'm going to bring you out Now's the Time to come out I I made this promise I made the promise to your father Abraham that you will come out you'll Ser you'll sojourn in a Strange Land but you're coming out because there's a promised land that you're coming into and I'm going to fulfill my word and here they are sitting in the land to see those things and here they are going out and after after they've already seen the the water turned to blood they'd already seen all of the the the fleas the lice the frogs all those different different things that they had seen all the destruction that had taken place all the brimstone all those things all the destruction that they had seen all the see live through the darkness the death of the firstborn all the things that they had seen all the all the things that God had brought them through telling them ahead of time what was going to take place and they come out through that and here they are God set them up there told him listen you're going to come out you got to have you got to be prepared you got to eat the the lamb eat the UN liveing bread get prepared because you know what you're going out and here they are God brought them out and they were ready for battle God had set them in order because Now's the Time because when you go into this land this land of promise you're going to have to fight but you know what he had let them all he had showed them all these great things that was going to take place here they here they are they're they're going to have all these testimonies in front of them but God knew after they had all seen all of that now we can't take the short way we got to go take the long way around because if they see War if if if the Philistines look like they're going to raise up you know what they're not going to be in they're going to be disheartened because of what's going to take place and not and not be encouraged by all the things that they had seen all the things that that God had done to them and seen brought them through up to this point they're not going to see that as an encouragement they're not going to see the power of God in their life they're not going to see what God can do for them here they are they're going to they're going to go through all of this and you know here they are standing there and you're you're going out through this and and here's the here's the pillar of cloud leading them during the day a pillar of fire at night and it's like you know what there's nobody else in the world that had that nobody was under that nobody else had the Covenant that they did but you know what they did not have have the faith to believe when as as a song with all these Mir all the uh with all these many miracles why don't you think it's possible amen after all the many things that you have seen amen I'm sorry what something about you know why don't you believe when all the things he's done for us yes I mean after all these things that you've seen don't you think it's possible don't you believe that God can do these things and here they are they're they're set in order but the problem is is they don't have faith that God's going to lead them through and here and here we are as as here in in the book of Ephesians here's the Apostle Paul writing to us and telling us to put on this whole armor of God that you may be able to stand just like they were they were armored and prepared and in battle formation coming out and so he he's telling us the same thing to put on this whole armor of God that you may be be able to withstand the attack of the enemy here you are you are prepared for battle but will you be like the children of Israel when they've seen all these things and not be not be prepared and not stand up and not realize what God has done for you or will you just stand there and it's like well I I we can't go this way because here here they are and and in the reading of the scripture here when it talks about in Ephesians it says to put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to withand to be able to stand against the Ws of the devil and in verse 14 it says stand there for having your loins G about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness now if you go back and look up to put on or to have on means to have something laid upon you to have something that is that is covering you that that is laid upon you it also means like brother Wade is being said has said the last couple of services I believe is in Luke 24 it says he when Jesus is speaking to the to the disciples he says behold I send you the promise of my father upon you but tear you in the city of Jerusalem until you be endued with power from on high so he was saying the word endued is also to put on or to be have on is the same word to be endued which not just means in the physical we say it's to put on something but in the spiritual it's actually to have something inside of you so you actually have this inside of you it is an indwelling of the spirit so you are in because of the of the birth and you of the placing of you in the the C Body of Christ you have this armor yeah and so you have put on so put these things on and realize listen I've got the helmet of salvation I got this breastplate and I've got the sword of the spirit I've got a shield of Faith so when I have these things in I don't have to back up that's right I'm prepared for battle amen now see when when the children of Israel when when Moses was bringing the children out you know he had them going on the land because they were on their way to the promised land there was a they were on this journey leading them to the place that they had just heard about here they are going to a place that they had just heard about but you know what it was real and it's like well you know it's some you know in the site by and by we'll get there but you know what I believe in the in in moses' mind I believe Moses saw the land by faith when he began to walk I don't believe it was just some idea but I he actually really believed and began to walk in that but there was PE you know people that just had as an idea wasn't a it wasn't something that actually was something that was actually concrete to them it was not something firm to them he's like well we're just holding you know but you know what you have to actually see that see that as and so brother BR says he he's leading us today in the spiritual just like he was leading them in the natural he said in the same Pillar of Fire that led the children of Israel here here he is leading us the same one the same Pillar of Fire leading us on the supernatural light of God moving on leading the church spiritually so the same thing the same situation that they were in back there we are in the same situation today and he's leading us and he's made this promise to us that we are going to the Land There is a land that's been promised to us and you know we have realizing we have entered into if you're an overcomer then you have come through the the Egypt you've come into the land of the Wilderness and overcoming but you know when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost you have come into that Promised Land you have come into the land of the Overcomer you are an overcomer but you know what you've got to fight in that land you've got to claim everything that belongs to you there is a place for you to reach and it belongs to you and the only thing that's stopping you is you it's the only thing that's stopping me is me see the Pillar of Fire brother said the same angel of God the logos that went out led the children of Israel through the Wilderness he said it's the same one that would came apart in the day of on the day of Pentecost that split up and went into the Believers that same that had the 120 had the same one amen but instead of him leading over us and leading in front of them the Holy Spirit was actually inside them to lead them here they are being led by that same Spirit see if we have that same spirit that was that came down on the day of Pentecost the same one that let that showed them all those Miracles showed the children of Israel all those Miracles and the same thing in the early church and the the days of the Apostles the Miracles that were done was done by the holy spirit amen leading them through to do those things he said it should put us today he said we ought to be one heart one mind and one Accord because you know what if the same spirit that was back there it should have the same experience it should have the same effect today that it did back then that we should have the same thing see as brother R said we live we live below our privileges am see see we understand that we're all one body we're all one Army we're all equipped to fight together it's our battle you know there's no there no there's no you know uh no man on an island and if and if you think you're if you think you're going to be like Rambo I'm sorry that's not the way it works it's all of us have to work together because we're a body we're a unit you know brother brand talked I believe it uh restoration of the brid tree there brother brand was talking about those men and he said they were going through this training and he said they were he was listening to the radio and they were talking about those men climbing under barbwire live machine gun fire going over their head heads he said they're they're sing there with their pockets full of sand and all of that kind of training that they were going through he said because there's rigid training that they've got to go through he said he said he said we are here tonight go this is rigid training for us he said because the battle's out there but we all have to go through this training because God wants to bring us through because you know now is the time that we get to the place where that you find out what you're made of what you've got and what you don't have see brother Bram says here in the message thirsting for life he said see but in principle he said we ought to stand one Great Mighty Army of God marching on and that's where I got my title from one Mighty Great Mighty Army of God marching on because each one of you in your peculiarity God has proved that he's ignoring your Doctrine because he give you the Holy Ghost and the Bible said he gave them the holy ghost that obeyed him he said now if I obeyed him in my peculiar way and you obeyed him in your peculiar way he give us both the Holy Ghost we ought to be Christian Brethren and sister enough to put to arm up together and March on for one great purpose the gospel so you know I mean everybody is is their own person but you know there's a time you've got to get past your and you know everybody's going to be different everybody's going to have their peculiarities but you know what all of us have to be one in Christ you know when when you when you go into to the military and you know some of the like Brother Don and different ones you know when you go in and the first thing they want you to do is they want to separate your individuality because you know what it's not about you anymore it's about the whole group it's all about everybody together you know because brother brandom said living the Christian Life is living for others it's not about living for ourselves because you know what everything that we say and do ought to be pleasing to the Lord but it ought to be edifying to the body of Christ and we ought to hold our tongues and watch the things that we say to make sure that it's not offensive to anybody and so you know those things because you know I don't want because like brother brandham said you know one one little misdeed one little thing that happens you know we can cause a problem in the church we can cause somebody not to get their healing and those different things as you know we've heard brother brandom say you know all those things you know we can cause an issue to come up just by not watching what we say you know there's many times people say things and they and they you know they they don't mean anything by what they're saying but the problem is is when when you go to speak sometimes the problem is is before they speak they ought to pray and and say Lord you know watch my what help me keep my mouth because the problem is that sometimes they're not paying attention to what they're saying not not they're trying to be offensive not or anything like that but sometimes their brain's not engaged when their mouth is and I'm and I'm guilty you the same thing but I mean you know sometimes but you know you say things and as soon as comes out of your mouth and you realize you know what I shouldn't have said that but see here we are fighting this this greatest battle and you know the the devil's going to try to hinder you in every sit every little way every little problem that you see all these things are going to come up and it's going to have have an effect on you you know it's just like when brother Brandon was uh speaking about the squirrels you know he was telling them about how he was he killed the squirrels and you know he knew that they were going to be here and the Lord spoke to him and he said you know I want one here and there and he come to the one he couldn't find and he was out there trying to find that one squirrel and brother I believe it was brother Donovan was praying he said Lord if brother brandham told the truth let him find that squirrel and brother bram's like they don't believe me do they not believe me he stand there and he you know he almost gets a complex because of what was said well brother Donovan didn't realize what said in the prayer because he was hoping brother Brandon would find the squirrel and then he went back later and he said well I didn't I didn't remember saying that but it was something that was said to see how brother brandham would act react to it and so you know when when things are said but you know you have to realize you know sometimes you just got to have U Love covers a multitude of sins and sometimes you just got to overlook those things and and not realize you know hey your brother says things and you just got to overlook them and pray for them and not take offense to it sometimes although it can be tough but see we're in this great battle brother BR says and the greatest battle ever fought he said the greatest battle ever fought he said she's going on right in here now yes sir between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt he said oh my between Liberty and bondage the battle is on Shine Your spe soldiers polish up the armor God is getting his soldiers ready amen God anoints his army see we we got to get into into this into the battle in this Army and brother say he said so in an Army first in getting ready for a battle first there's got to be a select some soldiers they've got to be dressed for fighting they've got to be trained for fighting and he said I believe that the greatest battle that was ever fought is now ready to go into action I believe that God has been selecting his soldiers I believe he's been dressing them training them and said now the Battlefront is now set so now is now is the battle and you know here's here's the battle and we realize that you know some of us have been in the way for a while and some of us may not have been in it that long but you know it's the same battle and you all got to join in and you all got to take your place and and and start in in that battle and you know many times when people say you know well what what is what is this battle about you know and understanding that you know it it's not as much um I always said it's not like it's not like Matt Dylan stepping out into the street and facing the man down or you know Gary Cooper in High Noon you know going out to face him by all alone you know but it's the simple things you know the Bible says the foxes spoil the vine it's the simple things in life that that you see that that that's the battle you know many times in in in battle and um you look back especially I always think about Vietnam and you know the the the men that fought there and you you go through well there was a lot of things that were hidden you know in in Guerilla Warfare there's a lot of things that were hidden they didn't see what was going on lots of times they were surrounded by enemy they didn't see them they had all these traps set up nobody saw them and so they always had to be on guard because here's here's all these things and that's the way the devil is he's sneaky it's not it's not where you know like the Revolutionary War was where you come across the battle or the or the Civil War where you see all of your enemy right out in front of you and they just line up and you know you just start shooting and you start running toward the enemy lots of times it's gorilla Warfare you don't see what's coming and so when when you see this see it's it's it's very sneaky but you always have to be on guard amen right see brother BR says here and in the message he's talking about in his life story you know he was talking about you know he never got to fight in the Army but he said he said he he he found the Army to get into and he said he said but dear Christian friends he said I'd rather in the army of the Lord than any place that I know of that's right cuz I know that some someday we're going to a land where there ceaseless ages we'll live there forever and he said but if I'm not man enough to be out in the Army to fight with the Armed Forces then God give me a job here to fight the powers of the enemy and he said I am a soldier after all one in the ranks with you dressed with your type uniform and your brother in the service amen and so you know when when you don't have these things but he said I'd rather be in this one he said because he didn't get to pick he didn't get to pick to be in in that but that Army but God put him in the army that he wanted him to be in and he prepared him and he said see we're speaking of these armored men going into battle he's got to prepare himself he said no and no Nation would prepare to send a man on the battlefield and trained he might not only get himself killed but another group he doesn't know how to take hold so he must be prepared for it and he said and the nations are wise to that they got to get their men ready ready for battle and so you know that's what God wants us to do is to get ready for this battle and realizing that this battle is for us and you know the and you you look at the one of the first places that I that I think of when when you think of of this you know not not this not this well-trained Army and you know like like we see you know like these Special Forces kind of these men you know all this kind of great technology and all these great weapons and everything but you know it's it's these men that that have this great desire to fight you know it's it's it's not just the the Great Men of these great Heroes but every man that has taken up the oath to fight then they're a hero every man that has taken the oath to defend what he believes in in the natural when a when a man takes the oath a woman takes that oath to stand there and defend the Constitution and protect this country then you know what they're Heroes because they go and wherever they're at and they nobody may never know their name nobody may know what they've done but you know what everything that they do because every por every part is essential amen every part every everything that they do is essential and that's the reason I I give my respect to our Armed Forces because they fight whatever they do and they say well I didn't do this and I didn't do that but you know what you answered the call and whatever it is if if you just had to scrub toilets or if you peeled potatoes or what whatever else you know if you never never flew a a military plane and never never grade any stars on your on your collar it doesn't matter because it's about being answering the call that's right and it's the same way with us it's not any big eyes or little use but it's being faithful to the call that God has called us to amen whatever portion God calls you to that is your job he's not going to ask you if you done this or if you done that did you preach the gospel did you do this were you musician all these things he's going to ask you in the end were you Faithful the answer will be well done my good and faithful servant that is the that is what we're looking for as a child of God are you going to be faithful to the call that God give you and you know the one person I think of in the scripture that that answered that in in that situation where you look at somebody that wasn't well trained we don't we don't see anything in the scripture of this person ever having military training not having anything but you know what God called him to do a job and that was Abraham and God called him and he had a journey and God told him that his hand was upon him and you know what when when he left his father's house and he said separate from all all your Kindred and go into a place that I lead you I'm going to take you to a place and he said and you the Earth is going to be blessed blessed those who bless you will be blessed those who curse you will be cursed and here he is he's leading he's leading Abraham out but you know what he came along and he brought lot with him and like I always said when you when you leave out the the problem is is people bring a lot of stuff when they come with God they bring a lot of things that they shouldn't bring with them they keep because God's trying to separate you from unbelief and all of the baggage and a lot of things but we still want to hold on to a lot of things that we shouldn't hold on to because he's trying to free you from that but Abraham went left with lot well he got to a place that God had to separate and get rid of him because you know and here he was he allowed lot to choose which way he wanted to go and he said I going to go the other way and he allowed him to go and he chose because he was a man and you know that that just by his own eyesight not seeing the the the danger not seeing the sin and all the other problems that lay ahead he didn't see any of that all he saw was the well-watered Plains and how wonderful it looked and you know he went that way but you know when he got in trouble here here's Abraham we don't see him ever being a great Soldier not being a strat just any of those things we don't see but you know what God had called him and he left there with 318 men to go get lot and he took on Five Armies amen he took on Five Armies and he one and brother Brenham types that with Christ and he also types that with us he types he types that that spirit is the type of Christ and the spirit of Christ in us to go after our brother if your brother Falls well you know what that was his choice he look at the messy in well you know what you ain't got to go over there and throw dirt on him right because he said he said if you don't have the the love of God in your heart to go after your brother he said you need to be in the if we don't have that if we don't have that desire to go after them no matter and you say well you know look at the great odds that Abraham had you know what Abraham was not looking at the odds he was looking at the promise he was looking at what God had promised him and here he is going and when when he fought this great battle that that had impossible odds he brought back the spool and he brought back lot he got what he what he went for and in the process when he came back he melt mesic in the way and had communion and brother talk about this in the last day when we get done with this great battle we're in this great battle right now then you know what we're going to meet the king and we have communion amen we're going to have we're going to have this overcoming rejoicing time see we have to have that same Spirit of Christ yeah go after our brother amen see fight and he said you know you got to no matter where he's going or how bad it gets you know you don't give up on him brother BR was talking about you know he said they I believe he said he pursued him all the way to Dan you know they just kept going and going and going he like we we're going to win this battle no matter how far we got to go we're not giving up it's like well you what I've got wward L ones well we're not giving up we got way we children but we're not giving up we've got you got sicknesses in the in the in your family and and problems and and financial problems and whatever but we're not giving up we're going to pursue this thing we're going to pursue it all the way to the end it's like well I've been in this battle for 20 years well I'm going keep fighting I'm not giving up why because you never know when the battle is going to be that the last battle is going to be you know sometimes people get right to the end and not realize Now's the Time to Victory to have the final Victory to overcome this and then give up when you get so close and then you say well I've reached the end I just don't I just don't no you don't see the end but I see Jesus he's leading me to continue to fight yes sir all the way because you say I I'm I'm going because this what God promised me where do I have to go all the way where it looks good bad or indifferent I'm still fighting I'm not giving up I'm still pursuing see we got to keep fighting and and hold on and and you see when you in this battle everybody everybody's in in their battles that you're fighting just like he was he was there and he had those 38 318 men with him that was fighting but you know Abraham never gave up he kept fighting he had he had that one thing that he was going to do and he was going to overcome amen and in the scripture in in Hebrews 10 10:23 it says let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promise he said let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to Good Works see we're all we're all in a battle and brother brand said to provoke means to encourage encourage one another un love and good works he said if you see a brother in the church that's got something against another brother don't say something to stir that thing up but say something that'll bring them together see when you see the battle going on then the thing is is you've got to get into the place where you can get into battle and be an encouragement right you've got you've got to find the place and and lots of times like well I don't know what to do well the one thing you got to do is pray amen you need to pray like when I was preaching at I was preaching at brother Luke's and I told him I said lots of times the problem with with churches is when when things come up and people ask you know why why is this going on and why is that going on and like why don't the preacher the pastor do this and the pastor do that lots of times you don't know what the pastor knows and you don't know what he knows and you don't know what God's told him and lots of times like I said it's above your pay grade God ain't talking to you he's talking to the pastor but the problem is and instead of people questioning what was going on ask them how many times have you got down on your knees and you prayed about the situation before you start questioning it that's right that's your job we've got we've got word from the prophet to tell us to pray for the pastor well if you want the church to grow how many times have you prayed for the pastor how how many times have you prayed for the five-fold ministry amen and then people wonder why things don't happen well you know what God didn't ask you to because if he wants to give you the answer he'll give you the answer but you know what lots of times we're not in the position to get the answer the pastor gets the answer and you know what I I've got I've got all the confidence in the world that God speaks to brother wait and he's going to do whatever God tells him to do and you know what he's my pastor and you know what I give him respects and honor and you know what and then I'm going to say I'm right behind you until the Lord tells me something different then you know what I'm going to be right there there and I'm going to say that's that's because you know what if God don't tell me nothing then you know what my job is to trust that man because I believe I'm following him as he's following Christ but I believe I got the Holy Spirit if he gets off then you know he can speak to me to tell me about it but if we get in if we get in our place then you know what it progresses the body of Christ advances but the problem is is if we get out if we get to on Shaky Ground then you know what nothing happens right see that's how you become an encouragement to somebody say listen I appreciate you I'm I'm encouraging I want you to keep going amen see don't don't give up see he said if you you know he said if you don't feel like bringing them together it's time that you got in the altar that's right there's something happened in your life there is something you've been deceived in you haven't got the experience that God wants you to have so you've got to come to this place and realize this is the spirit of Christ and the spirit of Christ is going to bring us in unity amen that's that's because you know what you're going to separate from unbelief and we're all going to come together the spirit of God brings us together as one am because you can't say well I I you know I don't I don't need you I don't I don't need you I don't need you I and no every every person is important if you're if you're a son or a daughter of God everybody's important everybody has a part to play and lots of times like well I I don't know what I'm supposed to do read your Bible and pray be a light you know one of the greatest testimonies a person can have is a person that's not blown around with all winds of Doctrine and have ups and downs and have all kinds of problems but you know what somebody that that can battle the storms can weather the storms and you know they they don't have they don't have to be a preacher they don't have to be an evangelist they don't have to be a song leader they don't have to be a deacon but you know there's somebody that can come and you see you see people and they're ups and they're downs and you know what they still press on and it's like Wonder I mean that's the one thing I I love about my grandmother you know that Grandma gray you know you look back all the things losing her husband when she was little trying to you know she was like early 40s losing her husband trying to raise kids all those things you know all the battles that she went through but you know what she wasn't blown around when when churches split and people come up with crazy doctrines and everything like that you know what she just kept going why because she was anchored into something that you know what all the things that she had to go through now I know she had problems and and things but you know what you see somebody that's on the Rock they're not moved around they're not blown about you know they're they're not up one down you up one day down the next you know they're solid as a rock and that's the kind that's the kind of testimony that I want amen have that kind and it's like you know you don't you don't have to be where people know your name nobody knows you've never been around the world you but you're the people that God puts in your path amen right those are the people that you've got to be the light to that you've got to be an encouragement to and say that's that's a Life of Christ right there he said see live the life and let Christ live in you that makes people hunger and thirst to be like you he said you become salty you become salty he'll get thirsty and the only way that you can be salty is Let The Life of Christ be in you for he is that he said salt only saves as it contacts so we have to be in contact with these and see what God wants us to do and realize this is what God has called us to do amen when you see people go through so many storms and problems in their life and you know what they still just keep on going amen and that's a that's a real testimony amen you know so I'm I'm not going keep you long tonight but I I just got a couple more things I want to look at tonight and and and this is the other thing that I when you when you look at an army and you and you and you look at this great battle that we're in we're all having to fight together brother brand this is this is from Christ the mystery and I want to read this I I love this and I know we've all read it many times and some of us can probably quote it but I still want to read it tonight I just love it because brother BR says love one another he says above everything love one another he said don't no matter what the devil tries to say he said now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way he said no sir he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sit him down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of poison stuff and he'll start through the church with it he said but don't take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with it with anything else he said you stay right loving and sweet and be kind to one another pray for that man and he'll be saved or that woman whoever it is and just pray for them and stick one with another and he says and pray pray with your pastor see he's the shepherd and you give him respects and he'll lead you through because he's ordained of God to do so he said he said the enemy will come and when he does just cling that much closer together and that one that the the devil is using for an enemy will either get out or come in and be one of you that's right and he says don't ever Clan among yourselves or talk or make yourself clannish we are one he said I couldn't say left hand I'm mad at you I'm going to take you away because you're not my right hand he's my left hand I want him to stay right there even the little tip of my finger I want to stay right there every little part of my body stay right there and God wants us as a body of Believers to stay right exactly with one another right with one another and he said you've got tapes on that we've got tapes on what we believe he said we got tapes on discipline in the church and how to behave and he said we got to come here together how we come we got to come here together and sit in Heavenly places he said don't stay home he said if God is in your heart you can't hardly wait for them doors to open out yonder to get in here to fellowship with your brothers he said if you don't feel you don't feel that way I tell you it's time you got to pray it he said cuz we're in the last days and he said we got to assemble ourselves together have Christian love just skipping some of this trying not to read all of it he says if a brother you think is a little wrong or a sister say Lord don't let me never have a root of bitterness spring up because it'll affect him it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't do that he said just wax that much closer together he said draw up take the Buckle as the brother testified a minister here the other night about having a buckle see seeing it in a vision just the buckles on the whole armor of God the buckles on the whole arm of God said just pull her on tighten up move right up close to one another love one another anyhow talk nice about one another say nice things about one another he said then God Will Bless you that's what God wants to do I I love that sometimes sometimes I read that and I get hard to keep from crying sometimes because if you don't see that I I want people to see that I want I want that to be exuded from my life that people can see that amen I I know I talk to people at work and sometimes and people say you know I just I just love talking to you because you're always positive I I I know people some come up to you and talk to you and it's say I love you because you know what you're an encouragement well you know what there's there's so much negative in the world and then you can be a positive influence on somebody you can be the encouragement you can provoke them to good works that's what God wants us to do you know brother R was talking about you know AA Allen and you know and the things that AA Allen you know the things that he believed in different things and you know and people tried to put him down and he's like you know AA Allen may not be right but he said I I want to support him I want to help him he's trying to win souls to Christ he said I want to be right beside him he said at the Judgment bar he said I want to stand there next to him and so and my uh place would be beside him showing he's trying to win souls for Christ and that's where I want to be because there was there's nothing to be gained by trying to tear him down I mean he might have talked to brother Allan when was off by himself and told Brother Allan I don't agree with what you believe but you know what he wasn't trying to get in the pull pit to run him down and trying to and trying to hinder what he could do for the for the cause of Christ you know it's just like you know there's so many that you know where they like well I don't I don't agree with you on this and I don't agree with you on that he's like well you know brother BR said you can draw me out I'll just draw my circle bigger I got a Bigg old Circle I can just keep drawing as much as I want to like people say sometimes I want you to know I love you and there ain't nothing you can do about it why because that's my choice he said he said you know if they smack you on one Jesus said if they smack you on one side just let them smack the other side if they want you coat give them your cloak too you know it's just like in the in the in the in the in the seals you know when when the when the red horse rider went out with the sword to take peace from the earth and you know and it was it was so amazing that the that the the combat Beast was the ox and you know that's a sacrificial animal and you know one thing it said he came to take peace from the Earth but you know what he couldn't take their lives you know what always amazed me they they trying to take something from them but they gladly walked into that because they were anointed to do that because that was their testimony because they knew I've got a moment of time that I'm going to have to suffer but you know I'm getting ready to enter in to the glories of the Lord and here they are was like well I've got to suffer for a little bit but you know what they were they could see beyond this veil of that they were going to have to go through the next thing you know they're walking into something that's marvelous that other people couldn't see and so you can't take away something because if something because if you're giving it they can't take it away from you see that's the way it is it's because God is is so freely giving and and that's that should be us also see just take these things and and see what God has given us here here God is calling us to do these things and you know uh we we see our lives sometimes and and I I want to I want to finish here in a minute but you know I think about that that sister there and and I I believe it was in uh Mississippi you know that she goes and uh sees the the lady holding the baby and and and you know brother Brown brother Brown tells the story that you know the Lord tells this woman said you need to go pray for that baby and she sees the lady's got a prayer card and brother Brandon's going to pray for that baby but you know God told her to pray for that baby and and you know she couldn't get away she wanted to try to work some deal or whatever but you know the Lord never let her leave that that burden stayed with her said you got to go pray for that baby amen I said that's that's what you got to do and you know she was so burden she finally went and asked that sister said you know c c can I pray for your baby said the Lord's just not going just not going to let me rest until I and said sure sister you pray and she prayed over that baby and then you know she's like well she saw that lady get in you know she went sit in the balcony said here she is she sees brother brother Brandon come to the platform get ready for service the lady gets in the prayer line say oh wonderful this brother bram's going to pray for the for the child not realizing that's right that when brother brandham comes under the anointing and he begins to discern that it's like Oh Sister your baby's already healed and the sister that's sitting up there in the balcony earlier prayed for your baby and that's when God healed amen she's been healed all this time am because she obeyed the spirit of God because she obeyed what God told her to do and many times you know some of the worst times that I've ever had in my life is not and and sometimes it's simple things and but you you you it's like follow the leading of the Lord he said whatever you do brother R said whatever you do if the Lord leads you to do something then that's what you have to do he says he said the compassion of that mother for that baby went far went far beyond what I had done for it I've had done for it see so the gift of healing if God ever speaks to your heart to go pray for somebody you do what God tells you to do see always follow the Holy Spirit and you know I I I've told this story before but I I still brother Harold hilderbrand came years ago and came preached he preached the whole week in Ruth North Carolina and I think brother Dan was alive back then he came and preached that Sunday morning and preached to services that son and his voice was shocked he was so he was so and when he got done he come sit on the front row beside me right there and the Holy Spirit was all over me that morning I sat right there and the Lord kept telling me to lay my hands on him and I never did and I was like well you know I you know I just didn't want to be I was like you know it's like well this is brother hildbrand and you know it's like you know you you don't want to get out of out of your place or anything like that but you know the second service brother hbr come out and his his voice was even worse and I I I just could have fell in the floor and it's was like you know what because I look at myself so low it's like why would you tell me to do that why didn't you get brother dad why didn't you get brother w why you get somebody else because he wanted to know if I'd do that just like this young this sister go pray for that baby God told her to do it it wasn't brother brandom's job it was her job to do it he come up here and I was like you know what I felt so bad that that I didn't do what God wanted me to do but you know I made a I made a promise promise that day if God tells me to do something I'm going to do it and people ask me why you do certain things you know because he said check it by the word if it's not if it's not wrong then do it because you know what you may be the one that God wants to use to bless somebody and so well you know uh you know no we we want to we want want to try to make ourselves so humble but you know what not following God's word doesn't make you humble I looked at myself so little but the problem was if I was humble enough then I should have followed What God wanted me to do that's humility to do what God wants you to do it's no big eyes or little yous but it's all of us working together see if you will believe what God tells us to do then you'll just do it and trust God see and I want I want to finish on I love this this probably one of my favorite quotes I I there's many quotes in the in the message I love but I always love this one this is from Wess he says now you that got strength enough to yield a sword if you believe the word of God then you take the sword the sword of the word he said and now you that God understanding enough in God's word to claim it to be your own personal property who can pick up the word of God now in your hand and hold it in the hand of faith and say I take my side with the Lord I'll be Oneness with God from this hor I'll yield this sword of the spirit in this word and I'll cut every I'll cut the devil to every promise that God promised me he said if you believe that with all your heart I ask you then sincerely with all your heart now listen to this in the name of Jesus Christ stand to your feet and accept it so if you believe what I just read that the prophet read if you believe that I want you to stand to your feet and accept it he said Do you believe it are you sincere is the is the word of God in your hand is your hand your faith he said raise your physical hand to God and say God by this by my uplifted hand I pledge all my life I pledge my soul I pledge my thinking I pledge everything to the word of God let the Holy Spirit take my faith now and give me the thing amen he said cut every doubt away from me and by faith I receive the promise that I asked for this moment amen thank you and you know what not only just pray don't pray of your your own self but pray for every believer in this building for your brothers and sisters your family members next to you the ones that are not here raise your hand and believe for them too yes he said if you believe it say Amen thank you he says congregation says amen say Amen if you believe with all your heart in the name of Jesus Christ I promise you what you've asked for amen amen God bless you let's all bow our heads the musicians can come let's just all bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you for this evening Lord Jesus
