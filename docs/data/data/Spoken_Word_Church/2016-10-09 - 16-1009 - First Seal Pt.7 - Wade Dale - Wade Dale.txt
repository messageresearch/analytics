========================================

oh look at that okay all right driver bit okay all right we're headed in the right direction now okay now we've been talking on the first seal for now weeks um we want to take the first deal and I want to go back up over helloo hello hello on the first seal we have um come to conclusion and I I want you to really see this cuz you're going to have to see it for yourself I thought this this week I thought well we'll cut it off here and then go on but let's back up just one more day and one more Sunday and come look at cuz you're going to have to you going have to dig this out for yourself because even when brother Brandon preached it and then brother Dale preached in 82 even those tapes listen you got to get your own it can't be contrary but you got to have your own Revel you got to be able to see cuz I can tell you that the first seal shows one true and living God but you got to see that you got to see how that that writer is a different person than God and he's not holy he's Unholy you got see that there's not any Holiness about him but there's a lot of religion about him yes he's religious I I don't want anyone to ever tell me I'm religious right amen right the devil's the this the most religious person besides the Lord Jesus Christ That Ever Walked on the face of the Earth or in heaven or in any other dimension so that's what we have to deal with is that man that guy that fellow like brother R was talking about in the first seal and um and I don't believe we can see the Antichrist until we see Jesus Christ we must see let me place that again we can't see what his tactics are and what he's doing until we see the real listen you take a picture of something you get a negative right off that negative you get a picture but there's got to be a positive of you a real that's why I was talking about um um reflection or an image in a in a a mirror okay but man has been you can see now I see more than ever how that Satan has come so close you know brother said U man has got into God's laboratory right see we can have a virgin birth now that's right but we can't have a virgin birth without an egg from some you understand what I'm saying right but you can't take an egg in a and and a sperm we I we just saw that not too long ago when this daughter couldn't have a child and her actually her mother had her own grandbaby right now whatever situation you want to say that's their business but to me that's a little bit messed up yeah but you can do it why can you do it because what happened in the garden then you come down to what happened to Mary but Mary was not received a a germ and then an egg came down right God created both and put see man can't create they got to go get an egg somewhere they got to go get a sperm or a germ somewhere and put them together but they can surely put them in a virgin and have a birth right same way with now with photoshopping you can take an image and you can distort it you can make it look good you can make it look bad so what God has never took an image of himself and had to redo it that's right amen he's never have to take an image and redo it that's right we were made in His image in the beginning right amen right but we had to come this way because of what happened with Adam and Eve we had to come in this thing right to keep me together down here keep my spirit and my and my soul intact that's right but for God to work out through this you know I was thinking the other day the only one time that Paul talks about you know I pray that I think it's in Timothy I pray that your whole body that your Soul spirit and body be what found blameless he put the body in there he put the body in there okay he added the body because I'm telling you again and and listen don't get so that's what I say about quoters quoters say well brother R said sins in your flesh your flesh cannot sin it has no motivating factor to sin on its own right right your body only does what the firing mechanism on the inside tells it to do that's right that's right okay that's right I was thinking yesterday at the at the festival we saw many many children that were deformed and and um um you know it's just genetics man has just jumped into God's laboratory so much that's why God wants to keep everything pure he wants to keep the line pure he want to keep those levitical priest keep that line that lineage because when you cross two together you're going to get a recessive gene are you going to get I'm I'm sorry going this way but we got to go to this to get back to the seal because that recessive gene in the mother or father like brother R said now how and I thank God I talked to brother George Quinn yesterday was talking about brother Marlo passing away and well by email I didn't talk to him but we were talking by email and it's just great how God give us a prophet that could go in the mind of God and tell us exactly what God not what man not what man's come up with that's right but what literally is over on that other side that's right mhm people they don't eat because they don't have flesh bodies but they have a theophany body and they're waiting and and that's where they're all at and and then a prophet to tell us how that that uh he prayed for a little girl with epilepsy and he said oh that come from the grandfather three generations ago oh my how' you how' you do that God had to take him back and then remember the U the time where the Indians he went out to that reservation and they had lost all their records about who was who what was what and then brother Billy Paul said brother R sat down at the table brought each person and told them who their mother was who their father was who their grandparents were well who was that that wasn't William brandom that was almighty God that's right showing the genetic line to the prophet and he could tell them whose family they were in like same thing you say well boy that's amazing no it's not it's God that's right there 144,000 over there in Israel right now I believe they're all alive okay right coming to adulthood are already adult that they don't know where they come from but God knows where every one of them and I believe them two prophets will sit down just like brother brandham did cuz remember it's a spirit off of this right Spirit off of this Prophet brother brandham going over and taking the fifth coming of Elijah yeah so that same spirit's going to sit down and say hey you're levite you're Benjamin you're and just deser for 3 and 1/2 years they got to kind of tell them where they're at right cuz remember a Jew holds a lot to that for that lineage okay and that lineage will be 144,000 they won't be one over and one less so there's got to be a generation same way with this talking about this first seal there's got to be something we see in this seal that takes your genealogy and puts it in God and the other genealogy is the one riding away the one that's messed up the one that's perverted the one that's see what I'm saying then like you take now with with all the things that can do with television they can put you in a place you had never been before and you've never been there before you know so uh Satan has worked so close and and you can see it in in the things that uh that science comes up with Hey listen cell phones um wireless internet was back in the garden God spoke to Adam that's right yes but now he literally spoke to Adam you know what God had to come down and speak to Moses now remember surely they taught lift ear but not like Adam and God did before the fall no no no man cannot do that anymore until we come back in a glorified body there's no way God can talk like he did with Adam before the fall I believe he walked right down into that I believe there wasn't any Dimensions except the one they were living in that's right and God would just walk up and talk to Adam just like just like me and him talk together but now Moses and God never talked together in that form I don't believe cuz he said I'll not be able to strive with man anymore in other words I can't flesh to flesh I can't meet but I got to come in human flesh in Jesus Christ that's why he had to be our brother then he could talk to us see that's to me that's very simple Adam see God sure absolutely he saw God I believe he did Brother R said he come down the cool of the day talked to Adam and Eve walked in the garden with him walked in the garden with him sure he did Where Art Thou Adam H he said Where Art Thou Adam yeah sure Hey listen whatever happened before the fall that's what we're going back to so don't tell me we're going to go to heaven and not see God inum flesh correct in human flesh he didn't have human flesh in that's why you can believe that if you want but anyway you believe that if you want to but he had a lot of substance about him when he killed those lambs and tore skins off of so I'm not either way I'm not saying that is a subject to bring up talk about but a got we got to talk about rer today yes but I believe God and Adam were that close before the fall he come down he said it was a family brother BR said God come down as a father and talk to Adam and Eve so I believe he tal yeah I believe Adam literally saw God knew who he was but now when sin happen happened God had to withdraw himself and make Dimensions so that there was a buffer there cuz listen God we say oh God's God he can do anything he wants to no he can't God can only go by what he's already said that's right and he I don't believe he ever met a man until Jesus came on Earth he never met a man like he did Adam you know talking met a man now sure mzc but what was that that was a borrowed body remember what brother rown said he just picked up 16 elements and put it over the form of that man mzd right so that wasn't the body of God but now Jesus Christ was the body of God that's right okay that was the body of God right man saw and even Peter said we held him right boy I mean that's CL we held him well see what is he doing it's bringing Adam and Eve back together I mean Adam and God back together again yes and who's coming with him Eve he's got Eve's got to come with him to come back into uh full restoration cuz he's not going to restore Adam and EV the second Eve us right we've got to come up with him we' got to come up with that second Adam so and that's what you see in the seals you can take this first seal tie the entire Bible together with it and not go to another one cuz it shows one true and living God but watch right here now look but Satan hides himself like I said before he he can you know he can change forms he can he can do all these different things he can make himself this the other but he can't create anything yeah I take something that's already created and pervert it all right so watch here what brother Bown says I want you to read this right here this is in the first seal the that white horse rider has been in the land all the time so he just didn't get on the horse in 1963 and start riding right now as soon as Christ came on the scene Judas came on the same the Antichrist but it was in the form of what a saying we'll get into that just that's what I want to come back to because to me it explains how God goes through justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost the devil goes through the same three stages cuz he goes devil Spirit we'll talk about a minute but you got to start something little God has to start with you little baby form justification forgive me of my sins Lord I am a sinner right and he's just to forgive every person in the world that ask that question but what problem is is people in the that are taught in the other uh Realms of religion is is that that's it right like the Baptist you know once saved always saved I got that you know I was I was I was saved in when I was 9 years old but I done whatever I wanted to up to this point no they've not been taught right that yes that God did forgive them of their sins but they continued as a sinner because God never entered in and resided in that man or woman to make them a born again Christian but like I said thank God for William Bram to bring us a a message to show us the whole thing yes cuz to me don't ever forget this message this message brought one God to the world like it had never been brought before even with the apostles because they never understood the son of man because you got to bring the son of man in to one God that's right he was God wasn't he right okay so you got to bring son of man in which the which the apostles sure they looked at Jesus Christ they thought they they I don't say they thought they knew he was God but they really didn't understand the whole way that God wanted to manifest himself which was an adopted son what brother Dale's teaching now we come up to a place to where sure they had Authority they had Authority Under the face of the fathers right but they never come to a change of a body or even the ability to because of even Paul and I I didn't find that scripture this morning but I find it next Sunday my legs getting num got what Daddy give me that that hereditary yes ain't never happened before boo devil get out of here Shake It Off yeah shake it off but we come to a place we see that that Paul even says Grievous wolves will come among you now we stop there but if you'll keep reading that scripture says and are already here yeah so that's what this is the white horse rider has been in the land all all the time he will change from Antichrist he does that and becomes to a false prophet see he first started an antichrist the spirit then he became a false prophet that later when the devil's cast out he is Incarnate then with with the devil three stages first he the devil begin with SP of the devil then he becomes a false prophet teacher of a false Doctrine next thing he comes as the very Devil Himself in carnate same thing with Christ Christ comes down through the Old Testament shows itself all the way down through the Old Testament as the Christ as the anointed one not as a person you understand not not in them they couldn't truly see him as a person but then when he come on the earth what he was the prophet not a false prophet the prophet that's right amen all right it was the spirit of God let's just look now this we're not talking about this but look starting as the Antichrist the spirit God started his Spirit come down through the Old Testament as a spirit okay right sure he would reveal himself in different forms but he was always of us right couldn't go into this into the interior of man and make that man totally totally whole no sin in his soul at all right but he come Christ comes as a spirit so guess who's coming right with him Satan's coming right with him as a spirit that's right that's right a little saying a little this a little that then he become the false prophet well Jesus Christ became the prophet right yeah God in human flesh right right then look then he become the false prophet teach false Dr next thing he comes as the very Devil Himself incarnate now he said oh where you going with that well that's us that's us that's not us but the positive of that is us we are the very God himself incarnate that's what brother Ram said whether you believe it or not he said the son of man will be here and be incarnate God God can't be here in one man in flesh like he was back then until what the Millennium because of the sin curse and all the things that's going to happen but you and I have to be incarnate God to get out of here that's right that's right that's right so he's going to as soon as we become incarnate God and we take a Rapture okay Satan's going to become incarnate Devil in a man called a pope and he will be the devil made manifest in another form called a pope you can say what you want do false prophet Pope incarnate false prophet we'll get into that look and at the same time that this devil falls out of heaven and becomes incarnate in a man the Holy Spirit goes up and comes down in incarnate man oh my what a time you understand that he falls he falls out of heaven and becomes incarnate here what's what the Holy Ghost is going up but he's coming down and incarnate man the Holy Ghost had come back on the day of Pentecost right they were incarnate God they just didn't know all that they needed to know to take them to a body change but we will know somebody will know that they're not God himself we're God himself made manifest in another form called Bri yes not a second person that's why I've always you you go to the you go to Genesis and you think God created something and that's another something read Oneness with God God said true Oneness is God Adam and Eve standing in the garden even before the fall he said when you look at them you see three but when God looks at it he sees one that really helped me understand true Oneness um reading that Oneness with God and it really helped me a lot when when that Doctrine came out about the Jesus not being God to the River Jordan because it there's several quotes in there that really knocks that down but as God has already wrote out if listen if Satan was in the land God was already here right he already prepared a church in the first three Church ages he prepared a church to withstand that Antichrist Spirit at the beginning that's right but it wasn't strong enough now his spirit is but Spirit filtered through man we got to bring man's got to come in here that's right somewhere okay and there's another quote in the second seal where brother said God decided to use man okay so and we look like we're messing up and we say man we ain't even able to hardly be good Christians on the Earth but God chose us to finish this thing that's right right he he chose us to start it Adam and he chose us to finish him that's right amen so here we are I mean this is the way it's going to happen it's not going to happen any other way that's right right this is what it's going to happen we have got to see God is going to reveal one God to somebody so much to where he they don't say my father's someone else they say I my father one when Jesus said that he wasn't lying that's that's true he was telling the truth that's right and there was somebody preached it not too long ago one of the brothers that came in that that I really enjoy CU always said it brother D always said it I my father one if you start saying that what is that that's true Oneness that's right you said no I see too remember God is when God said let us make man our own image he made millions of his children all the bride was created if you want to say are revealed right there why I love that scripture Genesis 126 everybody that's a child of God from the from um 120 in the upper room all the way to the last one that comes in that's that Genesis 126 man not somebody else not Moses not Elijah hello somebody not the 144,000 no his children his bride we're the only people that are created in His image to look just like him and not be the devil's children right amen now Moses Elijah all them will be as an impartation of eternal life by the faith that they had that's right right that's right but they're not ever called the children of God Abraham being the greatest one of all that I believe because he was the father of our faith right God called him a friend Bible calls him a friend of God he was a son of God true everybody's a Son of God by birth see that's why you got to have to be careful have to be careful everybody's a Son of God by birth that's right but when Genesis 1 when he spoke at Genesis 126 man it was a multiple form all of his bride all of the ones that ever was going to receive the new birth in their soul was created right then not created as far as not having cuz remember if we're created we got to have an end okay that's why this has got to be changed but our soul never had a beginning right that's right and never had an end we were in the mind of God he thought of all of us but when he said let us make man in our image there you are you know what he done he wrote it according to the word and he wrote the word according to that okay those where you come from well I say word I'm pointing to brother BR message but you understand what I mean the Bible yes we come from the word of God what brother Dale was trying to get us see you know Wednesday night we are we are we develop from the word of God we're always we've always and I agree with them we always were Eternal in that part that's right yes right but that word had to come down here that's right because even in the Oneness with God and I asked a brother a question he never answered me brother Bram says that the apostles acted the way they acted because God wasn't in them yet now boy that kind of knocks up and and you know what would be so if if they got the 120 in the upper room but if you got he even the disciples he breathed on and said receive ye the Holy Ghost now he's God Almighty in human flesh why didn't they just Why didn't that seed just come to life right then they had to go to the upper room and or they had to hear a word that's right to Quicken what they had held they took the word and held it okay then you put the Holy Ghost on that word okay that's what brings it to life okay so that way I agree God created all of us way before the foundation of the world that's right but you got to come here and develop that that's right you got to come here and develop you got to accept it God knew you would okay so he already put it in the Bible cuz all of us all of us became Born Again by a certain scripture not just you say well I well I have one favorite one but you reading through the Bible and or preacher preaches well what's he he already be preaching what's in the Bible that's right right that's right what quickened that you you you were quickened by what he said that's right you were being born by the spoken word word amen like it had should have been had they not been a fall okay amen right that's exactly what would have happened going to fall you just been spoken word but that's beyond the point because that didn't happen because of all the other attributes of God that's right but first he's the devil with he's a spirit Spirit of the devil false prophet of a false Doctrine so what did he do in the first three ages it was the same that's right a saying went out well hey remember what uh brother Bob brought me when we were talking about Jesus not being God sthus back in whose age was it irenius I believe it was irus and Martin somewhere in there somewhere in these first three ages guy named sthus comes out with a doctrine that Jesus was not God until he indwell him in the at the River Jordan same thing they teaching now and irus were somebody run out of the bath house and said if he's in there I don't want to be in there I in other words I don't want to be near that Doctrine right okay yeah we kind of pet it sometimes but they were pretty Stern I mean they them first three ages buddy they cut you off okay so it should be back the same way this way but it became a sa then when he went to NAA in 30 306 then it took 300 more years to what they come to a place to where they crown a pope right 606 I'm going to read it to you if I have I got enough time I got to go hook up brother for cash but uh the next one let me look let's look at it let's see let's read this one anyway right here so we are Mortals we can make mistakes God can't God's first decision is perfect and the way he chooses to do it it can't be no other better way I've told y'all many times there's no other better way if you don't understand the word of God it's cuz you're not born again that's right or you haven't been caught well one of the two that's right but if you stay in the word long enough it's got to Quicken because it's got to be Quicken by itself word quickening word right that's right that's right he can't improve on it because it's perfect to begin with if it isn't he is an infinite if he is infinite then he's omniscient if he's omniscient he's omnipotent amen he's got to be that our wisdom here comes from Satan We inherited it from Eden M really that's when Satan got on his White Horse and started riding false Doctrine in the garden okay correct okay it wasn't that he started in the first church are he started right when God came down talking to Adam and Eve guess what Satan came down and what incarnated a beast okay and started talking to the bride that's right just like he's doing now inherited it from Eden where we swapped off faith for wisdom he did it now he was first called Antichrist the second stage he was called false prophet because that Spirit among the people became incarnate right you remember the white horse rider had no Crown when he started but then he was given a crown what he was a nickan spirit to begin with then he became incarnated in a man then he was crowned and received a throne and when he will serve that for a long time then talking about seal breaking we find out that after a long time Satan was kicked out of heaven and he came down according to the scripture and enthroned himself just think and enthroned himself in a man and become a beast and he had power supreme power like that he done all the Miracles and everything are the killings and bloody fightings that Rome could produce right Jesus died under that punishment Roman punishment yes for the Antichrist absolutely right he's talking about There They Crucified him first as Nick what did the nickan age ask for it asked to get away from them buch of people that shout clap their hands look like disgraceful like they did on Pentecost act like drunk men and I just messed up who I at they said they were drunk then the celebrity listen don't miss this it may sound crazy when God makes when when what makes God big is because he can he's big enough to stoop that right he stoop the Lord and anybody can stoop any human being ever stoop he was the king of Heaven came to lowest City Jericho and got sold till even the shortest man in town had to look down on him talk about that K how about all the family look now let's say take this church here and take a bunch of people like we are if you wasn't real spirit filled and let's take say now nothing against the mayor come Mr barart and talking about the board now you know what this ought to be different what you know what he's doing he's talking about the he's going to tell you in a minute that the bride you're talking about going to NAA that the true church went to NAA and got caught up in that religion what Satan was riding so close he deceived those people and they took see somewhere you had to do that somewhere because remember the first three Church ages never taught a father son Holy Ghost bapti ISM never taught of Trinity never taught hell being Eternal but somewhere in this age right here because when they come out of that Catholic age Martin Luther was teaching father son Holy Ghost baptism right Trinity Doctrine hell being Eternal okay cuz that's all your denominational Foundation coming out of right here what so it had to get into the real church that's right yes it had to that's right so Satan put himself injected itself right into the real church just like he did E told her everything was cool this is fine man everything's good this is God's way of doing it right that's what he told Eve right Thou shalt not surely die and that's what he told him right here same thing right don't don't worry about that them old like you said them old shouting speaking in Tong you know baptizing the name of the Lord Jesus Christ don't worry about them people this is God's program for the day now what happened that was the same thing that happened coming up now here this though is the Pinnacle see that's what shows you even from the first seal to us that first seal that white horse rider continues to ride right he doesn't die off he continues and actually rides on almost to the Millennium right cuz that that Spirit becomes incarnate in in a pop and that pop rules the world when we get out of here he rules this whole place spiritually see naturally the PO runs it now what Pope says that's what everybody does kind of that's right kind of Baptist ain't going to deal with all of it but they'll deal with some of it but not all of it that's why brother R said they'll all come together then see they're going to listen to what that Pope says that's right truly who's going to Crown that pop the denominational world's going going to Crown that poke which is that pale horse rider we're going to get to in several years the pale hor rider that's his all of his mixed Doctrine together and he's going to what and they're going to think everything's fine I was reading I've been reading the small gospels I love those small gospels F second John Timothy first second Timothy first second Thessalonian I go through and read them every once in a while cuz I like them first second Peter you know all the all the little gospels I call and cuz you get a you get a big punch every all the rest of them are kind of a commentary but man when John comes in and said the Antichrist is among you children beware the Antichrist is here you know I mean he's got pump CH cuz he's only got a short time variety you know make the point and um same way with um what the what is it Thessalonians where it says peace peace and then sudden destruction yes that's what's going to happen there's going to be a time of Peace we're going to see a time of peace and then all of a sudden boom but who's going to take over though we see that and we see that in the Christian realm we see that as us getting out of here right but the denominational world will see peace peace sudden destruction and then somebody's going to come on the scene to raise it back up again the Pope's going to come in and say I'll take care of all this and then he's going to spiritually Rule the World Plus physically rule the world CU you can see how physically he's ruling he stand up and say hey don't fight but you still got those denominations that some of them are like we're not going to listen to what he said but when they come to a point where everybody does what that one man says he's got control over the whole world see that's what Satan wants he wants to be just like Jesus Christ CU Jesus Christ is going to rule the world Bible says right so he wants to rule away he wants to do the same thing God does yes but bless his heart he ain't going to do it just put it in simple terms he just ain't going to do it we ain't going to let him God God's not going to let him and you know who's not going to let him do it through us the bride and the two prophets in 144,000 they're going to resist him to the place to where finally he kills them the Bible says finally something's going to happen to let him be able to kill them which I believe is just like see you look at that Spirit you see that Spirit come on Jesus on the river and then for three and a half years he couldn't die nothing could kill him right they tried to many many times they tried to Stone him they tried to back him up against the cliff and he went through the crowd you know he wasn't his time but when he come to Gethsemane the Spirit came off of him well that spirit's got to come back on me and you where we won't die but now remember that spirit's got to lift up and go all the way over to the 144,000 for 3 and 1/2 years kind of strange for 3 and 1/2 years this all happens in 3 and 1/2 year period 3 and 1/2 years they can't be killed don't you think they want to because the the prophet said all they got to do is speak tornadoes of whatever this hurricane they can just bring it right across Israel or or syrians or whatever they want to do they just say destroy that Nation wow you think they going to hate them they going to hate them but don't you think somebody's going to be an assassin and try to kill them in then three and a half years can't do it because the spirit's on them because they have to fulfill the 1260 days that's right then the two prophets are killed in 144,000 so that's right but see where it comes from you come from one God you come from the first seal and you you see this from back from Before Time Satan's trying to do this remember he fought with Michael before all this started and then he got on a white horse he didn't get on a he didn't get on a he wasn't real obvious you know he gets on a white horse and he tries to ride right With God all the way down Through the Ages and that's what's happening now and um and I hope you see that it start and every little thing starts is a saying then it becomes a deed then what it becomes a Doctrine they come out and wrote the doctrine 606 did I see in counsel Jesus is a like substance of God therefore he must be the second person of the Trinity because the Holy Ghost is the third person of the Trinity and then you got a father see what I'm saying but see it started developing down here when that sthus guy when he broke forth and said Jesus wasn't God to the River Jordan he automatically split them in two right but Satan had to have what a triple ground so he had to make Father Son and Holy Ghost that's how everything starts so let's go ahead I going to go hook brother cash up the Lord bless you listen pray for the people in Haiti they were destroyed devastated had hurt anybody any believers they have been hurt bad also Florida and South Carolina Georgia and all up
