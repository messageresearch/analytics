Lord would would bless us because I've enjoyed this part of doing the series on the the seven comound names of Jehovah and I hope you have I hope it's been needful and really enjoyed to brother Matthew there last Wednesday and then brother Reed this weekend and I thought they came in and done a good job of boosting us up and fing on you know and to to see the Lord okay Hebrews 8:1 now the thing now of the things which we have spoken this is the psong we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens now go into Ecclesiastes as I said when Paul is finished they coming down through 7 chapters and then he says that this is the PSM now we come down with Ecclesiastes the preacher as it's called as he's coming through delivering his message unto the children of Israel and he gets down to the 12th chapter and the 13th verse and says let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter now what is the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man you may be seated The Lord At His listening to the reading of the word now we've been talking about the using this basically because there's I I know there's at least 10 or more uh Redemptive names of Jehovah and some are spelled different in different things you know so uh you know keep that in mind if you're studying along on the line but we've been trying to get a point across because I believe that it's been helpful to me anyway to see that uh you know there are seven compound names and each one of those names is related to an attribute from God and being that then it's displaying that attribute and and the point that I've tried to get us to look at to to keep saying over and over that you know God revealed himself to each one of these for the time of where they were all right so you know he he he does that in showing what he is all right and we covered up through the the the six of them we're up now to Jehovah Ray which is r a a h is where they spell it one of them one of them spelled it R o l so it's still you can turn to Psalms 23 if you want to but the main thing I've been trying to get us to see now you can't make one any more value than the other now I I thought maybe somebody would come up with this idea and you know I had already thought about it and you know we we think that we know what we're talking about sometimes and we'll say uh well our brother Dale Jehovah Gyra is the greatest cuz that's the Lord's provided sacrifice well then I figured somebody had come up maybe with a with a quote like you know like a quote from Brother brandham which would be saying you know that uh you uh Divine Healing which is Jehovah RI that that's a that's you know that's not a a front run thing in other words it's it's a secondary thing but you know I was thinking somebody would come up with that and I was waiting but no one has anyway to think on it so maybe you've gotten the point of what I'm trying to make you can't preach him to be Jehovah Gyra right that the Lord's provided sacrifice unless you would preach him to be Jehovah rapi the Lord that Health thee because it would have to be the same you couldn't make one part greater than the other but make it to be what you have need of you know like I said then when he appears to Jehovah Gyra to Abraham he needed a sacrifice all right now he didn't appear to him as Jehovah rapi the Lord had health your diseases because that was not what Abraham was needing remember remember that I kept trying to emphasize God Appears to us as to what we have need of for the time that we're in all right now that will be valuable along about Sunday morning because I made the statement to you that you know and I'll get to it Sunday the Lord willing that uh out of all of these things that we studied we haven't talked about the rapture we haven't put that part in yet because there is a a reason for that now but think of it now if you need him as a savior then he will not be revealing himself to you as a Healer as I said you need him as a Healer he would not reveal himself to to you as a banner or his righteousness he would reveal himself to you for whatever you have need of what whatever it is if you're needing a savior he'll reveal to you that part if you need a Healer he'll reveal to you that that he's a Healer because he's not having to reveal all of them in the same uh point now you'll see what I'm talking about Sunday but he reveals whatever is needed for the time that's the way I believe God reveals himself amen for whatever we have need of that is what he's going to make manifest to you and I you know you're needing him as a savior you wouldn't be saying Lord want you to heal me you're praying for a savior then he would speak to you about that so it's whatever is needful for the time so keep that in your mind now whatever what you have need of is what God is going to be dealing with us about that so we can be right here in the building and he he can be revealing himself tonight and in all of his manifestations right because there's enough people here for him to reveal to individual people that's right what they have need of all right now see that's the kind of God I believe you know I believe he's whatever that we have need of you know we need a savior he's a savior we need a Healer he's a Healer if we need peace in our heart then he's our peace but see it's whatever is needful for the time right so Paul is saying to bring this down to a sum words Su up what I've been saying then here's what it is we have such a great high priest right now in dealing in the high priest realm now I think women a minute on what I'm saying in dealing in the high priest realm the high priest has many many things that is made manifest through the high priest H right all right now now get the point saying see someone comes along and and they need a savior well the high priest will offer a lamb right see because that's what you have need of but if you're sick it may be a turtled of that he would offer right so he has to know what to do so you come up to him and you say you know I I would just like to have the peace of God in my heart he said well all right we'll find out that I told you if you'll go and check these you'll find an offering related to each right there is one called a peace offering righten and see then that offering that high priest would to know what to do so that's what Paul see the point I what I'm getting at Paul says the sum of this we have such a high priest in other words paraphrasing it we have one that knows what we have need of it's not that the scripture that your Lord knows what you have need of before you ever asked so then that's the high priest and we'll get to that l later to bring it back but as I said now watch keep the point see you wouldn't ask for a A Healer if you're not sick you may need something else but God is to each one of us what we have need of what a wonderful God Amen what about a high priest yes a high priest that would keep up and know just what to do cuz this offering here I mean they've got all kind of offerings in the Bible right and you got an offering for this you got an offering for that y uh like a a baby being born they was a special offering then they have had to have like the the little boy when he come to you know 8 days old and circumcising then you have little offerings to take along or something there was something in relationship for what you have need of does everybody understand what I'm trying to get the point whatever we have need of that is what he is amen and see being that then we come down and we we've got to to all of them I said we'd use the the last one which is Jehovah r r a h h r r o HL because they spell it two different ways but it simply means the Lord is Our Shepherd so now let's just go to the to the 23rd psalm and I I gave you this and brother Joe to kind of blow it up and and get it fixed where we can see a little better but see and I've got another paper that uh when I started into this sister Jean Sunday brought a paper that brother Ernie Villa NOA had brought to us I don't know how long ago but it was talking about the seven the 10 10 Redemptive names of Jehovah that's counted in the Psalms 23 and if you'd like that I'd be glad to to get you a copy of it but the reason I said what I did that there are seven compound names because all of it is related into that right point so now let's read Psalms 23 and read it as you know as it would be reading it with the name there in other words all right so look what it says now the Lord is my Jehovah Rea r a h a now don't ask me to pronounce some of these correct because you just get it read spell it but what is it the Lord is my shepherd so that's what that word means Jehovah R means the Lord is my shepherd right all right now watch I shall not Jehovah Gyra I shall not want because he's whatever I have need of He's My Sacrifice he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures in other words he maketh me to lie down in Jehovah Shalom which means he is my peace amen now look what the psalmist David was doing and that's the reason I save this look what the psalmist David was doing to sum up in technically five verses because the LI is a statement about what this will bring to us like surely goodness and mercy shall me that is that's more or less an outward manifestation of what the five verses but look what the psalmist David was saying see he maketh me to lie down in green pasture Jehovah Shalom his peace he leadth me beside the Ste Waters Jehovah Rahab which would be the shepherd He leading you to the to the place amen he restoreth my Soul Jehovah rapi which means a Healer r a p h he leadth me in the paths of righteousness and what is that Jehovah T you cuz he's our righteousness y though I walk to the Valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil why because he's Jehovah Nasha in I SS I which which means our Banner so you don't have to worry about walking through the valley of the Shadow death why because somebody's with you he's not just with you he's raising up a banner okay for thou art with me Jehova shamama which means present or his presence right thy rod and thy St they comfort me Jehovah Rahab which would be right back to your Shepherd amen verse 5 thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies there you go right back to the banner a sign a signant thou anointest my head with o Jehovah RI he's the Healer my cup runthe Gyra amen now you just think about how a man could be led you believe the psalmist David was led in the spirit cuz the Bible said that David said in the spirit so you know the writing of the Psalms is you know not just David crying out of this it's actually God speaking to a man amen and what about taking five verses and covering the full part of the Redemption of man right the Healer the Savior the banner the righteousness the peace the presence all in final verses can we do that do we said no we're just looking for this now somebody sent this along and I thought it was good enough and read it so let's read the 23rd psalm again over in this way the Lord is my shepherd that's relationship I shall not want that's Supply he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures that's rest he leadth me beside the Still Waters that's refreshment he restoreth my soul that's healing he leadth me in the path of righteousness that's guidance for his name's sake that's purpose yay though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death that's testing and will fear no evil that's protection for thou art with me that's faithfulness thy rod and thy staff they comfort me that's discipline now prepare as the table before me in the presence of my enemies that's hope thou anointest my head with oil that's consec consecration you my cup runneth over that's abundance surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life that's blessings and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever that's security that's eternity all within the 23rd psalm that we teach our children to memorize that's wonderful you know you know to get a star in a lot of places you got to be able to quote the 23rd PSAL but do we read it to really get the depth out of it cuz everything David needed was covered in the 23rd psalm right he needed a savior he needed a Healer he needed a banner he needed righteousness he needed peace he needed his presence all the things it might make us think a little bit of difference about and what I done I just went through mine and I marked it down and wrote like where it says the Lord is my shepherd I put Jehovah rayon there you know and then I put the other one to keep up with it but think about how perfect the word of God Amen so you would think you would have to read the entire Bible to find all the Redemptive names to find all the attributes of almighty God that you would have to write a book you know you'd have to have a a great discourse to cover but the psalmist David y could put it all there in just a a few verses amen can we sum up our Christian experience in the 23rd psalm right can we look at it you know to find ourselves can we find our peace in the word of God right amen can we find our Salvation in the word of God can we find a Healer in the word maybe it is because that we don't value all the same and we try to make one thing greater than the other but how can you do that when you're dealing with the revealing of an eternal God the smallest amount of anything that God could reveal to mankind would be more Superior than anything you and I could ever comprehend to be like we talk about a a spoonful of water out of the ocean the only difference is in volume but that's what I've been trying to get us to see is he greater because of being a savior to Abraham would that be greater than to be a a banner you know for who was it that we covered it huh where run off all of them the got to Gideon Gideon what is the difference see it's the point of what God reveals himself to you and I right he may not ever reveal to you that you're healed because we may cut off the channel it keeps him from being able to reveal it to us looking for it in a certain way or a certain thing but does that mean he's not the Healer well brother D he's never done this for me me or done that he's never raised up a banner when I was in trouble and things but you're still alive that's right amen remember I told you about the man there at work one day and he he said talking about something about the Catholics I was and he said how many are there I said well at the time I think there's about 500 million he said you mean there's 500 million of them wrong and you're right I said I didn't say that I said the word's right if I'm with the word then I'm right right he said well if that be that way about doing it why are you sick if you're thinking that much about the word I thought for a minute and didn't want to answer him sarcastically I wanted to answer him in love and I finally looked at him I said well I'm not dead you know I mean I didn't want to be sarcastic I just said I'm not dead and he apologized you know you know for making a sarcastic remark but you understand what I've been trying to get at right now Sunday we're going to bring all of this around into and tie it together to look at the Rapture because as I said all of these Redemptive names here are dealing with where we are life right Abraham didn't need a Rapture right right he needed a savior he needed a sacrifice right you know and God gave him what he had need of but what about the psalmist David coming to a position that God could take five verses and cover all of these things right amen he's a wonderful savior am he's a great God he's a great Eternal in him amen but you see David could see and realize that the Lord was present with him right so he can go back through all the Psalms and remember the things like the time he said you know could remember Me Maybe reading job where job said if I make my bed in hell said you're with me now job wasn't going to hell and that wasn't the point what was the point the point was showing how s how sure are the promises of God that he'll always be with us that it would be possible to cast me into hell that God would be there amen but it's not not possible to be able to do that why because he saved me so that's what job was saying he wouldn't say one of these days I'm going to die and go to hell the Lord you'll be there no no no no he's saying if necessary for it to take place you understand what I'm trying to say all the attributes of God are shown right there in Psalms 23 amen find some other attribute that would not be related to what we just read cuz all the other ones are like Jehovah Manasseh that was when uh the boys were born to Jacob Isaac was it get it right Joseph Joseph two sons and when it comes to Jehovah Manasses he said that was what was written there in the script scures and that's what he titled cuz he named his son Manasses you've heard brother Brown talk about when those babies was were born that even in the birth and the naming of the child that it would literally Place those people he said I can show you that they're exactly where God said that they would be right now I wish he had to put that out where we could see it I remember talking about one time about the the vine that went over the wall he said that was the ones that come to the United States see he could have went through there and told us all the thing but it's not necessary it would just be nice knowing but if God is our savior now here's the point I want to drive to make you make sure you don't miss Mis understand meaning he can be our healer and not be our savior right right he can be your healer and not be your savior so I don't want to be the fact that you think that I would be putting it all in if you get one you get it all I'm not been con considering that I'm saying if you get Christ you got all amen that's right if you get Christ you got all the Redemptive names but you see then he can be something to someone and not be that to another person right but he'll be what you ask him about see then he reveals himself to each one of these in the Old Testament for whatever is needed at the time right okay see then by being what is needed then that would make it manifest in the body of Christ that we would all together as one body we would be making him manifest I mean the man that we were the prayer request that's going to be executed because he taught the Christian to convert the Muslim to Christianity now he he needs a savior right he he don't need a Healer he needs a savior so the desperation for what you have need of are you listening will bring upon the scene would you have need have you ever been to a place that you were just so burdened that you really didn't even understand you know you ever been out way you ever been dis burdened about something see then when you're doing that you need peace that's right you need his presence to come to you yeah but you need peace yes what do we pray for well I really I just I just pray in a lump s yeah that's why we don't get what we're asking for we pray in a lump s well God knows what I need that's true he says he knows what you need before you pray but did he tell you not to pray right no he told you to pray he was the lord of the Harvest and standing there and say pray that the lord of the Harvest would send labor into the field why because he wanted us to have something to do with has he ever been personal to you I mean have you have you ever just like I said have you ever been just burdened about something in and all at once peace just come you ever done that you ever need healing and then just all at once a peace comes upon you and says right I Stripes I'm Healed he's manifesting himself but when we get it to the point that we try to to make is I keep emphasizing make one greater than the other one we're limiting God Amen right I I want to magnify his attributes amen instead of trying to limit them you know brother R says God wants to heal you more than you want to be healed right right now how many of you sick or been sick and wanted to be healed amen see God wanted you heal more than you want to be healed cuz he's not he's he can't get Glory out of a body that's sick he can use things to bring us to a place yeah but he wants us healed amen he wants us delivered but our problem is like that we want peace we want his presence he said I'm with you I'm with you always but yet we pray for him to come to us my brother R said you don't need Faith what' he say he said you already have it so if you got the new birth you've got faith but yet we pray for Faith now that don't mean we don't pray for revelation of God's word come on now don't but get what I'm trying to say he comes for whatever we have need of that's the kind of God that I believe in he's on the scene you ever got into a a discussion Etc maybe with somebody and you can see that they're not you know they're not getting what you're talking about and you you are struggling for trying to find something to say well see that's the worst thing thing to do because they struggling you'll automatically cut yourself off just relax just relax a little the first thing you know it'll come but if you ever notice too that when you leave talking with someone and you start down the street or somewhere and you're walking along you say well I should have said this and brother R said God didn't want you to say that he said because if he had he brought it to your attention what I'm trying to say is why can't we realize folks that God is in command of everything it's not me and you it's him he is our peace he is our joy he's our all in all he's my savior he's my healer he's my banner he's my righteousness and he's a very present help in a time of trouble right amen but when we get in trouble we have a tendency to try to call on God right but how do we try to do it do we try to bargain with it that won't do no good let thing do just stand there what was brother Brown said about Billy Graham when he went overseas he wasn't making fun of him those people challenged him right he said he should have just stood there Yen y I don't believe God would let the man down he said well I don't agree with anywh that's all right you don't do what you want to I'm trying to get a point God wouldn't have let the man down if he just stood there right but I'm kind of like the children the three the three Hebrew children that made a good point by saying what we believe that God's going to deliver us but them the lot nonetheless we're not going to bow down be positive and make the statement and then watch him come on the scene to the statement right have you ever had it to where that you say this is the way it's going to be you ever had that I don't mean a thought or a you know a good thought in your mind of what it ought to be I'm talking about this is the way it's going to be you ever had that to happen well is isn't he trying to get us get us to realize he's personal present je but are you understanding my whole point now this is what I want to get David was capable of summing up in five verses the complete Redemptive plan and presence of all Mighty God and what God would do how he would reveal himself in all in a few verses didn't take him a week didn't have to write 100 chapters he wrote five verses y Brother Gary summed up everything we have need of that's right what the Lord is my shepherd you don't belong to nobody else come on read it for yourself if you ever just what i' invite you let's see what is it Psalms 22 is Psalms 22 if you ever want to read it to find out about the things that happened to Calvary read Psalms 22 where they pierce my hands and my feet and all the different things but if you ever read psalms 21 to really read it let's read that it'll get you to the point of what I'm trying to say let's read psalms 21 let's read it like this and this is literally the way I have it written in my Bible I'll read to you what I got written here he says the king I wrote people so the people shall re shall joy in thy strength oh Lord and thy salvation how greatly we Rejoice now you read it there and you'll see he and all like that but this is the way I got it written because become personal to me verse two thou Hast given us our heart's desire and has not withholden the request of our lips for us CE for thou preventest us with the blessings of the goodness thou set us the crown of pure gold on our head now he's talking about the king the king is he you know he's talking about his own self right David's talking about hisself okay I'm talking about me we asked Life Of Thee and thou gave us gave it us even Length of days forever and ever amen our glory is great in thy salvation honor and Majesty H has thou laid upon us for thou H has made us Most Blessed forever thou H has made us exceeding great with thy countenance for the people trusteth in the Lord and through the mercy of the most high We Shall Not Be Moved thine hand shall find out all thy enemies and that's I left that thy right hand shall find out those that hate thee because that's us Thou shalt make them a fiery oven in the time of thine anger look what he's promising to do and the Lord shall swallow them up in his wrath and the fire shall devire them that's the enemies enemies enemies enemies enemies their fruit the enemy's fruit shallal thou destroy from the earth and their seed from among the children of men y the enemy's seat for thou intended evil against thee for they intended evil against it they imagine the mischievous device which they are not able to perform therefore shalt thou make them turn their back when thou shalt Make Ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them be thou exalted Lord in Thine Own Strength for so we sing and praise not power something happened that day when I wrote that that brought the presence from talking about David and the King until I saw it was me can you read the Bible out way we look through the Bible to find all the things it talks about uh like Psalms 23 my God my God why has thou forsaken me where did that happen on Calvary David So entered the spirit Psalms 22 verse1 read that whole chapter there he so entered the spirit until he was speaking into the first person well why can't we do that like white said I'm reading about Abraham but it ain't Abraham I'm talking about it's me amen this is my Bible this is written about me you must believe that and then when you need help turn in there and read what it is you ever get down and out read psalms and look what a man without the Holy Ghost yeah could be led to say that's why I chose to bring this one this one message of the 23rd psalm amen that in five verses the psalmist David could cover all the Redemptive names of Jehovah God bring it out of where it we can understand and put it there that he's my shepherd I want I'm no problem wanting because he's already provided the sacrifice he maketh me to lie down he bring peace to me he leadth me beside the still wat as a Good Shepherd that's where he he lead he restoreth my soul in other words he Health me I am the Lord that Health all of thy diseases he leadth me in the paths of righteousness Jo this can you he's our righteousness what is he he prepared a table for me in the presence of my enemies he's my banner he's my peace and he's ever present the psalmist David would sit there and cry in the spirit and these wonderful words would be transmitted from his heart because he understood what God was trying to say and you never pay close attention to the writers of the Bible that you're talking about yourself right wouldn't Moses talking about himself wouldn't Joshua talking about himself wouldn't David talking about himself wasn't it written about him the Bible was written about you and I see there's where the Rapture has to tie together because it's only the Redemptive names will deal with this journey of life but something must take place to bring a Rapture right cuz there's no Rapture just because you're saved now you will automatically go in it but you go by the grave right cuz you're healed is not Rapture right even his presence that we just got to speaking about of the second coming of Jesus Christ and being his coming being here and his presence being right here that's still not to Rapture I leave that for you to think about you we could be like David and going through all of these things but David wasn't raptured right he's depending on somebody else so all we used in the Redemptive names were all Old Testament revealings now we've got to enter the New Testament to find a Rapture to be able to go away what do you mean he's my healer he's my savior right but there's Millions down through time that are still waiting on you and I according to Hebrews 11:40 that they without us cannot be made perfect you and I must find our place in the word of God right as to what is to be be revealed in our day not what was revealed to David oh that's part of it yeah come on folks but you got to be something personal to me and you somebody's going to stand right here just like we do with healing and say by Stripes I'm Healed when the manifestation has not come into reality yet right somebody's going to have to stand here and say I'm already raptured well you know what they'll do they get a straight jacket for you even the Believers will right because they won't know what you're talking about but somebody's got to come to a place that they can understand our day and its message but if we don't read the Bible for ourselves about ourselves right then we'll never come to the place to walk off this Earth but if the psalmist David could conclude in five verses the entire Redemptive plan of mankind you know of the things while we're here on Earth why can't we take the entire Bible and come to a place to walk off this Earth maybe it's what I said when I tried to preach from talking about you know that all of these are cannot be separated but we cannot make one of more equal value you than the other cuz when we do we're limiting God because I'll give you the key it will take all of his seven Redemptive names revealed to put us in a position to walk off the earth in a Rapture amen you're not going off the Earth without a Healer you think you're going to be changed the moment twinkle eye and go to meet the Lord in the A and you're going up with one leg missing or limping or 70 years old in her whole body now something wrong there but just remember the key it will have to transpire here that's right it won't be when we get dark that's simple that's a good old Baptist Doctrine bless God I don't want to worry about this smoking CU going get me a new body I'm not making a joke out of it or throwing off on they were saying what they believe you haven't never noticed one thing I mean have you really ever noticed that brother randam and he was explaining it I was thinking about this the other day you know in the days of John Wesley under sanctification you know there was a lot of songs that we still sing and thank God for them now don't misunderstand but a lot of those songs was about the blood right cuz you know what they believed in that day they believed you were sanctified they believed you were born again John Wesley didn't just teach say sanctification only he Tau sanctification as the baptism of the Holy Ghost right I've got his writings if you'd like to read he taught sanctification as the baptism of the Holy Ghost Martin Luther taught justification as the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that was right for their day but the songs they sang were about the blood you ever noticed that the people of this message are writing new songs you ever notice you change uh uh from one dispensation to another and you'll find songs being written about the dispensation you're in sure go to Jamaica W can verify go to Jamaica and preach a message that morning and somebody will write a song or have already done it but they'll write one if they ain't got it they'll write one for the evening sure about what you're talking about I remember I went over one time and I was preaching my heart about and they were just shouting all over the place and I was preaching on about Michael being chry when it got through I thought my Lord they must have wrote the song while I sing cuz I didn't know that was a song like that they got up there singing Michael on your side you know get what I'm saying get the point listen Abraham needed a revelation about a sacrifice yeah to be given in the place of his son he had to sacrifice he was going to sacrifice it he fully intended right to kill his son
