========================================

now I want to talk this morning about a real simple loop to the subject but if maybe a lot of times we kind of overlooked and that is the subject of justification because when we're talking about the new birth and everything a lot of times in our mind maybe we'll kind of skip over and and and we want to get to the new verse as fast as possible almost like it maybe just kind of thinking in our head you know and we want to almost kind of treat justification as you what yeah you believe in you turn around and those kind of things and just keep on moving but I think you know the gospel is so simple that these little simple things and we've been talking about patterns and things and how God God in his simplicity just gives us a real pattern because it's so hard when are our human minds to really grasp anything that's complicated so he gives us something for us to understand remember program before it Cecilia said remember just keep only the same symbol true I forget exactly how the cocoa but the same simple message same simple messages continuum because it's real simple and this same simple just looking at justification the same simple truth of justification keeps keeps going up higher and higher and higher and NC what really what really a justification really is you know kind of kind of think before we get into this why did brother branham when he began to preach the capstone messages i went up to nineteen sixty-five an invisible union widen he stressed so much that we are justified it is the similar is more powerful and it became so much more deeper to him as the message went up higher and higher to higher plane a higher plane of revelation i claim is life than it was when you look at it as just a stepping stone a piece of the the things that God does you to bring you to a new birth because think what what is really JIT to be just before God where you could stand before God and he looks upon you and says there's I finally little fault in him I find no fault lay my bride right out of here we just ran John chapter 31 where and gentlemen zone he's trying to say well I had one break this long list this long chapter of all the good things that jump is doing and really if you stand before I only God those things like my brother Joel brought out his message that I righteousness before god it's like filthy rags all those things that job is gonna head looks real good let's go ahead come on man that looks real good on that book but when God looks at you if he's not looking at a reflection of himself God willing inside a person then your righteousness it's just like it's just filthy rags right back so here's here's a if we read down through joke moving over from Joe chapter 31 to job chapter 32 these first two verses where Li who comes on the scene who was the type of Christ and give his job a little bit of Correction so these three men c stands for Joe because he was righteous in his own eyes they ceased to talk to them comfortable you know if if you believe that your own works are enough to save you that you in your own self that's enough reason it's almost like what more can you say to somebody they just left off talking to it and here comes alive then was kindled the wrath of the light of the Sun Chronicle who's I of the candidate of RAM against Joe was his wrath Kendall because he justified himself rather than God now there's the whole the whole secret of the Christian experience is to get yourself out of way God can't justify myself the only justifier the only way that will ever be able to stand just before God at this is if God comes down and does something does something for you to make yourself manifest in you now let me let me switch over the slides that I have here and starting off with it easy of course we know all the Old Testament story was of bringing your lamb and and placing your hand on and being identified with it in faith not just because somebody told you do it but because we have a real revelation of what's going on looking to it to the sacrifice looking to the offering that was made for you and it's the same way we do today when if you go to church and don't have an understanding of what Christ really did for you they need to pull himself all other things that you did and would do in your life and if you if you put your faith in Jesus Christ not by anything that you have done it ain't nothing that you can do to warn any kind of salvation nothing that you can do it's only in Jesus Christ yes if you get this this whole type of it runs through the entire Scripture but I want to stress this from the old testament to the new and that's what a lot of us get in her head that in the old testament christ jesus that the attributes of god were different in the new testament no he's the same yesterday today and forever if you can't even buy coming in by faith today that's how they came to him in the old testament in fact that's the scripture I'll back it will talk about it and then just shall live by faith that's an old testament scripture that the judge shall live by faith not by works but my face and Leviticus 17 11 assists crib talks about that prohibition of eating blood and things because for the life of the flesh is in the blood and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls for it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the Soul something had to give a life now in brother branham except we're going to look at a justification kind of going going down through the plan of redemption because it starts off justification before you get the new birth it starts off as chopping off your past sins you've done a lot of wrong and you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and all the things that you have ever done and this is what's so fantastic because they don't matter what it was you're an adultery how about this a pedophile I bring it all down bring it on down to the most horrible thing you can think of now really think about how horrible things that people do but if you have faith and believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he'll wipe the slate clean yes right the future home of the heavenly bridegroom they're only bride now the first step is repentance toward God and it follows after that is water baptism water after to a pen and be baptized the name of Jesus Christ sea water baptism falls showing that repentance was genuine order to remit our past sins to take away the things that you did in the past that has nothing to do with future sin now say we're getting somewhere now first take it away your past sins because we're moving on the look to being where what God looks at us and we remember the statute perfect man adoption all these things are talking about oneness with God we're trying to move to oneness moving from we're far apart is a great chasm between us and God and moving this up until we're until the bride is speaking what God that got the revelation the voice is in the bride and cool that I know that stones a lot of people like hold on now how can you how can you say that the voice will be in the bride well how can you say that God will come down and Tabernacle himself inside of a believers of the only ghost that that's stumbling to that God can make himself manifesting somebody and show for this work through through the Baptist but all yours has been down through the seventh Church 85 showing that repentance with genuine or to remit our past sins that has nothing to do with future sin it only remits repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ work for remission taking away of past sin has nothing to do with the future just your sin has been chopped off what you did you can't repent from what I've done you never know that Adam do you just forgive your forgiveness for what you're doing the old nature is still there that's that's the key what I'm trying to the point I'm trying to make their old nature is still there you got your old seasons chopped off all nature is still there we're going to wear that old nature stealing their we're going to us that's what I'm going this morning is where you can stand before God perfectly justified where he looks upon you it says an invisible Union and brought across better in priest now the bride is justified you are justified we're god you're looking for you as a no fault anywhere now this is I found this this is a little letter we all know the story Baberaham Lincoln porn and this is one of the partners that he signed this man is pardoned and hereby ordered to be discharged from the service he wrote it and this is how he had party he dried up scribbled down real quick and I think this is actually written on the day that he died and we know the story of how the power must be received as a partner's got to be accepted as gotta be it's gotta be you gotta believe that is for you and the gospel tells the gospel is so fantastic in the end of proclamation that it makes there anything and depart if you'll just believe it and that's what we have so much trouble just accepting what's written and God word that no matter what I've done and no matter what you doing that it can be pardoned and and and and you can be made completely just before God Michael 718 it was a god-like under the pardon of iniquity and passes by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage he retained it not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy this is the Old Testament scripture remember remember the story about David God gave him a choice he turned over to the hand of the Lord when he when he did wrong i think it was be numbered the children of israel he will be turned over the head of the Lord you want to be turned over to the head of the the of the kings of the world will not explain I'm doing them for things and uh I'm kind of paraphrasing quickly but David said I'd really be turned over into the head of the Lord because I know that God is reaching mercy of God slew some of the children of Israel because of what they didn't done but he still knew David had a revelation that God was rich in mercy that's what that part of the snickering who was it God like underneath he retained if not his anger forever because he delighteth in mercy he will turn again he will have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and now will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea which is a poetic way of saying then there ain't on me no more they're going to be completely annihilated the sins are going to be going of course now we will remember we'll bring them up and we'll bring them up things that other people do does and stuff like that but but as far as God is concerned they are gone their knowledge man I was kind of looking at the deepest place in the ocean is 10,000 almost 11,000 meters deep which is which is way higher than Mount Everest is so now if you were to top something down to the bottom of that if you talk something down into a deep pool it's going to be kind of hard to retrieve it if you talk something down into the deepest part of the ocean you ain't never getting it back is that yo that's right didn't so the annihilation of past sins and ignoble Graham talking about Clorox to outlaw roxas you put he puts us a sustained in the Clorox bleach no God's blood and it wipes it out and the Clorox you know gets all in the chemical structure in the molecule that everything until this is for literally gone the stain is gone and he says that's what the blood of Jesus Christ does to the true child of God when he confesses that sin and says they're justified in his mercy goodness even it's so great to God said I can't even remember it anymore and it's absolutely my son stain remover for whites I put because it the bleach of God blue will it will make us in spotless the spotless my church adem can be presented to him holy and blameless right through and through so gentle 92 the job answered and said I know it is so of a truth but how should maybe just with God in june nine twenty twenty two deities on if I justify my mouth shall condemn me if I say i am perfect it she'll also prove me for earth though I were perfect yet would I not know my soul I would despise my life because why would he say something like that well if you could lay out all the good things in your life doing still there's something wrong on the inside of man something's got to happen on the inside of man now that's the best of thing about before the new birth if you're justifying all your sins are chopped away there's still something wrong you got to have something change on the inside of a man so that you could stand before God because if the nature's not changed you can have those past sins chopped off but you'll just keep going right back there's still a conscious of scenes right there's still something in there that that that makes you draw toward the things of the world and that's got to be gotten rid of Luke 16 14 and 15 and the Pharisees also who recovers heard all these things and they derided and he said on the knee are they which justify yourselves before me but God knoweth your heart see I maybe you've heard the expression before that then we judge one another by by our works or by the things that we do but we judge ourselves by our our 10 and everything in this I can you know God judges the same way as we judge ourselves which is merciful he looks upon our motives in our objectives my works are presented other people but God knows the secret of our heart we can own outside we can present ourselves as Holy and pie someone conspiracies but on the inside you can be like a open likewise if occur as Jesus says oh I'll canker everything on the inside but that's why I says but God knoweth your heart you got to have that inside change so justification is well and good and it's needful on the path to being own again but we're talking about something on a change on the inside moving up higher and higher and let me kind of kind of keep going on so I don't and this is the script track quoted earlier back at two for behold his soul which is lifted up is not a pride in him your soul lift it up but how could you remember real revelation will bring your soul down because you realize how much you need God that's one of the greatest things that God can show you that nothing in myself that I can ever justify myself with ain't nothing in myself that I that's even worthy of boasting or anything all the glory needs to go god yes because if we believe on him the just shall live by faith the just little by his face Jove 19 23 23 to 27 old and my words were not already know that they were printed in a book that they were craving with an iron pan and lid and the rock forever forever for I know that my Redeemer liveth see how is it he's living by faith that he shall stand at the latter day upon the earth and though after my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I shall see for myself and mine eyes shall behold and not another though my reins be consumed within me I'm just kind of moving quickly I am the resurrection in life program said the job here four thousand years before his coming saw his death burrow and his a resurrection and his justification that come by the resurrection and the absolute guarantee of the resurrection of the believer what a comfort it is to know that those things are true it's not a fiction story now I just put this put this in it cuz up cuz with them keep going up high for a second here justification is all of it all these three things are done by the word are you hit a word of them that the Spirit comes and you yield yourself to the spirit believe the Lord Jesus Christ a quick as it to you your aquarium that you believe the Lord and you're justified you believe the Lord and and it works I surprise you you believe the Lord and finally a baby is born out there you say one that's what we're the key point right there is is when the baby is born then your borning you you're justified your sins you're cut off and you keep movin on up eating the word clip being cleaners is easy to thirty-six twenty-six twenty-seven cents and a new spirit while I put in you I'll put my spirit in you a spirit of god that puts it is in you that push you into service and then would you move over them that's right knee high on a higher because God has a he's got like an evolutionary path where even in the beginning when he he created the animals and everything and he began to move up and created the monkeys and they created beast who I hey that might be it kind of close he was upright like a man talking and those kind of things but but then God made Adam and Eve and and put a soul in them said they were walking a higher form that's that's what the same thing that God does in the script trees he starts you off to the foundation starts you all the new birth and it keeps moving you up higher and higher everything is continually moving up higher and that's what I reading this program said in the statute perfect man he was talking about you you fall have the altar in you have an experience with God and you think that's it but no God is moving a higher and higher he's continually moving up and what's he doing as he moves up higher higher z's uniting himself you with himself and so so let's just come stay on this for a few minutes I'm i hate that clock y'all the viable proof of the reservation program says but let's watch him as he stands there gravitation and this is where this is the scripture in the Bible he's talking about work in Acts chapter one ways he's given his final message to the believers and then he ends up in a cloud and he's given his message that this is the same thing that the believers were doing ascending up higher and higher on the word but let's watch him as he stays me gravitation loses his power one day gravitation is going to lose his power for us to right now watch his feet begin to come up from the earth there's a light beneath his feet he rises higher and higher higher and higher gravitationally lost his power just as death lost his power he was the center of gravitation he was the creator of gravitation he held gravitation and his own command as he held death and his own domain okay that's what you see you get born again and you think well I understand justification and justification was just something something to get me to the point where I'm born again but it's high you got to keep moving up higher and higher moving up to higher planes higher and higher like it is when a man will stay not come up and shake hands with the past you put his name on the book but when he will stay there until he feels something cut loose inside of him and he begins to float out younger by faith knowing that his sins opacities anchored his soul in Christ and there is something raising him higher and higher persistent perseverance now that's after he gets the new birth hey something-something raising him higher and higher right hey I love this quote brother I was talking about if you you know he's talking about i quickly paraphrase you get all these little denominational thing almost these little ideas and things in our mind and everything that's separates us from one another and he's talking about if it will just get lifted up higher and higher like like ducks on different sides of the fence that the rain comes and lifts us higher and higher too it's just all united not united by like some kind of denominational system but you're not invited a word and reminds me of a fellow one time had some ducks and he cut their wings and he could fly up and yes and took some one side and ducks on the other water began to come in the first thing you know the water got higher and higher ducks got together then and I'm skip down so denominational barriers can be floated out if we just let the waters get deep enough and we'll let the waters get deeper out of a spoon because that's what we're uniting me with God and we as we take more of the word and we grow in grace and knowledge oh okay now so we talked we've been talking about justification as as putting away your past sins and and of course you still got that same nature you got to have that nature change so justification is talking about put that a death to the to that sinful nature of death to the sins not just not just cutting them off and leaving them hanging somewhere but a real justification is the total annihilation of those past sins we're talking about a total annihilation of that old nature until you can stand before God's completely just and moving on all the way up into a capstone we're now you really justified and such were some of you but you're watched as Paul says but you're sanctified but you are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus and by the spirit of our God and he says all things are lawful underneath nothing here he's talking about he's talking about new level of justification I believe because he says I will not all things are not expedient all things are lawful for me but I will not be brought under the power of any and when you get the universe that's when God's powers on the inside of you power to put you in a service you will not be brought under the power of the things that used to be a power in you now you're intervening to a higher level of justification where you could stand before God just where his own life is inside of your soul if his life is in your soul and you can't you can't help how you can hold anything against the charge of a Christian against a believer because there's something inside of there that's different than the way it used to be that's the reason we're going to send in a visible union hold on sake yes that's the reason you have to be born again you have to separate you have to dodge that first husband you can't live with it you just can't say well I'll divorce him and hang him up here until occasion no sirve no writing of divorcement he dies the nature of the world has to die every speck of him has to die you have to be reunited again with another nature I just got the more minutes up to the born-again Christian of the missing your first husband is dead you know he did God let it die it's finished and we're still talking I justification now of course now there's so many things that go into these I don't want I don't want you off track because we're talking about justification sanctification the Badgers Nolan jokes moving on up move it higher and higher higher forms of an anointing the physical unit abroad across program said your old book of divorcement is put away and it's dead absolutely out of existence even in the mind of God and then in invisible you know the Bride of Christ pahrump said again look up the word the word don't mean forgiven the word means justify it don't mean that you're forgiven and skipping down the old union the old union is in the sea of God's forgiveness now here's the key you wasn't married to it to begin now this is some deep stuff right here you wasn't married to it to begin with because what's he doing he's taking bringing us back full circle back to a union with God Leia should have been in the beginning he the bridegroom bored or shame himself for you in your place he took your place for you and predestinated for him to be in his bride before the foundation of the world and and then I say message he says you your first wedding was an old it was you've never done it in the first place because there's only one thing to do it that will be God come down himself and took your place in a form of the Son of God Jesus Christ and watched you by the water of the washing of the lord of the world now now when you've got the new birth now you're in a different realm of justification that may be it may be there might be a different way to say that but to the best of my ability I'm expressing it this way who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect because in the center of your soul and down in your soul is God himself and how can you charge God for doing anything that's that's why when you get the new birth there's no more conscious of seeing ya you have no more desire for seeing how can that soul that's now eternal with God be judged anymore because it is just it is righteous it is justified in your soul yes who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect it is God that justified Hebrews 10 once or two cents for the law having a shadow of good things to come another very image of the things can never with those sacrifices which they offer year by year continually make the comers very to perfect but then when they not have ceased to be offered because the the worshippers once perched should have had no more conscious of sins which is what the new birth gives you no more conscious of sins of course this is one of the way tale the genuine evidence of a new birth no conscious of sin this is admony you walking in the garden naked but there was no conscious of seeing they were naked but they didn't realize that there might be some kind of bad implication of that and it realized that the that you know somebody could say well y'all are naked know what what are you talking about no conscious of sin that the things that when you get the new birth of things that had a former hold on you you can say well well I had a problem with alcohol or all these cigarettes and stuff but now I'm going again and sometimes I still struggle with that God will remove the conscious of seeing completely from from your songs from your innermost being so that remember he's like a that soul is the control tower of the person and that the control tower is perfect it bought a new birth then it's going to set the believer in action to move in the right way so that there is no more conscious of seed now I I'm getting to work sitting in the spirit so hang only for a second but in that soul how can you accuse the soul of the believer of cigarette problems you will have problems in your spirit and but not that kind of problem you say you see a believer going into a brothel or something like that name that's not they probably got a problem we're talking about there is no more conscious of sin and we know seeing is unbelief when that new birth comes into the innermost that Oh God Jones with a solar planet you cannot disbelieve God's Word and here's the thing let's jump straight to 122 wish we had some time later than a few minutes looky here for he a worshiper once purged the worshiper once perked has no more conscious of sin sin has passed from it and acts 13 35-39 and buy him all that believe are justified from all things for which you could not be justified by the law of Moses justified from all things that's kind of what I mean yeah I was really hoping program said that when you preach you what do you want you want to convict the heart of the people that make them feel ashamed in the nitration but others there already are Christian you want to give them something to keep moving higher and higher on me so I may be one of my aims this morning is a to convict the heart and and give us all something to aspire to something greater and greater because the gospel really is really simple if it can be revealed try maybe don't minds and then maybe you know I my thick head is sometimes something it takes a while for for God to get through it to get to it sometimes but if it really is once it begins to be open to you it is really simple and it's so simple that the lies in the time I show right over let me let me kind of wrap up here a minute let me see where a good place to stop yeah this is this is a good Scripture now stop right on this one Matthew 11 28 come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and lowly nan and he shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is life why is his yoke easy because you have to do nothing for salvation I program so how are you have to preach I'm just preaching because I love the Lord and I love his people but we don't have to do anything for salvation all you have to do is believe on god and when you do that he shot he shall find rest unto your souls honest a rest unto your souls because your soul is now eternal but you can still have problems in your spirit and so i'm gonna stop right there that'll give you some things about maybe
