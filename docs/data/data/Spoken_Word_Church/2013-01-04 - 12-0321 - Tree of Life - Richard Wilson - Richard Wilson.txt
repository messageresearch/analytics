to see i want to see [Music] is [Music] oh he said the world won't see me no more but you'll see [Music] always been to me to come down and see the people a lot of people will say you know i i want to preach it somebody knows more than you do i'm just awesome yeah that's right amen you got your bible and read one verse and you can be seen i got seven more scriptures i want to read in ephesians the 4th chapter of the 30th first let's just have a form of prayer before i read this picture heavy father we're thankful again tonight we have a previous evening to come together the saints of god to worship thanks for this place your lord the word has gone forth for many many years we love you lord for your grace and mercy to us all you give us lord give us opportunities to hear this word it's helped us now the knives we stand here you give us the words and you speak lord what you have us to say what the people needs you know we know that lord all things is possible we'll only believe absolutely bless each one now bless every request and apply every need he has these blessings in the name of jesus christ amen ephesians 4 30 and grieve not the holy spirit of god for about you are sealed unto the day of redemption amen amen may god bless you you can be saved and god bless his word and i got a several books here we go through all them we'll be here about midnight six o'clock in the morning um i won't do that but it's just good to be back and always kind of come down here and fellowship and view your people and it's the the glorious day we're living in that's right very very wonderful time me it's the greatest first time they've been on their faces tonight that's right that's right hold on please i say something if you don't agree with this statement and brother dale he's a pastor he's corrected my lead i don't want to i know we have to say the same thing right now there's only one word right so then it's it's very easy because a lot of people have get sidetracked and getting the wrong thing right have the wrong conception of them you know something that satan would give you right and when it's not god-given it's the devil right right this if i'm if i'm wrong i don't know it right you know so the only thing that's right is the word i know that right so now you just pray that the lord will help me and i don't have to try not to be too all along but i've been talking to the church at home for several services i guess on the tree of life so that's why even an adam in the garden of eden they fell from him right amen which is eternal life right amen we know by the way that's not hard to understand well you know what we fell from right right so then uh maybe i'll just continue on with the same thought but you just you just pray for me that i'll i can say something happy you know you know a lot of people they'll say you know i know brother dale's been talking about teaching lately on the you know showing the right and wrong between hershey's also it must be herself that's right you got to be here you know that is approved you know that's right right but people really i told church the other day uh i think it's past sunday that people don't they want brother brown they say the third pool is never he was [Music] what those seven thunders were yeah whatever you know the third pull and i said they don't they don't believe him now they won't believe then that's right you know i doubt i really just me personally i doubt he'd be preaching to him oh lord that's right he can god can do anything because one thing god can't do he can't leave his word so you know if brother bram comes back he should be a 30 40 day period there that's right you know god can do anything yeah he can jesus he called him 40 days i see but now to me i my understanding that we have to have faith to get him back here i believe that that's god that's gonna be something that's a revelation and i'll try to maybe get to you there's things that the lord's revealed to me and i got some books y'all recent quotes out of and what i believe it takes to get him back right i'm always right because i don't believe martin luther's faith will get to the registration he's the one that was ordained of god to bring the message to finish the mystery of god right right now he says right in the scripture and it says the voice of the seventh angel that's right you begin to sound the mystery of god shall be finished he's declaring the prophet so he's the one he brought the message that finishes it amen so if the if the third tool can't be understood it's not revealed you know they there's no rapture there's no way you're getting the science back here right right yeah but i believe according that brother branham uh the third pool was over on seven seals he went in the deepest rims of god that he ever he said he ever worked exactly so now but that wasn't you know he said this will be the third pool remember that vision he had yeah yep he says he said it's not gonna be like they they have it right a public show if it's the third pole you see and and uh if it's the third pool it's the older the seven seals come on right that's what he said exactly so the seven seals brings rapture and faith all right that's right right now now i'm going to get started on my notes you know i'm going to talk it'll take all my time i don't want to do that so now you just pray that i can say something right that'll help you you know sort so uh i want to read another scripture you got your bible read with me in the first peter first chapter clock don't slow down so i don't have to speed up first peter 1 verse 22 seeing here purify your souls and obeying the truth the way you purify your souls you obey the truth right right don't just hear the truth obey the truth amen through the spirit unto unfinished love by the brethren sinner you love one another with a pure heart verbally being born again amen amen being born again amen not to me that's after you're born again that's right for the new birth right all right non-corruptible seed right that's how we come to the first time corrupt right but of incorruptible by the word of god which later than the body forever right so being being born again by what by the word of god right glory all right okay now in uh matthew 17 when he came off the mountain remember that right jesus you know his adoption there and all those things that take place and uh verse 10 he said disciples must first come amen right you think she said to him them a lie truly shall come first come right shall first come and restore all things exactly he's already coming to john the baptist right so john was he was the third count so so elijah which is the last must come and restore right right bring back right you know your original place right your original position that's right right right now let me go let me read a book uh real quick i want to read something you're out of easter cia preaching 65 unfinished i believe it was yeah it fits april 3rd 1965. and from page 16. he that understandeth he knoweth his place in this hour he that heareth my that's word you purify yourself right and believe it on him that certainly had that's presented eternal life right man she'll not come into the judgment but it's passed from death this eternal life dwells in you it is the potential or the earnest of you being quickened from moral immortality right amen right well let's say nobody has to come back and speak your eternal bond again it's going to take place from inside you right amen glory let me say that again that's the brother talking he said let me say that again when this spirit has found you he sent you the individual has come upon you it is the potential of your eternal inheritance amen that god thought of you and made you before the foundation of the world that's your potential so that's that is what your redeemer restored back to right amen all right all right what then he has thought of you was what you said there tonight and me standing here right yeah all right now look the thought of god is what is the artist the holy spirit immortal to immortality now that's that's your predestination right right that's where it is now all right let me get started so again now in revelations 5 the book adam lost all right all right i wasn't john weeping you know all right the i think and nobody was worthy to take nobody opened the book that's right so according to brother branham i really hear a man admit he said you're you're the book is sealed and you're sealed with the book exactly right all right okay now the tree adam failed eprom right exactly which is god's word right now look glory see this is the great mystery god unfolds down here to individually any individual now right the that's only two though the predestination amen right here now look never to a group just to one person god told brother ram remember that he said i'll meet you in there midnight vision that's it a little room this will be the third pool yeah okay columbia public show so then so god to me you may not may not agree this this is my understanding of it but brother bro when the sabbath season can open to brother brown he said he spoke of the vision he had he said six years first he said no he was seven years yeah right well 56 to 73 right was seven years right he was a television interval a lot of people talking about right he's i'll meet you in there and this is the third door all right amen so in slovenia canyon he said when the source struck his hand he just struck inside and said this is the third pool amen i'm all right right and no one wants the end time he said the third pull was the opening of those seven seals see all right showing all down to the ages that's right the word they had missed so here's still a man a redeemed son of god right see that had been redeemed with the full word of god to finish the mystery god had in his word amen that every believer down through the bible right typed and spoke about right here he stood to bring forth that mystery to the people right i'm a very glorious day so he said it's a secret now let me ask you something when brother brandon preached those seven seals who knew it besides him who did no that's right i want a soul on the face not a soul right he was a secret that's right amen not only to him he was the opening of the word to him amen glory all right but he said you didn't get any questions you didn't get it you weren't supposed to exactly see you had to be a certain place right here he was right here i hear the holy spirit right am i right or not amen he preached all the word in the former in a former ring from the serpent in the garden to the nations of wolverine right right right so there he stood and then something happened so now look right let me go on here real quick see there in revelations 5 is the most sublime thing in the scripture so there he stood our stood the lamb revealing the mystery amen all right now let me read some here real quick i think i'll need to eat out of silver before i go on this thing okay hold on just be patient with it this is page 79 78 he quotes a scripture he'll read it in ephesians 4 30. he hold that word redemption until the day that the book of redemption has been revealed and the redeemer comes to claim his possession now they can do it don't grieve it fail don't do things just do things that please god for the book is sealed now and you are sealed amen the holy spirit itself is the seal all right see so what is the holy spirit it's the word brother he said he said you're sealed by the word right glory you're not sealed by the words you miss the seal you know where i tried it exactly okay now why the holy ghost come on dear pentecost he would have not accomplished that's right man when it comes to the word right it birthed the word that was in there and it set down aside 920 right you're coming out right okay now it's a it's a birth of the word now this is page 79. you notice this book is sealed and you are sealed with the book right that's right until the day of redemption again and he goes to romans 8 22 23 24. so with the whole question grown surveillance of earth so things will give it to them see do you have the first troops grown within ourselves waiting what for the adoption right now you know you believe that was brother bram's adoption i don't know what it is and god took him out west there and man those things were brought him back i believe that was his adoption man i sure do absolutely so he uses that scripture he's an old man i'm old my don't it make us old folks feel good yeah does me don't you go down don't worry well it's getting old right not older maybe yeah still that makes you feel a little better yeah the old man that's right i like to be called an older man you give me a little bit see now it ought to make us all feel good waiting for this hour we understand it will take place at the first resurrection right nature's grown and we are growing but listen that's right you're in the resurrection now amen the first resurrection exactly right so we're gonna raise the whale down the road somewhere from the dead saints no the resurrection said don't get freaked out amen is that right right it has to be that's the first resurrection birth that's right right christ's birth in you i believe that it's only resurrection there is come on brother said masterpiece he said this is the last thing there'll be no resurrections after this right yeah because he says that's not he's talking about saints of god because we know the center of the city man right yeah now this nature's growing we're all groaning everything's grown the because we realize there's something that's not right the only way you can grow his way for it is because there's been new life come in here that speaks of a new world amen now say look let's don't kill ourselves do we really expect this thing to happen all right i mean we're under anticipation you know are we really enthused about it is it is it more real tonight than it was last night it has to be people right now it's not we're just going along you know right maybe we'll get in you know yeah that ain't what it is that's right it's the individual amen that's why is the earth growing it's not it's right to be state why am i growing right why do you grow new life the earth knows it's going to be a new earth it's going to be redeemed right right exactly right now look let me hold on just a minute i get too excited right you're right all right now look the more you're sealed with the book the more you realize you have fallen from somewhere right you understand me that's right man the deeper you the deeper you go in god that's right as you go off that pyramid are you a birth all those virtues there is a birth according to brother brown you're birthing this you're burning am i right see although it's the deeper you go in your new birth that's why peter said being born again he's teaching says you're a perfect man right by the word of god the deeper you go the deeper the birth pains off right you believe that exactly right oh my god why the more you realize where you fell from let me hear an old man 73 year old right yeah well see now a lot of 73 year old man in the world don't know one thing about god right here but why am i troubled right new life from another world i've been born from above so there's gotta be a pool from here up there there's another report your mother's out there did you have any pain when you had your children yeah that's just hot now you stick a needle in your spine you can't feel anything yeah you know yeah that's right right that's how the church is doing right right give him a shot exactly you're okay you're gonna be all right we're gonna let you know we're going the wrong way yeah that's true that's right you know that's true but see jesus coming into his ministry according to brother brown page 130 i believe in the seal book he said he said now my soul troubled right you mean you're coming down the end of a ministry you've got trouble what makes something you think some spiritual thing happens you have trouble with you right i'm not afraid to die but i don't want to die i'll be honest with you that's right you might hear what to die i want to die to myself but i want to see this thing consummated right glory but gary constimation in me don't you right right that's exactly what it is right amen this words this word come for someone this we should believe it come for us but listen you've got to live it more than you love anything that's right you're going to want it more than you want anything else man if it's not that way you know when you ain't you ain't right you need to move up yeah all right all right so the deeper the pain see the more the cleaner the message get the more you realize from the place you fell from that's right grow up but see the closer you get to god think the more pain you have right because the planet it gets the place you fail from right right so then you start seeking searching for that position that place you fell from all right you're not satisfied just to hear the message you've got to be the message hallelujah preaching it ain't it that's part of it it's not all right you live a good life and that ain't it put a good last part on it amen right look reason we got a man who don't do nothing wrong come on if he ain't got atonement he's lost exactly outside christ being in you he said you're lost he goes for me are you anyone right that's right that's what dude that's what i'm saying do we really want to see this thing come to a climax really ask yourself because you live a hundred more years you know where you are now that's right because see we was playing here enough tonight amen i was going to live here in the eternal mind that's exactly right we won't pay here to die that's right so when the word comes he said a true eagle will understand right he said he searches for his position oh my god and i'm gonna read it here in a minute you know if i can't don't give me great we want to be delivered but we're going to pay we're in we're in a birth we're being birthed right right all right now let's see what brother graham said here i've heard brother brother wade mentioned this before i heard my other day i take the other day i mentioned twice two different tapes you know he said we quote all the time do we live below our privilege right you know we're satisfied to go on you know that's right but what's that with we let we slip it under our privilege we need to move up come on come on when we see we need to move up we better move all right well i'll tell you what i'm going to tell you someone's moving right now someone's moving they know right now someone it's going to this world is going to be vindicated right now look what he said this is birth playing 65 or january 24th notice quickly she is in that phase beyond shadow doubt we're in atlanta same age her messenger is promised amount of kind of fourth chapter he's promised to do it the message is to bring back the word bring back the people to the word birth is to be she's to be delivered delivered amen i'm gonna have a baby some girl said i'm gonna have a baby keep saying that for nine months and then have a baby some monthly right right she never has to concede right amen right that's right but she's to be delivered of a new birth from according to malachi 4. amen right now the birth of malachi 4 restores you back glory all right all right amen now if i have time i want to read that i'm going to go on something a minute okay you're just praying look here so you the book is sealed and you're seeing with the book till the day the book the day of redemption for the day the book of redemption is revealed right now what book is it's revealed so this is this bible here is the only book of redemption there is amen amen for my brother so this bible that has to be in us amen amen to be revealed that's right right come on he does it reveals it then it makes it manifest right all right so we're we're having labor pains right we want we want to be delivered right right now you get god's on this guns down there and go to there oh yeah that's right that's right that's right right but see when we get away now what that word was saying right then we can't make it manifest that's right oh my god yeah it gets pretty bitter don't you that's right it's pretty rough right yeah anyway all right all right when i left this message and look at myself amen did the lord help me let me just get them to talk about a message and tell people we're all going to make it no we're going to make it only though there's god ordained to it now i'm going to go real fast you know this is the seal book page 81. now something's lost that's grown it's trying to get back to the original condition would you imagine someone falling from there down to a pit somewhere struggling climbing pulling they must some way get out of that pit this pit there's nothing they're not in the original state and frantically they're screaming clawing walling making a noise do it some way they're groaning because they want to get back to their original state right see now that's what that's what when a new life comes into you right i mean literally it's born into you and your soul becomes the very soul of god eternal amen if you're so determined to god the only one for eternal it starts at birth pain in you come on now even though in a baby form when you when you see things you can't explain it but you know they say right but see as you're growing grace and knowledge and things see then you you start being born again then you begin to realize i've fallen from somewhere right now i've got to get back to where i feel from we left our home for the future home we left our home to come down here right that's right correct right we're going to be testing the sin and when the test is over we redeem back right see amen this time our soul but that thrills my soul come on because this is the message of our own baby god's let me live to hear it amen amen amen right right i don't know allow me to hear it let me believe it don't walk away from me all right that's the grace of god brother dave you don't need anyone that's right right by the way that's exactly right that's right when it's when a person is stuck with disease and aches and pains see now listen i you go to the doctor today they said you've got you've got pneumonia they're not that bad it's not a bad cold not the flu you know they give you some pills or whatever i don't you know that cold they might get all back home yeah but you're the doctor and he says you know no sense of you've got symptoms of believer cancer oh come on yeah the diagnosis and you find you've got you've got to live with cancer oh my now your attitude is going to be different amen am i right so i believe it's the same thing when we're we're we're down here in the pit brother in haunted yeah see we're fell from somewhere that's why we have aches and pains naturally right then look we wanted to get back that eternal life is our little dude dog remember having sparkles our son get he wants to go back where it come from right man so that eternal life in us is pulling us right back to where we fell from and we're gonna go back to a thought no no no that's red right how the easter seal yeah that's right no hey the hair does he give you before the foundation of the world right right that eternal life right right amen amen lord they're grown and why they're not right there's something wrong they're growing and trying to get back where they they've had health right that's right see people who catch your meat up here they're growing they're trying to get back right right a lot of people they just grown a little bit you know grunting and groaning is too different you know you're right that's right you can't get a lot of people leaving the ground right that's right we got that right amen hey man i don't matter to me where i go tonight or not oh my yeah i know the message oh you know i can hear it and uh i follow this message 40 50 years or whatever and 30 you know i have to go all the time but the rest of the bride the true brother truly will be faithful at every point right exactly when nature and the people as the bible said we are groaning he shows there's something that they're not in there ought to be conditioned they have fallen from somewhere we don't need anybody to interpret that for us right that's right you don't look at me for 73 year old you can tell i found somebody always looking i don't look good i don't look too bad anyway look at these young kids back there you know sterling background look at him you know they started sitting back here his mom and dad he just you know i used to look at why i just you know be young you did too i said we failed them somewhere right right but the new life but you and i are the privileged people listen we're the last group right we're number seven we're not a seventh no we're the best he saved the best of himself right right right he though he didn't would have done it no matter what age you're living in right right amen right now for of course we know it was eternal life that we'd fallen from they lost their acclaim on eternal life by the fall of adam and eve who fell from eternal life to death in the garden of eden brought all nature under them to death do you believe that man i believe on you let me hurry you now let me read those another place you i gotta hurry i'm gonna take a long time reading of the book here but it's hold on it's on page 92 at the bottom of the page come back to one of one of the very last five referring united breach uh the ones that i'm throwing in revelations five all my people i'll just keep on down to my opinions all my people she said john saw his arm all my people i'm just feeling i'm just feeling this this way but let me let him set the angel let him here is the book of redemption here is the plan of redemption here is the only way you'll ever be redeemed right right amen for there is the title deed to redemption the whole heavens and the earth let him come forth if he will right yeah now remember what he said back over here you're the book you're the one sealed amen am i right right right the seal to me the seal that's brought to you is the one you're sealed by right correct so you become the word if you hear this word amen and you hear it and you receive that word in yourself amen you take it into your soul and lord make me warm with that word you genuinely receive that word you become that word back right am i right right man come back because listen the one that come and died for you was the word amen a man never died for you god died in the flesh for him amen amen right yes sir nobody can die for another man come on god die in the flesh amen right then your seal he said here's the only way for that lamb come forth and take the book come on that's the only way you can be redeemed that's right that's what he said right right then get here this is actually a perfect man here this is the seven ages and it's you right right he's an individual right right right so you're the cure you're single the new faith is a new birth that's a new birth you're sealed into virtue you're sealed into knowledge right now listen and when we say we we've got that revelation come on we say we got it come back brother and we bring the word you sit there and listen to the word come on now listen to miss a minute right this is the truth you there and listen you and you're in harmony come on yeah the

jubilee glory all right that's it the the life seal is broke the actual answer to give his message this is it's the word god spoke to adam and eve and left the garden of eden come on then what the seed is a woman yeah look here meow i've heard what they'll say well chasing dick couldn't come and die for us that's right man all right yeah sure all right the woman got put in the garden of eden right hallelujah but you know something it's the same person all the time all right come on he'll tell you to come jesus christ right yeah that's right hallelujah since you believe it restores all things through elijah message and all the living word restores all right the only thing that restores he says the word right amen see this this is the new testament come on we're in the new testament this is the new testament in an american right that's foreign see it brings in the millennium the most sublime thing in the scripture is what you're being sealed with this book of redemption right you're a copper no one can ever comprehend it because they never had the word to call for anywhere right are you comprehending right but but unto you comprehend that the book you're seeing is the book of redemption right you're still here right man right yes you are right see you all right now see see that book is revealed in the day of full redemption right because you had to have the full word here right that's right the brain full of redemption yes sir so then the book you are sealed with redemption see it's the his ends on the sixth seal right yeah because redemption ends on the sixth seal they seven series wrote the bible and he wrote down they didn't pin am i right or wrong this here is something that's roaring around right right jesus preached six seals did you know in the word right and why did he preach the sabbath because he was right amen that's what it is right see you are sealed with a holy ghost seal christ the word amen brother perhaps you're sealed by the word amen right right because listen you must become the word because only the word knows the what the faults is that's a razor edge and if we're not the word brother branson if we're not the word we'll be deceived right right amen that's right yeah right we'll do it me you anyone we'll do it right see you're sealed christ or by the word unto the day the book you are sealed with is revealed right hallelujah look at the amen because what is it it's a revelation of jesus christ in your new world right he's the one who's crowned that's right he's the one it's all about that's right hallelujah right amen amen yes sir see to me this is what reveals your position but again you're being restored that's right as you hear the word and when you see that word you hold down where you're taking and holding it right you begin to understand you begin to comprehend brother says that's what god been waiting on for it to be fully comprehended wow well here's a problem with all the word come on well if you have all the word there's no way unto god's earth the predestination is not going to understand they will understand right [Applause] that's christ's bride right now he was a prophet he was a seer he's the one who interpreted the book to us all right right that's right this is the restoration of the bridegroom play 63 marie from 62. hold on now watch he was god's perfect prophet tree the example tree the bridegroom tree amen yeah he said that i did too amen he's talking about jesus right i'm going to say something directly this is brother brown talking if he is the bridegroom tree he said if he is the bridegroom tree right he said do you believe it blessed amen from the garden of eden yeah sure he's the bridegroom now listen real close he's the bridegroom tree from the garden of eden right right all right right then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit that's right that's right so he's got to have a bribe tree she's got to be born of the same material all right amen thank you now who did brother branham uses the pre-figure i haven't the woman right that's right amen that's right yeah if even stayed true who would have come to him amen who would who now listen he wasn't god in heaven doing it nope now stay with me come on you tell me i'll listen i promise you it wasn't that jehovah up there right right you had him down here right who would say it can't be jesus jesus could have a wife and had children sure i wouldn't know anything less god all right he had frustrations according to brother brown right yeah i didn't take that i didn't take it away away from moving on right you still don't all right man am i right right it yeah exactly right so if he's the bridegroom tree from the garden of eden right and the bride has to be the same material right right because it showed in revelations 5 but then right there they are the same material exactly we're number seven right right we're going to set up the church age timeline but not in the layout of the sea right right we've been called out but now we're in the brown age starting in the into what 50 right now the release right right amen so now look here you may believe you're gonna be another hundred years i don't know i don't believe that right right i don't know i don't wanna save his brother but listen this is the shortest age of all right it's on him never sign not just one single death but all signs point this is the end anything can happen right and it'll cure if we're not ready yep and we'll message you hmm you understand that's the truth god have mercy on us now look then the bridegroom tree without the female don't bear fruit so he's got to have a bright tree she's got to be born of the same material the word come on may flash from the tree come on right what was he who was the eve to wait on adam yeah absolutely she had a weight on her word husband adam death would have never got in right amen that's right you understand me yeah according to brother spoken words you read your seed and when they had that that child with birth was born on the earth through them how you want to believe it i believe in through the word that child wouldn't die nope yeah that's what he said yes sir amen what brought the dead the sin yeah amen what says conceivable death right right man that's true people man that's right i hope you get the same life in this female tree you know he's in the same life sure so if he's the word and he bits the word in us then the same lie puts the same life in us right amen right that he's going to do in us yeah like he did in his own body right is that right it's got to do it's got to happen right hey man hey man yes sir i know i'm doing a bad job trying to sing come on the as it is as it is in the bride see the same the works i do shall you do also that's right john 14 12. he wants the bridegroom you say that ain't scriptural oh yeah that's bro that ain't scriptural oh it is right amen amen i caught that now see we're fixing to have a healing meeting a minute i caught that he was you want proof of it he said i am the vine you are the branches all right man hey man come on all right now look it's the end time brian she wasn't drafted in right come on right yeah spread the tree and stick the lemons and set it up no he might be an army it might be a living limb a branch yeah but the call that's going to burn it's going to come this end time bribes come from the roots fair no sir i don't believe that i am divine you are the branches you bear the fruit right now what was eve what was eve to do bear the fruit from her her husband her bridegroom all right am i right or wrong right right brother brown said she was there he was he was given she was given to adam to reproduce himself because he was the son of god amen hallelujah i want to be on a silver company the female tree and the male tree now this is what this is i love it i like it the male tree and the female tree produces the pollen yeah one to the other right right you know why you want to know that form to bring the fruit that's right exactly i usually garden i don't even know i used to know for years i'd play me a row of white corn not playing hero or yellow corn on the back then they didn't have it like there now you can bite now all right [Music] yeah you see what i'm saying now where's the fruit right it pollinates right here man right this way see the the the female she can do it for herself right neither can the mailbox that's right right three john he said i'm the vine you're the brave right come on so if even it stayed true the woman in the garden to be heard adam with a all right come on exactly right they would have brought forth their child according to brother brennan right and murray brought forth right right not full of death full of life that's what he's doing now by the way he brings forth serving of god now full of life and not full of death that's right yes he is hallelujah that's exactly right see you see what i'm saying that pollen one to the other raise forth the fruit right you can't do it you can't do it yourself you could do it yourself that's right jesus couldn't do it because it wasn't natural that's right i think that's right not right now let's see again brother should god love fatherhood only he'll do it it becomes a man right right man that's the only way that jehovah god himself came down and become me you're right become a human being come you took our place on the earth see so he said the world singing almost you'll see me because i'll be with you even when he said on the day of pentecost here he came back 50 days yep hi what are you doing preached to him 40 days you said it because 10 days later here he came yeah the soul blood right to the soul of god and the holy ghost came back that's right now listen jehovah jehovah fathered 120 yeshua amen right that's right paul says i preach it i preach it he said apollos he'll water it right because jehovah gives the birth right exactly god's only gives the increase is that right exactly so i went down with middle then and somebody having a great revival yep as the lord said good you gotta join yourself down here in the desert 300 where all the dead head is at yeah the forms and all these things right so he came back down there reading i was there 53 right and phillip joined himself to it and that's what i said he said do you understand why you read he said how can i understand the word don't let me tell me is he talking about himself or somebody else he's telling me yeah michael said philip stood out there and preached jesus that's right heaven it's talking about jesus who was jehovah god right jehovah fathered another child right yeah right the seed came through the body right yeah right man that's right is that right absolutely that's right he had to have a wound the only way the bridge amen to bring forth the shielding yes sir now look here who he said you know her i heard it talking about four head death measures you know four life measures come you know justification back to the holy ghost in the word the i think for first line justification syndication patch in the holy ghost right then come in the cap oh my what is it that holy ghost bust being honed out right now when we get home we got to be cut defensive great headstone right right we have to be caught people we won't stand and let the world cut us we will never feed it amen so that he can fit with the same kind of ministry that he had when he went away that when he comes back it catches the whole thing in the rapture where they're justified sanctified built in the holy ghost that pyramid will stand again they're going to have that ministry that's what bothers me i don't know about you it bothers me terrible you know we go down away these birds we've got to have our name we have to have a message that gets the people together right but why don't you raise back there brought the bridegroom to the bride i'll tell you she wasn't fit right that's it come on the lady took us right yep hope everybody here sticks to the chest out yeah hmm oh my okay now look they're justified satisfied baptism in the holy ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of god will live again the tree of life is growing again man who's you making this real life right you and me amen exactly right that's only that's the only place there is in the land see there was something there in the garden of eden if he were to stay true and stay with her husband amen come on they would suck them there that's right that would totally stop death right come on come on amen but see god knowing what he wants and how he's going to express himself he'll he he let him do what she's done i'm making him let her do it he knows you do it right hallelujah thank god for the word amen right hey man now are you ready i'm ready amen let me hurry here real real fast i ain't been going with her five minutes look at what he says here this is christ is the mystery gauntlet i've tried to hurt god's great nature has a safety camera to see it nobody knows nothing about it even angels didn't understand it he didn't reveal it that's the reason in our seventh minister when the seventh seal was opened there were sons jesus when he was on earth they would they wouldn't know when he would come even the son himself didn't know when it was going to happen and god had it all to himself it's a secret that's the reason there was silence in heaven for a space of half an hour seven thunders under the voices right john was submitting the right becoming the lord amen amen that's one thing he hasn't revealed yet how he will come when he will come it's a good thing he doesn't know he has shown or revealed in every type that's in the bible exactly every time therefore the entire bible is a revelation of god's mystery in christ he said huh the entire bible is expression of one goal that god had one purpose he wanted to achieve in the entire bible and all the acts of the believers in the bible have been entitled to an expression of what god's great goal is and now in this last day he has revealed it amen come on and shows it and god's help we'll see right here this morning right here right there what god had in his mind all along has expressed it amen exactly look at that people oh man i didn't know that thing i thought i said it hmm i'll just keep up with it too hold on now the new birth is christ he's a revelation right god has revealed to you this great mystery right and that's a new birth right now what are you going to do when you get all that grouped together right when the revelation and that's the only way you know god right amen right there that's the only way approaching that but gary the only way you you know okay bamboo says i can't accept revelations and you can't accept god right god will never get to you the only way god gets to you and me is my revelation all right hallelujah
