========================================

[Music] [Applause] [Music] some things eat all the new in this God change a minute a man and a man good to see about in house the Lord hope you come ready to hear well that's what we gather for a faith comes by hearing hearing by the words for let's just thing open the out of my heart is wait comes to minister the word of the Lord unto us an eye open eyes of my heart eyes of my heart I want to see I want to see you see him I don't believe the world opening eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart [Music] to say hi and lift and shining in the light of your glory pour out your power and love as we say hi day [Applause] shining in OH [Music] holy holy [Music] and I want to understand you that's what that songs about not see physically we will seem physically but we got to understand him first I was we were I was listening to the radio yesterday I believe it was and they were talking about Jesus and even when you hear him talk it's yeah this man was 2000 years ago and yeh saved my soul and and yeah but yeah but he's like he's back there he's not here you know I mean he's he's not they say yeah he's living inside of me but they really don't know how and I written you know then I the scripture came back to my mind that where Jesus said they'll say Jesus Jesus or the Prophet said that won't get anything and then also all of a sudden you read the Bible where it says they'll come and say I've done all these things in your name all these mighty works I did in your name he said depart from me I never knew you I never had an intimate relationship with you that's what you and I are we need to make sure we're having an intimate relationship not just in the cleanness because a lot of people if the foolish virgins going to be in it's just an acquaintance they come to a place that they get acquainted with God people get acquainted with the message but do they ever have it in here from here to here it's got to come from here to here brother Joe's got a chart he pulled up from way back when where it shows memories and conscious affects an imagination where it's got to be connected all through here but it's got to come from the heart comes from the heart then everything is everything working out fine so then we will know it Jesus said this world won't see me anymore but you'll see me in other words you'll know me you'll have an intimate relationship with me but all what a great time but when we get to see him in person we get to see the man all right I'll tell you a little story another thing you wonder how the world is doing I kind of figured out I went to the dentist Tuesday I guess it was and had a root canal of course that takes a couple hours so you're there you know and you know me even with a mouthful of cotton I can't keep my mouth shut so um or they couldn't keep my mouth shut that way me anyway this little girl was sitting there and she's you know talking to me and she says I went and visited this church the other day and she said I don't know if we're going back or not I said why just something there said no their service was two hours long I just looked up at her and I said our services are always two hours long she said two hours long and she just kept on and on and on I said you'll sit and watch she's from the University of Florida bless her heart but she she got a degree there and left so that's a good thing but I said you can sit and watch my did I kind of bait her I said now hey you said watch Florida football on television right yeah I said what I said you sat down watch them for three hours a football game is three hours long you sit there and watch that ball game but you can't set two hours and listening to somebody talk about a man that hung on a cross for at least two and a half to three hours with nails in his hand I was I was probably pretty ill when I got when I left I plot of brotherly kindness wasn't flowing that day so that was really it with the lady I mean her religion tells her she if it's two hours long then it's wrong please people good grief I mean that man died God died on the cross for two and a half hours at least from 3 o'clock to 6 o'clock head nail prints in his hands they strapped him to his guts was almost hanging out they couldn't brother Browne said the hamburger meats what do you look like but we can't set two hours in the service come on people I mean that's but that's what they're doing out there they're feeding them entertainment and now they won't even entertain them for two hours so they're gonna find them another place I said well maybe you'll find a place that serves your coffee and you can set to in less than 15 minutes and go the house I said but I don't know what you gonna get you know during that time some anyway it was just it was a little I didn't like for her to keep on and on about that cuz you know what two hours is not a long time and then I told her I said let me tell you something you know you spoke to tithe and boy when you talk to them people about tithing they're like their eyes roll back in their head I said look if you just tied your time 10% of your time of a week is not even two hours I mean it's longer than two hours but if you just give in two hours you know even giving him 10% of your time I said think about that lady I said you supposed to tithe 10% I said give me 10% of your time you've got 90 percent of their time to do whatever in the world you want to do give him 10% so anyway I don't write alone and all but but that's what they're getting fed out there I mean god bless him I I hate it for him that the band brother branham did he said to pulpits become so weak and that's what they do they get in the pulpit and you know what I think that church was had a to our side or to our service wasn't a message Church but it was some kind of Center Point Church in Gainesville or something something like that but anyway thank God they have it to our service so that's okay with me well okay well her because she kept on and on about it so anyway let's go to Dingle 924 and we'll maybe we'll try not to be here two hours by way of announcement remember Sunday we're going to meet after the first service in my Sunday school class for everyone that has something to do with the fall festival if you want to do something please be there Fall Fest will be October 26 we're starting at one o'clock right like we always do one o'clock until sister's brain dessert and the chili will be provided by the tall guy and his wife over here leaning against the wall and we'll have plenty of food so come hungry also this huge service will be the first Sunday in November and yeah make a lot soon the youth service would be the Bible study part will we're going to start at two o'clock two o'clock we already have many many questions that need to be answered plus we'll be eating but the youth service at two o'clock now remember this is just for the youth okay right and because there'll be questions and answers that

but no participation this is just for the youth set a time for them to be able to talk about the Lord and ask questions so so god bless you I think that's all the announcements Daniel 9 verse 24 let's go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you have given us a desire in our heart to come and sit lord of whatever time we know that many many years ago there was no air conditioned no heat that came in carriages and horses and buggies and people would sit all day and listen to a preacher talk about the Word of God Lord don't let us get so far away from that Lord do we forget that you did truly as a human being you hung on the cross till almost 6 o'clock in the afternoon they put you on that tree and every time your legs would go down you suffocate and you'd have to push yourself back up my water we think we go through a hardship thank you Father for doing that for us thank you Lord that we don't have to climb up on a cross somewhere Lord what you told us to bear cross and that's fine but you never told us we had to get up on the cross because you did that once for all and lord I pray that we'll give you that time that we'll give you that time Lord that that we'll remember if we become weary and our eyes become dim and our and our mind becomes foggy that we'll remember that you hung on a cross with a crown of thorns shoved in your head for me and Lord to give you something a little bit back father let us give you more let us give you our life Lord let us give you everything that we have probably give us this day our daily bread and forgive us of our sins be with us today Lord be the active participant you died so that you could come back and not stay in heaven you came back down here and now you're dwelling in people in a bride in the end time father where everything is coming to a close and now Lord we pray that you just be with us take care of each one Lord hear ones that are sick the ones that are not with us rely on sister Anna call instead they're sick different ones for the deck and all the all the ones Lord that are getting up an aged father age doesn't mean a difference to you Lord just raise them up for your honor and glory father there's touch each one of us now in Jesus name we pray amen Daniel 9:24 seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon the holy city to do six things to finish the transgression to make an end of sins to make reconciliation for iniquity to bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy into and North the most holy now that's all of Daniel seventy weeks all right verse 25 26 and 27 is gonna tell you how it's done know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore him build Jerusalem unto Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore in two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in troublous times and after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself no we were talking about that with the wild olive branch you and I had to be grafted in he was cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city in the sanctuary in the end thereof shall be with the flood and to the end of the war desolations are determined and here we're coming up to where we're going to talk about a little more tonight the six fold purpose part five and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and one week equals what seven years and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determined shall be poured out upon the desolate you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing so the reason in the word we'll just bring the brandy chart back out thank you be and I know maybe you can't see that in the back but they'll zoom in on if you want to look at it online it's getting a little worn because we're touching this in many times but but that one week equals seven years and what we're looking at now is the six fold purpose the six fold purpose is six things that happens in this last week to bring in the millennium is that all right say ma'am what we're going to do tonight is is we're going to talk about this little part called Armageddon because I believe if you'll see that - you'll see also that there has to be one week left after the rapture to fulfill all these things to get it everything into that seven-year period it can't be three and a half years this thing keeps there we go there has to be one year week left or seven years after the rapture of the church which is 1260 days we'll talk about the two prophets and then after the Battle of Armageddon there's got to be some time there and we're gonna read that again - maybe but let's get into this in second Chronicles let's just read this is the history part here in second chronicles we read it we've read it every time but I want you to know that in second chronicles it tells you that what's going to happen therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees who slew their young men with the sword in the house of the sanctuary and had no compassion upon young men of our maiden old man or him that stood for age he gave them all into his hand remember God said I'm going to disperse you because you won't do what I've told you and all the vessels of the house of God because we're talking about the Jews and we're talking about the city there was a temple Solomon's Temple was the glory of the age then in Jerusalem that was the time that that everything was no there was no war everything was fine Solomon had he just married everybody the king's daughter and he just married ever of all the king's daughters and they couldn't go to war with him because it had to be going to war with their own family so he had a thousand wives so somewhere in there had to be some Kings daughters okay so but there was there was a time of wonderful Oh everything was a had gold all over it and silver and and you couldn't even count the gold the Bible said you couldn't even you didn't even know what was what it was worth and then now what's going to happen though between the time of Solomon at the time of all this is going to happen Israel is going to go and play a prostitute we've already read that in the Bible they're going to go out and have other lovers not physical but spiritual they're going to go after other gods they're going to go to may Locke and all those different ones will they throw their kids in the fire and all these things and God told them said stop it through all the prophets stop and stop and stop it they never would stop so he said okay if you won't stop I'll stop you if you won't let your land rest I'm gonna let the land rest I'm gonna let man tear your temple down but I'm gonna build it back up and all the vessels of the house of God great and small in the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king and of his princes all these he brought to babylon so whatever was in jerusalem during that time is gone they just went in and ransacked the whole place and it's just exactly what the same thing titus did cuz they built it all by gutting and titus knocked it down again but we'll get to that later on into the 70 weeks of Daniel and they burnt the house of God and break down the wall of Jerusalem and burn all the palaces there with fire and destroyed all the goodly vessels their own and them that had escaped from the sword carried huee to battle and so in other words whatever didn't die he carried them to Babylon so he dispersed them took them out of their land now remember God will not deal with Israel unless they're in their homeland so he's not going to deal with Israel he never dealt with Israel from the time that that Jesus hung on the cross to the seven churches because right here is the only place he's gonna start dealing back with him right here he's not dealing with him now sure that's going to be saved but that'll be bribed I'm talking about this group of 144,000 that's promised to be raised back up and a city to be built all right and then they had escaped from the stored forgot the water I have to do like Bob we got to have a care for a pacifier y'all ever watch Bob here that he'll go here reaching in here pretty buddy you preach around here put it back never does drink I'll do better let water well they were servants to him and his sons until the reign of the king of Persia because we're going to catch up here in just a few minutes that when we go to this will be later on but when we come into Nehemiah and all those different ones that king of Persia are Cyrus the different once Cyrus is the one that gives them the opportunity to go back and build Jerusalem because nobody wants to place bill back so we'll get into that so fulfilled the word of the Lord by the mouth of jeremiah until the land had enjoyed her Sabbath for as long as she laid desolate she kept Sabbath to fulfil 70 years threescore in ten years they break not that say man alright so now let's go to quote number one we've read this before but we're gonna keep reading it because repetition helps cuz in the six full purpose property God says seventy weeks are determined upon thy people for what purpose for what whose people was it determined to pump Daniels people the Jew so remember remember and remember again the Daniel seventy weeks is talking about two groups Daniels people the Jews and the holy city now that's Bible all right cuz watch Daniels people at you and what was it determined for upon not only Daniel but upon Daniels holy city now class watch Daniels holy city and everybody replies Jerusalem all right so that's the same way with you that's why I'm saying if you if you'll catch this 6-volt purpose you'll see that according to the Bible there has to be one week left after the rapture are seven full years after the rapture because you got a Battle of Armageddon how can you build a temple over here and then you get it destroyed again and then we go into the millennium know can't you can't place it it's just you said well I got close I got the if that quote don't match the Bible is wrong but they're not they're not wrong you're just not reading it right amen you're not seeing understanding Jerusalem so we got the people and the city now Luke number two let's read number two mmm we're gonna get into a little bit of this tonight I was looking at something I hadn't I guess I did see this but I hadn't seen it like said to understand it like I do now about the what brother Brown I'm saying right here now watch these seventy of wheats covers from the going up of the church until the coming back to the church now where did the church go up right here Church goes up the bride goes into rapture right here and she's not seen until revelations 1921 coming back into the Millennium with Christ to go into the Millennium is that right say Amen that's what that says and these seventy weeks of Daniel covers from the going up of the church until the coming back of the church that space is what it covers now watch what he says now not all seventy weeks of Daniel part of it remember we got to build dates and times and all this and messiahs got to be cut off and all that but a six fold purpose is only going to happen right here to finish end and reconcile to bring in everlasting rice and sell vision profit in North emotionally that happens right here but it's all set up over here they have to be dispersed they've been dispersed they have to be dispersed they got to come back they got to build the city they got to build the wall even in troublous times they got to gather back into Jerusalem but what did they do they gathered back in Jerusalem and then the Messiah shows up and they turn him down that's where it says he'll be cut off but not for himself he didn't die for herself he died for me in you but he died for the Jews when they said let his blood be on us in our children that cut that olive tree off he cut those limbs off grafted in the wild olive branch for seven church ages then we're going to take a rapture and then in this time right here that's what I was what we'll get into in just a minute a lot happens in here brother Brian MZ cometh the woman in the Sun the red dragon the vials of plagues the trumpets everything happens right here remember all trumpets sound under the sixth seal who opens the sixth seal to profits okay right then you've got the trumpets the trumpets what then the seventh trumpet is is a watch the kingdom of Sovereign Lord has been coming to Kingdom Zahra Christ and we shall rule and reign so it's over here it's a lot in that it's gonna happen in that last week and we'll set it all up here in just a minute seventy weeks are determined now there was a six fold purpose to his visit telling him what was going to come to pass there was a six fold purpose of his coming let's going down to the very end the seventy weeks are determined upon thy people now remember that is all that the journey of the Israelites will have in this earth they are determined seventy weeks is just determined that's all lauded to the Jews so you and I don't have a time but they have a time it's going to be 1260 days for them to get Redemption that's what's left you and I've had 2,000 years plus or minus because remember revelations 10 says he still don't one for all and one for them since that time shall be no longer but in Daniel it says the same man stood on land and on sea and raised his hands that will be for a time times and a dividing of times so three and a half years they've only got 1260 days them two prophets know when they get a revelation who they are after 1260 days they're gonna die and they know that but you know that doesn't bother them one bit that doesn't bother one back go they keep on right to the very end all right therefore this 70 weeks and I don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews and what's the end of the Jews the end of the 144,000 is right here because remember the Battle of Armageddon there is going to be no Christians on earth amen there's only good there's no Holy Ghost on this whole earth during the Battle of Armageddon zero two witnesses have gone 144,000 are gone we're already in glory now the now the had a senior moment the foolish virgin they're gonna have to give their life they're not bribed there are nine hundred forty-four thousand they got to go through this they got a they got to go through this and die cup of water in my name all those different ones because remember when all this culminates and the 144,000 comes back builds the temple fifth sealed you wherever they're at I don't know I kind of do but I'm not gonna say anything about it but you and I are right here and that's all that's going to be on the earth that we know of that's in the Bible is us 144,000 that sealed you there's not gonna be a foolish virgin running around it's what I'm trying to say it's not going to be a cup of water in my name there's not gonna be any salvation that I know of in this thousand years why everybody cuz everybody's got a dial they can't go up you can't have people in here they're not that go through a millennium they're not saved I don't know it's hard to start to see these things they're for the nth now don't miss it it will reveal from that time to the end of the Jews now look and also the end of Jerusalem until there'll be a new city built end of Jerusalem remember Battle of Armageddon we're going to read it in a minute it's an atomic battle they're going to lay waste to this whole world who's they humans communism Romanism fascism all that brother Brown said collects into that battle in that valley of megiddo for the Battle of Armageddon all right everybody got that say Amen all right so that's what we're heading toward the Battle of Armageddon where everything's wiped off so brother Brown places it the end of Jerusalem Jerusalem is going to be destroyed right here because they're gonna build in a Millennial temple somewhere in here according to Ezekiel 42 44 and then we ride back into the Millennium as the anointing to the temple I mean I'm reading paraphrasing quotes but I read you the quotes last Sunday where brother Branham said that's what it was was us riding back into millennium with Christ according to revelations 1921 to reside in that temple alright everybody got that choice to the end of Jerusalem until there'll be a new city built now how can you build a new city right here if everybody in the message says no there's only three and a half years left after the rapture to finish Daniel seventy weeks that it's not true according to the Bible how can you bring in everlasting righteousness and and do all that over here and then have a battle of Armageddon and you got to build it again I don't understand that but people listen quotes will kill you Jesus stood and said eat my flesh and drink my blood he never explained it one bit we saw where Paul explained at Sunday those of you that were here to take communion we'd fulfill that scripture amen but did we eat his flesh and drink it nope that's a quote brother well you had to get a revelation of the quote right I hope you get it real deep tonight okay all right let's go to revelations 11:1 and there was given me a reed like unto a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not where he's given unto the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months how long is forty two months three and one-half years so what's he talkin about right here all right everybody got that same in I'm grating Bible and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy exactly 42 months 1260 days according to the Jewish calendar Oregon I'm sorry the prophetic calendar of 360 days but that's what they got right there everybody got that now what's gonna happen is is the Jews or the 144,000 let's say Dutch Jews the 144,000 are going to go through justification sanctification in the baptism of the Holy Ghost just like you did to receive the new birth in their soul to make them 144,000 and to Christians but not like I said Sunday now not statue of a perfect man not adoption you can kind of argue a little bit because I don't think the two prophets were the only ones that's going to stand in and and you know be able to speak the word I believe maybe 144,000 may be able to help them a little bit because you know what it's not just one person speaking the word here today it's a many membered body speaking the word all over the all over the world but they're not going to be bribed so they're not required to be up the statue of a perfect man but they are required to realize because it's a revelation to you you can walk around all day like that guys the other day I was telling you about that said he had done it this stuff in in his life and he was fixing to go to court and he went and he's going to go to court and tell him that brother Branham said the real me didn't do it what an idiot I told that brother that told me that I said he needed to get born again because he was using that justification for a crutch he didn't he if you had a true revelation of justification it makes you right down here he don't make you right up here amen it makes you realize and you know you did it because you did it but you realize that God can't see it anymore lopped it off well that's what he's doing right here to finish the transgression make an end of sin and reconcile their iniquity just 144,000 they realize we're not going to go over it much but look they're going to be justified God's going to forgive them of their sins what is that finish the transgression end of sins they know what happened to you listen if you have sinned in your soul today you're not born again it's gonna make an end of sin in their soul and then they're going to be reconciled just like you and I received like we read in Corinthians the Ministry of reconciliation what is the Ministry of reconciliation them two prophets they're going to preach Christ so real until they're gonna say where'd you get those scars they're gonna all realize that that they missed it that Jesus Christ was the Messiah and they totally missed it but that's the same thing this earth is going to go through to when they come to the white throne judgment you know what the people who don't receive eternal life God's gonna say I give you an opportunity you turned me down I could have finished your transgression I could have ended your sin and I could have reconciled you back to me but you wouldn't listen that's why the foolish virgin walks up they get eternal life because they did realize somewhere in their life God was cleaning them up but they never went all the way as brother brown says they never accept it they never got to the new part KND w like Adam knew his wife Eve an intimate relationship they never had an intimate relationship with God but they were sanctified but they never went on to be reconciled to God but now what's going to happen with these four hundred forty four thousand listen God promised he'd save them there's going to be a hundred and forty-four thousand that's going to be saved sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost by two prophets preaching the Word of God and what a powerful message because not just preaching it in the congregation they're going to be preaching it to the world but now the only people going to get it because what's going to happen is the Bible says that if somebody come against them to kill them they would in the same way be killed in other words they come to kill them with whatever a gun or whatever it was the Bible says fire would proceed out of their mouth and in other words they have power to do things but you know what it's getting ready to end the world though they need that powerful message you and I are having a powerful message you and I need to realize that you and I are going to be in speaking terms with God before this right here happens hey man you're gonna be able to call things I believe that if you don't believe that you need to go to the Baptist Church or somewhere else where they just tell you that God died for you stirred well not God but the second God died for your sins 2,000 years ago that's not an intimate relationship but they will have an intimate relationship right here nobody in the world will receive it that's why when they're gone we read it in just a minute what happens because remember there's two battles everybody got that same man there's two battles there's a Battle of Armageddon and there's a battle of Gog and Magog which is way over here after the thousand years two totally separate battles we'll get into it in a minute they asked him that question two totally separate battles one at one end of the thousand years one at the other this one is man is going to do it this one over here God is going to do it because God is going to destroy codes remember look right here battle of Armageddon those people die and they stay in whatever 5th dimension all the way through the thousand years amen right fifth dimension is where the center did go there's a lot of people and pile up in that place during that thousand years and even Satan's bound but he's not destroyed but now the Battle of Gog and Magog over here that's when they're going to be destroyed everything's going to be destroyed over here by God's fire which is the holy fire this will be man's fire a reader where brother Brown says it will be an atomic battle that's why it's gonna take a while so that's why there's still time there's still time in here for this battle of Armageddon not gonna be everybody's dead no there's gonna be people survive why do you think Louise Mad Max yeah everybody saying it the mole movies Mad Max the people that made it through the apocalypse you know and they're all kind of hideous people huh come on you know what that's man's mind trying to feel what God said in the word because remember we're not gonna read it tonight but remember it's the Battle of Armageddon after the draft of the Battle of Armageddon in the Bible it tells you that man would stand on his feet and his skin would fall off of his body and the birds and all would eat his skin while he was alive but what do you think that is that's an atomic battle what happens radiation you they say you just peel the skin off of you if you look at them people in Chernobyl yeah look at that look up Chernobyl in Russia you'll see where they just their meat just falls off their skin well you know what that was under still the grace of God this right here is no grace it's just man pushing buttons let thank God we're gonna be out of here way before that but they're gonna be out of here right at the end of that or right at the beginning of that and then man's gonna just destroy their self let's go to the next one here where we talk about the first three finish the transgression make an end of sins and make reconciliation for iniquity that's one two and three of the six fold purpose everybody got that same man that's one two and three finish the transgression make an interest in reconciliation iniquity that's not for a temple you can't reconcile a temple you can't reconcile a building you can't end the building sins you can't in buildings don't transgress people do so there is Daniels people but now what about the city you got to get Daniel and the holy city if everything is destroyed here there's got to be time for something to be built according to Ezekiel 40 through 44 though the children of Israel or the Jews 144,000 they go three processes completes their birth then we've been pointing to the chart I like these words finish and in reconciliation he's going to finish the transgression make an understanding reconciliation for iniquity that's the same way he brought me in you listen if you got sin in your soul tonight you're not born again period now you can have it in your memories and conscience affection imagination that's where Satan plays and that's where God is trying to trying to have preeminence but if you're born again tonight he has preeminence already in your soul because it's him it's not you anymore it's not I've it living but Christ that liveth in me and the life that I now live I live by the faith of a son of God not looking back to the old things that I used to do same way--with same way with 144,000 of what are they gonna do you read the Bible reread it and i condensed it for tonight but they look back and they go where did you get those scars when I didn't get them right here he got them 2,000 years ago at Calvary these two prophets are not going to go over there and let me be real Stern again they're not going to go over there with tape player and quote books they're gonna preach the Bible to them and the Bible is gonna tell them what they did and then the Bible is gonna they don't don't go over there walk over and say my brother Brown said brother I'm said now I promise you they're gonna tell them about us and the Prophet that came in the end time cuz remember see they're looking for a Elijah remember I preached a long time ago the five cups of Elijah they're looking for they know if Elijah shows up the Messiah's going to show up and when John the Baptist showed up guess what the Messiah showed up when brother Branham come and left who showed up the Messiah showed up but now he's in a mini membered form called the bride but they're going to see that understand that and go we missed that part but one of these two prophets is going to do they're going to say oh but wait this man over here died for your sins this man over here in the New Testament told you this is the New Testament in my blood that I've shed for you this man was hanging on a cross and will tell you in the Bible that this man said Father forgive them for they know not what they do they're gonna realize that then they said the Bible says they're gonna separate and they're gonna mourn and they're gonna wail because why just like you did when you got down on your knees and that's God to forgive you your sins you look back to Calvary and you heard him say Father forgive them for they know not what they do oh this thing gets more alive as you go through it it's gotta be alive the menu first where the whole we're the kingpin that's keeping that from happening the headstones gotta come to get the bride cuz this just not the bride but we got to get out of the way so God can deal with those Jews because you won't deal with us in them at the same time we'll be in glory in a marriage supper while all this is going on the bride's gonna be in the palace and then Jesus is gonna slip down into two prophets and he's gonna reveal all they're gonna say just like they did Joseph all we've seen it there's no oh no Joseph said no wait this all happened to save you remember there was seven years of good seven years of bad and now what did what did y'all do he brought his people in Benjamin he brought him in to save them especially that little Benjamin group which is the top of the 144,000 that all right we're in the Bible okay so now let's read revelations 11 again let's put this together just for a second should be done by 8:30 and that was getting me a reed like him to a rod and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and them that worship them but the court which is without the temple leave out and measure it not for just giving it to the Gentiles and the Holy City shall they tread under foot forty and two months and now give power to my two witnesses they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days twelve hundred and sixty days in sackcloth then I closed inside cloth all right these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man shall hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemies and if any man will hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to shut heaven that it rain not in the days of the prophecy and have power over waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth not just Jerusalem not just Israel proper the whole world is going to hate these people and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will now when's that gonna happen that's gonna happen right here right the 1260 day prophecy the two prophets are on the earth doing what they're told to do according to the Bible and that's what they do they have power to shut up to heaven but now let's not read verse seven yet because verse seven says when they have finished the Beast is going to kill them so let's go to Daniel 9:27 and read right here keep it in the Bible and he I remember who is that he that he cannot be Christ or God or anything to do with Christianity because whoever that he is that person is going to break that covenant and God never breaks a covenant and he who the Antichrist shall confirm the covenant with many in other words he's going to gather them together and see okay you can have all your stuff that all right cuz you know about 80 70 Titus hauled it all the to the Vatican so down under the Vatican they got everything to put the temple back together the Jews know that no they're not stupid they know that so they're gonna make a covenant and bring them together for seven years and in the midst of the week are 1260 days that's kind of the middle he shall cause the sacrifice and oblation to cease and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate now how is he going to make it desolate hee hee the Antichrist is gonna walk into that temple that for three and a half years they've tried to make sacrifices to get to my side there he's gonna walk in and go I'm going worship Me amen that's what he says the Beast and you we the United States of America not us personal but in the United States of America's don't give me power according to Revelation 13 give him power to speak but he's gonna make it desolate why when he walks into that temple a Gentile walks into the temple he's going to desecrate the temple so the Jews are going to be one highly agitated group of people but not 144,000 because they're gonna be standing there going I don't care who walks in this building God's right here he's not standing over there God's right here that's why that's why you look at the Bible and you see the different meanings of the Bible in Matthew 24 when jesus walks up and he gives him all the seals and then he's telling about what the olive tree and all these different things he said if somebody says Christ is here he said don't believe Christ is over there don't believe him what don't you the Pope's gonna know he's gonna think he's God because he's Satan and Cleaves the Incarnate Beast and you know what he'll have some signs he's not gonna walk in there not have nothing no he's gonna walk in there fully loaded and start doing signs and wonders just like them to prophets because there's always two twins there's always twins and every anything you bring in there's always God in the devil but who's gonna prevail now look at right here according to the Bible he prevails for just a little while he the Antichrist because what remember let's continue verse 7 and when they shall have finished their testimony the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit will make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them so he's going to break that 7-year covenant in the midst of the week after this 1260 days because remember he can't touch them too which during that time the Bible says they're going to prophesy 1260 days so they're protected just like we're protected if you'll realize that you won't die that you're protected that you've got an anointing on you different from everybody else they got an anointing on them that they will not die for 1260 days I don't care thanks in the Mossad FBI the CIA the AAA or whatever you want to send over there 1260 days bullets cannot harm them poison cannot harm them guess what when we come to close that body change guess what that's what's gonna happen to us amen brother Brad said they have to crawl up your sleeve when you just brush it right off how many of you have brushed death off today if you got up you did if you got up and walked in this church and you're breathing you destroyed death for a while anyway cuz a some people didn't make it through today some people didn't make it to the day but you did so you just thank God for that and when he had finished their testimony the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them and their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt also where Lord was crucified so where's that at Jerusalem all right and they have the people and kindred and tongue and nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be put in the grave like I said before CNN Fox News NBC CBS ABC Clinton News Network I always said that CNN some got that some didn't yeah but anyway they're gonna be watching they're gonna be look that those people have tormented the whole world now they're dead and they're gonna send gifts to the each other you know what that is that's an old pagan ritual in Rome when they would remember the leaves and all the things that the Romans would wear it's cuz they conquered somebody and they started sending gifts to different ones well that's exactly what's going to happen because what Rome is going to be ruling and they have the people in kindred tongue nations shall see their dead bodies three days and a half see so they'll see it on television or internet whatever and shall not suffer their dead bodies to be putting the grave so anyway these cameras are on these dead guys for three and a half days and in Israel it's really hot all the time so three and a half days they're not gonna look so good because remember Lazarus was dead for days and Mary said what he's thinking so just you understand I'm going to make this as graphic as I can because they're gonna have cameras on these two guys these guys taught me to the whole world they love to see them dead look and they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them and make merry and send gifts one to another because these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth and after three days and a half you know what the people of Earth and the gunner they're gonna think that they prevail and that that little thing they just went through was just nothing but you know like just a little just a little bump in the road Oh buddy way do you li get right here you a little battle Armageddon starts they don't even realize none of that yeah and after three days and a half the spirit of life from God entered into them and they stood upon their feet and great fear fell upon them which saw them and they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them come up hither and they ascended up to heaven in a cloud and their enemies beheld them now many times you have to be careful with that because 144,000 is gonna have to be killed too so they're all going to take a rapture because they're gonna be right there with them two prophets like I said they're only gonna hate two prophets they will hate all them honey the Jews are gonna hate the 144,000 you always get persecuted more from within right the inner circle Judas Esau yeah and you know who tried to kill Hitler his inner circle tried to kill him first so that's the same way with that they're gonna they're gonna all be killed and going to rapture now when they go in the rapture what's gonna happen oh hey it's gonna break loose but now look let's go back just for a second this where I was looking at today if you're looking your Bibles you don't have to look in it now but look at brother Brown stares from revelations for one to revelations 19 the bride seen no more right we go in the rapture for one is what John is caught up through an open door he's caught up brother Brown said that's when the bride goes in the rapture now remember revelations 5 is a scene in heaven a scene revelation 6 now remember the seals open to the Jews because there stands your 60o right there the sixth seal that's not open while we're here in this natural form because these two prophets of the sixth seal we just went through that that ought to be kind of fresh in your mind these two prophets are that sixth seal they are the trumpets all trumpets sound under the six seals of the trumpets so read your Bible look revelation 6 the seals are breaking on earth revelations 7 look at revelation 7 revelation 7 is and after these things I saw four angels standing on the four corners in other words all these things watch verse 4 and I heard the number of them which were sealed and they were sealed 144,000 there's revelation 7 revelations 8 same thing look at revelations 11 revelations 11 swear you two prophets come down revelations 12 watch this revelations 12 is the woman in the Sun the manchild being born and all these different things look at the Archangel chapter 13 what the beef to all is happening right here right here now watch revelations let's go to revelations 14 I'm just speeding through here revelations 14 I looked and lo a lamb stood on the mountains island with him 144,000 that's not us that's them having his father's name written in their foreheads and heard a voice from heaven as the voice of many waters and as the voice of a great Thunder I heard the voice of harpers harping with their hearts and they sang as it were a new song when we can't sing because we sing a bride's own they sing a 144,000 Jews song and they sang as it were a new song before the throne and before the four beasts and the elders and no man could learn that song but the 144,000 which were redeemed from the earth these are which not defiled with women they're virgins there when they which follow the lamb horse whoever he goeth they are redeemed from among men all right there that's chapter 14 now go over to chapter 15 chapter 15 now where does the vials get poured out right here where does the plagues get poured out right here I mean that all right that's that's chapter 16 all right you got the vials on chapter 16 then chapter 17 you've got the seven tombs you've got babbling coming in now watch chapter 17 chapter 17 shows you right where it's going to end up at right here Rome's gonna rule for just a moment when that 1260 days is over Rome is gonna rule for just a moment but it's only gonna be for just a moment therefore shall her plagues come one day death mourning famine she shall utterly burn with fire for strong as the Lord God who judgeth her then it talks about babbling again didn't you go to what revelations 19 so from revelations 4:1 to revelations nineteen goes on right here amen I just read the Bible it goes on right here not right here it's all these other things because you got the battle Armageddon in there you got to I didn't read it all but you got the you got the demons that come out with a long hair and all those different scorpions and all that stuff that's happening all through here battle of armageddon man standing can't die calls for the for the rocks to fall on him and they can't die their skin falls off the birds eat your skin while they're still alive that's right in here but now revelations 19 you don't see any of that all you see is one I read it last Sunday you see the bride coming down to what settle on a earth that's been cleaned off by this battle of Armageddon but during this but during the Battle of Armageddon when everything's being taken care of when that Bible is over God's gonna finish his six fold purpose he's not gonna finish it down here he can't how you gonna bring in everlasting righteousness and take that hideous stuff I just told you and put it right there can't do it you can't seal up the vision and prophecy into people you can't anoint the most holy down here that's us coming into the temple there's not even a temple here now there might be a physical one that man built that the that the Antichrist is going to step into but that ain't God's temple this is eco 42 44 is the dimensions that God told them to be if you'll read it read Ezekiel 43 44 look at the things that happen through the eastern gate and all these different things that are going on they're going to rebuild that temple because it's to Daniel people and the cities got to be built back for millennium to start everybody got that same man I hope you do man because if you don't when we start reading some of these quotes and things and we start getting through danger seven new weeks you gonna say we're just faced final resting place where does it lie in I read you two quotes last night last Sunday face final resting place two prophets it is in the Bible is in the Word of God you take everything back to the Word of God and it will work itself out I promise you it will our profit was not wrong folks I did I'm like brother Dale out stand right here find me some work now listen he said well he said now if he said he was wrong that's different he did stand up one day and said I preached a white horse rider was the holy goat I was totally wrong he said I thought the 144,000 was the bride I thought the fifth cell Jill was the bride that's what he said he said it was way past my but I want you to bring me one quote where he said I was wrong in damn 70 weeks he was not he was not wrong he said it right the first time second time and third time and every time but why do people fall off the message wagon and that's the first thing they bring up Daniel 70 weeks brother Brennan was so wrong in Daniel 70 weeks and Feast of the trumpets he made so many mistakes bla bla bla bla bla that's all I hear is blah blah blah blah but they won't listen to somebody don't put them together and put it with the Bible and the message if you put it with the Bible take the Bible first you don't take the prophets message and make the Bible fit in no God don't share his glory with nobody but if you can take that Bible I'll guarantee you the prophets message will fit right in that Bible every time alright let's look at the Battle of Armageddon just for a second right here real quick Daniel 12 verse 1 in it at that time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people whose died people Israel Jews there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and at that time thy people shall be delivered who the 144,000 are going to be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book now let's go to the 70th week of Daniel Oh 806 1961 I didn't highlight any of these because I want to read through kind of slow we got about 15 minutes all watch these three prophets now he it corrects itself or these two prophets when they raise up here and in the middle of the week they're cut off like that now where is the middle of the week I just read you after 1260 days they're gonna die and then starts the Battle of Armageddon not here right here if I got that either shake your hand they're saying man well I'm shaky as a man okay I'm just I'm reading it's got to fit the Bible that quotes got to fit the Bible and watch and in the middle of the week they're cut off like that and then starts the Battle of Armageddon then God begins to speak himself then he stands and begins to fight that prophets are striking the earth what the stick sale they're preaching the name of Jesus Christ they're baptized in the same way they're doing the same thing that the first Pentecostal fathers did and many are following them but that who's Confederated that organization moved right on down and even the power of those two prophets didn't break it that's what struck me today when I read that quote that power of that Federation denomination whatever you want to call it the Pope that power is so great that kills them two prophets it's stronger than they are watch even the power of those prophets didn't break it because I'm telling you just like this that one heat when when the Antichrist or the Pope walks in right here and walks in that temple and says I'm your God a lot of people believe him because there's going to be two forces fighting each other you've got to have to to have a battle two opposing forces even the power of those prophets didn't break it and finally they said we'll make it all one organization and he brings in what is it the abomination Romanism I just told you brings it in right here Romanism to overspread the whole thing that makes desolation battle Armageddon is going daesil ate the whole world the abomination that maketh desolation takes in everything the filthiness now let's read number two questions and answers and this is 1953 look how the abomination of Daniel when the Great Prince shall come he'll prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days which was three years and six months and that's exactly what Jesus preached so he's taking the three and a half years in Jesus priests he comes to the Jews alone that where is that right here he didn't come he come to the Jews but they reject him cut him off remember right here so watch what he's saying he'll cut him off for a sacrifice of the people and that abomination maketh desolation the Muhammadans set up the mausoleum of omar there which is over there now and they would tread down the walls of Jerusalem - until what the Gentile nation beat this dispensation be fulfilled was that he went - right here alright then watch what he says and then he will return to the Jews again and there's when the Battle of Armageddon takes there he called the Gentiles to take the people out for his name his bride he study goes back to right here cuz remember he don't take a bride out here we're gone so he's God takes that right here you got to learn to place it yes sir the 144,000 are all redeemed Jews just got to stand there yet which is in here alright so now let's go to questions and answers 1954 read seeing all these things they're putting out the materials out there the Jews real rich then that same thing will pollute their camp again yeah they'll come right down the cities of the world Russia will come down we just got to have that stuff that's uranium and everything down there we got to go get it and as they go down then we'll be the Bible of Armageddon that'll be when God will stand like he did in the valley of the children of Israel and fight again but that'll take that in other words that will not take place until the Gentile dispensation will be finished and when that time is finished she's cut off cuz remember there's no Gentile saved after right here no Gentile zero we're gone Gentile Brides out of here he goes to the Jews 144,000 alright so let's go to the next quote now this next quote the house if you'll remember if you've read your Daniel 70 weeks book brother Brown tells you he's leaving that night to drive the Tifton Georgia to preach this message right here so this was preached two days after brother Branham preached the 70th week of Daniel on 8:6 he drives all the way to Tifton Georgia to preach this message but that way he says now the Bible predicts then in the last days he'll he will trap policies and Romanism and all those things and then coming ISM on all them together they're in the valley of Megiddo there till there be such a slaughter amongst them until the blood will flow to the horse's bit horse's bridle see that's in Revelation that'll be in but thanks be to the Heavenly Father I don't think we'll be there by his grace we won't we'll be in glory then look see that will be right after the the two prophets has prophesied in the Battle of Armageddon that's when these Gentile nations get so wicked just keeps on Confederations churches and all this comes together God will take the church the electorate's home out of everyone and all the sleeping virgins will be waiting the Lords of sleeping virgin will still be here now the bridles bit they're come out from the sleeping burdens and all them back in that day and he talks about communism watch number 5 now this is questions and answers 1963 324 go to the next quote number 5 here's the here is the question would you please explain about Satan being bound a thousand years and being loosed for the Battle of battle of Revelation is 20 and 8 and I remember watch what he's saying watch what the person is asking would you please explain about Satan being bound a thousand years and being loosed for the Battle of Revelation 20 that's the Battle of Gog and Magog co-state ins not loosed right here he's loosed over here nobody got that okay give you a little visual because he what he's going to explain you'll understand what relation does that he'll with the Battle of Armageddon as mentioned in the fourth seal see this is right after the seals brew will gog and magog be gather from the people the new earth well this is a long one and I'll just have to hit the spot see now the first thing now maybe I can't explain it I'll do my best would you please explain how Satan spent a thousand years being loosed again for the Battle of Revelation of twenty and eight that is not the Battle of Armageddon the Battle of Armageddon takes place on this side everybody got there and the other one is at the end of the thousand years over here everybody got that that's mentioned in the fourth seal well Gog and make all together from people of the new earth Satan was loosed out of his prison and went to gather all his people the wicked to bring them to this place in God rain fight God rained fire and brimstone out of heaven and they were consumed two bottles all together because remember this is not God's battle this is man's battle they're going to kill each other with atomic weapons this Gog and Magog is God's battle god rained fire and brimstone out of heaven and they were consumed see they're not consumed here they just killed their soul stays in the fifth dimension until the thousand years is over with but now when you come up to the to the white throne judgment there's got to be a battle to destroy those people just what Isis is way I see number six Victory Day 1963 we talked about let's go to paragraph 127 we talked about we've had several years the wars and rumors of wars and V days and V days and V days it'll all finally wind up in the great battle of Armageddon that'll be the last of it when she comes to the Battle of Armageddon that will settle the whole thing just before the great millennium armageddon is to clean off the earth shiri purifies herself with this atomic blowing atomic and the volcanic ash and things sink this soak blood of men and upon the earth and sin and crime she sinks beneath the earth and the volcanic Bray's out again and renews and cleans the earth for the great millennium he cleans his church during that time for people to live here a man I like that yes sir there's coming a time when it would be great everybody got that same in all right here's the last one this one is where brother Brown puts a lot together we're going to read it anyway number seven questions and answers 1964 the church age ending and has blacked out the bride is called and we have already entered into the Tribulation Period now there's people still believe that they believe people believe we're in the Millennium you know how I tell it you know how I tell them take them to the zoo because the lines posted lay down with the lamb take them to the zoo and throw them over in the Lion pit we'll see if we're in the Millennium or not actually they will see further in the millennium or not but how foolish somebody taught that and this person right here asked the question he thinks we're already entered in the Tribulation Period that's a question this is question number 392 and questions and answers somebody asked that question brother Brown said no no no you're I wish that I could have more time on that see the bride when she's taken from the church then the church age will cease right here right Laodicea goes into chaos what the the foolish version and all the ones that don't have to die during this part of the tribulation the bride goes to glory and the Tribulation Period sets in upon the sleeping virgin for three and a half years while Israel is getting its prophecy then tribulation sets upon Israel and then comes about that's that little part right in here then comes the Battle of Armageddon which destroys all things and then the bride returns back with a groom right here what revelations 19 for a thousand years the millennial reign then he finishes up after that comes the white throne after that comes new heaven and new earth and a new city coming down from heaven God out of heaven eternity in time blends together but we haven't finished we got to bring in everlasting righteousness sillas vision profiting on photo ain't done it yet bring it up you got three more to finish up we didn't finish him over here this right here's gets us into the Millennium because listen folks you whatever you think about we don't build temples we're the bride but according to Ezekiel 42 44 there's got to be a millennial temple built our brother Graham says instructed he means put together instructed somewhere in here for us to ride back to go walk into it not sit there watching build it amen so how can that happen right here according to what everybody in the message says it's only three and a half yet years to finish Daniel seventy weeks they can't be according to the Bible there's seven years 1260 over here you got the Battle of Armageddon how can you bring in everlasting righteousness and then have a battle of Armageddon I just read you what happened in the Battle of Armageddon everything is destroyed man destroys their self and everything else and then when all that dies off there's 144,000 somewhere got to come back in here and start building the temple to bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy where is it sealed up you say well it's sealed in me sure the Gentile part but they're sealing up parts then 144,000 that vision is sealed up of Ezekiel 43 44 I don't think they're gonna have to come back and go all right find me a Bible no they're gonna come back and no because they're Jews they study this thing don't you think they study that Old Testament they know it better than you know the New Testament so they know all the dimensions and they're going to come back and even the Bible says they'll build houses they'll build houses and they'll then have it ain't got time to get into that cuz we're about doing they will have vineyards and someone else won't take over you know what they're saying brother Dale's daddy built a house and then he died and one day he had to give it to him and then one day then generation no Bible says they'll build a house and they'll in heaven they'll plant vineyards and you'll get the vineyard it's not passed on down you got it they'll build their own thing but you and I according to Ezekiel 42 44 you and I are going to be the anointing to that temple according to what I read you last Sunday is the anointing to the temple will be the bridegroom and the bride and the 144,000 is going to be there he's going to be the son of David sitting on a throne ruling the twelve tribes of Israel he's not ruling over us he's our husband we're on a honeymoon we're not going to be toiling and and all these things we're just gonna be there but they got a lot to do you know why they got a lot to do because they turn crops down over here but now remember before we close right here remember one thing don't look down on these guys because their daddy literally walked over there at Calvary I put his hand over their eyes and he said I'll deal with you after a while but I got to get me a Gentile bride cuz they're gonna they're gonna fall in love with me and I'm gonna marry them but I'm not gonna forget you now I'm the one that blinded you NIF God willfully blind somebody he can't kill him that's what remember the fifth seal Jew was the same way he literally blinded him well he literally blinded him for 2,000 years he blinded them but when we leave the hands lift it off but only 144,000 are gonna see it and then when all that's over in the Battle of Armageddon then folks we bring in everlasting righteousness why they come back here to the earth like brother mom said right here the Battle of Armageddon which destroys all things everything is destroyed but now remember that thousand years is of is still in time we're still in time here let's read something real quick I didn't I read it last Sunday let's read again this Sunday let's go to Daniel they don't have it on there but they can pull it up if they want to if you keep reading in Daniel says go that way Daniel chapter 12 verse 9 go that way Daniel for the words are closed up and sealed till the time of the end meaning she'll be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise but the wise shall understand ok verse 11 and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up when is that I just told you incarnate Satan comes in the Beast we're Pope whatever you want come he walks in and desecrates the temple they can do no more sacrifices that's what makes them mad they that whole temple that they built took them all this time to build it one man walks in and just desecrates the whole temple and from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination of watch that make it desolate set up there shall be a thousand two hundred ninety days that's only 1260 1290 puts you on out here but we're not done with that blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the 1330 fifth day that's going on over here a little bit father we're over in the Millennium now blessed is he that makes it to that who's gonna make it 144,000 they're gonna make it cuz they got to come back here to build that temple but for you and I it doesn't matter if we come back right here right here right here but we definitely coming back right here according to what the Bible says we can walk right into the Battle of Armageddon and stand there and watch the whole thing be obliterated and it's not gonna bother you you in a glorified body so what does it matter and that's one of the main questions we'll close right here musicians come everybody says well well brother Ram says we're in the wedding supper for three and a half years and what are we gonna do during this time of face three and a half years left you made a bad point you said time I thought time is no longer for us right here so what does it matter and I want you to show me in the Bible we're worried a wedding supper for three and a half years there is no scripture that says we're at a wedding supper for three and a half years nowhere in the Bible nowhere but think we got to thank God we had a prophet that connected that with that because remember we're in the palace but then Joseph comes back down here to reveal itself to them it does not matter you what does it matter what we're doing we're in eternity with the wedding supper he's gonna be going on while God reveals itself to the Jews and when he finishes revealing himself to the Jews they're going somewhere brotherly because they're not gonna go through this battle of Armageddon God's gonna take them out of here take them in a rapture just like I said and then them 144,000 they've got to come back somewhere in here and build that temple back that's Bible let's stand our feet that's the Bible and that's your whole six fold purpose so Daniel seven two weeks cannot end right here it has the end right in here because there's one week left why do you think brother Bram preached he didn't preach the 70 weeks of Daniel on that third sermon he preached the 70th week not the half week you said better I got a quote it's got a match the Bible but don't match the Bible you got to go back read it again if you don't see Christ in every verse go back and read it again but it's God revealing himself but also hiding himself in total simplicity let's sing a song god bless your heart and for faith to increases yes sir [Music] [Applause] [Applause] you maybe blares and [Music] printer cloth the key with them and we need to keep him in prayer because of all this congestion and junk they're going through it really is taxing on their body pray for your pastor thank you lord you know there's many things that we go through in life but just like that 144,000 there's a lot they're gonna have to go through but going through it it's part of it for us to come out on the other side and be victorious that's the connection that prayer cloth is your connection to God don't have to pray Bible didn't say acts 19 he didn't say to pray he said they just gave the cloth to the people and they took them with them his body Lord and he stood for you all these years Lord I pray that you'll stand for him now and I give you Lord this petition that he has for this ear Lord that he can't hear out of Lord and the rest of his body that you'll just touch him father and bless him Lord and maid tonight when he is saying his prayers tonight before he lays down Lord to take a little nap father that this thing will be taken care of by the time he wakes up in the morning father we pray that this will happen in Jesus name Amen believe it yes ma'am [Music] [Applause] [Music] when the doctor calls it it's just a diagnosis that they look in a book and see that the things are happening in her body but lord we look to you father we look in your book the Great Physician book that says by your stripes our sister is heals father we pray Lord that you'll manifest that Lord by the time she gets home today she will see a difference Lord and it from now on Lord she'll give you and I know she will give you the praise and honor and glory for all these things father we ask it in Jesus name Amen you should do believe in that same God same God same God I'm not changed he never changes yes sir we just gotta be believers believe that God's done it symptoms remember what I always say a testimony has to have a test first TST then the testimony happens after the test code we all want to give a testimony having God did all these great things for life and he's touched us and healed us and kept us safe things that go for it and by end all right you believe it man you know what that is you just put that over put one in her backpack put one she plays this big old Trump alert base thing I said put one on in they've gotta help you play better hey man have you play your notes better kids brother Brown tells many times remember he prayed with sarin and Rebecca and all them about tests and then the neighbors kids would come over and he'd pray for them about their death you need to be the same thing let's the brothers and sisters if we don't pray who's going to who's gonna pray we know the prayer faith will save the sick we've seen it happen we've seen it happen put him in ok you heard that they're gonna take a hundred safety course testing and remember that in prayer amen amen let me read what it says and God wrote special miracles by the hand upon so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons and the diseases departed from them now to me them means about anything is breathing puppies included and the diseases the party from them and the evil spirits one out of them that said didn't say pray just said they just gave them to him they just passed them out they passed them out well I've still got the ones that that brother Branham prayed over when when we had that meeting in 2006 I think it was Perry Green brought us these big old bolts of them said he drove up to brother Browns house there in Arizona and he just he said everything I could find hey I think he said to win him a seat on his bed after he got done he just piled them all in his truck and brother burned him just laid over the top of them and prayed and he handed us bolts of them and I still got a few right here you're not getting them but if you really need one but you know what same God same God same God anointed this the same God has anointed these hey man that God didn't live in 1965 he just got better and better he went into a mini membered body god bless you let's bow our heads all minds clear oh yeah man brother Terrence the Deacons need any brother Bob and dad needs a meet for about ten minutes after the service is over in the office the Heavenly Father we pray this you had bless us tonight I believe you came among us Lord and and ministered to hearts and settled some questions settled the minds of the people Satan would have nothing more than to disrupt all of our life and all of our Satan as a prophet of God and I see it more every day Satan hates revelation he hates it more than anything it's for somebody to get a revelation from God and that's alright that's okay because we live and feed and breathe on Revelation we need a revelation more than anything the prophet of God told us so Lord we need for you to reveal yourself to us father give us this day truly our daily bread bless the ones that are sick not with us the ones that came up Lord we pray that all things will work together to good to them that love the Lord who are they called and I believe we are Lord you call them we answered and father you been answering back through the message of the hour now for years for many and and years and years and years for many father it's been long journey but father this is not a sprint it's a marathon it's a long race Lord but you know what it's about to be over and we're going home we're going to enjoy a wedding supper forever how long the time it doesn't matter in another dimension while you do and finish the Book of Revelations with the Jews and then we walk right back in revelations 19 and fulfill the rest of it Satan's bound a thousand years we'll have no tempter then when Jesus shall return to this earth again please don't go return alone father you're gonna return with the bride and we're gonna be able to live and rule and reign their Lord with you for a thousand years Lord give us strength be with us for the rest of this week be with us this weekend coming up father and all the things that we
