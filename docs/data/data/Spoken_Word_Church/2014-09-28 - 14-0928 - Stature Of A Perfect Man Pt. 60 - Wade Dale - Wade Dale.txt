========================================

now he wasn't a man after God's gonna wait because my ways are not your ways and he did all that with Bathsheba but that's because Holy Ghost and his soul to keep him from doing it uh you know brother random thing right and that's what he did he just really he sought repentance he saw Esau wasn't quick enough you know because remember he saw salt repentance but he didn't seek repentance till later on he didn't seek repentance quickly because the Bible even says he saw saw repentance with tears and God didn't hear him because you know why God knew he wasn't serious about it he knows whether you're serious or not I mean you know you you repent and all that and if you're not serious God knows that God knows it and somewhere it'll all come up sometimes um we repent too I mean I mean all right when it's good for us to repent not because it's the right thing to do right well most people repent because they get caught yeah yeah I really honestly you repent because you get caught you know so or like you need God you know and you're desperate that's why David says I seek Him daily so see David there was not I don't believe sure David handed up now but I believe David went by the precepts he went by the Commandments he went by what the priest said you know he had his he had his Earthly problems in his flesh but but as far as as being a man after God's Own Heart he did just like I said that right there I have done thy precept well now if he hadn't been doing it he'd been lying and it would have been in the Bible you understand what I'm saying it wouldn't have been written in the Bible if it would have been a lie so God knew that David kept those precepts every day of his life still living in human life and all that but he knew that if David had a new birth like we do that it would have kept him from doing a lot of those things but of course you know it hadn't been given at that time so I'm sorry we don't have technology today to put anything on the board iPad become a i flop for a mo just for a moment momentarily momentarily charges that no no they got they had a new operating system which I loaded a couple of days ago and it had so many boo-boos in it they came out with 8.2 or 02 and they're loading it now because it something's not right because I'm not working I'm not working and it's not operator error no I'm just done not this time I leave the door open those of you that clapped you can leave now but amen Francine Reed with us today are you drove a long way to get here today so good to have good to have them with us today you'll be blessed by brother Keith I'm sure if he just read the scripture go home it'll be a good it'll be a good day so but what we're what we were talking about what we were going to talk about was we're running around comes to this part right here where he says we've come up this bar and now the holy spirit's going to seal this in it's not a different Holy Ghost like we're talking about remember last Sunday it's not a different Holy Ghost it's the same Holy Ghost but there the degrees are with you and me and you know I may have I may have stated that wrong the Holy Ghost doesn't have degrees only goes to the Eternal it has everything you need we are the ones that give it the degrees right do you understand what I'm saying yeah because remember brother that's all you it's if that's all you can believe that's all you're going to get now the holy ghost that you've got is full of this right here right right the Holy Ghost is full of divine love you don't get the new birth down here and don't get Divine love no you get the you get the headstone but what we have to do as humans we have to process it here right right then it has to drop down here our problem is that we see in a lot of the ministry is honestly they get it here they can read a quote they can take a scripture and like mama said they can just make a good dissertation just like a college professor they can put information together and then they can speak that information and you know you with the Holy Ghost though it can Quicken but they can be standing In a Pulpit and not have one lick of the Holy Ghost that's the anointed ones at the end time because they're Anointed with the true Holy Ghost but they have nothing in their soul but God can anoint them like Caiaphas Caiaphas listen kindness until Jesus came Caiaphas was the man right right catfish was the high priest gone when he went back one year for the sins of the whole of Israel when he went back and put that blood on the altar God accepted that but he knew down inside countless was going to turn him down he knew that were the foundation of the world right I've always wondered and I looked in the end time but you look at Balaam Balaam could get an audience with God he knew how to approach God but that man was evil yeah and it's all he was evil because what he done was he wanted to destroy Israel but he said I can't speak except what God tells me so he honored the gift but remember Satan came in and give him an idea to go around that gift right right and say oh let's just get them to marry among each other and then you'll have your purpose fulfilled whether you think it's got to come right here we're just going to go around it now once the devil always done right God put Adam and Eve in the garden to fulfill this purpose Satan just goes right around Dog's Purpose comes right up here and starts in Eve right but now God's purpose remember will never fail right because when God purposes something it's going to happen so it didn't it didn't disrupt God's plan in the garden being they don't didn't disrupt God's plan but Balaam did destroy a nation he did remember when Israel went whoring with other women and other gods God divorced them he turned them away so he destroyed a whole Kingdom of Israel by what he'd done but Balaam could get an audience with God Balaam knew how to put the quotes together let me put it that way Balaam knew how to put the clothes together knew how to put the scriptures together because remember seven Bulls seven seven rounds yeah see he knew that you had to put this quote with this quote this quote with this quote hello somebody exactly right right he knew how to put all that together and you know what God comes down right and says what do you need he said I want to curse Israel he said you can't do that and you know what they don't goes back to balance and says I can't curse them but in balaam's mind he was thinking how can I get by this because remember brother random city was a hireling prophet he wanted that money he won money remember money women in popularity is the three things that will get you if you standing in any position so you be careful with it and um so Balaam wanted the money part so he just kept going and you know he he kept even pressing God and God said no no the German yeah and God honors respect that's right at that point when they wanted something even a sinner no no and the knew how to respect God for what he said sure that's what he was talking about I was trying to find the word but it was respect because your parents had respect and God so God you know he has respect back to you just like with David David had respect for what word he had right but we have to watch that in the end time because without these virtues without these virtues we are deceived one more time without these virtues working in your life there is deception you say you can be deceived yeah I will to be so close the Bible said it'd be so close till it would try to deceive the very left when I see the very last it's right here so there's a dissection that comes but the Holy Ghost should raise up and say no that's not right right no that's not you know the Holy Ghost should come up and say no that's not right now you not be might not be able to do like me now I can come up and explain that error you understand I can explain that error brother Dale can explain that error that comes forth right but you may have a question in your mind you may even be deceived yourself for a moment of time but I've said in many services we're a Manny Services sorry to say message Services is that when a preacher would say something there'd be something in me go and it would just be a click it'd be just like it was an uncertain sound that's right see you're sitting there dinging now a preacher can preach two hours and be right for an hour and 55 minutes right and preach five minutes of error and brother Brown said it's all wrong right one word off so that's why we have to be careful as preachers we have to we have to not just put quotes together and just put scripture together we have to see what the spirit says and I'm getting somewhere with this it's not it's not because of recent event but it is part of it but right here this right here this is where the Bell Rings the loudest you understand what I'm saying you'll get a little knock from God you'll get a little but when those disciples came to a place to brother Brown said just one little nod from God and they'd go do it one little just a little nod from God they go good see that's why we all have to be led that way they all have to be led by the Lord that if something does you know we were sitting in a meeting one time there was 600 people there and a preacher was preaching away and he made just a you know uh talk about Jesus wanting God and all these things you know and they all all of them get up and shout except me Jim daddy Mama Richard Wilson sister Wilson a couple others we sat there because we didn't agree with it I'm not going to agree with something I don't agree with him and when I think it didn't just stunt me itched Like a Knife stuck in my heart I'm like no wait a minute see they said uncertain sound you hear that and you go okay everything's fine like you're going down a road driving a car and not all eight cylinders are going like this and all of a sudden your cargo boom you go okay what's wrong yeah there's a problem somewhere right so you go back into your memory reason conscious reflection imagination which is where these were remember she taste still smelling here doesn't have anything to do with it that's right she taste spill smelling here is given to everybody to contact the world but now remember they can be deceiving right magicians can prove that magicians can do things to make your your site see something you don't want to see or not see something you do see because the hand's quicker than the eye but the but when you get into memory reading conscious face and Imagination this is where you have to bring it into control in the spirit Realm because remember excuse me if you're born again there's only one sense in your soul right right that's Faith it's not faith and doubt right right that's right that's too Soul right it's not Faith or doubt you're either black or why right right but now what happened with the old Indian was what happened with the old Indian the old Indian the black dog was driven out of the soul but he was still in the spirit because we still that's where we have our problems the problem is the word of God is getting us to because remember the first round see taste still smelling here is everybody Center Saint whoever doesn't matter all right but memory reason conscious affection and Imagination that's where the devil plays and that's where God uses the same thing because God has has to use my memory to bring this back to you right but Satan will bring something to my memory that I did 30 years ago and I'm like where'd that come from well I know where it come from it come from that Fallen condition of Adam the adamic nature is done away with an assault so it's not faith and doubt so faith is in there and doubts cast out but I like what um brother Michael team said no remember Ryan you got next Sunday right okay Coach brother Bob and I'll be in uh that brother um Matthew I want to call him Mike Matthew Brady but remember when you come to a point in the gospel where there's questions I hope this helps you with that you've got a question in your mind the best thing to do is it's not over not overdo it no you know don't press don't press into anything just kind of brother Brown said one time he said just kind of lay it on shelf right so brother Mike holty he had a good example he said if your soul is eternal idiot your soul is easy to turn if you're born again this morning Eternal as God is you have the potential of all this actually you have this but remember what the scripture just said it's in a baby form it's the it's the it's the it's down here at the at the bottom at the Cornerstone the foundation stuff it's got to be built up this is not a statue this is that your hype development that jury is growth up to here all right Robert he said look he said still he said if you're Eternal in your soul now that doesn't ever disagree with the word that's right it can that's right because it is the perfect word but now we have questions in our spirit realm and that Spirit lays so close to that Soul because you can't separate them you know brother Brown drew the circles that's okay that's for reference points just like this is forever but it's not that there's not you fill up with virtue like a tank of gas you fill up with virtue and then you stop and you fill up with knowledge and you stop no it's all intertwined right but your spirit is laying so close to your soul that Spirit still has that Holy damn it nature and I love what he says he said because once you hear has to go through that filter first right right it goes through the spirit realm first that's right goes down into the soul right the soul gives it a positive or negative that's right agree or disagree and when it comes back out if you're not trained right that's right have the virtues working in your life because remember without the purchase then it's a stumbling block to the unbeliever but it's also satanic if you can't handle them what happens is is that that Point comes back out because remember it's got to come out of the heart proceed of all things out of the heart which is not this it's the heart of you when it comes back out to that filter of memory reason conscious faction imagination the devil's sitting there and he starts plugging those fluids up right yeah well he might be right if or this might remember when we all go through it I've just never heard it explain that well because really your spirit does lay so close to your soul you can't separate them you know there's not a circle inside you that's just got your soul and a circle that's just got your spirit no it's all intertwined take the soul out of a person you die close the spirit goes back to God what's the Bible said all right so that sometimes we have to take in the spirit realm this is where these come in into effect because they're already in your soul but it's that it's that part that comes back out that's trying to get out and manifest itself definitely understand what I'm saying it's the part that gets out like when you get a revelation a water baptism that's wonderful but what you got to do is you got to let that come back out not so that you can explain it to others but so that that can live yeah that's right see God doesn't want us just to pack it in our soul and not live it out that's right we need to live it out and to live it out is this this is life like he said one time and I really appreciate what he said he said these are the trials of life these are the trials of Life the these are the things that I deal with every day of my life you should too that's right you should be so conscious that you are virtuous enough that somebody wants to come to you for prayer or come to you to ask you a question or one more and then you gotta have it to give it out but now a lot of times though we sit upstairs or we sit somewhere and we have to filter things that comes down through here down into here I mean it really adhere to here then down to here then when you got that Soul which says yeah that's right well wait a minute you still got that contact coming out of those final senses memory reason I want you to look those up sometimes and read about them you just in a common world just just what the world says about memory reason cons inspection imagination because remember that affection is not affection for God totally remember that's feel your love adopted love is what's in your soul which means that it's not exactly what this is right brother Brown said this is love for your family for your children for your wife This Is The Love for God right right because remember brother round says he said it comes from agape love to feel your love to lust to fornication you know just it keeps getting worse it goes all the way down you see you got to filter all that other out brother Brown priest thinking man's filter right he didn't talk about stopping the flu though we'll watch the flu stopped up and your flu is not stopped up in your soul right I see the Cardinal as God is that is though that is the Genesis 1 26 man that's the one that's preserved before the foundation of the world that's the one that never sinned today in its life right he never had a problem with the word it's just when you bring it down through those filters of memory reason conspection and Imagination where the devil is standing there waiting on it to come right right you ought to all agree with this because it's all happening in your life that's where the devil plays is the memory reason because remember CJ still smelling here it's just how this reacts to that amen this should you know take the Soul and Spirit out and this thing lays there and you can't accuse it of nothing you can't accuse it a dead man of wine that's right he's dead when you say when it comes back out or are you talking about like all the action to it well or like more like your revelation of because what happens is let me give you an example here's a perfect example when I was 14 years old you know we were we come up in a message 1968 well in 1974 I was 14 years old well I started really studying the word of God and I started studying the message of the hour well I had a real good understanding of water baptism I had a real good understanding of serpent seed I knew there was only one God but now I wasn't born again I know that because 20 years Gap in there proved that I wasn't but I had got enough of it in me to where when I did get born again God quickened it real fast I went through justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost in a very short time I was almost like a disciples and I don't make myself nowhere close to disciple but remember the disciples for three and a half years Jesus sat there and preached to him every day so brother Brown said what happened in the day of Pentecost all that they had taken in was quicker so they went right up to here because they all that came back to their memory what Jesus had been telling them remember they didn't understand it before but now on the day of Pentecost Peter's the first one that stood up and he didn't stand up and say men and Brethren repent and be baptized in the name and follow us on hold though just like Jesus said no he gave him the true Revelation that what Jesus had in his mind yeah he gave him that true Revelation on the day of Pentecost but now remember like I said I could have that in my heart I mean in my spirit but that wasn't in my soul my soul still was doubt that is true okay that Soul was not born again so I had it in my spirit because what I could remember right I could reason I had conscious that brother right on was a prophet the devil knows that all those five senses I had those senses of that word coming this far but not here this is the salt it comes this box but now remember when I was born again all that I had here was quick and coming back out and it wasn't to quit it was sure it was to quit smoking drinking and all that stuff but it was that I could take now serpent seed and not just say well it was Eve having sex in the garden with the beef no I can see serpent seeds still affecting us today and see the Revelation that brother Branham preached well see that to me that's the new birth the new birth shows you it never stops unfolding it never stops revealing one God it never stops revealing water baptism it never stops revealing the son of man it never stops revealing things when that thing comes down in that soul and that soul is nothing but God it's got to come out but he's got to go back through them same flus that it came down through everybody understand that it's the same the same word comes in but when it quickens in your heart it's going to have a different reaction when it comes out now if you allow it you say well I I don't think I can have temperance then you won't so you'll stop that flu up God can't work anymore above that right God can't work any more about that but now you come up here and you say well now I got Temperance I'm getting patience I'm getting God I'm getting brotherly kindness then this comes not as another remember there's many refillings there's one baptism that's when God burns the old you out burns the nature of you away and doesn't put another soul in he brings his soul yeah it's not the two Soul people is like you know he kills one and he brings you another one no it's you you're you until the day you die the day you were born you got the same soul in essence you have the same life amen but God Burns that old nature off just let you say well how do you how can you explain that brother Brown said in future home that God does the world the same way he does us so what did he is he going to destroy this world now we believe before see there we go through our filter We Believe before with our eyes reading the Bible that this world was going to be annihilated and we were going to heaven right most denominations believe that you're this is going to be done away with annihilated Bible theft and we're going to go to heaven we'll see when brother Brown preaches a future home he says now that word's not exactly what it seems to be he said God's just going to burn the sin off of this world right and we're going to come live on the earth amen now what same way with the stole a man if the Earth is the center of the universe then you're the center of God Center if you have a new birth you're the center of God well now he's not going to kill that he's not going to kill your soul he's going to burn off that old adamic nature that when you were born that adamic nature attached itself to you and you did wrong right brother Brown I got a quote uh he pulled it up he says Adam Even Adam Adam's Soul was covered with Blackness when he did what he did now he was the son of God so see we can still have trouble and trials and tribulations but it's not in the soul that's right it's in that Spirit realm that's where the devil can play but the Earth is just like us remember we go before the Earth the whole world is groaning and waiting Romans 8 waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God in other words when we come to hear so it's waiting on God to burn off us yes first because see Adam fell and everything fell under him so now we got to start and go back up remember Redemption is not replacement whatever fails got to come back so when Adam fell all nature the Earth fell with it right so now what's going to happen this has got to come back to full manifestation shown in a prophet a little while with the with the squirrels and with Hattie riding with the storms different things there was God or the or the second Adam back in power again everybody got that but remember he was here he wasn't groveling around on the ground crying down here no he was up here at full manifested Son of God yes that's the way I believe it on Sunset Mountain brother Brandon was adopted that's right just like the Lord Jesus the Lord Jesus didn't need to be adopted but he went through the act of adoption right everybody understand that amen so brother Brown went out there when those angels came down and said go back to Jeffersonville dog was saying this is my beloved Son hear ye him right and he could bring us then see somebody had to come to that Jesus had to come to it Jesus was it but he grew in Grace and knowledge that's what we said before but somebody hadn't come to it any end time to draw the rest of us up okay so he's give us the full message of the hour to draw us up so here we are we got to come to here not here we gotta come to here but this is not a this is a refilling this is a more of this is a this is a I now have my memory reason conscious faction imagination under control you're not gonna ever do away with him he's going to be under control right right because you're always going to have a memory you're going to have memory right up to the chain right and even when you get over and changed Bible even says the form of things will be passed away God's going to have the Wi-Fi memory bank out of the bad things I believe we'll remember the good things but all the bad things all the horrors that we went through will never remember that again former things will be passed away all things will be made new okay and we thank God for that what he's going to do for us but seeing your soul that soul never did it to start with that's what brother man could say your soul you the real you never did it in the first place that real one that came from God see brother Brown said God comes down here you are remember the the Bible says that the house is sweating garnished what cleans the sand out but that's just justification the sanctification because if you don't fill it with God that unclean spirit is going to come back and go right back where he was before make you seven or eight times the center that's right religious but if God feels that the good man of the house is in there and nobody can come back nobody can come back in that soul but that doesn't mean they can't come into that Fairgrounds he's going to come back into that Spirit realm and he's going to try to figure out a way to get back into your soul because the same can get in your soul he got you all right that's right but you take that memory region conscious affection and you got your soul as Eternal as God is it never did Sin so what you got to do is you've got to believe this is where our believing's got to come from that's why I think this is so important we've got to believe that when we come to this spot right here it's not that we're not going to have any trouble it's not that we're not going to have any trials no we're gonna have memory like I said right after the change of the body you're gonna remember the bad things you did because the devil's going to be right there brother around right before the chains he said you're gonna throw it's always not my thought was one time is well it's going to get better as we get closer now Jesus didn't get better as he got closer that's right he got worse right the hour not he didn't get worse the things that were upon him got worse he died on a cross he was beat like hamburger meat you know I mean that was his crowning moment right so our crowning moment's not going to be that we're going to walk around here with sinless perfection because we're always going to have memories and conservation imagination and Satan's always going to be able to at least come into that part but when God comes in down the statue of perfect man brother Brown said God comes down and vulcanizes remember he talks about the rubber he only talks about Vulcanizing one time God comes in and brings his soul that Genesis 1 26 man that's right that's what he brings he brings that Genesis 126 man that Eternal not you as a separate person that's right but it's God and brother Brown said this is my eye God gave it to me so now I can say this is my Holy Ghost God gave it to me it's not God's anymore it's mine but it is God that's right that's right it's not God's giving me something it is God coming that's right it's God coming and putting his soul brother Ram said soul to soul see that's where he brings man back then what we have to do though is work our way out about this right here this is the only way we're going to get it it's the only way we're going to keep it kept keep it under um surveillance not gonna be able to do away with it but you're going to be able to survey what happens make a Choice a decision or a judgment by what's in here versus what's out here so we need to go yes ma'am oh yeah the mind is where the memories of conservation of imagination everything all five senses go through the brain memory do your brain reasoning do your brain conscience is in your brain prevention is in your brain first then imagination is always in your brain
