appreciate hebrews 6 and john 14. our precious lord and our savior our redeemer are all in all and jesus is your name thank you for the revelation of that name thank you for lord revealing yourself unto us because without you lord there would be nothing in us anyway we give all the honor the glory that all and all is to you truly you are our god and our savior and lord we do want to see you if moses could have thought in just a human mind without the new birth that he could think about wanting to see you how much more is it that your children want to see their father lord just come and manifest yourself among us and today through the word as we preach and heal the sick and lift up each and every one of us we love you and we thank you you've promised it so we believe you said you'd send your word and heal us so we believe you and lord just come on the sin now and have your way in jesus name amen hebrews 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on unto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on of hands and of resurrection of the dead under eternal judgment and this will we do if god permit all right as i said this morning ended the services up i believe that god has permitted you and i the opening of the word or the word to be delivered into our hands by the prophet messenger and the holy spirit is here to quicken that word to make it alive in our hearts and line all right and we'll go to john 14 and we'll read verse 11 and 12. believe me that i am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake see they wouldn't didn't want to believe him but he said now listen you just check it out what's going on you know verily verily i say unto you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do i don't know but look at the last part of that how is it that anyone could ever do any greater works than what he would do would have to be connected with the life's part right what is it now then and greater works than these shall he do because i go unto my father you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i hope we can get through pretty fast this afternoon i have to do just some major reading and you know to get to a place but now we've been talking for a while about going on to perfection or going on to completion or finishing you know going on and not being satisfied with uh where we are but to always be constantly climbing to greater height and better understanding where would the world be if it had not went on in the natural understanding you know um i'm 70 years old but at the age of seven i was plowing a mule all day long in the field because we had to do that to make a living thank god that we have went on i remember the old truck that we had along about that time for some reason they had overloaded it and the uh right behind the bed between the bed and the cab with the old pickup truck they had overloaded it or something and it was just bent down and the front end stood up and the back end stood up and we all piled on to try to hold the back end down and i guess that just raised the front end that much higher but you know we've got the town i never didn't understand how the drive shaft was turning because it surely had been hitting something there but living in an old house that was called what was known in that day as a shotgun house and you hear brother ryan mentioned shotgun i don't know whether the kentucky way of it is the same as georgia but in that one you had the the kitchen and the eating area was on one side and then there was a big old porch in between and that porch was almost as much as this room across it had a bottom and it had a top but it didn't have any sides in it all right then on the other side of that was the sleeping area there was no heat whatsoever in the sleeping area they didn't believe in that they believed it would burn the house down they wanted it to be if there was any fire in the other end that you would at least have enough time to get out of this end all right but see we've come a long ways all right it's because that man didn't just sit down and say well we'll just be picking cotton the rest of her life and you know i i never could do that it hurt my back but uh i do anything in the world i go cut wood because the cutting of the wood and the gathering of the cotton fell in october and november so i would be glad to go cut wood any time to keep having to pick cotton but my point is if we hadn't went on where would we be all right and in the gospel if if we had not went on where would we be we would still be back in man's ideas and opinions and thoughts you know to uh of what the word is saying and and who's out who's right and what is right you know and well that's your opinion you know that's what they say but see thank god for sending us the word right and i believe as the prophet said i gave it back to you but i didn't mean for joe to put these in but in the questions and answers in 64 brought around and said we have the perfect interpretation of the word of god and i believe that i believe we have it in our possession brother dale do you understand all of the word i didn't say that but what has been revealed to me i understand right because it's been revealed amen it's been made known to me then there's things in there that that used to i pondered didn't you i wondered what it meant i wondered what would be here and what would be there you know and you know we just had our own ideas but thank god for sending us the truth and giving us as paul said that you know if god permits we'll go on to perfection well now down through time he didn't permit mankind to reach that position right because he had you and i wouldn't be here right but see now we have the opportunity to reach unto the perfection that is spoken of and and going on to the change of the body and the rapture and all like that you know you know i believe that we're in that time to where these that it can take place all right not setting dates or times and seasons that's never been worth nothing anyway but there's one thing about it we can't all believe we're in the end time so then we're here at that point right on that but now what i want to do now is try to maybe in a few messages uh i want to illustrate some to you and show you uh you know that we must go on in our understanding because if we don't we will as a prophet said cabbage down upon one thought or one way of seeing something all right whereas the the word will keep unfolding right and we will just stop on that and say well no no greater works now i know what that means you know well do you know all of the things that the prophet spoke of through the scriptures of the greater works you know and uh you say well this is what i believe it means well it's all right but if all doesn't tie together right see we don't have a surety you know we're not positive about things but see if we go home and let it unfold then we can come to a place to see that it has to be set this away in about at least four ways of looking at greater works we're gonna try to try to tie type together to see that it all must be saying the same thing but if not then we're making a contradiction all right see that's where people don't understand they say there's contradictions in the bible and you say well show me where they're at see we are the ones who make the contradictions if there is a god that's for your question not mine if there is a god and he can't keep his word straight well it's not much of a god you know we give us a totem pole do this is good but see i believe god has given us the word i believe and you say well what do you believe about this i believe the king james version is the correct version that we need i read other versions i love to compare i love to check out things to see if if the other writers will hold the same point about a topic you know i enjoy doing that when i come right back to the king james brother branham even said that the lonza bible was he said exactly in other words he said we can read it's in the church book part and it'll be exactly in in revelation but i can't read it i've got one and i can't read the two and seem to keep the same thought i've tried it sure you know i i know he could but see he was looking greater than i was looking right all right but see i believe then the king james version is the what was written in heaven before the foundation of the world you say oh boy you're getting on that now we can prove the king can't do this well go ahead prove all you want to because there's another point there that the prophet said we have the perfect interpretation with the divine vindication right around reggie came to any version and that's what he used and god vindicated he read other versions but god vindicated what was there all right so we don't have to worry about it i believe we have it the way it's supposed to be all right seeing that then they can't be contradictions right now we can look at it and see it but you know like i've always said about it you know paul truly believed in one true living god right but yet look at his talking he was speaking under scripture one day and he said the god and father of the lord jesus christ bless you all god and father of the lord jesus christ how many you got i mean you got about four there at least you know but yeah he wasn't a trinitarian and in no way was he making any statement that could be implied that there is a trinity but yet that took a revelation of one god or takes a revelation of one god to be able to see that it's not contradictory right you see like i said this morning brother brown said one day says let's stand together and address the third person of the trinity well he was really a trilateral see that you got one statement and yet you'll believe that statement above everything else that is said we see then what you do there is you prove you got the wrong interpretation and you make the contradiction god did you understand my point now right that's why i like to take anything i like to look at it from it is i don't mean low like low but partial realization you know to the very point of just beginning and then continue on to the highest apex could be reached to the thought in that way then but i'd be pretty close to right you know right if it'll all fit and that's just the way that i do like we're talking about uh therefore leaving the principal to doc here's paul with a new birth and he goes all the way till he speaks of the rapture of the church right right but see now john said jesus writing there in the scripture that greater works than ye greater works shall be shall ye do now what are the greater works okay now remember we can't isolate one thing and just stay with that point and say well i don't know about these other things well you know see we you remember in the series of the um seven compound names how that we could isolate one and say we need the savior more than anything else and we dwell only on that the within when you do you're leaving the other things that are as of same value to god right as the jehovah jihad the lord's provided sacrifice see now i hope that will hold on to us until we can can follow on you know and know the lord as the scripture says now but remember my point seal us into your mind while you're awake that jesus said the only way that the greater works can be done is because i go unto my father all right so now you see where we're putting the whole honor and glory on jesus christ so then it cannot be that you and i no matter what we think of the greater works it it won't be us doing it ourselves are you following me it'll be the holy spirit in us doing the works you won't be saying look what i done well you didn't do anything that's the best way to say it if you say look what i done then that means you didn't do anything because i got in the way now so keep that in mind seal that into your thoughts that no matter what we talk about it will have to be the fact that it can come to pass because he said i go under my father now so hold that in your mind okay so brother branham we depend upon you in your understanding how we could read our own thoughts and ideas and talk about greater works but what is greater works you know what is your thoughts upon the point to where that we can get an understanding all right and so let's read a little bit the message serves what time search we would see jesus 1957 11 12. number three on your notes now the fruits of christ when he's here on earth the things that he did when he was here on earth he promised that they would be done by his church after he left the works that i do so you do also greater works than this shall you do where i go to my father greater if anyone who knows greek knows that that word greater doesn't mean that it would be in quality it means in quantity in other words it would be more than this shall you do would be the way we would read it more than this shall you do for a go to my father greater because no one could do any greater work than he did because he raised the dead he stopped nature he done everything that could be done and he stopped the roaring sea made the winds to be still raised up the dead after they were done corrupted in the grave and no one could do greater in quality but being that his spirit would come into the church and reach out it would be a universal church all around the world and they could do more of the same things that he was doing all right now so where do we start from that we start from the basis of seeing that it it doesn't mean that we're going to do something greater right it means that we're going to do more right because we've got some of this in here but you know what he's saying that because he was limited to one body he was limited to being a human being no you say limited well the best way i can express the way that way is the fact that he done it himself okay now it's not that god cannot be all over the world it's not that he can't know everything not around the world it's not that he can't be on the moon or anywhere it's not that he can't do these great things but he didn't choose to do it that way all right so now you're listening to me so by coming down into human flesh he limited his own self to being in one place at one time right right now so then when the holy ghost would come onto that pentecost he would be dealing with there at one time was 120 little christ like brother harris made a statement one time i enjoyed if he just left him alone he wouldn't have 120. you know well if he had left him only would have won himself but by crucifying him now you've got 120. then they go out to 3 000. and then it spreads to the world and all around the world today jesus christ can live in the heart of each individual person that is born again amen you agree every person around the world is born again jesus christ can live in here so did he is it us you follow me is it us or is it because he went to the father he hadn't went to the father he couldn't come back all right now so what's he doing he is all around the world and that's right in her doing what he couldn't do when it was here just in one human flesh right so the original translation says more not more in quality but more in quality right you know around the world so let's read a few things man you say well we understand that but let's read it to make sure everybody does the next one is then jesus came in 1957-1213 and that he is leaving he said the works that i do shall you do also greater works than this shall you do and the word greater anyone knows means more you couldn't do any greater inequality just in quantity because he was there in one person god was re was represented in one person now he's represented in the universal church everywhere more than this you know you do before i go into my father need a little while see me no more he's gone out into the world into the bride of christ around the world a message called jesus christ was saying 1958 28 214 he's talking about this and he said now the word there in the in king james says greater works than this will you do but if you'll run that back to the greek lexicon you'll find out that doesn't mean greater it means more you couldn't do greater he stopped nature heal the sick raise the dead done things well there could be no more done but you could do more of it because he would be in his church as the brains amen as the vine in his branches are whole world around the same okay you know in the next one uncertain sound 1960 12 18 john 14 12 he said in the works that i do shall you do also and greater works and this year you do more of it the word there absolutely look in the greek and it says more shall you do because why he was he was just in one man now god is in his whole church you see god was in one man then all men who believe him now more than this shall you do for i go to my father i'll return back to the light that i was that led the children of israel through the wilderness all right one more perseverance 1962 520 someone said now listen someone said oh sure we do greater works because we got a greater organization than he had we got greater we're all the way around the world now that's just what he said that he would be all around the world right but he didn't say an organization so now man interprets that of greater works and we certainly wouldn't agree with that that we got a a denomination an organization see he said we're all around the world wait a minute and watch him before you do that do the works he did first now what is to do the works of god john 6 and 29 is to believe on the one that god sent well they definitely didn't believe on the one god sent it wouldn't be an organization all right and anytime you go out with your own idea remember what you're doing see you're not doing the works of god first off is to believe god now second off and i'll show you other times where brother branham was saying this if you want to just run in greater works in your computer and come up and give it to you okay and you'll find him talking a lot about people that will say uh and we have one here in a minute that they'll say that we uh preach the gospel around the world well that's what jesus said would take place the gospel would be preached around the world but not by an organization organization preaches their own concept i'm trying to show you how close it is that you go out and you say well well brother now when jesus died he went around the world and now you preach the gospel all around the world and an around organization world we're on the radio around the world we we've got more giveaway programs we got great things we build great schools we build um you know we build um homes for the children the elders and everything but it wasn't what jesus would talk about but i'm trying to get you see how close it is someone said we do greater words so before you do that do the works he did first and you can do the greater he said you do his works first and then go greater if you'll take the translation of that from the original it doesn't say greater it said more the same works and move more all the way around the world then you got it right yeah but there it is the unauthoritated daughter word now you see now brother branham one time makes a statement like this he said you talk about you preach the gospel around the world he said now you do the lesser works in other words do what jesus done first right and this is what he said he said come i'll give you the pulpit and let's see you do it nobody wouldn't get up because they knew what he was talking about right but yet he stood right there in midst of all the unbelief that those people could produce and said if i told you the truth let god come and back it up so it's not just the point as i said to believe on them that god has sent but that's the beginning of it too it goes all the way to signs and wonders taking place in god doing those things all right now then you know for a reality in your heart that the biggest portion of the world religious system doesn't believe in in signs and wonders they're just churches they they got we're talking the other night they got uh you can find just go in the telephone directory and and call up your churches and and you just tell them your problem and they got a re they got a group for that now i'm not saying anything right i didn't say nothing but a brown didn't say anything they got support groups for marriage and divorce problems they got support groups for the kids they got support groups for the divorcees they got support groups for the alcoholics they got support groups brother brown never said anything about it but he didn't call it the greater works they called it the greater works he called the greater works as being the spirit of jesus christ going around the world and never born again believer that's where people don't understand this they think we're against this church over here because of the work they do no way no way thank god they're there you know if those people wouldn't out there there'd be a lot of hungry babies it'll be a lot of starve to deaf kids thank god for all of that right but the truth comes back to ring in our ears is that that is not the greater works even though it sounds like that's what even jesus was saying that even brother adam was saying of being around the world so now are we starting out right see the greater works now so we lay it down as to being more around the world the gospel is being preached born again believers are living the word preaching the word carrying the word the little money that we send to the philippines those brothers nestor brother del monte and all of his brother rocky and those brothers and brother vernon and them they go into vietnam laos they go into places that uh you know that there's not even churches in some of those countries and they put their life on the line and you're a part of it because we send them a little money to to help them support you know just to be able to get across back but see you're a part of sending out the gospel you know right you're proud of them preaching the gospel out like that but now is that all there is to it he said well no brother dale because we know that uh we're supposed to get to imparting eternal life and that's right we'll get to it a minute so hold on but there's a little something goes in there first before you talk about imparting eternal life because remember now we'll get back and say this again the catholic church says they impart eternal life the baptist the methodist the presbyterian come on they say they impart eternal life let's take something that's got to fit in there to be able to understand because you can't just jump up to an important eternal life let's take something and just cover it and compare these things all right we can go around the world we can fulfill the more because we can preach the gospel around the world everybody understand that but look down at the next one on the which is number eight on your notes faithful abraham 1961-312 where is the gods of balaam where is your critics where is your critic sage the holy spirit's not right come forth do the same thing you say well jesus said are greater than this you come do the works he done first and then we'll talk about the greater and i'll tell you what it is now what is the greater works and i'll tell you what it is listen jesus could not preach the baptism of the holy ghost right right i'm reading what your prophet said it hadn't come yet right that's the greater work we're doing but do the same works he did he said you would okay so that's where people come in now and i'll make this statement before we get into what we're talking about there people will say today you know where where's the signs and wonders that's what they're looking for where's the the works of god you know the signs and wonders and people even say i said it too they have more out in the denominational world a lot of times than we have here but i still don't say that we don't do the works of god in praying for the sick and the sick being healed and things happening the dead being raised the signs and wonders that has taken place among us you know of the word being spoken the different things now i want to see a whole lot more but if you deny what's already been what category does it put us in so if we say brother dale look they have more out there than we have here well why don't you go out there no problem if you think that's more of god you want to go with that we see you're too embarrassed a lot of times do it that way but that won't help nothing but see don't don't say then that when we ain't got it because we don't see signs and wonders i believe those things take place among us all the time that we could back up and stand here and talk about and the sick being healed the dead being raised the things that happened from this little group here and there would be no argument or shouldn't be with anyone that those things has taken place but now let's go along with this because your prophet made an outstanding statement there he called preaching the baptism of the holy ghost the greater works because he said jesus couldn't preach it now we're back on that thing again see it's not he couldn't preach it because he is the holy ghost right right it's not that he can't preach it but around say it not saying that he can't preach it it's just like what i said a moment ago now god could be all over the world but he chose to bring himself down into one person and limit his abilities until the church would come in to be amen it would take his same thing that he's doing right and take it to the world amen now keep that in your mind right all right that's why it takes me so long to preach the truth is the hardest thing in the world to preach it's easy to preach a lie i can just run across everybody shout glory hallelujah we enjoyed that you'd be alive hard to preach truth because you got to get people to thinking about what you're saying right so now it wasn't that jesus couldn't preach the holy ghost because he was the holy ghost right but he didn't choose to do it that way right he preached all of the bible come on let's see i i used to have the idea i don't mind telling you when i'm wrong i don't mind telling it at all i used to have the concept and it was partially true that you know jesus like who said he he can't preach the holy ghost see what my idea was that you and i could do something he couldn't do and there's a truth to that now listen to my point martin luther had the new birth amen but he didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost they come with a death pentecost in that way he had the new birth which was the baptism of the holy ghost but he get out of the holy ghost and fell on azusa street that's what your prophet said i'm i'm with him because he had a partial realization right and the holy ghost could only fall on the amount of word he had but it was the same holy ghost but it was just the way of doing it all right now the holy ghost would bottle up in that man we call jesus you agree see so the disciples could only preach what he allowed them to preach but on the day of pentecost they went out preaching the baptism in the holy ghost see it's not that god that jesus i'm not different around i'm trying to explain what he's saying he's the one we just read that jesus could not preach the baptism of the holy ghost it hasn't come yet right what is he saying the dispensation of the baptism of the holy ghost did not come until the day of pentecost right when jesus was here it was the dispensation of sonship in the basis of son of man now i'll be glad to show you this quote brother ryan said that's why when jesus said he said now you blaspheme right but he said it won't be accounted to you to do it to me right right you can speak a word against the son of man it'll be forgiven you the scripture but it said when the holy ghost has come oh that's right one word against it won't be forgiven in this world of the world to come so you see what it's doing it's going on the greater works god thinks more i don't have no education sorry but he thanks more of his pride than he does his own ministry what your prophet said he left something for her to do you know what he has something for her to do what she used to preach the gospel and under the dispensation of the son of man that he was there did you say something you say something about me i'll forgive you okay paul covering a sin we see when the holy ghost comes one word sorry so you can see what he's saying now jesus wasn't in the dispensation of the baptism in the holy ghost he was then the dispensation of redeemer right to die that the holy ghost could come what now do you understand it and then brother around there was one said these things now don't blame me because he said just try to understand look at the next one number nine on you know it's getting in the spirit 1961. now if you think of theology is the sign of the messiah of messiah and what if you think the theology is the sign of messiah and and that's and that's a greater sign than this jesus said it works and i do so you do also and you say preaching the gospel is the greater words all right then you come here and do the lesser works so we're right back here at all the other here's the platform help yourself come up here and go down through this prayer line and let the holy spirit move out in the audience there over you let me see you do them works and then preach the gospel then you do do a greater works jesus could not preach the baptism of the holy ghost because it has not yet come it's a greater works it certainly is the church is to preach the baptism of the holy spirit jesus said it was coming but the church has it and saying we got it and it's for you see so that was a greater that is true now what's the greater works now repeat again not that jesus couldn't be the holy ghost not that he couldn't be all over the world he limited himself to the place of bringing his bride into view to bring you an eye sister gail into view god would said it so in the word that even he couldn't preach the baptism of the holy spirit he'd leave it to you and i okay look at number 10 and we're being be not afraid in his eye 1960 305. i was talking to a fellow not long ago he said oh sure brother branham we preach the gospel all over the world that's greater works i said do the works then that he did then do the greater show me the works that he did right the works that i do shall you do also now here is where people as i said a moment ago they say oh you don't have nothing i don't have nothing ain't nothing going on i differ with you amen because somewhere around the world that's right amen the ministry of jesus christ this day is being displayed if it can't be displayed here or someone making that statement and it can't be displayed in your church or whatever then you know what it means it means like jesus had to take him outside to pray for him it means that the scripture is right when it says he couldn't do mighty works among them because of their unbelief now let's don't get tied up in unbelief right man heaven help our unbelief as i said if there's just one person somewhere around the world today that raises the dead that's the body of jesus christ you hear me if there's one person who's healed or sick anywhere in the world today that's fulfilling the ministry of jesus christ amen when i brought it out you're just making excuses because it ain't in you no people wouldn't say that if they knew my background and the things that has taken place here they wouldn't make that statement so then it's ignorance that you're doing it in because call me sometimes and i'll tell you about how the dead's been raised the stick's been healed the food has been multiplied the mighty wonderful works of god but it's been so small until people don't see it but do you understand what i'm saying forget whether it's little or whatever it is if there's one person around the world anywhere today and the sick is being healed that's jesus's ministry so get off of it see and get down asking god to help us watch next one number 11. revelation chapter 1 1960-1204 he that believeth in me said saint john 14 7 he that believeth in me the works that i do shall he that i do shall he also do the same works the greater than this because christ cannot preach the baptism of the holy ghost would be greater he could not bring it to them jesus couldn't get the baptism in the holy ghost so not one person while he was alive uh we need to get the pepper okay someone was saying i need to take it and break the pepper open and grip it on my hands and go back to the audience and lay hands on everybody i'd probably wake you up okay listen jesus couldn't bring the holy ghost to him because christ christ cannot preach the baptism of the holy ghost would be greater he could not bring it to them because the holy ghost hadn't yet been given and when jesus came and sacrificed his life and the holy ghost returned then they could impart eternal life to the people right that's the greater now we're going to get on the eternal life let's read the rest of this but the signs and wonders jesus finally said in mark 16 go in into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature how far all the world how many ever creature long as the gospel is being preached these signs shall follow them that believe and when that becomes a revelation brother you're near the kingdom then on this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell can't prevail you see we look at it and think that every born-again believer but you got statements like brother branham he said you may never lay your hand on someone and feel the surge of power run through your body and see him instantly healed that don't mean you don't pray for him that don't mean that you're not a christian because they remember the whole story was started the reason anything can be done in the body of christ is because jesus said i go to my father now let's talk about eternal life now we've uncovered two things we've done covered that it's more around the world we've done cover that the clock's covered done covered that it's that jesus couldn't preach the baptism and holy ghost because it hadn't come yet right but when it would come then see around the world the more that can be done by all around the world can only be done because now the holy ghost has been given the scripture said that the holy ghost couldn't be given because jesus hadn't been glorified that's where people would say today what do you mean they had the baptism in the holy ghost and the old testament well now that's contrary to the scripture right country brother brandon you take these quotes and leave them there to even just say see that jesus couldn't preach the baptism and all again why because the baptism of the holy ghost dispensation would start on the day of pentecost and in the bride of christ the greater works of god around the world by the preaching of the gospel amen could heal the sick raise the dead cast out devils by the preaching of the gospel okay now so look what your prophet went on to say that day on calvary 1969-25 now the reason that line is on there that means this is continual you know continual quote so just keep right on reading 12 and then we'll turn over the next page and go on this is a continual reading right from that day on calvary 1969-25 now notice the greater works was to have the power in the church not only to heal the sick by prayer cast out devils by prayer but to impart eternal life to believers now the catholic church believes that they impart eternal life they believe they forgive sins unless we tied together now what do you think about imparting eternal life well brother i'll just give it to you now according to my understanding of the bible there was a man i believe his name was simeon simon simon the sorcerer he offered money to the disciples he remembered the book of acts and what he wanted was the ability to be able to give people the holy ghost reach a scripture but they told him where he could go you know because it didn't work i just get a holy ghost who i want to now according to the last words we just read there doing parties oh let's see the holy ghost was coming and given to the hands of the church to impart life oh that's what calvary meant it took stop degraded men and women and lifted them into a place to be sons and daughters of god to heal the sick and to impart eternal life by giving the holy ghost to obedient believers not to just anybody to obedient believers men who once enlight men who once who were once unbelievers be made believers and impart spiritual eternal life now how can you impart eternal life well brother we just didn't party eternal life in our church we just we just lay hands on the party turn alive well impart guilt all right well paul said when part gifts just lay don't get none how'd he say it was done how did paul say imparting gifts was done to stir up the gift that was in you those gifts and callings are without repentance so you can't give somebody a gift right right right right you don't give them a gift you stir up the gift that's within them all right but yet we think and there's a lot of churches teaching and i don't mean the message necessarily they can just impart spiritual gifts come out here and i'll pray for you you'll be a prophet well you could all mix up around the country you can impart it only to obedient believers now keep on reading how much greater is it to say to this sick woman laying here i can pray a prayer of faith she'll be healed that's a great thing that's what he was doing then he died he prayed for him but said greater than this so you do i'm going to give you power not only to raise him up for a while but to give him eternal life which we will be eternal forever poor blind wretched people how do you miss that don't you see the greater thing you see what the greater thing is that's the greatest thing that could ever happen was to invite eternal life to people what is eternal life the life he lived the life that was in him impart that to others can a man do that a son of god can now we just flip the page okay whosoever jesus said whosoever sins you remit to them they're remitted whosoever sins you retain to them they're retained now how do you re remix them how you retain sin how do you give eternal life and how do you choose who to give it to now here's where the catholic church and many of the others made their big mistake they go out and say i forgive your sins that wasn't it how did they get sins forgiven in the bible peter answered that question on the day of pentecost they said what can we do to be saved right how can we get this that you all got right he laid down the prescription he told him what to do right he said repeat every one of you towards god and be baptized in the name of in jesus christ what for the remission of your sins there's the greater word amen amen by the preaching of the gospel is not that what he's saying by the preaching of the gospel right you can remit sins right by the preaching of the gospel you can impart eternal life right wordy where did eternal life come from on the day of pentecost i'm talking about downstairs though 120 received it because they'd heard the word but they went downstairs and they said men brother what can we do basically well all you got to do just believe me i'll give it to you no repent be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost so now we're still tying it all back together we got one two three things and they're all tied to one thing jesus went away and jesus came back and jesus is doing in the church the same thing he's done when he's really amen now in his church well i thought i'd just give eternal life just anywhere i wanted to you know i just that's what i've tried my best to tell people don't do it people in this message they'll go out and explain marriage and divorce to a bunch of unbelievers don't do that it's not for them what do you mean i mean what the prophet said he said it's not for them he said it's only the believers in this message now you read the prophet's message marriage and divorce that's right amen it's not for everybody come in the message didn't receive the grace of marriage in the voice see you're getting them in by dangling something in front of them oh i can go over there and get my sins forgiven i can go over there and get eternal life oh glory dear people say they got the ability to impart eternal life the only way you can impart eternal life is the same way jesus did right did jesus give eternal life to everybody according to my understanding he never gave my eternal life to nobody now you come and show me he did but he was here in the world he never gave eternal life to anybody he had to be crucified where that eternal life could come out of him right to be able to go into somebody else is only done by the preaching of the word amen amen so it's so vital to see what that prophet said jesus couldn't preach the baptism and the holy ghost but the bride can and that's the greater works amen now as i said this morning christian park word won't do all of it preaching era won't do it right god can't quit an era right right it must be the truth that's preached you shall know the truth the truth then it shall set you free not part truth no well what are we doing he laid down the prescription he told him what to do he said repeat every one of you towards god and be baptized in the name of jesus christ what for the remission of your sins there's the greater works how many of you preachers this morning that we're still reading that day on calvary this morning how many of you listening to my word on magnetic tape are willing to go to calvary this morning and look what god did for you did there for you and forsake your denominational creeds and preach the gospel listen to it hallelujah he's in your lap now what are you going to do with it why repentance and remission of sins must be preached in his name to all the world beginning at jerusalem hallelujah there you are what does calvary mean to you what'd that day do to you did it stuff you out of some theology did it make you a stuffed shirt or did it make you a christian sort out hallelujah sin is remitted greater works than this shall you do you see where the use are don't you greater works than this remitting sins in the name of jesus christ but through creeds and denominations so forth it's bound you down to a place you're still flirting with the world so the catholic church can't forgive sins but neither can you and i unless the holy spirit comes on the scene in you and i to offer it right amen right once it's offered so where the preaching comes in the preaching comes in to offer the people the opportunity to receive eternal life all i'm trying to do is give away what god gave me years ago brother i've heard you say that many times that's right i'm trying to give away eternal life well give it to me brother we'll be through it a little bit that's right and the water's waiting that's right so come on down and repent and accept jesus christ and we'll go baptize you in the name of the lord jesus christ and it even connects to the remission of sins now the water baptism don't remit your sins it is your faith in god amen but if your faith is not right in god you can be baptized a thousand times right and it won't do you anyway hallelujah thank you let's go to the message now shalom 1964. let's pick up another point of greater works but remember now each one has got to be tied back together but we're going to pick up another point of greater works all right listen if i'm long i'm sorry forgive me i may have to go a little over because i got to finish this all right because it ain't something i can cut off and get the next shalom 1964-0119 the word is light when it's vindicated until the word it that's promise for today is a vindicated then it's not light it cannot be if god said let there be light and no sun comes in existence there's no sign of light but when god said let there be light and there was light when god promised the messiah messiah come then he was then his word was fulfilled and he was the light of the hour when he promised noah and he promised the others and on down that was the line of the hour and there's a lot of the hour today that's jesus christ in the power of his resurrection his word that's promised for this day the works that i do shall you also greater than this will you do for a go to the father greater works greater things than he did he said you believe it i believe it he seems humble it seems like it goes over the head of top of people's head look when he was here on earth how could you do greater works i've translated that many times more but the same thing greater he said in saint john 14 12 it works greater works than this year you do did you notice now listen whitney he calls greater works did you notice when he went to make wine and water into wine he took water first already he already created substance and he turned it into wine when he fed five thousand people it took a fish that once swim in the water broke it handed it out multiplied creation he took bread that was once we baked it into bread broke it and hung it out to hand it out to the people and it returned back again multiplied creation but in the last days when there's no sign of creation he spoke it into creation yeah chose to flee the same god that was in the beginning he can create squirrels he can create whatever where he wants to because he's god greater things than this will you do for i go into my father the word's infallible and has to be manifested and has to be fulfilled greater than this shall you do not multiplying but speaking out but speaking out into creation right now you listen oh that was only for brother brown we'll read some more this is the continuation from reading a man here that can turn on the light 63 12 29 and it goes from page for paragraph 216 through paragraph 223. he said i want to ask you something that he's coming down and let it be personal though watch this see he's the same yesterday today and forever what his works that he did manifested itself now listen close when he stood there and say in john 14 12 he said the words that i do so you do also greater than this shall you do for are going to my father now he said it's heavens and earth will pass away but that word will never fail and if we're at the last end of the age where is them greater works going to come right see we're here we haven't gone he said now listen if the roman calendar is right we got about 36 years left every 2000 years the world meets her in first 2 000 years destroyed by water second two thousand years christ came this is 1964 coming up 36 years now the egyptian astronomy calendar say we're 17 years out at 17 years ag years advanced from that that would mean that would leave 19 years left jesus said the work will be cut short for the elect's sake or there be no flesh say where are we at the works that i do shall ye also same kind but greater sure you do now don't lose that because i read in between i just wanted to give you the continual reading go back to what you're saying up the top now we're at the end of the age where is them greater works going to come well we've been around the world preach the gospel right we've taken the gospel and been able to repent and get the people to repent and get them baptized and do greater works now look the greater work since the prophet is tying it together with what speaking of things into creation paragraph 2 20. now watch listen close go on your i pray that god will open your heart and your mind understanding though that you'll understand without saying it too much out much here notice he said one day let's get some of the great work he done let's just stop for a couple of things let's think one time he said you fed them you feed them something to eat they said we haven't done he said what do you got bring me what you got they said we have five barley loaves and two fishes he said bring them to me he took the original five party lows and began to break the loads and from the original he made bread that fed 5 000 is that right then he said have you got a fish gave me the fish it was a fish to begin with and he took off that fish another fish and another fish in bed 5000. is that right but in the last day he had nothing he just spoke and said say it'll be there and it was there without anything in it he never had a squirrel there was none there he said let there be there was his words infallible it has to be fulfilled i could tell you things that would shake you see it's there when he says it's dark let him say it just exactly see the east and the west here has come back and met the east see the east the west has come back and met the east it was moses even picked up sand and said let there be fleas and so forth like that upon the earth but in his last days he didn't take anything just a word let it be and it is what said that's the way it'll be i want to testify some of the things to not see that's what happened that you can see he's still god his word cannot these works that i do show you all to you also and greater than this how you do i took a fish made of fish you don't even have a fish you still god he's still the same son the same son of god that took a fish off of the fish he's the same son of god today these works shall i say these words that i do show you also even greater than this will you do it'll be magnified greater than this you do and the people refuse to see it greater works now keep this right listen your profit spoke the word right but whose words was that was it him or was it god all right now which one was it was it him or was it god all right now let's magnify it he spoke squirrels into existence but he imparted eternal life one day sister had the rights to boys they didn't repent and get baptized they did afterward but he said i give them eternal life he told brother dalton he said it's been spoken and all of your children to be saved it was magnified but who was it that done it remember the sister had it right she said brother brown may not but the truth he said something inside of him said tell her i asked what she wants it wasn't brother brown see he's just showing that god coming on the scene that we just read down through there and how he's going to do the greater works right that's right we believe it's for brother branham okay let's read number 13. amen message here you know 1963-13 he talking about the robe of immortality showing that he had received him that's the thing that god will do to his sons here on earth someday he will call you a side church if you'll only obey him and stay on the word and believe it he will place into the church before the coming of jesus christ he will place into the church all the powers that christ had in him will be in the church all that god was he poured into jesus all that jesus was he poured into the church god wanted his work done he sent it into his son the son wanting the work done he sent it into the church and that day you'll know that i'm in the father father in me and i and you and you and me and that day because the same power of god was in jehovah god rested in jesus christ the same power that rested in jesus christ rest in the place sons in the body of christ on this placing of a son take him out of a certain place have a ceremony before angels and posses place in positioning what he is in the body of christ then that person has the authority let me say this if you kept me a fanatic from this night on that very same thing that i'm speaking on will be done there will be a power put into the church and now it's coming in that the holy spirit will so anoint the people that they'll speak the word and it'll create itself right there we haven't seen powers like coming into the church now i know it for a fact say this mountain be moved don't doubt any heart but believe what you've said shall come to pass you can now what you have said the placing of the church in position when the fullness of the power of the holy ghost comes into the church then critics mouths will be shut it'll be a short time jesus come right off the mountain went straight to calvary notice it won't last long but it'll be there people that can speak the word oh we can look back now there's the thing that i've been talking about the earth believing of the principle to the doctrine we can look back and see what brought around done and say that was the ministry of jesus christ right but you see we've got to leave that and go on to christ in the bride now see if you put it all in him that's your doctrine that's your your belief all right i just don't believe it but i believe all god was he poured into christ and all christ was he poured into the church it didn't say as some man said one time all god was he poured into christ all christ in the brother branham he died and took it with him we ain't got nothing well that's what you believe and i don't believe it i believe the greater works he's waiting on the bride of christ to not just heal the sick not just cast out devils but i believe it's left up to you and i just speak the word that's right you let this thing go for a little while and we all get hungry bellies you might begin to realize that we need to speak you may have to speak your next meal into existence but you see it's put into the hands now of the bride of christ it may be one out of georgia that means rest y'all got problems you gotta move states they ain't enough states for everybody to go to even though obama says there's 57 of them god's waiting on you and i adoption time that he can pour in his fullness am i quoting the prophet to raise the dead and we'll go in the rats right now i believe that now it could be that we come to where we can impart my brother branham no sister had it right said your children will be saved now brother brown said if you got the revelation for your own self why can't you believe it for somebody else right now here's the rest of that quote he said god if you don't have it for that way then i doubt you're saved now i'm paraphrasing that but it's close see we're selling ourselves short but not believing exactly right we're not believing in the greater works but the whole emphasis from 1 2 3 four things or so that we've covered about the more to go into all the world about that jesus couldn't preach the baptism in the holy ghost but we could do the greater works and preach that holy ghost if it's in us right impart eternal life preach the gospel and let people see the word and it'll bring eternal life to them or even come down to speaking things into existence but you see what we do is we doubt we believe it was for brother branham we believe it was for jesus but we don't believe it was for us well according to my bible the whole world is waiting on you and i hebrews 11 40. may without us cannot be made perfect god's waiting on you and i amen to realize who we are that's right and that we can do the greater works let's see what he said look at number 16 you know phase 15 church age book and remember this christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts but the book of revelation shows how the antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it making it look more formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works now what is the rew what is the works of satan attempted destruction of god's people and to decorate this deep discrediting of god's word otherwise i keep you from believe what the word says about you and the preachers in the land today we don't have to know these dudes be careful now get all confusing discrediting the word right listen right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army the word invincible means incapable of being conquered it's not invisible it's invincible you may pronounce that wrong but the definition is what incapable of being conquered overcome or subdued incapable of doing it you'll have to be an invincible army listen if they get a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and god by god's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit satan will be powerless before her he will be as definitely courted today as when christ withstood his ever effort to gain power over him in the desert yes satan hates revelation but we love it with true revelation in their lives the gates of hell cannot prevail against us but we will prevail over them page 34 church age book may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation all if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by it the living word manifest amen we will do the greater work and glorify our father in heaven amen now luther could take that and do the greater works and preach the gospel but he couldn't bring it out like it is today you and i in the end of all things come to a time of the age when we can believe it and god can make it manifest right all he wants somebody to do is believe it that's it he'll make it manifest that's right you just believe you believe it when it's impossible told people years ago i said wait his backslid but he is coming back the lord showed me you know what one minister said you think your kid's gonna be saved cause of your kids pretty blunt isn't it i said no sir they gonna be saved because i believe it right because your prophet said to that spoken while ago if you don't have faith for others he said i doubt you got faith for your own son oh my god bleed for the impossible june knows i tell her when i look at wade and she was backslid at that time and i talked about her too and i said when i look at wade i laugh at him he got a hard road to go but he's coming amen i've told some of you the same things right joyce did i tell you one day danny's coming joyce you say because you said it now because i believed it i wanted her to help me believe right i talked to some of you others too why can't you believe what god says why make it so little when the greater things are there i don't think i've covered anything wrong the basis of imparting eternal life or anything i think i covered it right brother branham it was not brother branham that said the sister had it right i gave you your children it was god through brother brown if it's said by you it's god through you amen and i turned around one day and i told my wife i said wade's coming back yeah i believe it i said yeah and i'm gonna tell you something else he said what i said he's going to be standing in the pulpit beside of me preaching the gospel do you believe me why because god showed it to me i'm not telling you anything like brother branham was if he told me to go race george washington i would just say hey folks the bus will be leaving in the morning and we will all take a trip don't worry down be a long ride but we'll get there and he's going to be raised from the dead and it won't be like who was it father divine or once i'm told he's going to walk on water boy he had them all built up he gonna walk on water and they pulled out their outside the ocean rolled this big old carpet out down next to the water father diviner one of those guys you know i'm not throwing off on him i'm just telling it he walks right down through there he's right up the edge of the water he turned around he said there's one unbeliever in the crowd oh fine her mom can't do it listen church the greater works let's go on to perfection let's go on to the basis of believing god let's go on to preaching the gospel until the people can be saved let's give an opportunity brother why don't you preach my wife knows i've told her if it wasn't for the ones that was leaved and wanted to believe i just handed over the way and said i'm done but i've fought it out all these years god is going to come on the scene he's going to manifest himself because he's doing it now doing the greater works come on brother i'm sorry sorry i took a little lift this must be your book yes sir 307. it's coming let's believe and let's see all right because we that's all it is you don't have to do that you don't have to beg nothing to put it out you just say thank you father we just lay our hands upon our sister agreeing with her that what she lord is desiring in her heart shall be given unto her because she believes it we believe you and we thank you father in jesus name just go believe you don't say it just don't say it it don't matter what anybody says do you leave you bleed for your family you bleed for your children you bleed for your husband your wife your father your mother i don't have any abortions is of the greater form that we could do than what squad has already done it's just more because around the world i believe the ministry of jesus christ is this day around the world in but if promised the pride will have that we limit that by not believing he you've got work for you to do me is jesus they can see you you remember one day when i was talking to you and sister trudy and hear this and she'll know that what i said most of you heard me sister truly drives five hours she's gone up north to some of the family is visiting this weekend not with us but if she went somewhere like she'd be here five hours she drives down five hours she drives back home i told her i said sister i said live before your husband your family is the way you want them to follow and i said of course it's real nice and all you know because you're driving five hours you drive back home you get home at 10 o'clock tom comes up said i want something to eat go fix it yourself i'm tired i've been to right you don't ever say that's just a hand you don't never say hey if you want something to eat go eat i've been reading the bible oh that's nice any joyce still danny i've been i've been praying i told her i said you go fix him someday and you be happy about it and say thank you lord you remember the lady that strolled it they throw the eggs down and all and she was down in the floor you know unless jesus buried across alone converted her husband and i think it was two more men just by her being a christian listen we all have our problems there's nobody ever preached brother branham didn't preach that he lived in a glory hallelujah world that there was never no troubles he never preached nothing like that jesus never preached anything like that he had his ups and downs and problems in the world in life brother brown said he sat on a rock and grown with a headache after raising that little boy from the dead but wouldn't it be something he'd say i just don't feel like going to calvary today lord maybe another day i'll feel better you know man i'll go but you see we use excuses an excuse is what something just to try to get away from not doing what you need to do until you make an excuse but that's not what it is go ahead wow singing oh oh i'm i'm oh
