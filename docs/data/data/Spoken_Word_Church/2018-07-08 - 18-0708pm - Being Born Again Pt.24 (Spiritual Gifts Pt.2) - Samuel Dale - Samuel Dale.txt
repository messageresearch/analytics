we'll go to Romans 11 first Peter 1 and in Romans 11 remember the ones that are traveling remember the different things of this prank the Lord would bless and guide each one and lead us all into his love men all right now remember the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday that brother pageants so remember that and keep that in mind and and I'll remember too now the end of this month I'll probably preach a couple of wins these Newton for thin if I get tied up cause by the end of this month we're gonna start scheduling so we'll have schedule and preachers you know and we'll have to preach we just schedule for a while because we're gonna have a bunch of ministers in to minister unto you and pray that the Lord would bless and be with each one amen father we thank you for this day in your grace thank you for everything and just let your light shine into our hearts and our lives that we may all walk in you the order and may we see you made manifest among us forgive our sins lead us by thy grace and your love Lord that we may walk in the light of the day and the hour that we're living have your way Lord lead each one we commit it to you in Jesus name Amen 1st Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren thee that you love one another with a pure heart fervently they what a lot of people wonderful why do you use that same scripture that because we're still on the same thought it doesn't matter if it's 20 sermons to me or 40 sermons and that same talk if I keep it then that's what goes yours I thought being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth for ever okay Romans 11 I want you to notice this point and then we'll bring our point we'll go to verse 25 or I would not brethren that you should be ignorant of this mystery unless you should be wise in your own conceits that blindness in part is happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles be come in now remember Israel is blinded for our sake all right and there they can't come in until we get out of the way so they're blinded for that but now what's a blinded people and what's what the point is and so shall all Israel be saved there's going to be a group of people fills you that are going to be saved and they are saved down through the time and they didn't accept Jesus Christ what I mean they've died down through time the field stills you from Calvary up to now that feels feels used I'd not accepting Jesus Christ we'll look what he says about him and so all Israel shall be saved he's gonna save a group of people that don't even accept him don't do anything and what's your conclusion now there shall come out of Zion remember that's out of the bride Isaiah says what is it one of them is out of the bride two other ones in all right they're still come out of Zion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob for this is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins future times are coming on all the way through as concerning the gospel they are enemies for your sakes but as touching the election they are beloved of the father's sake for the father's things for the gifts and calling of God are without repentance you may be seated to the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word gift and calling or without repentance we're gonna try to pick up our thought from where we left off this morning but I want to read you something remember what our in talking was about that we are a wonderful blessed people that if we need to know something about the Bible you know what a scripture means etc we just go to the message of the hour it ain't like we used to well we'll go down and see what dr. so-and-so says about it we'll go see what this says about it you know no we go to the message of the hour to find the answers to our questions all right that's a wonderful opportunity because see there are a lot of people with a lot of questions all right there's a lot of things that questions but they don't have no way of getting an answer because they have no thing and we know the Prophet is not infallible I mean he you know he he can do wrong he could he said things that was wrong he taught things that was wrong with any corrected it and all like that but the message that he brought when you take it straight down through the line it's infallible it's totally pure I may have them words all messed up of what it is but I just simply mean this message any question you have any thought you asked go to the message and find out that's why on the Internet I will not answer any questions of people on the internet because you're just gonna get into an argument you know arguably about and I'm not gonna do that I tell the brothers is to tell it brother Joe sends back a notice go to your pastor because he's responsible I'm not if you don't have a faster go straight to the message you know cause what else can you say we have the ability to you're from God by way of a message that the messengers died and going on he's been buried he's in everything you know but we have the message thank God for technology to where that we can have the message to be able to search though we used to sin I mean we'd spend sometimes I would be studying for a sermon I'd spend more time trying to find a quote from the Prophet just one little quote then you know back in the old days then I would even try to get the sermon together so you to find something that the Prophet said on that talk now it's the instant you just pull it in this instant I mean that's that's wonderful you say well how do we know well we've got the right answer now let me describe better setup into a point you're not going to pull up and try to get the answer and just have a great big thing but you're gonna get a statement well then see if brother Branham says over here there's just one true and living God there's no such thing as a Trinity etc etc all right then when you come over here somewhere and you find some wording that sounds like he's saying something about a Trinity so you know your answer has already been stated because remember what he will be saying we'll come into the truth if given an opportunity I've seen a lot of things that I thought was totally contrary into tonight statements the Prophet would make haven't you we'll give it time to come find out it's a in the same time a little different form little different wording but saying the same point cuz there's only one truth now we're not looking through a message to find a half a dozen truth we look to the message to find the truth see a truth is fine that's good but the truth is what I want see in that bin that but do we put everything we've got is our whole life and everything set on this prophets message so not on the message and the messenger the man the things you know he was a human being he was all the things my whole thing is not based upon his life and his living in different time it's not on there it's based on the message that he brought because he had to link to the to God to bring it down to us Oh No see then I don't have to worry about it I just sometimes I may have to wait on the answer you know cause I'd like I said I've seen a lot of things that look on through it here to here but you wait a while and you'll find out the truth is there that's the way that I put my confidence into the message and then it goes back from Daraa to saying well the Prophet says this this this the Bible the Prophet can't say something contrary to the Bible as a human element he may make a statement a kin a statement or something but he cannot be contrary to the Bible so if the Bible and the prophets message says something we're supposed to believe it yeah but I'm just no no no we have not one iota of a thought of any form other than to accept the Word of God now that's been my stole oh it's been my thing all the way through you know to stay on that one time this message has ever answer that we need answered sometimes we don't need to be answered in maybe all right but for what we have need of this message has the answer well I was in Greer's almanac the other day and I was reading and the Lord showed me sup well that's good but Greer's almanac didn't bring you the right dollar it just maybe had words that opened up some channel that God had already planted a seed to do in your hearts and lives but do we believe do we believe what the Prophet said he said we know now you're trying to say something exactly right then we know now you got something in mind that you're not something right it's exactly right what do we believe the message is right do we believe what he says to be true I gave him one of these but I got a couple of it go ahead and pull up the one I gave you got a couple more and look what the prophet has to say off of the message you're his voice but we modern Americans what we and the false prophets behind the pulpit say that's all right I'm kind of notion of saying they worship you get what he's saying and the false prophets behind the pulpit say that's all right so you know that what are we supposed to depend on the false prophets or what then he says look I'm kind of a notion of saying that if I'm wrong God forgive me so he's gonna make a strong statement so listen I'm persuaded that a lot of them don't know God talking about the ministers and the signs right they don't know God look the congregation will never live any higher than its pastor do you believe that these some of you looking at me some of you said in stone-faced some of you ain't moving a muscle think about it the congregation will never live any higher now he's referring to the false prophets and the way they're lewin and all right and makes that statement now here's another one I didn't give to him but this is off the Pergamon Church age the church and the priest in 1960 talked about the hidden manna the little something special what is the special not something to the blessings of the Holy Ghost don't know no that's for the whole congregation but the hidden manna was a special revelation because he had to teach the others he was a little more knowledge of the scripture that he could teach the others now listen he's supposed to be is that right you'll never live any higher than your pasture you just remember that because he's the Shepherd that feeds you if he's the Shepherd right cuz I've always told you that a lot of people I don't I wouldn't call my pastor God I don't agree with him in the word you know the word is the pastor anyway all right so what is he saying you'll never live no higher than your passenger you just remember that because he's the Shepherd that feeds you if he's this effort you got to know where the miner is to feed the sheep that was he's got to know where the man I hit I look at this from questions and answers while having a shadow we believe in God in church government the government is ordered of the Holy Spirit in the Bible the pastor is always the head of the church the pastor is always that's God's elder in organization you have to come through the bishop oh yeah okay they're getting them here there's no higher order in the Bible than the elder of the church tell me where it's at there's no higher order in the Bible for the church than the elder which is the pastor and he's the highest order of the Bible what no no you say well brother Dale I got that straightened down brother branham's my pastor okay he said brother branham's my pastor well you gonna have to argue with him what he's talking about money so I ain't gonna worry about it that's why I don't try to rule nothing I try to direct us and keep us in order and got it cuz of the truth because we believe what the Prophet said it me now it does not mean when he says that there's not a higher order than the pastor it doesn't mean listen it doesn't mean that you don't know intellectually more than your pastor because you're in bad shape if you don't know more than I do intellectually it didn't say that he's not talking about head knowledge he's talking about Holy Ghost knowledge head knowledge can't lead a church now let me make the statement and you won't do it's going to many churches have you been split because they seem split because of head knowledge but Holy Ghost knowledge labraina church together all right now there's the things we will be reading and we'll be walking from the order and keeping it in that line I am NOT trying in in no way to make you line up for my ideas and thoughts I've never had no idea that it's whether or not you agree with the word it's not whether or not you agree with me I'm like brother branham he said I don't want a yes-man that behind me in other words is cutting me from the back I've had him to do it oh brother Dale ain't none greater than brother Dale he's he's the greatest we've got there and in them you feel that knife cutting through and you realize that hey wait a minute they're not they must not mean it all right but listen you say that's a funny way to approach what you want approach car don't approach the idea of the fifo ministry all right we have had a message we have brought the Prophet brought the message thank God for the technology to bring it down to us that we can search it and I said a moment ago that we can see what he's saying we can check out what he's saying you know thank God for all of that we've had all the things that God figures we have need of I guess is a way to say it put it our disposal to where we can follow the message all right that's not trying to build up the fivefold ministry to me you don't have to I tell you without any remorse or thought or anything whatsoever it doesn't matter to me what you think about me except for one thing it will determine what you are you know that determines what you are I'm not trying to make you believe me I'm trying to say this is what the Bible says about the fivefold ministry what the Prophet says about the fivefold ministry and then it's left into your hands what to do about it all right see then that way I'm not trying to straighten out this or produce this idea you know well the people are just not on mean and this that and the other you know and I'll use for pulpit against that having helped me I'll quit today when that comes into view because there's never been no such thing because you're going to find out before we finish this that your prophet said it's not the preacher that's doing the preaching he said it's God that's doing the preaching you see you ever take a lot of reading well if that ain't according to the word then it ain't God preaching through the person I don't care who it is that solves that problem you know I mean we're to have enough sense to know you say well these preachers out here say God leading them and they're preaching Trinity and they even give you signs and wonders to back up what they're talking about how when it's not true so they can't be telling the truth right because it ain't according to the world what I want to do is approach that fight for ministry by the thoughts of the world of what it says about it and then leave you with with whatever you want to do cuz that's not not my problem that's yours alright see so I wrote it like this if we're required that's trying to end the message putting this message in between we'll start on the virtues the Lord willing Wednesday alright then asking the question that we're required to have the Bible reveal to us or whatever you wanna call it statute of perfectman adoptions and the time the Bible being revealed if we're required to how the Bible revealed to us then how is it to be done now we know for surety that the faithful ministry is not the ones to bring the message me are you in there and if Ifill ministers not the ones bringing the message God sent us a prophet to bring the message it's not my message I try to preach the truth of the Bible and that's brother branham's message he'll get the honor and glory from because he brought the message unto us but whatever you do with the line and the channel that goes between between you and God and that's the way he'll honor it called brother Brennan says you honor the gift God will honor you see that's what I want to make sure that we understand so I'm going to make the statement while you wait enough to listen to it and put it hard and strong there's an entirely difference between the Prophet could fulfill all the offices but Ryan could fulfill all of the five ministry offices all right he did because he was pastor he was this he was that he could do all of that all right but he's the only one that could do because you can't cross gifts no I'm not quoting the Prophet you you can't cross gifts if you're a pastor be a pastor I can't stand that to wear that you got to pastors of the church and they're going 50 75 percent of the time from their church I've never done that when I was coming up so he's shorter know what I'm 78 I'm not gonna start it now you know I've always stayed with the church and very rarely missed any service whatsoever because I've always either been you know here with somebody else preaching or preaching themself because I believe in that I don't believe that the pastors or to be out running and preaching like everything there's nothing wrong with a pastor going somewhere preaching services or something or preacher convention or preach some things you know that's nothing wrong with it because that's fine within the other parts time you ought to be with his own church teaching these people and you'll see that's why a lot of people leave churches right because their pastor is not never around you know that's just his honesty I can be if it's required that we have the virtues we must find the channel whereby they are to come then walk in that channel to let God unfold the things unto us did you catch what I'm saying if we are supposed to have the virtues God has already supplied everything he brought us a prophet to bring the message that was what was ending up this morning talking about Malachi for Malachi force to do two things one turned the hearts of children back to the faith of the father to reveal the seven thunders which is a revelation detained in the seven seals it'll be these divinely revealed truths that literally turn our hearts back okay we got that settled the Prophet come to bring those things all right he brought the opening of the word he brought the restoration of back to the faith of the fathers and then God went on into the message and opened up the entire things that were held secret from the beginning and let him bring those things through the opening of the seals all right and like I said this morning now you think what you won't I'm pastor I'm gonna say what as much as I can of what the truth is you say well brother Dale we agree we're about to we believe that thunders has been revealed but said we don't we don't know the new name all right that's the only thing you can argue with me about it because I'll show you where brother Brennan said all the mysteries have done been revealed so you know better than to argue the point so drop that out of your mind this message has already been brought there's no such thing as brother branham to come back and teach us a message that has not been taught or give us some secret something I don't look for that I'm sorry maybe you do you look for him to come in and the one thing you stop and argue with him about you'd say what's the new name of Jesus whoa brother branham what is the new name of Jesus he said maybe they would be made known when we get to her we see you're not going to put your life behind that statement come on is it is it true that's the words if you need it I'll find it for you maybe it'll be made known when we get to her because you don't need it here you need Redemption here you don't need it when you get beyond the curtain of time or get into glory you don't need redemption anymore see most people thanks brother Browning's got to come back and preach some secret mystery to change our bodies well show me where it's at cuz it's what I said you do all you want to you're gonna come back to one thing if we sit down and talk you gonna come back to one thing there's one thing you can argue about because I'm gonna quote you brother branham all the mysteries is now history there's no more mysteries you looking for bread around to come back and bring us mysteries you got a problem because he didn't finish his message while he was here then then you ain't got no background to hold it on so you can say well I'll argue well I just didn't watching you name it you'll be made known when we get there yeah I can quote as well as you can all right see I'm not trying to do I've made myself quite clear about the tents and the things all the way down the return ministry design they'll be after the resurrection 30 to 40 days according to the Prophet between the resurrection and the change brother branham could preach all across the country but he won't need no Jedi replying to flywheel he won't need nothing like that and that's what gets me is people come up with her ideas see well run around he's got how that plane well what about that plane brother well we got it sitting down yonder and said it'd take us two years to get it to flying you don't tight man don't believe brother Browns coming back for two years okay who he is what he said he just said it said it came fly for two years if I was saying that I'll tell you this away to not be derogatory they change that white horse ever so often at Mohamed's thing he ain't gonna have to wait on the white horse if he jumped out of that grave the horse is ready all he's got to do straddle and take off right if I was dependent upon brother Brown having to have an airplane that I had that our plane would pull out on the runway every day and it would fly and it would come back and it would be refueled to the top it would be reconditioned as much as I could do without making it too worth it it wouldn't work immediately I'm just saying that people see you listen to people but then when I say something I'm saying I believe the Prophet and what he says well my dependence is not upon what you say he says it's on what he says he says all right see then that away I'm leaving a tire okay because I believe see the fivefold ministry there's knows I said this morning then there's no quotes that I can find if you could find one I want you to give it to that it says that the Prophet was further perfecting the science I want scripture I want the Prophet know but the script says the fivefold ministry is for the perfecting the Saints the Prophet said the fivefold ministry for perfecting the science I've told you when I started there is no such thing as this powerful ministry having a message of its own no way the prophets already brought the message if you think you're gonna get something he didn't bring you ain't fivefold ministry forget it I'm playing to say it you're not a minister because you're thinking about getting something of your own my total dependence is upon this message I have no thoughts whatsoever to try to bring my message of any thoughts it's total dependent upon that the Prophet brought the message but now here is the point I believe then the message has been brought okay to its fullness by the Prophet as to what he was supposed to bring of Redemption salvations the things you know preach us all the way to the future home so if he came back what was he telling us you know and bring something in the mysteries of redemption get it he can preach to us he can tell us how glorious it is he can do all the things you can bring a great messages for 30 40 days but it won't be by salvation because salvation to be completed when you're changed right you ain't gonna need a message after this this message is gonna bring the change or somebody's I've missed it somewhere and I'm not trying to be against anybody that believes intent doctrines in huh no way that's what he used to be an older now they call it return ministries and all kind of but look at the ones that's followed to return ministry and see how many of them has fallen now but others has fallen to but if we believe the Prophet brought the message all right now it's in the stage of the fivefold ministry to take that message and I got it in here we're brother Branham said these young men will take this message and break it down and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord there's no greater honor in the world if you ask me for golf run for president of the United States I would tell you you were I mean if you guaranteed me you're the president of the United States all you got to do is walk up and say hi I ain't going because that'd be a degrade the greatest height of anything could be is to stand in the pulpit and declare Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever that's the greatest height that anybody could ever want or think about you'd be degrading me to ask me to do something like that because this it's already there the ministries here the Prophet had brought his part while we've been 50 years why have we been 50 years since he left because the people hasn't caught on to what supposed to take place see if we accept I'm trying to lay it all what's listening we accept right around him as the prophet we accept him as the messenger of the age we accept him as the truth that he brought but do we accept him when he says that the ministry has to break it down do we accept that and see that's why I said every while ago I don't mind stating it because that's what people say I read the statements about your pasture he's ordained to lead you through and you say well brother wrong it's my pasture well you you're the one that's got the problem not me because he you can't a tape recorder as a pastor you can't have books is he a pastor you say well he's my pastor I don't care what yourself show it to them in the Bible I'll show you to the opposite direction I'll show you where Brennan said Jezebel didn't understand but they have with her I mean but Elijah was her pastor whether she liked it or not he didn't have any trouble with that because that was what the truth is all right let's get in the hurry now to read thinking about it trying to cover what has what is happening and what's been wrong as I said we accept the Prophet we accept his message we accept that to be and we're not looking for something else you know we're not trying to set aside and brother so-and-so coming along and all and you see the people this message they do that especially you get a young minister he comes along and he's fired up and he's going and really and wanted to do people just flocked to him they run to him because they can't expect if there's any signs and wonders and things name listening to what he's saying they're not hearing what he says because they're caught up in an ecstasy but listen what about it now what about Ephesians 4 that tells you let's read that we'll start from there if I don't finish this off finish it Wednesday that's no problem if I read what all does here we will be Winston Richard was looking at in the councii they've kind of under understaffed in the back a little you know someone had to move around to different positions and here I come in with 30-something quotes when a lot of times I've only got two or three he come in all right let's get this started Ephesians which would be number seven and let's just lay down the scriptures while you're getting there I'll read this one while they're getting that one up run around them on the statue of a perfect man paragraph 406 407 408 I think it hit and once he said build me up O Lord into this let Christ be my head that working through me on my foundation my faith is in him let virtue knowledge temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness working me O Lord is my prayer I don't care it live or die sinker drowned denomination or no denomination friend or no friend let that work in me let Christ virtue his knowledge flow out that I may might be able to teach those and listen to him where God has said in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists all for the perfecting and bring in all of these virtues into it okay come on for that perfection of the coming of the Son of God each one of these stones are a material of the other one etcetera and these berkshires belong to him and they're pouring out of him down through them but he you listening to what he's saying fivefold ministry for what's to bring wife are the perfect yonder in bringing all these virtues into it for that perfection of the coming of the Son of God now that's the fivefold ministry he names who he places them alright we got plenty of more to go with that but we're going to go with right now go to number seven which is Ephesians 4 but if ever one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive and he gave gifts unto men now listen what are those gifts what gifts did he give to man what do you give speaking tongues against yeah foolery that's it huh let's got his place well what does he say the gifts are come on the gift cigar speaking of tongues shouting I steals God gives gifts but what does Paul say about the gifts and he gave gifts unto men now that he ascended what is he but what is yet but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth he that descended is the same also that ascended up far above all heavens that he might fill all things and he gave some now here's the gifts right he give gifts what's the gifts he's gonna name them right so don't worry about tongues shout all that skills that's those the the title of the messages is is gifts you know but listen he that descended is the same n he gave some apostles some prophets some evangelists are see gifts and some pastors and teachers he gave gifts which was his faithful ministry was that the same thing the Prophet up here said fill me up Lord that I may teach for the bringing of this oh come on where God has said in church hostile teachers pastors evangelists all for the perfecting and bring in all these virtues into it for that perfection of this coming of the Son of God now your prophets declared what the five four ministries to do I declared back there in statement to you of the things I believe about the fivefold ministry we don't have a message of our own Cyrus were you gonna throw the people don't throw it now we don't have one the Prophet brought the message come on you ain't listening to what I put back before this message Moses was the only man that went to heaven to get to pattern to build a temple by David and Solomon and them that brought it together you know that built the pyramids to represent cry never has in there that they went to heaven and got the pattern Moses got it why cause Moses was a prophet you didn't need nobody else Solomon didn't need something else David didn't need something if he had the profit that profit build a tent sitting over there Solomon built great big monstrosity over here but they said the same thing this has got to be the same as that that's got to be the same as this card he didn't you missed the whole point and Enoch kept it all off by building a pyramid in stone he never talked to Moses but he knowed all about it but none of them went up you understand the message come to Moses that's why the Ten Commandments come to Moses they didn't come to the others the others was to take what Moses said and bring it out to the people they'd have been okay if they'd have stayed with it that way but they didn't nut so are we huh well look at the gifts he give and he gave some apostles and some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we call come into the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ that we hits floor demote be no more children whether we get the knowledge on this one there would be no more children tossed to and fro and curd about with every wind of doctrine by the sleight of men and cunning craftiness whereby they lie in wait to the sea but speak the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together and compacted press to heaven by that which every joint supplies according to the effectual work in the measure of every part making intercession of the body unto the edifying of itself in Christ a fivefold ministry is for the perfecting of science now what is the word perfecting mean there's not the fivefold ministry to get another message to make them perfect it's not at brother Branham just brought it up so far like they say brother Branham swept off the foundation and thank you don't remember some of them doctrines they just swept off the foundation now we're to build the building know no more than David note anything about it other than building it according to Moses all he had to do was build that building according to Moses because Moses was the prophet Moses was allowed to go in and out and everything else review old Bible once they finally unknown at that place and they had to stop but you know there's get the point Moses brought the message the others just built Moses never got out and hammered sawing and in doing this and fixing that and doing that Moses didn't do that Moses sitting back under shade tree he saw you ceiling well doesn't I be I'm stupid too but I got a little sense Moses didn't get out there working he had the rest of working but they worked according to his design right he was the one in charge I don't care if Joshua said this needs to go here Moses says no yeah but this sticks out a little bit and he said don't worry about it it'll fit we just got some other stones to bring in right I'm just illustrating it brother branham brought the message it wasn't just a return message to the faith of the fathers that was a part of it it had to be done were you and I could understand he brought the message of eternal life I've always asked you to do it just go home and take one in little books details all the titles of the sermon and go in 1963 and read the titles of the sermons till 1965 try some history unveiling God mighty God unveil who is this male charity future whom every one of them has eternal life little random brought us the message of eternal life that's why I don't have to worry about it all I got to do is build a temple according to Moses you follow me I just need to be a good David in the Solomon to build it according to Moses because I got him in front of me and what brother branham say he said you say when I say he said cause I'll be responsible he all right and I never heard but two parts of the early part of the ministry where brother Branham was teaching the white horse rider as the Holy Ghost you know that God would not condemn me for teaching it until that they come when truth I faced it then I would have to change over do you understand what I'm talking about you understand what was on that man's back you really realize of all of our lives and everything it was depended upon whether or not he could be who God said he was no he's not God no but he was the messenger from God he was the one to tell us about God and once he reached the place I think reached all I believe on adoptions and things yes once he reached the place to go out there and meet that angels of the Lord I believe that was his adoption you can believe what you want to that's no problem with me I believe that was when he was adopted when the cloud came down and full into full ministry you know what was being said you ever heard brother Branham say that God says he said he steps back when he adopts his son he steps back and says if you hear any more you're gonna hear from him there's to hear you him if you hear any more you're gonna hear from him because he's now in charge I understand but what is it what was the gifts given done under man the fifo ministry don't make them nothing they don't make nothing for me to be a part of the fivefold ministry you can't serve over that's God I'm a preacher you know we're gonna get to that in a little bit don't we won't we'll get to it Wednesday night or next Sunday get some college there without repentance right you don't repent to get a gift but there's non spiritual gifts it can go from one person to another one and only be used one time in your life that's non spiritual gift with the fivefold ministry in the end the gifts of where you you can it can go from one to the other speaking in tongues or discernments or anything remember that we'll have to answer with the fivefold ministry answers only to the Prophet come on I could stay with you all day long because God has revealed all these things for 40 years how could Paul condemn Philip this and Jaime Gnaeus or teaching the resurrection was passed when he was where they got it from because he was teaching the resurrection was passed come on they took it wrong and made it the physical he was talking about the spiritual but because they were against him he could turn them over to Satan for the destruction I couldn't do it you couldn't do it look Paul could he said it's why you don't feel food with gifts you either got a gift or you don't got a gift and there's no such thing as to seek the most earnest gift let's just say well I'm pastor and I need to seek being a an evangelist I need to seek being a they don't have them to do with that that has to do with your non spiritual gifts your non spiritual gifts you are to seek the most earnest our best gift for the operation of Christ but not so in the film industry by film industry is predestinated gifts are predestinated I'm reading brother branham willory know the nine spiritual gifts is predestinated before knowledge the fivefold ministry has predestinated straight from God to the people falling right behind the Prophet if you don't believe that's true I'll ask you what happened when Moses passed on I ain't saying they're supposed to bend somebody stepped up now don't get your garbage can running somebody ain't to step up I'm just illustrating when Moses stepped off the scene there was Joshua but remember Joshua was a prophet this prophet left that prophet was just to bring more talent it's no such thing now no such thing as you thinking well now what it should have been brother Branham brought the message but when he stepped off the scene other day a wish to take over no no no the fivefold ministry who are we supposed to follow the fivefold ministry dr. Brennan will make statements that sounds so outstanding said will a bride have a ministry he said sure she consists of apostles prophets evangelists pastors and teachers he said that's what the fivefold ministry you see that's why you can't go no higher than your pastor because if he's a true pastor he's going to take you to Christ the word and you're not going any higher who would want to okay let's start reading okay go ahead we'll start with number 8 and we'll read and go as far as we can and then we'll take up Wednesday or in the Bible and they'll get this one it said there was set out apostles prophets evangelists teachers pastors all these for the perfecting of the church God set them in the church God set the gifts so I gave the gifts not to nine spiritual gifts separate that when you were reading gifts and it stays with the Ministry get the ministry that's the gifts because those gifts are higher than this natural gifts come on all these for the perfecting of the church God set them in the church now there's nine spiritual gifts that we can lay hands on and so forth and pray earnestly for the best gifts okay but you don't lay hands on the FIFO ministry to give them a gift of ministry you only lay hands on them as a congregational group as two people to show that you honor that and they're respected among you and as part of the ministry you don't lay it on there for gifts now we know the truth you can't lay hands on the non spiritual gifts to get a gift the gifts and callings are without repentance you either got it or don't got it you're born with it what about the fivefold ministry that's why you don't vote a preacher in and vote him out it's done every day in this message and they ain't no scripture far show me the scripture where you can vote a pastor in vote him out he's the way I just spin it well show it tell me that's going to me you don't vote on the fivefold ministry God ordained that we'll read a lot of it listen now there's nine spiritual gifts that we can lay on the hands and so forth and pray earnestly for the best gifts and so forth like that but these others are predestinated gifts of God God set them in the church the fifl ministry right through the age that's coming and John the Baptist was a special forerunner for the age God just for ordained him to do that work do you believe that now what's he talking about John no you know before because listen do you see he's a prophet he's more than a prophet prophets are not voted into office right our prophets not fivefold ministry prophet he's not even voted but what about a prophet like brother Branham he was ordained a prophet from the foundation of the world but at the same time he was ordained a prophet the fivefold ministry was ordained right with him now you tell me I'm wrong the gifts and callings of God are without repentance come on let's read go to the next one watchman's one of the night paragraph 81 we should this be rolled over and over and I'll tell you what I'd done in this and you know my cut and paste everybody know I just couldn't put it and go and tape it and I just I never tried to make a line up this one message I never tried to make a line up I just took them as they came put them down took them as they came whatever they fall in line so you're gonna hear me read something here this says identically in the next quote are you gonna hear it cause I just picked him up I didn't want to do to try to say some line that you would say well that he line these up to kind of make that look like I don't have to do that if it's God if God if not then we don't worry about it this is all the message watch them on what of the night but you know him and you know me so just make me Lord by divine gift that was ordained before the world begun and this ministry should be in this day just like a ministries or ordained for that God places in the church apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists so forth God does that that's his ordained gifts he doesn't that's his ordained gifts let's read as many as we can okay greater than Solomon number eight be that was a day he will innate be alright and you'll see by ABCD that up with these and later on as it come along I just took them in all right this is from the message greater than Solomon is here prophets how the Word of God and are born to profit a gift of prophecy is different that's a gift I'll give the prophesies a gift are you getting the Knights personal gifts as gifts but the fivefold ministry is ordained to be that it's not just a gift that can go from one person to another one it's not something that you seek the best gift well I'm I'm a pastor but I ain't getting paid too good so I'm on becoming evangelists prophets how the Word of God and are born to profit I'll gift of prophecy is different that's a gift now there's nine there's five ordained gifts in the church apostles prophet teachers pastors evangelists now that's the five gifts that God places in the church by his foreknowledge then there's nine gifts that's locally in the church right speaking in tongues interpreting of tongue and give the wisdom and knowledge and prophesy and so forth them nine spiritual gifts that operate through the church but then there's not there five office gifts what's that wording he's using five office gifts that God puts in the church and how we love to see them all operating one of them is the pastor teacher and those things in the others comes along in confirmation gifts are to magnify and God just got it so even a fool will be will not be excused with all right listen so what are you getting that going to the next influence this is 1963 well the days we say the days of miracles is past we say while they're getting that pulled up we say well we don't see nothing going on now I just put this in the end so I want you read it see we say well the days the miracle is fast I can show you where God ordained miracles right now you can't tell me where he ever took it away we don't relate that to the right way see he ordained gifts he never did see where he took it away he gave the gifts he never took him away it's the Scriptures go into all the world preach the gospel to every creature what because its gifts cannot be taken away but now the nine spiritual gifts they can go up and down brother Branham I'll read you in a little while across one where he says they can even be passed from one person to another right but the fivefold ministry don't change that's why the preachers of this message you don't even know their scriptures what's the call to preach I've asked ministers this question what's the call to preach well you know I just I got to this and I got to that and I got insisting hard trouble the last one guard one day could I be a preacher and he said you know he didn't say not so I just accepted it Paul tells you what the call to preach is I stand here for 40 years I know what God what my call was I've said it over 40 years what it is I had to worry about it Paul said that his calling was the mystery that he had to preach come on read your Bible he said the mission wherever I'm called Paul's call was the mystery of the ingression of the Gentiles the adoptions the things that he brought you know what my call is to tell you what that prophet said I don't have a message then I have parts that he's dealt with me about and I've talked these ministers that you will have certain scriptures that will stand out in your life as you go along mark those scriptures even the natural people than that you know delay it t mark the scriptures that are brought to you women men whatever those scriptures has to do with your inner being because I believe in God speaking to the lung congregation as well as speaking to the fivefold ministry as well as he spoke to the Prophet I'll show you where he put it in you show me where it come out listen preach the gospel what's the next from the message there's God there's God change his mind 65 I do not believe that you lay hands on the people and give them guilt and even then the nine spiritual gifts who don't work you either got it or don't got it Paul wouldn't say and he said I'm putting laying hands on to stir up the gift the fact of coming from your what was it her his grew grandmother or something loss or units or something he brought it down because that was where the gift dropped down to come to that person he said I'm just laying on hands to activate and that the words get you to you they are listening I do not believe that you lay hands on people and give them gifts if some callings are without repentance they are predestinated of God to meet the age and the time of that age any Bible student knows that's the truth Moses was born just in time Jeremiah in time all the rest of them John the Baptist's in time Jesus in time and we're in time right we're in time going to the next time tested she tested faith produces goods you don't lay hands on one another for them God gifts God has said in the church Jesus was the son of God in the garden predicted to see to the woman and crying in the wilderness from John Dawei gifts and callings are not somebody's done it's what God that's done it's not what somebody has done somebody's done it's what God has done they're born they're raised up with them it's what God has done now he called some of us to preach some of us to teach some of us with different spirits of operation now there's well our non spiritual gifts in the local body see now there's a gifts of prophecy that could be on any person in here tonight and maybe never own them again that just comes and goes there's quite a difference between the spirit of prophecy and a prophet listen a spirit of prophecy is to be judged by two or three that has discernment therefore it can can ever be given to the church before it can ever be given all right listen when the Old Testament prophets stood Isaiah Jeremiah they had thus saith the Lord they didn't answer to nobody a prophet don't answer there's nobody right a prophet answers to God I'm talking about brother branham's ministry him and the Prophet I'm talking about an ordained prophet for the aged and what needs to be brother Branham never had to answer it or nobody he didn't have to be judged but if you got this guilt you can be you don't have to be judged and that show me where the thigh bone industry hasn't you said what do you think and just preach anything you want to yelling the fivefold ministry and do that anyway that's sensible you do that anyway but if your fivefold ministry you're gonna be judged by the Prophet oh okay now we've hit something that breaks a lot of things right you realize that the way that I bring this message you realize brothers that are ministers in this church the way you bring this message you're going to answer to the messenger of this age the way I handle this message and what I do I'll have to stand before the Prophet you see how serious it is you don't swap places with it no you don't want the place you want to run the place it's like I've always said about you know you go into a building you've got a president if I spread it in vice president don't ever want to be President why cousin got too many decisions to make so he wants to be vice president we can tell the president what to do powerful Minister okay all right he calls us to preach so much to teach different spirits go to the next one ATF and then gifts where Paul said now listen to it now remember what I said want to go up there on one of the quotes where he said offices remember that in the court of two before I said remember that offices look at this one man b14 I pray earnestly for the best gift that's church gifts that's not offices the fivefold ministry is an office the fivefold ministry is an office that God has ordained okay listen there's get there's a gift and did an office it's an office that's a profit there's a lot of difference between a profit and the gift of prophecy before a gift of prophecy really should be given in the church it has to come before to our three judges that's got the gift of discernment to say whether it can be said but never did you see anybody stand before Isaiah to judge you understand what he's saying not stand before Isaiah to judge he's saying who can stand before I didn't tell him a different way you understand are you reading that sensible reading you're reading it word for word now I'm reading what he's saying it can given in the church he has to come before two or three judges that's got the gift of discernment to say whether it can be given but never did you see anybody stand before I say up to judge the he was born to prophet them prophets they were they had dust at the Lord right up through right up through life see it's a lot of difference between gifts that's my title it's spiritual gifts because they are spiritual gifts you lay it to you have your gifts give some college or without repentance you have your gift you have the things that are to be there to discern what the speaking in tongues all of the different things the Atlantis got their gifts I encourage you to use those gifts because I have to quote what the Prophet said he's in any church without the gift it's gonna have to give an answer now that's the direct quote some like to give an answer what kind of an answer would I give now this has happened what kind of an answer what I give brother call he stands up and he speaks in tongues and I grab him sit down said now you interpret it or shut up a minister done that now if God had moved on the sing you know who I think would went out the door not brother Colley because he was honest but you see people say well now tell you what man we keepin it straight around here you don't want the gifts to expose you Oh see that's why I believe in games I believe God can speak through brother Kali and interpret it through brother IO and tell you whether I'm right or wrong oh yeah but you're not for all you know you gonna stand for nobody code if I'm a true gift I'll take correction but if I'm not now that I go okay come on infallibility infallible proof of the resurrection priests in 57 I different with some of you theology ology of laying your hands on one and setting this one apart and that one apart and giving them this one gifts God gives gifts give some callings or without repentance that's not altogether the heaviest teaching that's Bible teaching listen there see the word impossible they are gifts many they are gifts ministering spirits since from the presence of God the minister and every office of God do you believe a fivefold ministry is an angel you've read brother Branham was an angel come on that's why he stands for nobody you go straight to the presence of God the fivefold ministry don't stand before people they go straight to the message your brain is dying a little bit tighter than I thought you know I'm showing you this is a dangerous place it's a dangerous place to walk into ministry and proclaim to serve yourself is to be a minister it's deadly you don't have to give an account for me but around says you don't said your wife don't have any given account for you I said you gotta give an account for her so is it with the turmeric now look in every office then in the local group there's nine spiritual gifts that come into the audience that don't belong to any it's just belong here it's just in the local church you see when they do this and one this one may do this and this one may never do it again this is one over here and that's just local gifts trying to get you to see one time the non spiritual gifts they can move from one person to another one and you seek the most earnest gift but when you move up in the fivefold ministry I am trying to trade the places with nobody not just what I am and I have to remain that because I'm in that part all right listen let me get a couple more and we'll quit too Wednesday I just hope you remember what I've tried to bring out number nine from the word message perseverance 62 I believe that there's a church coming into that perfection that Ministry of perfection were the offices now what's the offices where the offices were apostles prophets teachers fighted evangelist for the perfecting of the church then pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord I believe that I believe that we're nearing that time now powerful ministry for the perfecting of the church let's go another way Jesus Christ number 10 Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever 62 now what happens here a gift now the Bible said for these minister brothers the Bible said that God has said in the church five different gifts is that right has now there's nine gifts in the local church just on one or the other but five ministerial gifts apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists is that right five spiritual gifts now those gifts are for the perfecting of the church that keeps the church in order pastors teachers evangelists to keep the church in halter right perfecting then Jesus came but God has said in the church five different gifts apostles prophets teachers but those are part of perfecting of the church that is his proof his ministering spirit to the church to bring the body of Christ together by foam industry here you him recent fifty-eight sufficient for God's need he has said in the church gifts first apostles are missionaries both the son apostles mean the one sent mission Irving's one sent apostles prophets teachers evangelists they're all predestinated gifts of God gifts and callings are without repentance they're placed in the church to bring the church together hold it together for the glory of God by film industry will stop on that one because I got plenty more mm-hmm what is your whole point of what you're trying to say brother Dale God has brought us a prophet we've got the message thank God for the technologies and the things where we can look it up and see what is saying you know what have we've back in Luther Wesley or something like that when they wouldn't even hardly get a book about what to teach here regardless we can go to the message to see what this prophet teaches we can go to my agency I can go to the message to find the things that he's saying to me you can go to the sign message to see whether or not I'm saying what he said what a wonderful day you say that puts you on the spot I've been on the spot all my life I think the joke is truth when I come into this message I realize one thing for sure the Prophet was the Prophet not me the prophets message was the message not what I'd say first sermon I preached in this message in 1969 in Athens Georgia the old hollyhocks the brother had went off someone wanted me to preach and I spoke Park and I preached that the bride of Jesus Christ would be the son of man on the earth that she'd be the final voice to the final age I'll show you the notes are in my Bible that she would be the Bride of Christ would be the fullness of the Godhead bodily this is 69 this is when we didn't have the doing we got ever concordance we could get but 90% of the concordance has had about 15 pages of false doctrine now you that was back there know I'm telling the truth they had their own ideas brother so-and-so put out a concordant his first 15 pages were proving his point I just matter to me I took them to get the truth then I made my own way don't 70s reels and you some of you sisters can type Feist enough to be able to type off what brother Branham says you know and do it uh-huh I had to run about five words and stop it and write it down and I'd back it up and I'd put down about ten words not back up and come find out I couldn't even keep ten words Trey you ever try when I backed up went over it backed up when I was like out what he said because I believed it and I wasn't looking for something to glorify me or to make me something I was looking for something because it was going to be anything and I was in no way thinking about a ministry up until about that time but if there was going to be anything that my ministry would have to line up with the Prophet you said we're brother Dale what tell us what you think your ministry is what I said while ago my ministry is to teach you or talk to you about the things the Prophet has taught not what I think about it not what you think about it but what he had to say about it that's my ministry and then it's hard thing that it's always been when nobody would touch Daniel 70 weeks right they won't even do it today back in the 70s I was speaking on those things to try to bring light of truth comes brother Branham said it he's if you don't understand daniel said new ish you can't understand the seals that's direct quote right in front of you Daniel 70 weeks book but even till this day they don't want it they don't want truth that ain't nothing to me I'm just saying that seemed like that my ministry when people were talking about the new birth or talk about adoption or a statue a perfect man it just always seemed to be that I would try to bring forth what I could see what that prophet is saying I've done what I desired to do I desire to bring to you a message from brother branham's message not my own but to distant libraries that word illustrate bring out or what on what he said to bring it out in the open how many of you heard me say this you can put my name on your on the tab your name on my tapes and send them to the world because I don't want no glory I've been offered a lot of things in this message I don't want it I want Jesus Christ to live in you there's my greatest goal and honor mr. not argue about doctrines and ideas but to believe what the Prophet is said cuz I believe that ever doctrine he brought is in the Word of God but I believe it's in there and it's so hidden from mankind until there's no way for mankind to get it so they have to follow the fivefold ministry so are you willing to follow it are you willing to put everything you got on the fire for ministry you know I see some of you saying well ain't nothing else to do so much more stick around well it's alright I've told you the way I am I wouldn't listen to a lot of preachers in this message that are big names at boy you know man they're the ones both tell us what to do know the prophets already told us what to do he brought the message I'm just as you want to call it and I don't believe in being a parakeet you know what I mean by parakeet is to quote as a quote to the quote I believe in saying the Prophet said so and so and now here's why he said it you said well that makes you interpret it come show me anytime I preach anything the door is open for you to come and say brother Dale I don't agree with this we have no problems the problem is is when you go tell everybody else that you don't agree you could at least come and tell me and discuss it it said well bro they'll all agree we right here right here yeah it's okay you understand certainly what I'm talking about so I believe a fivefold ministry is to take this message let me give you that last quote you see if I can find it they can if I can get to it it's 33 32 33 off the message things that are to be it's number 32 brothers if you don't notify stuff but I'm very thankful for these open doors that I've had to go into an inspiration is give to young men like your pastor here let's call them as I'm beginning to get old and know that my days are numbered and know now that these young men can take this message and sweep it on to the coming of the Lord but you know what most people is done the Prophet finished the message they said I am waiting on him to come back and tell them something else I'm not against that I'm against you sitting down I'm not trying to interpret I'm trying to tell you I'm against you sitting down just stop him cuz you're gonna die well who are you I love this statement right here run up 31 just back go every which way up or down and look what he said this is off the message believe in God 1952 now that's my Commission that's what God gave me what he gave ever gospel preacher who will believe him wait to give ever gospel preacher that believe him what is the one thing he's give ever gospel preacher they believe look that's what God gave me is what he gave ever gospel preacher who will believe him what to give the power and authority to break that spirit I believe with all of my argh that ever diamond power that's in here at this minute is already broken I do I believe that every sick person in here right now feels a lot different raise up raise your hands you who to sit you know but what's the power given to any preacher the power and authority to break the spirit there's another quote I'll find it to break Satan's spell he has over your eyes that God can speak straight to you that's all I'm trying to do trying to get that spell broke off of your eyes that God can speak not to me did he can speak to you that should be the glory and honor and a thoughts of any Minister is to try to break Satan's spell he's got over your eyes that God can speak to you let's take ministers come away musicians come on we'll read some more quotes sometimes you that how these noses bring them back will you entity because the Prophet said a lot of things about the fivefold ministry let's see if we believe it well okay if we don't believe it then we'll take it out of the message that distracted you did it if you don't believe it won't stake it out that's what a man told me about the guilts one time what is it during the first Corinthians 13 there's something about to give some time he said dad don't let me tuck out of the Bible that's okay give me your Bible right give me your Bible you see what I said I'll take it out you know what I'd have done if you'd give it to me I'd have tore that out not hand it back to us and that's not in your Bible anymore he knew better than in with that Bible he knew if I'd got a hold of it I take it out why cause if it ain't work nothing take it out the entire Bible is God's Word God has given us the answer to everything we have need of it's in his Bible he sent the prophets he sent the people to bring that word that would be his word speaking straight down those prophets were not God but they were the closest thing that could ever be to God on this earth and you know what they still stand Moses today stands between you and God we just think about those Israelites and all they're doing all I can know Moses is standing before between God you know us every prophet is standing there to try to get us to line up to the word see that way then we got a message we don't have to depend on nothing else we got a message we're not looking for another messenger we're looking for this message to be made alive the Prophet said after the door the Gentile church is closed God willing on the church and he said here doing one year what theologist tried to do in 2000 he said but he's doing it now that's why I'm in a great revival folks I've been in a revival ever since I've been in Mexico time in the revival of the opening of God's Word that is my glory and honor the grace I could think of it's for God to speak to you and me about his word what else would we want what would be greater the whole world and blue sea so what would be greater what do we got go ahead brother we'll pick it up Wednesday this go on and just keep reading at least you'll know when you get through with these two messages you're gonna know that Raphael believes the property and telling you that profits these in a five fold ministry and what is here fall trees that won't give me no raise right I won't demand an extra payment to bring down right cut it's my job my job is to try to turn you to the messenger the hour to try to get you to say that the message is right [Music] we mean brothers I've always believed it right now I need to say anymore we be happy since me anybody have a need in your body and for your dependence upon the word if it is then my job is complete [Music] yeah so now let's believe that you'll keep that same attitude no matter what they say what transpired that you try to do what you try to do right didn't that work whatever happens there's no responsibility it's believing it's all okay all right so that's what we won't find the father you heard our sister she has a drastic need in our life there Lord let it be this thing will bring for her the fact of children of God is real and concerned with even are these little trifle matters that we think of in life of our doing that he's right there so we ask you Father does this give our sister the right attitude of everything no matter what they say or do that she keeps it all in line we believe you we thank you Jesus son let's go believe it says anybody else [Music] you might have a name the church do we believe what has been saying know what I mean the Bible of what said about the problem and the Ministry of design what a wonderful opportunity what a wonderful opportunity for you and I to believe that our Father is gonna take care of everything no matter what happened he's right on the scene and he'll bless him some carrots straight through lava cause we're his children where's children he's done everything he can do he sent us all of these things they become for the perfecting of the Saints that ain't time to make nobody perfect the way we think about it perfection means to bring it to a completion the five for ministry is to bring this thing to a completion the prophet has done his part we bring it to a completion through the fivefold ministry then God can step on the scene without 30 40 days to shout glory hallelujah and have a wonderful time from the resurrection to the ascension we're not going to sit around look what do you know what I think resurrection took place when they come back and told Peter them that Jesus had raised it was a good footrace who wouldn't I think John beat Peter liar Marat he's got a little younger he beat him nice but to show you how the connection is John know wonderful honey would we look at Peter Peter had done been given the keys of the kingdom Peter done been given that word and set an order in his life and went against our John goat and he just steps out of the way Peter goes running in and sees he was the guy that order been there because it was put in his hands God gave the fivefold ministry as gifts to the people not as something that we try to bad eye on our honor or something no something that we believe [Music] then we believe we can say well when I get sick I'll call but we know who to call fivefold ministry all of these things are laid in our hands what are we gonna do it not looking for something to come we're looking right at what's taking place this is the greatest hour that had ever been upon this earth because you're gonna realize one day who you are and what you're here for and when you do is this gonna be short remember Jesus went to the Mount of Transfiguration tradeoff tricks figuration you went straight to Calvary it's not a long time draw it out when this is finished in the church realizing who it is and start moving real fast they'll all be finished but to be finished to those who know father we thank you for today and I pray that what we said we know that's been hard and different wordings and things but yet to say and to believe that you're the same yesterday today and forever and that the same God that was here on the shores of Galilee is the same God hearing his bride in the last days walking upon this earth and being polished by the word until we can walk off of this earth we love you and we thank you goddess and keepers in Jesus name Amen you're dismissed [Music] oh and how happy [Music] you [Music]
