========================================

everybody help you come get my change for the Lord amen we all come expect me to hear That's What We Believe come with my hearing hearing my word but Andre doesn't have to be introduced to all of us here because I've been here a few times before we appreciate it appreciate his wife coming to me pray the Lord and blessed let's just sing and let the Lord have his way his brother Andre head comes to speak the word of the Lord unto us that we may all have our Eyes Open the Eyes of My Heart of My Heart eyes foreign that's our design that's right Amen to see him or see him lifted up that's right same magnified all right to see him as the center of our lives right glory to see him with the preeminence that's our desire amen God bless you this evening and certainly good to be with you in the house of the Lord It's good to see Saints of light precious Faith one thing brother Dale for giving us opportunity to come by us good to see all the ministers by the way why don't you take your seats for just a moment as brother Bill said uh bro Andre's not traveling alone anymore amen thank you there you go I wasn't traveling alone before but like but like Adam in the beginning who was not alone but God said it's not good that man should be alone that's right and God said that again Amanda and he said that to another son that's right and so we're thankful to the Lord to have my wife here tonight uh we uh we've been married a little bit over two years now see brother Louise and his they were with us down in Venezuela when we got married there so I I asked the Lord oh I would love to be able to take my wife back and let her see the Believers family and friends and so she's uh she hasn't got Americanized thank God Amen but she's really she's really been enjoying herself amen everybody's made it real nice for her uh she got that Walmart bug but we don't just do Walmart she uh she's she's a a real good thrift store flea market everything else she saw see she's an expert in that now she's she's laughing at it she's gonna get me there all right you Brothers help me out it's Paradox to me I was listening to brother Brandon some time ago he was talking about he and his wife went shopping and he said after about an hour or so he said my feet started to hurt me and I I thought I said well now hold on just my own brother this is this is a man with the spirit of Elijah who who goes into the mountains this is a man that walks 30 miles a day yeah yeah and yet just one hour with his wife his feet were hurt so I told my wife I said sweetheart if brother Brown 30 minutes five minutes in Walmart my feet are hurt but she she know that's just you know I I like the teacher that's all right but we're certainly thankful to the Lord I a couple weeks ago I know you had your sweetheart banquet and Brother Joseph was telling me by the way you did a wonderful job and I guess many of you all were there with your sweethearts so wonderful and I understand he started on a series on relationship and marriage and how beautiful that is and how needed that is in this hour that we live in that's right but we we don't get too religious to that's right to give out our families and to to to know our position right that's it and we're thankful to to the Lord that we've had a message that has come to positionally places so we're thankful to the Lord for those things well it's been a few years since I've been by and uh uh you know 16 years ago the lord gave smoke to a Brother Joseph Canada my heart we were down in uh we're over in the sunset Mountain we've been praying about missionary work and the Lord spoke to our heart not going to Venezuelans and you know the last time we were here and we showed the videos and things we uh we didn't know if that was the country or not because we found out later that they spoke Spanish in Venezuela and we we didn't have any Spanish and so we thought well surely God wouldn't send send us to a country where we don't know the language right but his wonders to perform God you you can't figure out God his thoughts are higher than our thoughts all right but we're so thankful uh brother give me God bless you I see you there too we're so thankful that after 16 years of missionary work in Venezuela God has not only a Venezuela a few years ago we were over in Guyana Georgetown Guyana and we flew up to the Northwest Territory of Guyana and was there for about a month and worked with the Indians there with a brother named Desmond Ross we were also been going back and forth to Colombia for Bayonne Bogota those places we've just come from uh bull Vista and manaus Brazil and uh brother Dale's just in Brazil not too long ago and so we we see that God is he's Gathering his people come on man but I can tell you after 16 years of missionary work God has turned the corner amen and God is as brother around him said once he said the move is on for the bride that's the strength and so over the years I remember brothers and are we going down the Orinoco River there and we still go down the river we got two uh message church and the Deep Amazon jungle Juan Pierro one Yana mommy Church there we work with those and brothers I have constantly going back and forth and then not so deep in a place called Puerto ricuchi and uh Southern Venezuela the state of the Amazon when we first uh started there when I first started going back in 1998 99 with Brothers there were about 30 or 40 tribes that we would visit but now over the years uh that kind of kind of dried up and and God began to separate and now I'm out of all those tribes and those 20 groups that we used to visit in Puerto ricocha actually the Indians the cost of civilization and transportation that's come in it's preventing those Indians that believe this message to actually come to the church there for brothers I have pastors and so we see that God he's it's not running without a message that's right right it's not being enthused uh over the years it's more than that amen and God has a five-fold ministry that's right that's led by God I see it amen God is not a hit and miss this message is not hit and miss that's right this message is directed demand to a predestinated people that that happened near to here you see and so now we're the we see that God is really dealing now with the maturity of the Bride yeah exactly and that's the uh on the mission field that's what's going on with us really teaching brother Brown says teaching places the believer positionally what they are in Jesus Christ amen and how important it is in this day to know what you are in Jesus Christ who you are and what you've been raised up for and we're thankful that uh so when we look back over the years of the missionary work and seeing how God has uh blessed us over the years open doors we're thankful that we can look back and see evident fruit of the ministry right and that God has I remember going uh maybe a year a couple of years ago and we're missing at a certain place and they said brother Andre you remember the brother here said no he said he was one of your first converts I said no he wasn't my convert he would have been my comfort he would have fell away a long time ago yeah but we see those over the years that have been steadfastly minded and the broadcast to every woman in the Bible that represented the broad had to be steadfastly minded right and had to make a clear-cut decision amen all right and we see that in the life of Rebecca Rebecca she had to make a decision brother round preseason time of the decision right and God had been grooming her sure man working on her building character in her before Eliza ever got to her you said and so when the message came to her she had to make a clear-cut decision right Ruth had to make a clear-cut decision when the prophet preached that message Kim's one's Redeemer he said now Ruth her very life is in four stages like a Believer she had to she had to choose she had to decide and she made a decision and she told Naomi where you go I will go where you Lodge I will Lodge amen your people will be my people if your God will be my God Amen and where you die will die she had to make a clear-cut decision right because she was only a type yeah right and the type is never greater than the answer type and a greater than Ruth is here tonight and so we see Esther and the different women of the Bible because God uses these women of the Bible it might be Sarah it might be as we said uh Esther a ruse Rahab or Tamar or Hannah or Hattie Wright yeah right man God uses those women right time of the church all right amen and so we're thankful that people have made clear-cut decisions and and we see on the mission field now uh some just genuine articles of God right right there you go and that's so wonderful amen not in not in quantity but in quality and as I heard the brother said and we were speaking this weekend oh Jesus asked the question will the son of man Find Faith right when he returns to the Earth I'm thankful that he'll find Malachi for things right right when it returns to the Earth because it's Malachi 4 faith is the very Faith Of God himself it's translation Faith right it's rapturing Faith right it's it's the faith that when Jesus saw that Roman Centurion and he came to Jesus and he said now Master Lord I'm not worthy to come under your house said but I've watched you I'm a centurion and I have people under me I say go they go I say come they come and I've seen you speak to Spirit sicknesses yeah death right and your minister is different than the Pharisees or the Sadducees or the herodians amen he said if you'll just speak the word yep right that's Malachi for Faith speak the word amen and God speaks that word and so we're seeing that kind of quality of faith on the mission feeling amen amen that's just so wonderful when you see that there's no headquarter around the earth there's no organization by man it's not man LED right man handle it's all God and how beautiful it is when God is in the business and when God is taking care of those things amen and so we we still continue our work in Venezuela all across Venezuela I've been able to minister and and all of the states the 23 states there in Venezuela and that's just for the glory of God you understand all right God would take this insignificant negro and send them to South America and all these countries and things that's for his own good purpose he said right and so we're certainly thankful that we can report back and not just us I Wish Brothers would come it would be different he could tell you some of the great testimonies and that way when Jesus said if I bear witness of myself my witness is not true not that he was saying anything false right but he said the father he will bear witness exactly and so I love that that those other missionaries can come and share with you but I will share one thing with you that over the years have been have been very special to me and that's to see the people our Spanish book brothers and sisters have access to the message right when we first went down to Venezuela they had so many books so many tapes then after some years of going and me and different missionaries seen false Doctrine come up and different missionaries representing their ambition or right or their pet Doctrine and and our wonderful Spanish brothers did not have that the the access to the message as it were to to respond to that right when people would come down and say you know brother Robin said this and rolled around and said this and we believe this and that and too many times they say those things not placing them in the scriptures this message is script to it amen it's in the scriptures you see amen everything that the prophet be just right there in the scriptures Glory it's identified God identified all right right and so when we see those things and our precious Brothers not have that the access to that you have here with all the material and the resources that God has provided we should be very thankful right right and we are you know and so that has always been something very important to me one of my heroes was a man named William Tyndall yeah and when your Tinder was a great man then the 1500s he spoke seven different languages and he could speak those language so fluent that no one could tell exactly what his native tongue was you see right and so one day William Tinder was looking out the window and he saw the the farmer plowing and he knew the curse of Rome and the Nickelodeon how they would refuse the people to have the language the Bible in their language but something struck William Tyndall amen and William Tyndall said if God gives me the strength I will translate the Bible that even the farmer will be able to read the word of God and he did that he surely did and the Catholic Church tried to stop him but not until he had made so many copies when they finally called him and there in Belgium they took him to the stake burned him at the stake yeah and I say we're burning him he was singing victory in Jesus amen so what what opportunity we have right that Bible that you have did not come without price exactly blood lives were given amen that we have an opportunity to read the scriptures and know who we are and recognize who we are right right and so to make make this long story very short brother Luis chirago he asked me said bro Andre I'd like for you to come to Mexico with me it's been about how many years ago with Seth Rollins around 2004. and we went to Mexico and we met a wonderful Pastor brother Australia then Monterey Mexico and while we were there brother brother Luis was speaking to brother Australia and brother Estrella had all of these messages of in Spanish and I think it was a word word form and uh Word document form and so I said brother Lewis get all the messages you can get get everyone you can get yeah and so he got all the messages but they had translation errors you understand because the just the quality was not there but he got all the messages and I told I call Brother Carl harms who's been a sponsor of us and and our mission work I said brother Carl there's something on my heart he said what is it brother Andre I said brother Carl you know our Spanish believers they don't have the opportunity to look up quotes the way we do in polio View he said well what do you what are you thinking what's on your heart brother Andre I said maybe we can get these messages in the same format of the folio view right and so he said I'll contact the companies it called talk to Brother Joseph Brother Joseph Canada I talked to Brother Joseph and talked about putting them on the PDF format I think different things and so we brother Carl said I tell you what we'll we'll get the same company that built the folio View for the spoken word the voice of God and we did and he did and he sponsored that and we had 600 messages on folio that the Spanish Believers can look up quote but there are so many there were so many errors so I asked brother George Smith I said brother George what do we do he said take the hundred and sow good messages that we know are clean and you're gonna have to start from start over and so we got brother Antonio Velasquez our interpreter and and Venezuela real Caribe and a couple other brothers brother juancho another brother out west and and Venezuela and so we went to work the brothers went to work and then they would send the uh brother Antonio when because of the translation so sensitive you don't want to get it wrong you see because this is the work of the Lord and you don't want guesswork yeah see and so brother George Smith would permit brother Antonio Whenever there was a question would send these quotes to brother George and he would prove them send them back so after that after a few years we were able to bring a new disc with about 400 messages all the folio View and we're able to spread those all throughout South America and the status speaking countries of South America by the grace of God and so what happened how tremendous it was because I think two years ago or three years ago we had a call from Brother Ernie Venezuela Venezuela from uh from Brother Mitchell's church he said brother I know y'all have these Spanish messages we need those for the tape uh for the uh oh watch this for the message I thank you run away he said we need this for the message hub so I call Brother Joseph and I said Joseph send them all the messages that we have to put on the message Hub and so it gives me great uh uh privilege to say that this work that God had placed on our hearts to do we're able to hand it off to our brothers and Marcus Samantha brother Freddie pattis and sweetheart what's the other brother's name that works in with brother Freddie the Young Brother and these men are just on fire for God Amen and they've taken over this folio View and they're working very hard and so we were thankful that we could hand it off to them that means so much to me amen I'll tell you why the first Spanish-speaking Church started in marked with Samantha Venezuela there was a brother named Oscar or Oscar galdona who came up when brother Brown was preaching anointed ones at the end time several messages and he came to see brother Branham but brother Branham uh was very busy and brother Perry green came to brother Brown and said brother Branham there's a gentleman from Venezuela he's here he wants to talk to you about baptism and brother Brandon told Brother Peregrine you go and baptize him and so brother Peregrine did he went and baptized brother galdona and after that evening brother Brandon said now did you baptize him he said brother Peregrine said yes sir brother Brown brother Brown said now go preach for him yeah and that was brother Peregrine's First Missionary trip was down to Venezuela and he can tell you all about it but the thing was even though brother Brown had preached in Mexico and different South American countries they never knew about the message they only understood about the healing the first pool and those things but after brother gal Dona had been re-baptized in Christian baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then he began to get the messages and God just changed his heart and the light came on and brother got Donna he had went to Trinidad and and when he was a young boy it's there was uh his father needed work and the economy was very low in Venezuela at that time so his father when I was returning that and then Trinidad he learned his English and and and his English was just outstanding I had the opportunity to meet brother y'all doing and preach for him and and go to his home and and one of the most homeless man you'll ever meet but you'll never know that this man what's the god used this man to take the message to Mexico and he went to the Mexican brothers and they said yeah we know about brother Brown he came here in Mexico City there's a woman whose baby was dead that morning that was raised up there was a blind man you know Miracles but brother gal Donna said but yes but there was a but but there was a message that followed that and so they were able to take the message to Mexico and all the way down through Central America and all the way through South America and I thought Ma how wonderful this is that now how brother God used brother galadona to take that message to the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America and now that same bark is Samantha God is using young men amen with this technology right to take this message to give the photo of you out to pastors that when people come down with their false Doctrine or their ideas that they and say oh brother Branham said this they can say where did he say that and how thankful we are that we can combat that right that always has a comeback he's done amen Bless the people all right let's always say those things for the glory of God and and and and now you know I I was just thinking uh here I am God it's giving me a wonderful Venezuelan wife and and I'm not fluent in Spanish I I I like for you to think I am but I'm not but we're learning and I speak a lot of Spanish but we're we're learning and and so Lord Lord give us the opportunity Brother Joseph and I and brother Louise we'll be working on some uh a little something with some slides some videos like we did here a long time ago and uh show that to you so pray for us we we'll probably be getting back toward the end of April or the beginning of May we'll be headed back to Venezuela so just pray for us we'll be making some trips uh but a brother Marcio de Yama uh he's a brother from uh manaus and we'll be doing some work over in the the jungles of manaus and also through the city there of announcing both Easter so remember us if you don't have anything to pray about you have something to pray about right so we we thank the Lord for that amen well I'm not going to keep you long but certainly we we've come to glorify the Lord and come to hear his word Heaven and Earth will pass away that's right and we're looking I'm looking at a people like Joshua and Caleb yeah yeah and I'm sure that you've been taking possession because Footprints is possession and this is the time where the bride comes into her full inheritance of the word all right and we're moving there we're moving there by Revelation and by understanding and I'm thankful as we were saying this weekend we're not just preaching a message where we can just come and say amen and your finances are not right your marriage is not right your home is not right this message has come to transform too many times we I saw a sign the other day it said not change transformed and I said Amen to that that's right we've got too many people that I'm going to change but we we need more than that we need power transformation and changes in his likeness Amen to make us like what God had in his mind of us to be before the foundation of the world and I'm thankful that a people in this end time hour have recognized their positions right recognize their calling recognize the the anointing that they're under right and that ego has been released that anointing has been released upon them and brother random says ego that number four living creature that means that means relief I mean that's Earthly Deliverance I mean we how can we do anything except the anointing that dictates our lives and moves Us in the scriptures we find ourselves in the Bible like brother Brown himself in the Bible he didn't understand about his life he doesn't understand about his calling but one day when that angel of the Lord came and said you're a prophet like Moses you'll bring an exodus you're a prophet like Joshua you'll take them into the Homeland your Prophet like Daniel you'll have dreams and Visions you're perfect like Jeremiah your prophet's artilleration then he saw his name in the book he saw his position right and he was able to move and the revelation of who he was and that's what brother Brandon preached when he preached perfectly Faith right he says now Jesus knew the scriptures that was written about him right and he earnestly sought the father that he would fulfill those things and that's that's that's all that's the hour that we live in even with social media destroying churches destroying families in this age there will be births Sons we see how Satan the God of this evil world the god the prince of the power of the air how he's come down through the social media and through this technology and has destroyed families marriages churches relationships right that's why Peter said that our conversation in this age of conversation in this age of communication right Peter said that our conversation and our communication should be holy because God's going to destroy all of this right amen and the Vera eat their ways and the Very radio waves because Peter said that even the elements would burn up with with such great heat amen and so we see these things coming in has loosed these things upon them on the P Revelations chapter 9. John said I saw a star fall from Heaven I saw him fall just saw him fall John saw him fall and brother Bradham said what how Thou Art fallen from heaven or Lucifer but he was given a key and a key gives you access it's knowledge and he was given to him right to unlock the bottomless pit yeah and he had lost the bottomless pit and smoke Rose from the pit what was this this was the Mulligan flux that saint has tried to baptize our children with that tells our family with it but I'm thankful by the opening of the seals to let the spirit of Truth has been loosed upon the bride amen I'm a standard has been risen amen and you're that standard amen amen that's right brother let's just take a few moments let's stay in once more and turn to First Peter chapter one First Peter chapter one these were about about 15 minutes or so First Peter chapter one we're going to start reading it verse two let's just buy our head for a moment find Heavenly Father Lord we're so thankful Lord to be in your divine presence this evening here Lord standing before the blood ball purchase of the Lord Jesus Christ Lord stand before standing before the Overcomers of this day Lord the Lord who have seen themselves in the scriptures Lord people Lord have heard your voice then we see Lord that we are the Bible we are the scriptures this day the very manifestation Lord of what was in your mind and Lord as we see the world falling apart again the world is falling apart and we see the handwriting on the wall and all of these destabilizing other countries because Rome is taking her position on and all these kingdoms Lord are falling like dominoes because it was prophesied to be Lord we see all of these things working their place in order and father we're so thankful that it was prophesied in the end time there would be abroad Lord the prophet saw that preview and he said if there is not abroad then every Vision that I've had in the past has been wrong but Lord in 62 you begin to change the prophets his very view as that great Eagle looking down from laodicea father he saw that Roman insect eat up the church all the way down to the stone right but Lord you promised in Joel chapter 2 I would restore then father it's not mine it's not my responsibility to restore it's your responsibility to restore father and you said you would restore and father we're thankful that restoration has come Lord belongs to his father we're thankful Lord that we are taking up our positions as it were father because you have spoken to our heart in this day and Lord your people are moving like a mighty Army Lord father we're marching to Zion We Know Who We Are we know that the very Gene of our spiritual life has been released and our newborn New Birth experience father and what all those characteristics and all of those things that were in you have been pregnated in your broad Lord now we see them coming forth bringing forth Your Great Name Lord in this hour father how thankful we are we pray that your bless each and every one here tonight Lord let them know who they are Lord and they do father this great ministry that you have provided through brother Dale there's no excuse here and hear your word amen may they take a hold of that word and and hold on to an implanton in their heart and that'll bring forth of the time after its own time the father we just asked the Lord May the spirit of wisdom and the spirit of Revelation be here tonight Lord may we see as it were even more clearly Lord who we are in you father and what you have made us in Jesus Christ we ask these things for your honor and For Your Glory in Jesus name we pray amen in First Peter chapter 1 starting at verse three I'm I'm sorry two First Peter chapter 1 verse 2 elect according to the foreknowledge of God the father through sanctification of the spirit unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ Grace unto you and peace be multiplied may the Lord add His blessings to the reading of his word keep your Bible you may be seated we'll continue to read we see here Peter he is addressing A peculiar people here all right amen this greeting is not to the world this greeting is not to the unbeliever right screening it's to the elect amen Lori amen those that had journalized engulfed from the foundation of the world right those who even though in their first birth they would have to come through unbelief because of our first pair of Eve adult tricks we would have to come listen now born in a bloodline right of the serpent all right and your natural bloodline they call it hereditary heredity and say well you're of this race and because if you're in this race you're you're you're more susceptible to getting this disease or having that disease that's bloodline you see right right man and you and I we were permitted to come through the bloodline of the serpent right right that's where sicknesses and disease and all of these things are passed down but we're thankful to God that there's a holy ghost there's an abstract title deed amen and they're holders till that title deed here tonight right that can break the bloodline of Satan you see and and that's the elected right this is not the foolish virgin right this is the verb wise version Glory this is the people that the scripture says that they shall not die but they shall be changed this is the elect amen thank you Lord this is those as we said that had representation by predestination that God was going to have them amen and he has them tonight he was going to bring them to maturity by the word and they would recognize that they an inheritance in God Like Father Abraham and we don't have time tonight but Abraham God never revealed to Abraham that he was going to change his body all right he just told Abraham to fall on him and even when he met him as Melchizedek and then an important righteousness to him he still did not reveal to Abraham that he was going to change his body right he was a mystery right amen that was going to be unveiled that was going to be revealed right and it's the mystery to the bride in this last day also you see right and so even even when El shadia the breasted God came to Abraham and when he came to Abraham El shadia in the breast of God he changed his name from Abram which means High father right chained to Abraham Abram Melchizedek priest and King of the most high God he was representing the god Elion and Elio needs the most high God and the most high God came to the high father Abram he was revealing himself right even in his son Abraham right but then as God began to unfold himself down because Abraham by election had an inheritance in God and you and I have an inheritance in God even though like Ruth we did not know that we had an inheritance but blessed be the name of the Lord amen the word has come amen and we have and and as you and I know Jesus did not come to give us an inheritance you've had an inheritance in God before the foundation of the world that's right but he came to redeem us to atone to bring us back to that inheritance in this hour and you and I by being born again it connects us to our inheritance you are by your new birth you are connected to that theophany amen and you begin to be you begin to be brought under an influence not us just trying to come to church well I'm just trying I'm just trying to make it you're not just hearing brother Wayne brother Dale and the brothers preach that message it's it's more than just that was a good message we're talking about inheritance now right we're talking about a people that says look I've been called to this I have an inheritance in God Amen and the Holy Ghost begins to draw you to that inheritance amen exactly that that that that word that you bypassed right begins to begins to make its way by the hearing of the word right because faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of the Lord amen and that's why the ministry of Jesus Christ was not like the Pharisees because the Pharisees you know they were so pious I was ready to condemn yeah they were so righteous and the Sadducees I didn't even believe in the Supernatural right and the heronians were connected to the politics of the day all right but Jesus ministry what's different than their ministry right man and the disciples saw this different Ministry in the land it was not like just reading the scriptures right and yet it was reading the scriptures but when they saw Jesus and you know the story of the testimony on the sea these are fishermen and they're on the Sea of Galilee and the storm Rises up and Satan says I'm going to destroy this bunch of Holy Rollers I'm gonna get rid of them and the storm builds up greatly and these fishermen who knows they know about storms oh yeah they know about waves it's not the first time they've been in a storm yeah but they've never been in a storm like this storm yeah and they knew we're going to perish they knew that they had no uh there was nothing they could do to control this right that's what they knew by the corner yeah but Jesus who was there for Redemption purposes and his first coming was for Redemption purposes mathematically for the son of mankind to redeem that all right call them back those that have representation and so when they said go away Jesus and he stood up and he spoke to the weed into waves they looked at themselves and said what what manner what manner of man is this I could not understand it oh man they hadn't sit under a Ministry like this before right I had learned this by going to the synagogue Bible study systematically did not bring this to them you said hey man amen they saw a supernatural life and another time Jesus walking by the Fig Tree cursed the fig tree it wasn't even time for the Fig Tree to bring forth it was untimely right yep but Jesus cursed the future he said no meaning from you from this day forever and the next day Peter says how is it that you just spoke to the tree and already it's withered right and his answer was to them was have faith in God all right all right you said what are you talking about brother I'm talking about your inheritance amen right listen now read between the lines Jesus was trying to bring an inherence to them and he was saying to them listen now what you bypass made flesh you should have come this way if you would have come this way you would have done the same thing but I'm here for Redemption purposes because this all belongs to you right that's right listen now we don't know all that Adam had in the beginning we know as Prophet said oh that Adam lost Christ restored right amen and we know that there was a time because Adam was God of the Earth and he can speak the word yeah he could speak and whatever it was it would obey right amen God would bring the animals to him and he would say mom you're you're a lion yeah yeah and that meat creature beside you that's a lamb right because the names is character right right that's the eagle yeah right sure hey who is this that just landed on my shoulder I'm gonna call you the dub amen he had the power to name these things exactly by their nature and even in the Bible that's their characteristics because when you go through the Bible it's lamb lion dragon serpent Dove etc etc etc and God would come down in the evening time not just like some spook right he would come down in a great theophany amen God in his great theophany right and walk through the garden without him all right yes sir Adam even though he lived in this three dimensions that we are bound to Lifetime and matter yet he was not restricted he was not constricted to that right right nope that's what this message is bringing us back to right amen where you will not be held by these dimensionals right right Uptown lighting matter because his brand complete restoration amen and God has showed that in the scriptures you see the prophet talked about that in the message countdown and you and I have been brought on this great countdown for what what has it all been about to bring you to bring your inheritance to you in Satan's even right right absolutely amen and for you to stand with the word that you're living by every day God in Simplicity every day believe in the word confessing the word and moving into that word and sometimes we need the Holy Ghost to kind of put us in the corner you know because we know we'll just you know yeah but sometimes like Queen Esther who thought maybe if she didn't say anything it would preserve her life yeah but Mordecai said don't think you'll be saved Esther right right she began to meditate that I didn't bring myself here to this position right I didn't make myself Queen it was something greater God brought me here for such a time as this thank Lord and sometimes the Holy Ghost right makes us deal with issues right and many times people don't want to deal with issue they want to wait to some some super hold some super duper thing come down what are you waiting on we we have the word to deal with an issue anything in your life don't put in a way to deal with it by the word of God it's called your heritage right that's it this is a living way this is a perfect way right and God's leaving you God's bringing you bringing that inheritance that was preserved in heaven for you right right here animal could travel like us all we can walk on water yeah he was God of the Earth right and he had God's character right yep he had God's word listen Tom broad will have God's likeness exactly to be the very manifestation and that's what you're walking into yeah that's why Peter said elect he belongs to the elective amen it's not anyone else right but to those that had Journal life in God that's why a prophet a prophet can look into the genes right because that's what this message has come down to Oh yeah and when you begin to follow the prophet in this message you'll follow him dawned down until he'll say things like The Germ of your spiritual life was in God right that where you come from your very origin your very new birth was a germ of life right in the chromosome of almighty God amen amen yes sir and when your birth of that Gene of God then what can you do but obey God evacuate he's not going to deny himself right now man and you feed him from your theophany you're not going to deny the very word that God is transforming because he's raising you up yes sir and you're moving into your inheritance all right let's let's just finish reading this here verse verse 3 blessed be the god of our father our Lord Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has begotten us now that's born again right we've been born again unto a lively hope right yeah look your your mom and daddy didn't make you you didn't right that's right your parents might be Holy Ghost Field right but God don't have any grandchildren right right and we have to come God's provided place of worship that's the only way God bless you bless him that's the only way right even in the in the church we see Isaac a type of Christ a type of the promised son who took the sacrifice who took the wood up to Mount Moriah he was obedient to death right he was a type of Christ right and he married a gentile girl name her and Becca because Rebecca was from Mesopotamia and that was Babylon and that's where you came out of Babylon you see amen and she was the type of a a perfect type of LeBron the only closer type than Rebecca is Ruth in the scripture and for 20 years she was Barren no no two Holy Ghost Field parents yeah and she was Barren and went to Isaac and said I want to have a child and Isaac said am I God am I going to give you a seat but he began to pray also right and after 20 long years when people thought nothing was happening in the womb of this message amen was in time twins 40 years just like Rebecca couldn't bear for 20 long years people come to the message and go and come and go yeah up and down in and out yeah but it has affected someone right amen and God came to Rebecca and she said oh God what is this and he said in your womb there are two Nations yeah of people right and when she came and when she brought forth she brought forth Esau but yet Jacob was grabbing at his heel because Jacob wanted the inheritance all right that's right and even his first words in the Bible was give me the inheritance because he was a type of abroad who wants her inheritance in this last day man right right so even though they were Holy Ghost mother Holy Ghost father not like in Genesis where one seed was serpent seat yeah and the other seed was Adam seed all right two fathers same mother yeah and brought for two different right yeah but yet this is two Holy Ghost Field parents right same mother same father and one Esau and one Jacob and that's the same thing this message produces in this time on each other and Jacob he wants the birthright he wants the inheritance and God knows you want that inheritance more than life because for this purpose as Jesus said shall I pray father deliver me from this hour for for this hour came High into the world for this hour God predestinated you for this time amen amen sometimes we have to get past the Clapping out of the hands and pass the singing other songs and ask ourselves what is it all about and we have to get down to this honestly right and if we don't have the baptism Holy Ghost you can have the baptism on the Holy Ghost seek the word of God all right man right Peter said repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin and ye shall receive the promise right you said brother Andre already done it well you just keep walking man and you watch God under your face right right that's why we're seeing this last hour people who have started off in this walk and get to sanctification and say you know everything's fine now continue to walk with the word amen amen continue to press on right and you're going to press on because there's a deep coin to the Deep right right all right and that deep calling to the deepest drawing you that great word representation right it is like an umbilical cord through your born-again experience you're connected to it right right then as brother Branham said your life on Earth is our reflecting what you are in another dimension right right that's right and we're thankful that a prophet you can look into the genes I remember Brother Cleveland and I think I heard brother biscoll and we're talking about there was an Indian tribe I think up in Alaska maybe you Brothers know the story that's right and they were supposed to they wanted to receive some kind of benefits and things from the government but they did not know the genealogy or the bloodline of whose father was whose father in it great father right and brother random went yep and he said now this is your great grandfather was this man and this was your father and this was your great great grandfather you're Gregory yeah yeah because a prophet could do those things you believe Paul was a prophet yeah oh he could preach the male chances of that and look into the genes of Abraham and said Levi paid toys when he was in the loins of Abraham he could look into the genes right and the problem God would bring that why would he bring it up because it's where you originated from and you who have eternal life you have representation the gene of your spiritual life was in God before the foundation of the world exactly right brother man can you run that back to Genesis 1-1 what the scripture says in the beginning out on him and that's as far as the Theologian can go to Genesis 1 1 and the beginning but we had a prophet that could go beyond Genesis 1 1 into the back part of God's mind and bring these things to the end time bro amen because they're essential how can we hold the child how can we hold an abstract deed in our hands and not know who father was unless we're pedigree right amen see this bro knows his mom and poppies they know where they originated from right and God knows them that's who you are amen glory by great inheritance body to it in the first rapture he came to his inheritance by Walking with God right right because his walk represented reconciliation right right and God reconciled Enoch to himself and you all know we all know this the prophet said that in it started walking with God and he got so close to God's house like God said just come home just come with me right listen now listen now what's the problem talking about he's not just talking about someone going on a walk this is a spiritual condition that Enoch walked into right he walked into a spiritual condition that the the characteristic of his life became the scripture that God could not deny him reality man and they wonder what happened to the Capstone in that day yeah it disappeared yeah but he even had it though right in the second Rapture Elijah he knew his inheritance and the third rapture Jesus Christ this was the third Old Testament right to Jesus Christ that's right he knew his inheritance right in the father man right and the first New Testament Rapture the Old Testament Saints they knew their inheritance because listen to them in Psalms 24 when Jesus is leading captivity captive and they cry out open up he guides and be lifted up for the king of glory is coming in how can they say that right how could job and those men say that because they had come to their inheritance and they were in a glorious glorified body in the province him right open up your Gates and be lifted up and let the king of glory come in who is this king of glory all right all right right here's the king of glory amen the second New Testament right about you amen an inheritance right that cannot be corrupted that will not fade away that was reserved in heaven for you right because you had citizenship now the hemoglobin the life doesn't come from the woman that's right that's from the man that's why you had citizenship right in glory before you ever came to the Earth because the germ of your spiritual life right it was in Christ I said Christ right right what's your germ and when you were born again that germ just like your natural germ of life opened up right yep The Germ of your spiritual life that God has desired to see come forth for God to see someone and Trust all right and we can know our inheritance I'm close now you know on the Earth was saying I was saying this Sunday you know on the Earthly scene on the corner you you let somebody

citizenship our citizenship is in heaven right listen God doesn't have a problem with illegal aliens there he has no problem with that your birth record right the G right the DNA the chromosome right this ain't God right right before you come to the Earth amen and even when you even before you come to the Earth and the Earth was cursed and your body was laying in the Earth right you still had an inheritance right that's right and gone right amen I was waiting for this time and for you to claim that yep right I wonder as I was saying Sunday when I was preaching I wonder this if God came to if the Lord just come to your door and knock on your door said who's that oh open the door and you went to the door and his Lord Jesus Christ and he said can a son of man find faith in this house yeah right will the son of man Find Faith here are those seeking for an inheritance in this home yep I want us to better sponsored yes Lord all right you have to have a face Glory y'all found the people with an inheritance right an abstract deed a book of redemption has been given to us we know our position Amen in the Book of Numbers when God numbered them and established them trials in tribal order right it was for one purpose that he would dwell in the midst of them but each one of those trials were represented under an anointing right right and they knew the anointing that they were represented under right right and if you went to Dan it would say we're Dan we're represented by the eagle from the north right they knew their inheritance and we know our inheritance we know Papa John yes sir and this is how Philippians 2 our sin our citizenship is in heaven from which also we look for the Savior Lord Jesus Christ change our vile amen body that it may be fashion like unto his glorious body according to the working whereby he is able even just to do all things unto himself all right right right remember when brother round wouldn't be on the current of time all right and he said his horse came right a horse yep and his dog came and somebody said bro they wrote Melissa we thought there's more spirits of that horses in him so well you know about this in Revelation 19. yeah I think Christ's return on horse on a white horse and the armies of Heaven followed him yeah but just look for a moment his horse and a voice would say to him all that you ever loved right and all that ever loved you right God has given you right what an inheritance what an inheritance that God would permit us to learn about a woman named Hattie Wright right yep you don't have to have brother Brown and lay hands on you and pray for you you have an inheritance if you're faking believe it you have an inheritance you haven't lost loved ones you have an inheritance you have a dream in here it's my brother and sister that's right but God has in store and is revealing to those but he loves and that loves him right this last day Brian this in time rod this beautiful this lovely Ruth standing in this hour clear-cut decision steadfastly minded moving into inheritance the very field that Ruth would glean in she never knew one day she would own the field right the very feel that she gleaned she would own the field Rahab the life that she lived and yet it was put in the sea of God's forgiveness that's right and what an inheritance that he gave her because after she married Solomon she had a son named uh Obed and I believe that's right you see yeah and on and on and on Tamar she wanted an inheritance and judah's son could not do that he died and then Judah told his other son you go in with her he refused to do it she played the part of the heart and why she wanted to have seed and she wanted to be a part of the lineage of Judah yeah and God bless Tamar and gave her a son named Forest Now read the line all the way down all of these Gentile women zakoria Moses wife asanal Joseph's wife right yeah yep they all fell into inheritance and we've come in this last day an inheritance that God has brought back to us that belongs to us my brother and sister that's right brother you have to go you have to State you have to State claims right on your inheritance right exactly stake those claims on your inheritance right they belong to you they're yours that's right they don't belong to anyone else amen this last quote here in the message God of this evil age brother Brown says now for God of this evil age page 15 paragraph 68 for as The Germ of for as The Germ of natural life is brought down germanized from father to father to father so is the Life of Christ germatized that's the reason God uses Elijah's Spirit five different times what is it it's the handy down right right it's handed down inheritance amen because it's germatized from one seed from one seed from one father to the father to the father to the father and the message of Malachi 4 was to bring this germ through the son of man Minister and Christ bringing germ life lamb life God's word Zoey life all right Laurie it says now just as just as your natural life and traits is handed down from the natural breeding of your father so is the spirit of God that was predestinated before the foundation of the world all right and when the entire word of God incomplete was headed up in a human body called Jesus Christ and there God made me pay for my sins in him there then he rose me raised me up with him in the resurrection and now we are seated with him with power and authority over every devil oh if you could only believe what God has given but if you're not seated there right you don't have it all right and if you're seated there but you don't believe it or afraid to move you'll never use it right but if you're seated there you will use it all right for your ordained to do what you do God bless you let me just read this one more quote God bless you this is the last one here and a message adoption part four all right brother Brown says now look he has predestinated us into this inheritance if I am a right inheritance of something if God is knocking at my heart saying William Brown I called you a long time ago before the foundation of the world to preach the gospel I have an inheritance an inheritance of eternal life now God sent Jesus to make that inheritance real to me right because there was nothing I could do to inherit it it was blank it was valid there was nothing I could do but in the fullness of time God sent his own good in his own good time Jesus the lamb slain from the foundation of the world his blood was shed that I might go to my inheritance Amen to be what what inheritance the sonship to be a Son of God and now this may just choke you to death but did you know that men that are sons of God are amateur Gods how many ever know that how many know that Jesus said saw the Bible Jesus said did not your law say itself that ye are gods and if you called him God why God said in Genesis 2 that they were God because they were they had full dominion over the Dominion of the world he gave him dominion over all things and he lost his sonship he lost his sonship he lost his domain and Satan took it over but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God finally amen let me say it this way we have come to that time amen amen right that headstone has come right amen John's the body right man see he says now waiting for the fullness of he says down he says but brother we are waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God who will come back and take it over again right waiting for the fullness of that time when the pyramid gets to the top when the full sons of God will be manifested with power of God will walk out Hallelujah and will take every Power of saints God away from him yes sir it belongs to him do you all believe that amen right yeah let me show you what I'm reading in case you don't believe it that's your thoughts all right that's a great thing I'm saying it's a great thing

that's it because you've been born again amen amen don't try to run away from it right we gonna put you there right you're gonna see it hey man and you're gonna say thank you Lord that's right he says now he's the logos that that was the son of God then he made man a little God and he said if they call those who the word of God came through prophets if they call them God to the word of God come to and God said so himself that they are Gods he told Moses I will make you God and make air in your make Aaron your Prophet brother Ben says amen he says I may act like a religious crank but I'm not oh when your eyes can come open and see those things all right he made man of God a God in his domain and his domain goes from sea to Sea from Shore to Shore he has control of it and when Jesus came being the one God without sin he proved it when the winds blowed he said peace be still amen all right and when the trees he said no man eat from thee there I say unto you that you little Gods if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe what you say all right it will come to pass amen exactly think of that when he said that those men looked at him and said what kind of man just by speaking a word can move a mountain this man must be guilty amen amen that man was deity and that man and I believe that and you believe that hitting the Lord good to him to us
