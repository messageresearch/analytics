brother Lyall if you could come open the Service in a word of prayer I believe there were prayer requests this evening forgive me I'm a little bit of a mess I left them back there if you have a request on your heart the Lord sees it that's the most important thing you can hold it before him in your heart or with your hand brother L if you'd open up [Music] good evening God bless you it's good to see so many people out this evening Wednesday night Hearts United together to Worship the Lord and to hear the words that he's given to our pastor to speak to us we have a prayer request here from Sister Nina Vil it says please pray for the children of my classroom several of them have had coughs that are lingering for weeks pray that sickness will leave our class there were also requests earlier today for sister Ellie Troutman who's uh in the hospital and she's there kind of getting things stabilized a little bit they haven't found any major things wrong with her they're just waiting for her to uh become a little more uh not stabilized because she is stable but a little more alert and awakened so they can uh find out a bit more what's going on and of course our brother Koo was scheduled for that major surgery today I hav't heard any results on that I don't know if he's still in surgery or if it's going postponed it's postponed so praise the Lord so there's still there's still that chance that the Lord can step in and intervene and have it not be required and that's certainly the burden in the prayer that's on our heart but above all we want the Lord's will let's join our hearts together now as we approach our Lord in prayer Lord Jesus it's such an honor it's such a privilege it's such an opportunity and it's something that we love to do to gather together in your name with our brothers and sisters Lord to draw closer to you to draw closer to one another to to feel your spirit move in our midst Lord and and the reality of uh of of you Lord we were at uh at at a funeral service yesterday and a memorial service Lord for our brother Roberts Lord and and we just know that he's it's sounds almost like a platitude or something to say well he's in a better place and without pain but it's true he is in a better place and he is without pain and Lord we just cling to that promise and that hope and that truth that there is a resurrection Lord you said in the mouth of two or three witnesses that the major things would be established and you gave us Witnesses through the mouth of job through the mouth of Jesus Through the writings of Paul Lord we know that

bless you all it's good to be in the house of the Lord tonight before we're seated let's turn in our Bibles to Proverbs chapter 6 verse 16 Proverbs 616 something that we've probably all heard this scripture and I want to dig a little bit deeper into it tonight I I think it'll be a blessing to us it's a very difficult subject but sometimes difficult to hear but I believe it'll be it'll be a blessing Proverbs Chapter 6 ver 16 says this these six things do the Lord hate yay seven are an Abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood a heart that div us Wicked imaginations feet that be Swift and running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that Seth Discord among the Brethren amen let's bow our heads our heavenly father Lord we come here tonight to learn more about you through your word and we pray father that as I open these scriptures and and read this blessed word that Lord Lord that the Holy Spirit would be The Interpreter to our hearts and Lord that we would leave here better people and we came in Jesus name amen amen you can be seated God bless everyone it's good to good as I said it's good to be in the house of the Lord it's it's always good to gather good to gather with with people that love each other and uh I was very proud of our church the L mentioned um the funeral I was very proud that so many of us showed up and and I know it was a real blessing to the family so if you went to the funeral God bless you and thank thank you for um representing our church Sister Sarah Roberts and the Roberts family they uh they're going they have a long road in front of them now that dad's gone brother Dan was younger than me bread winner for the family and uh many many of us knew brother Dan and just please keep the family in prayer again I was I was very proud of our group and so many of us showed up this scripture in Proverbs is kind of the seven worst sins and the the seven really really bad ones it says these things the Lord hates and seven are Abomination to him and it starts with a proud look You' think it would start with something else start with murder or something like that but it starts with a proud look as always as always praying about Lord what direction do you want us to go in our Wednesday night bible study where where is the next subject and brother Lyall is going to start on David and his life we just got through finished with Joseph and I've been going through topic by topic and I think that this is going to be a little bit of a um of a series that we're going to do on this thing called pride and pride is a it's really a bad one and after tonight I think that I hope that we can understand more that how bad it is so as I was looking doing research on Pride I looked it up in the dictionary dictionary.com says this a feeling of deep pleasure or satisfaction derived from one's own achievements the achievements of those with whom one is closely associated or from the qualities or possessions that are widely admired well that doesn't seem like such a bad thing doesn't seem like such a harsh sin this sin of Pride just saying that that you're proud of what you've done and this pride is one of the top things that God hates Pride leads the way as far as the as far as sins there has never I I'll put it this way there has never been a fight between you and your spouse without Pride dominating that argument right or wrong there has never been a church split without Pride being the dominating fact Factor whether it's on one side or on both sides with pride it was Pride that prevented Cain from receiving the blessings of God in the very beginning it was Pride that destroyed Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel it was Pride that constantly produced failure in King Saul the first king of Israel it was Pride that caused Lucifer to be cast out of Heaven it was Pride that prevented the pH and the Sadducees from accepting Jesus Christ it was Pride it is pride that destroys relationships it is pride that ruins careers it's Pride that destroys churches it's Pride that prevents an understanding of the scriptures I'll say that one again it's Pride that prevents an understanding of the scriptures it's Pride that prevents a walk with God unfortunately it's a prideful person a prideful person is the most difficult person to reach with the gospels you can reach a homeless person you can reach somebody that's that's sin somebody that's committed adultery and and feels bad you can you can reach many many people with the gospels but a prideful person is the most difficult person to reach Pride produces a strong religious spirit that's adverse to any correction and it's always correcting or looking down on someone else that's this thing pride and pride prevents Improvement it prevents us from making Headway in many many things I had a I knew a a friend of mine that was one of the best athletes that I had ever seen in my life and I've been around Sports I was around Sports the the first half of of my life I mean it helped me get through college and and I I was I was involved with a lot of athletes and this guy was the best athlete I had ever seen he was in high school at the time and I was older so I I could see the talent that He had he was bigger taller than all the other players on the team he was F faster than all the other players on the team he was more athletic than anybody else on the football team he was stronger than most of the other players on the team this guy was like a blue chip recruit to college but yet the kid had so much pride that he couldn't take coaching he wouldn't listen to his coaches he wouldn't do what the coaches would tell him because he was his attitude was you can't tell me what to do so he sat the bench his whole High School career he never got to college and this was literally the best athlete I think I had ever seen but he didn't go anywhere because of Pride he couldn't take correction Proverbs chap 11 verse one says this a false balance is abomination to the Lord but a just weight is his Delight when Pride cometh then cometh shame but with low but with the lowly is wisdom English Standard Version of that says when pride comes then comes disgrace but with the humble is wisdom inevitably it's that prideful person that the the thing that they fear most is to be brought down and the biggest problem is the only one that doesn't see the prideful person is the actual person that struggles with pride so it's hard to get through to someone that is prideful it's hard to it's hard to tell them hey you struggle with pride because they can't see it by definition almost if they're prideful they can't take correction so they don't see it and you can see why why God hates it so much Proverbs this is a Bible study so I'm gonna continue on with many many scriptures and I couldn't even get as I was studying this and praying on this I couldn't even get out of the Book of Proverbs on the subject of Pride so we're just going to stay in Proverbs tonight continue on there Proverbs 165 says everyone that is proud in heart is an Abomination to the Lord though hand join in hand he shall not be P punished Amplified version says this everyone who is proud and arrogant is in heart is disgusting and exceedingly offensive to the Lord be assured he will not go unpunished that trait of Pride it disgusts God you think about the most disgusting sin that you can think of imagine if there was somebody in the congregation that's really struggling say with pornography or really struggling with with lust or something like that and how we would look at that person but if somebody else says well you know the thing that I struggle with the most is pride he'd be like oh well that's that's not a big deal that's just really common when it's the sin of Pride that disgusts God more than any of it we looking look at it through our eyes and the things that disgust us it's wrong of course it's sin but God's ways are not our ways his thoughts are not our thoughts he sees this Pride as the most disgusting of it all and yet pride is so common it's everywhere you you you think about about how bad sin is and many times we don't even think of Pride as a sin yet I read that scripture before and it leads the way number one and why does God hate it so much I really believe God sees sin as what keeps us his children away from him and it keeps us out of heaven and he sees pride pride as the number one thing that will keep people out of the Heavenly Kingdom will keep them out of heaven and send them to hell it's because pride is is such a strong barrier for God to break through because there's no humility and pride Malachi chapter 4 we quote it so much we know it so well behold I behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yeah and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day cometh that shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts and it shall lead them leave them neither root nor Branch he's saying all the proud first that's the that's the first one all the proud will be burned up and all that do wicked we just think of all the wicked all those Wicked people are going to be burned up what we forget about he said first Pride all of the proud and yet Pride it's so common and so accepted more than any other sin pride is more acceptable than stealing Pride seems to be more acceptable than Merc murder and yet this is number one in that Hall of shame in Proverbs that I said earlier the seven things that God hates I know as I'm saying that word you're probably going through many people's minds well gay pride and how that that disgusts Us and how how it how you see the the the the prades that go through and they have the big rainbow banners and all this and it says gay pride and look at the gay part but the gay part isn't as bad as the pride part that's the major sin is they want to be proud that's that's the big one and gay pride is the pride part remember in the the uh in school and and and a in athletics they would have the uh the marching band The Pride of Arizona or the pride of your high school what you're lifting up this pride of which they can call it something else it's such a it's such a normal word to us but it is a it's a bad word it's something that's going to destroy many many people again I'll read Proverbs 619 616- 19 it says this in six things does the Lord hate Y and seven are an Abomination unto him a proud look a lying tongue hands that shed innocent blood a heart that deviseth Wicked imaginations feet that be swift to running to running to Mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that saw his Discord among Brethren led the way with pride Pro Proverbs 13:10 says only by pride comes contention only by Pride Proverbs 13:10 only by pride comes contention but with the well advised is wisdom I was I'll share a little bit about myself and this just Daniel's a witness to this is just happened last night is Stephanie made dinner and we were sitting around and we prayed over the food and she made a great dinner was there was green beans there and pork chops and um couscous and bread out of the out of the oven it was great great meal so we pray over the food and uh Stephanie takes her knife and she Butters her bread and there's a little bit of butter left on her knife like maybe half and she takes it and she starts to butter my bread I was like what are you doing I can butter my own bread I don't need you to butter my bread and and you know she looked at me I was like don't don't do that Daniel was there and it was you know what it was something that simple it was pride in me like I don't need I don't need you to butter my bread here here's my wife was she worked hard on this meal and she she put it before me and and she was just wanting to put to help me out on this bread and here I go and I snap back at her because that Pride rose up in me and if the pride would have rose up in Stephanie she would have said well you can make your own dinner and but it didn't and as I was it really bothered me I apologized to her I said honey I'm sorry I just I don't know why I took that wrong I I I could butter my own bread and and I I should have appreciated you doing it and that's how little things in a with a spouse That's how little fights can get started and it starts with nothing but pride and if if she would have snapped back then it would have probably been an argument you see how Pride can sneak in there and I'll tell you that that little bickering that that that came from me it disgusted God Accord in to the scriptures we think oh oh it's no big big deal it is a big deal says Pride that that this disgusts God and it said only by pride comes contention so when you get in a fight when you when you arguing with your spouse or your friend or whoever it is it's Pride that brings it you see what a horrible thing this is and it's everywhere there's never been a divorce without Pride because only by pride comes contention we talk about it's it's this pride is so common with us it's it's just everywhere I've heard I get criticism sometimes about using translations other other than the King James Bible why why it's proven over and over again that many of these translations are more accurate than the king J James I could prefer the King James because I like the poetic and I like the old English it sounds good and I've memorized the King James Bible I've memorized those scriptures that's the ones that the kids have memorized that's the one I like to read but why would there be contention for the King James over the English Standard Version of the NIV or the new King James why Pride well brother brandom used the King James Bible Well if you listens the tapes instead of just relying on Pride you know that he didn't absolutely not he used the young translation he used the emphatic diaglot which is a Jehovah Witness publication he used that he used every resource that he had at his disposal to better understand the word but with the a certain translation if that is your mindset then also throw out your smartphone go to the library and do your research throw out Google don't Google anything there's no Wikipedia there's no other knowledge outside of of reading a book and then you're relying on who wrote the book it's Pride it is nothing short of Pride well we just I just do this that's good but is it pride that you do it is it because of Pride or is it because that's the best way the uh Proverbs chap 15 ver 25 says this the Lord will destroy the house of The Proud but he will establish the border of the wicked not a beautiful scripture it's it has more of a spiritual meaning than it does a literal meaning like he's he's talking about the widows and how God loves the widows and the widows have to be dependent on God and he the in the New Living Translation said the Lord's te the Lord tears Down The House of the proud but he protects the property property of the widows he maintains them border of her property and he doesn't allow someone else to take her land but he himself will destroy destroy that of the proud he loves the widows he Comforts The widows and he takes care of the widows you know why because they're dependent on him and they were especially dependent on on him when This Book of Proverbs was written there was no social security back then the widows were dependent on their husband and as the bread winter and when when the husband died they were now dependent on their family or they were dependent on their Church to take care of them and it showed that dependence while this man that builts his builts his house up on a up on a hill and overlooking all of his fields and all of his crops he is dependent on himself he is the he is the one he says I got all this money I have done all of this I can sustain myself and God hates that he says I'll tear it down and that's how our Salvation is that's how our lives are we should never be dependent on us we should be like the widows who they are just completely dependent on God to take care of them some of the most prideful people I've ever met are some of those who seem to be so humble too we have to be careful we don't want to be proud of our humility we don't want to be that to be a source of Pride it makes that that our humility makes us better than someone else uh when we lived in Jeffersonville we were around a lot of Amish communities and you look at the Amish and and they see them so humble because they all wear the same clothes they all look alike and they you would talk to them and they talk in a certain way and they say oh you know well basically we're we're nothing and and uh and you know we just we we don't do certain things and they when they were building my house I had to correct them like hey quit spitting your chew on my floor of my concrete and they were smoking the cigarettes I was like you guys are are you're you're taking doing all of this tobacco and don't you think that's wrong but you you have to wear the same color pants and shirt but that was a source of Pride for them is the way they looked that was that was the way that they are they were they were too prideful to be on the electrical grid they were too prideful to live amongst what they called the Gentiles which would be us they were too prideful to worship Jesus Christ and what they called the Gentile church too prideful to visit and yet as I said they're they're they're smoking cigarettes and spitting Tobacco on my floor they were too good to fellowship with what they see they deemed as beneath them the clothes that I wore were too worldly for them the clothes of my wife wore were too worldly for them the fact that I had electricity in my house made them better than me the fact that I didn't have a beard made them better than me they would never outwardly say it but they would always they they were always looking at that and and you would say well you know they're really sweet but let one of their children or one of their Community go outside that rule and you watch the claws come out you watch the attacks start because of that Pride this is who we are we don't want we don't want any of our community to look any different because we have pride in our community and you see it's a source of of false security and then God if God wants to do something with that group then he can't it's it's a barrier that he can't get in there brother Aaron gave the testimony the on Sunday that it was told he he grew up in a place that that they wanted you to speak in tongues and if you didn't speak in tongues then you didn't have the Holy Spirit that was a source of Pride for that church we all speak in tongues we are all have this gift in our lives and brother Aaron goes up there and he's like I I can't do it and you went up and faked it right and then the the minister started praising the Lord and shouting and and and saying well he got it he finally got it it was a source of Pride for that church and it was wrong all of us have different gifts some of us speak in tongues others don't Paul said do all speak in tongues do all do all prophesy no God gives all of these gifts and if we try to put everybody in the same same box then it becomes a source of Pride because of us pride and it separates us from the word of God and it separates us from each other do you see why it's such a strong barrier difference between the Amish and the way that they did things and then you look at this man Daniel in the Bible Daniel had always prayed three times a day he woke up in the morning he prayed opened his window and and he let the air in and he faced towards the temple in Jerusalem and he prayed and then at noon he prayed again and then in the evening he prayed again and that's what that's what he did that was his walk with the Lord and then then the king comes in and he's tricked into making a decree that no one should pray except if it was to this King Daniel heard the decree that would have been a good time for Daniel to saywell you know I don't have any Pride so I'm just not going to do it I think it was 30 days that the king gave the decree but no Daniel stood up for what he believed he didn't try to do something to to be different or to lift to exalt himself Daniel just kept praying and kept doing the the same thing that he always did and he wasn't afraid of the king's decree that's the difference between Daniel who was not who was just exalting the Lord Jesus and not himself and the others who exalt themselves and not the Lord Jesus because of Pride when I was growing up I remember people some the brothers would come over to our house they talk to Dad they were talking about all these these different doctrines and stuff and and I remember one one of them one of the the brothers of my dad's age said that he would rather his kids be in a bar on Sunday morning than to go to one of these churches Tucson Tabernacle was one of those churches he was talking about can you imagine the arrogance of saying something like that I remember as a kid I I heard him say it and can you imagine that of of the the arrogance that's there and the that's there saying that I'm so good that I don't want my children to be part of any of this other religion because we are too important we are too special and then you know what happened I hate to say it but he got his way I know at least two of his sons had major alcohol problems I think one of them ended up in jail I know one of them ended up in jail and he has the same thoughts today that he would rather them stay home and not being Church than lower themselves to those people that just don't have the great Revelation that that he has that his family has Pride you see you see how hard it is for God to get through something like that to blast through that barrier it's just it's it's extreme arrogance as I was talking about the the wise virgin and the foolish virgins the other day in the in the parable on on Sunday morning morning and I said that so many people will insult one another and call us call each other the foolish virgin judging them it's extreme Pride saying I am so much better putting them down it's it's a spirit brothers and sisters it's a harsh Spirit we don't think about Pride we think about the sins of uh of the world and we we think about how the the promiscuity in the world and we think about the drugs and we think about the alcohol all of which are are great sins but we forget about number one which is pride how important is it as I said you don't fight with your spouse if there's no Pride and there is no Pride whatsoever in God look at what he did look at how God represented himself God the creator of the heavens and the Earth the the greatest the only the the only one the Eternal God and he created this world shaped it with his hands created the stars in the sky separated the light from the darkness put the Sun out there created this world put water on it separated the water from the land put animals on it put his son and his daughter Eve there and said here take this this is my gift to you now multiply and replenish this Earth and and subdue it and you have rule over it and he made this beautiful Garden of Eden that he wanted them to live in and everything was just so beautiful they sinned and they they messed it up and then God shows his nature 4,000 or so years later not prideful but comes to Earth as the savior in a baby born to the poorest people in the land didn't have a house didn't have didn't have anything they were going to pay their taxes God chooses this Virgin Mary to have his son and he doesn't even give him a hospital doesn't even give him a room gives them A Manger to have this baby born with animals around and the dung of the animals around they put the baby in this little trough and that's what God chose to represent him there's no pride in God but how great is he that's how Jesus could say the first shall be last and the last shall be first and how great this God is and yet showed no Pride whatsoever came in the lowest of the low and this man Jesus Christ Proverbs 16 Verse 18 says this Pride goes Before Destruction and a hotty spirit before a fall every time I read that scripture I I I misinterpreted it I always thought that Pride goes away Before Destruction so when when you come right to it and your life's on the line or or or you really are embarrassed or something happens really bad you're like oh you know no Pride there I'll do anything but that's not what it means it means Pride preceeds the destruction the destruction's there and here is what leads us to that destruction is pride it goes before destruction and a hotti spirit before the PA before the fall the answer really to to my question on that because I thought that that Pride goes away before destruction Proverbs 18:12 says this before Before Destruction the heart of man is is Hottie and before honor is humility hottie means arrogance and this explains it all be be before the destruction that this man or this woman is arrogant and hotty and can't take any can't take any correction but honor is given with humility been born in a manger I tell you that is the ultimate to me the ultimate story of humbleness and humility is Jesus Christ the baby born in a manger born to the parents that he was born the upbringing that he had and it shows the very nature of God where even the Bible says that that Christ is the express image of God he is everything about God is in Christ before the destruction the heart of man is Hottie and before honor is humility as I said hottie means arrogant and and pride really it defies God Before Destruction there's Pride it defies God may give a gift how many times have we seen God give a gift to the church or give a gift to a person and that person refuses it because it doesn't go along they're too proud to accept something they're too proud to accept something different as I was talking about the different translations of the Bible we have brother brandom when he was preaching he didn't have anything else he had the King James and as I said I love the King James that's that's the my go-to that's what I read I love just the poetic nature and the beauty of the language but now there are there are more tools that we have to help us understand this word and if we stand back and say I don't want your gift God because it doesn't match my way of thinking proud and what's going to happen is you won't receive the blessings at the at the best case you won't be receive the blessings that God has for you in understanding your word I'm not saying all the translations are good there's many there's many bad ones but don't just refuse it because it's not it's not one translation that that you've grown up with as I said when they I want the kids in Sunday school I want them to learn the King James to quote the king James because that's what we use and if you are quoting different uh different translations then you're going to have tough time looking them up but if you're quoting one translation then you'll be able to find them later but these things are a blessing let's go back to I'm gonna I'm going to be fairly brief tonight let's go back to Malachi chter 4 and read this for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall lead them neither root nor Branch the proud and the wicked in the day of judgment in the day of the Lord when all of this world is destroyed the proud are listed with the Wicked with the Sinners how we should always keep that in our minds First Peter chapter 5 and I'll close with the scripture the musicians can come likewise you who are younger be subject to the elders clothe yourselves all of you with humility toward one another for God OPP opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble I think that that's one all of the great Servants of God every Prophet really that's as I was praying about this subject and studying on this subject one thing that I think that pretty much every Prophet lacked was Pride look at Jeremiah what he went through look at Ezekiel what he went through all of the embarrassment that the prophets went through even David when David David sinned and even when he got caught immediately he humbled himself and so Lord I'm not worthy that Pride was cast out and the Really the Great Men and the great women of the Bible it's one thing I think that they had all in common they were not prideful people are you with me everything good we have a quiet audience tonight let me ask this how many people here struggle with pride now you ones that didn't raise your hand are the ones I preached tonight to I'm just kidding we all do we all struggle with pride we all we all have that in us and one of the scriptures that I left out tonight it's it's born in a man it's born in a woman to have pride it's in our children that they have pride and it's it grows up in us but we can overcome that and I look back at at last night I I just I felt so ashamed you're my friends and I can confess that buttering that bread that it displeased God I never want to displease him and it was because of Pride amen you with me God bless you all little [Applause] Josiah change my heart oh God

close in prayer God bless you brothers and sisters I I cut I I cut the sermon way short tonight because I felt like it pleased the Lord it was it was going down and I not I mean it was going the way that I wanted it to and I thought you know what people are tired let's just cut it off right here and I want to continue on this subject I W to um but ly will continue on with David and I believe there's so much on pride in this Bible if the Lord's willing I'll preach on it this Sunday morning and then we will continue when when we switch off on the subjects God bless you and let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord God we we love you thank you for this opportunity to be here and to be in your presence to hear your word Lord and father we just ask that you would do your work father God just continue to move deeper in our lives and cut out the the ugliness Lord and help us all just to be transparent and honest with you Lord and to to do our own self-examination father God and

situation and ask the Lord Lord do I struggle with this because I don't want to have anything between you and me on that day I want to live my life according to the way the book teaches I want to be right and Lord if I'm wrong I want to repent and I want to change my life and I want to be that humble servant that this Bible teaches these prophets and these servants in the Bible they were humble people that's one thing that I can look at them and they all had it in common they were willing to do whatever the Lord said even Jonah you now he's the one that stands out but he still was willing to do what God told him he may not have understood it but he did it that's the way that we should be brothers and sisters God bless you have a good evening and the Lord guide you and protect you this
