Paula's brother is uh someone that has been going through a hard time he comes to church every once in a while um brother um um Joe Garcia and he's just now starting to think about the Lord and and starting starting to give his heart to the Lord Jesus he said he's he's been to the Jehovah Witnesses and he's been to the different ones and he he just needs something real and he needs something for Comfort brother brother Joe are you here might be with his sister this morning um but it's it's good to be able to introduce people to the Lord Jesus and and blessings and welcome to all the other visitors that we have I see a couple faces that I don't necessarily recognize sis what's your name yeah God bless you Sister Faith you're welcome it's good to have you and uh brother what's your name yeah you Michael you Raiders fan it's good to have you with you with you brother Joel yeah it's uh it's good it's good to have visitors I um I wanted to start service I didn't feel to tell the story last week but at David Williams Funeral um it was a we had a reception afterwards and probably not too many people here were there um but I was sitting with uh think sitting marily I think I was sitting with you and and some other people and um and I looked over and I see this table over there and I see this lady sitting there and uh she has a young lady it's an older lady was sitting there and she has a young lady and a young man maybe 12 12 years old or so and sitting all by themselves so I figured well I'll go over and and talk with them like like I do and and uh walked over there and I sat down and I could smell the remnants of cigarette smoke and uh she was kind of a a rough lady and I sat down and I said can I sit here she says yeah sure you know make yourself at home okay and uh I started I started talking I I mentioned to the to the two kids there I said uh I said 'is this your grandma and they said no that's our mom no hope for two I said oh okay all right so um I started started talking to her a little bit more and and uh I was like just looking at her there wasn't much there it would be easy to judge this lady and as I was talking I said I said sister I said do you know the Lord Jesus she says I sure do and I said uh I said well good um did you know David Williams she says she says yeah David and I have known each other and I was in my missionary mode I was in my witnessing mode I wanted I wanted to lead this lady to the Lord Jesus and as I started talking to her my perspective started to change turns out that that young man and that young lady that were there were not her biological children they were adopted children they were they were foster children and as I started talking with her I started talking about the Lord and she was talking back with me about the Lord and I could see that this lady knew her Bible she knew her word and I said I said so what do you do and she says well I serve the Lord she says I have fostered 185 foster children and I've adopted eight and she said I have pictures of every single one of them by my my dining room table so I can see them every time I sit down and eat and she says I pray for them every day and I looked and and then she kept talking and she Saidi introduced every single one of these kids to the Lord Jesus she says I bring him to church she says we sit around the table we have Bible study we talk about the Lord Jesus she said many of them have strayed she said but every one of them has been introduced to Jesus Christ and I thought sister Angela I thought if I would have told her well here's what you need to do you need to quit smoking you need to start growing your hair out you need to wash your face you need to change your clothes if I would have started saying that she might have looked at me and said young man she could say it I'm 52 like to think young man I have raised I have fostered 18 185 children adopted eight introduced the Lord Jesus Christ to every every single one of them and what have you done in your life if there would have been anything to me and if she would have said that I would have put my head down and I I would have said nothing compared to you thinking about that lady I called her yesterday and I said I just wanted to ask you is it okay if I talk about you to the church she said yeah that'd be fine she says I have a question for you she says and she kind of broke up she said David Williams she said did he know the Lord Jesus she said did he have a relationship with the Lord and I could tell that meant something to her imagine the burden that this lady had looking the way she did acting the way she did and I would have most certainly judged her I did Judge Her thinking that I need to lead this lady to the Lord and now she's preaching to me I'm the pastor of a church and she says I just always wondered and I said sister I said I have talked with David Williams many times and I said we have prayed together we have talked about the Lord together I said he and I have have had this Fellowship Around Jesus Christ and yes most certainly he knew the Lord she said I've been so worried about that brother thinking about how we can look at someone and judge that person just on their appearance and I can look and I can say I think this sister has done more for the Lord than I have in my whole life I admire her then I at that same meeting after that same dinner I talked to another man and I started talking about the Lord I started talking about going to church as somebody I knew and I said hey do you ever you ever think about going to church he said no he says I don't need to go to church I said okay he says I get to I get church out in the mountains he says that's where I find God and I said well that's good but that's not the word and I started thinking about this this man and I think if I could go to the mountains and I could I could pray like I like to do I go up into this place in the catalinas and I pray up there and I feel like I get so close to God if I could do that rather than coming to church on Sunday sometimes I feel like I would do well but that's not the word job found God up in the mountains he found God in nature but job didn't have the word he didn't have the bible to read all he had was looking and seeing God around him but the word says that we should come together to worship Psalm 138 says that g that God has exalted his word and his Spirit those two together you almost can't separate them that they are together and and how God loves his word and he has given as I read in the in Psalm 119 he has given us this word to light our path and we don't take it seriously enough God bless you sweetheart Sunday school's let letting out we uh by the way I think brother Josiah made the announcement we're going to start meeting in the fellowship we're going to start meeting here oh you forgot is it still here we are next week it's just the Lord he's good to us isn't he uh no that's okay next week we are going to meet all the Sunday school kids are going to meet in the sanctuary and then we will dismiss Sunday school from the sanctuary then that will go and then I want them to have about 15 extra minutes for the Sunday School teachers so next week all the kids you come to the sanctuary and then the worship leader will dismiss the Sunday schools are we together okay we might not like something that the that the word says but it's still the word and we still have to abide by it and the word is meant if you look in the Old Testament it's very specific from everything from from the the um the the priest's garments and and the tassels and the lengths and and how the the Tabernacle is built to all the Commandments it's very specific but then when you get to the New Testament it becomes very Broad and it's not it's not specific like it was in the New Testament because in the Old Testament something changed you have in the Old Testament it says Thou shalt not commit adultery very black and white very plain but then Jesus says that no he says that if you just want to be with a woman that's not your wife you have committed adultery it's meant not to be a hard fast rule it's meant to for the the believer to ponder upon these things to study them to get quiet in your room and say Lord how does this affect my life how does this scripture what what does it have for me and then we don't just come to church to hear the word we get the word every day if you're coming just Sunday morning you're you're you're starving to death that Bible needs to be read every day all the time I was praying about how to present this to the people this thought that I have about applying what you read in the book and then I just turned in my Bible the Proverbs chapter 29 I w't I won't read it but it's about correcting a child and and it says that if if this child is not disciplined then he will bring shame upon his mother and in another place it says if you spare the rod you spoil the child child but how did how would that affect Mama V this lady that I was talking about that was at the at the table how would that affect sister Angela over here and brother Jeremy they can't operate like these are their and then we pray about it so we can't apply it in our own lives brother brandom said this he said the revelation of Jesus Christ who he is and what he is now the next great thing we find out that he hates anything that'll put any R anything to rule over his church besides himself because he is a jealous God anything outside of Christ any Doctrine or or anything that deviates from the cross is something that is added and if we are if we take a Doctrine and we form our religion around that not only is it away from the teaching of the Bible but we're not even Christians anymore if our Doctrine gets away from Jesus we're not even Christians there's a brother here I think brother Jordan was here maybe brother Arie but there was a brother here a few months ago couple months ago and he was talking to me about a shift that he has seen in the ministry now this brother's been around for a long time he's not a pastor but he's been around the brother brandom's message for a long time and he he's very well-versed very intelligent brother and he says I've seen a shift from these type A Personalities in these ministers that they're all about fighting and they're all about their own Doctrine and they're all about getting their own message out and if someone doesn't agree with them then they will attack and they'll fight and we've seen this over the decades and he said but he said I think that they needed to be that way because they had to get the word out but he says I have seen a shift in the Ministries and he said like he says these new ministers he says this next Generation he was he was telling me he said you're not about this building your own kingdom anymore he said you are now shifting away from that and you are now putting Christ in in the front of the people and not so much yourself we see there is a generation rising up that's not going to stand for this sectarian way of thinking this divisive way of thinking this generation is going to take God at his word it isn't about friends it's not about celebrity it's not about who is speaking at the church or who's leading worship I believe that we are going to see and I believe it with all my heart I believe that we are going to see a generation that finally puts Christ first and will not compromise on the word and I want to be in that generation I do I see a generation that is going to take God at his word and put Christ first so I was back here praying sitting in my chair and I was like Lord I I feel like there's something missing looking at my notes and Lord I I just don't feel that this is this is complete so something told me and I was thinking about this next Generation I was think about these young people and I was saying Lord what's what's right and something I won't say something said it but I just had a had a desire I saw Josiah and Katie and Daniel were upstairs in the upper room practicing and I felt led to go up and ask Katie give me a scripture I need something give me a scripture so I walked up there and I knew that that this generation I just felt this generation is going to put Christ first I walked up to walked up to the upper room and there's Katie and Josiah sitting there and and they're practicing and I hand my Bible to Sister Katie and I said give me a scripture and she looks and like she said 'w what what do you mean she said new testament old testament I said I don't care just give me a scripture and I'm sorry I make you nervous it's my personality I said just give me one and she was like well like I just give me one and she's she's flipping around I like Katie just give me a scripture and she's like well um and then she's still flipping and she flips and she gets to Philippians I said just stop I said right there just give me one so she looks and she says and she points brother Jordan if you could put it up Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 and she points she says okay here listen to this next Generation I believe that this represents it let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross wherefore God also ha highly exalted him and given him a name which is above every name that the name of Jesus that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of the things of things in heaven and things in Earth and the things under the Earth and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father it was perfect in line with what I wanted to minister today and that is getting into this word and getting away from all of our own ideas and getting back to the Lord Jesus Christ perfect amen 1 Corinthians chapter 1 verse 17 listen to this for Christ sent me not to baptize but to preach the gospel not with the wisdom of word words lest the Cross of Christ should be made of none effect how do you make the cross of none effect how do you do that by coming up with some new revelation of or something bigger than the cross and then the ministry gets built around that and we make the cross of none effect we just leave it we just leave it now it's about my Ministry now it's about my Revelation those Revelations might be right but when we get away from the cross and you think really brother Lionel the cross and the story of the cross and Jesus dying at the on the cross it doesn't glorify any of us it's something that one man did 2,000 years ago that affects every person who has ever lived on the face of the Earth the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ is the most momentous occasion in the history of the Earth but so often it's not enough we want some revelation we want to point to to something else for the preaching of the Cross to them that perish is foolishness it's not enough but unto us which are saved it is the power of God for it is written I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and I will bring nothing to the nothing the understand bring to nothing the understanding of The Prudent where is the wise where is the Scribe where is the disputer of this world ha not God made foolishness foolish the wisdom of this world for after that in the wisdom of God the World by wisdom knew not God it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe everyone and we have to be careful because we're all like that everyone has a new revelation a new something new that makes them more special that than someone else and sometimes I want to say just just brother just read the word just read the Bible that is the absolute word of God is this Bible but we want something more dramatic we want something that will exalt ourselves above above the others it's like with this rock with Moses here's this rock it's just so anticlimactic to speak to it it's so much better if you just hit it if you smite it but no God just wanted his word spoken and then God would have brought forth the water just like he promised but instead we sh shift into something that's beyond the word or outside of the word the Bible says the I believe it's David that he writes the law on his bedst he it's everywhere in front of him it's constantly he's constantly reminiscing about the law like I read Psalm 119 it's always in his mind it's always in front of his eyes and that's the way it should be all the time 2 Corinthians s chapter 3 look at how much brothers and sisters the word should be greater today than it is Do We Begin Again to commend ourselves or do we need as some others Epistles of commendation from you or letters of commendation from you you're going from place to place do you need to carry a letter with you saying you're from the two sign Tabernacle or do you need to bring a letter saying that that you're from this congregation or or that the pastor recommends you to preach at another church do you need that you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men your very life is a letter that everyone can read your Li and your lives are written in our hearts that's beautiful not only are you out representing Jesus Christ but here at home brother your life is written on my heart I want you I want to see you out there I want to see you succeeding I want to see you spreading this gospel Hano I want to see you doing the will of God leading people like like you wrote that testimony and pray praying for your friend leading people to this Jesus Christ that we know you're written on my heart brother I want to see it you don't need a letter of commendation right you need a life for as much as you are manifestly declared to be Epistles of Christ ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshy fleshy tables of the heart amen whenever you go wherever whatever you are doing wherever you go you are representing Jesus Christ I heard a story about sister that uh I don't know probably I don't know if anybody knows her here but going out and she was driving and then this kid gets behind her who I know and and he wants to say hi to her so he's behind and he's honking hey honking at her hey you know want to get her attention she s sticks her hand out the window and she wasn't calling him number one somebody's always watching you what a disgrace to someone that claims to believe brother bram's message that claims that oh we put brother brandom first we put we we lift him up and and we won't even hear anyone else because of how great he is and then you're doing that sis I don't think so and I look at all of us and what do you do what do I do will I criticize a brother or sister the Bible says never speak speak something bad about anyone it says to do good that to those that hate you and to pray for those that despitefully use you what do I do for the young people the Bible says forbids sex before marriage forbids it very plain and yet what do we do the Bible says many other things and we should sit and read this Bible and say Lord how does this apply to my own life but we get stuck glorifying ourselves and bragging about how great we are and we forget those things I say it often just be a Christian well we have the message we have we have this Revelation that Revelation just be a Christian that's the most important thing and then the Lord then the Lord he won't add to Christ I promise you that but he will help you and me with our change in our bodies Our change in our lives verse four and such trust have we through Christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also hath made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the kth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and engraved in stone was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which the glory was to be done away very interesting statement right there Moses we go back I don't know 1500 years ago or whatever it was before Paul wrote this Moses he gets up and he he gets the Ten Commandments he comes down and he sees the people had fallen and started worshiping Idols he he gets angry he breaks the Commandments and then after that God invites him back up to the mountain Moses goes up there and he spends 40 days with God doesn't eat doesn't drink just the glory of God sustains him and when he comes down from the mountain his face glowed just it's amazing thing and they look at Moses and and they're they're just amazed at Moses's face so Moses covers his face with a veil because the people they probably would have wanted to wait in line just to see Moses's face so he covered his face with that Veil because of this shining that was on him but let me tell you something that shining that that anointing that was on Moses it eventually faded away verse eight how shall the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious for if the ministration of condemnation be glory that was Moses bringing down the law much more does the ministration of righte exceed in glory we have a difference here he's starting to lay the foundation between the Old Testament and the New Testament the law was sent to judge it was sent to condemn The Sinner and then the sinner was required to make an atonement for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this Respect by the reason of the glory that excelth for if that which was done away was glorious that's this glowing that was on Moses's face much more that which remaineth is glorious the English Standard Version of that says for if that was being brought to an end came with Glory much more will this permanent have Glory seeing then that we have such a hope we have such great plainness of speech in other words since we have such hope we are very bold and not as Moses which put a veil over his face that the children of Israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which was abolished he put a a veil over his face he was hiding something that was going to fade away they probably as I said would have waited in line to see Moses's face and the same thing with the church a lot of times we'll see this great powerful service or the people will come to the altar they'll weep at their their seeds but days go by and that Glory that was once on them begins to fade just as the light was on Moses's face Fades but that does not have to be this is a different day what they didn't have back then is the holy spirit of God and once that Holy Spirit comes in it doesn't fade but the key is to stay in the word all the time open up your Bible read the scriptures then go then ask the Lord how does this apply to my life and God will make those scriptures alive as I said in Psalm 138 it says that God exalts his word and he exalts his spirit and how that should be in our lives all the time how many times have you heard for those that listen to brother bram's sermons how many times have you heard brother Bram say God is his own interpreter what does that mean have you really sat down and and wondered what does it mean that God's his own interpreter well what what's the preacher up there for well what's the prophet therefore aren't aren't you supposed to explain these things to us no that's not what he's saying he's saying that when you hear the word then God will interpret that word to manifest itself in your life so when you see when you when you're reading your Bible and you see maybe 1 Timothy 2:9 says a woman shall Adorn herself in modest apparal with shamefacedness and sobriety not with gold or pearls or costly array you can read that word you can sit down you say Lord how do you want me to apply this in my life yes or the man when it says in Hebrews that that don't neglect the assembling of yourselves together especially as you see the day approaching how do Lord how does that affect me here's my family Lord what do you want me to do here maybe I need to step it up in my life for my kid's sake and I need to set that example it says in 1 Corinthians 11 that the man is the head of the wife as Christ is the head of the man so what does that mean that means that I need to live a life like Christ did before the church I need to live that life in front of my family need to have our devotions and our Bible studies around the family table as a dad I look at a man and that man needs to be able to take that word or that woman needs to be able to take that word and apply it to their own life Lord what does this mean what do you want from me but their minds verse 14 but their minds he's speaking of the people that just have this lifeless religion but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same Veil untaken away in reading of the Old Testament which Veil is done away in Christ another translation says but their minds were hardened for to this day when they read the old Covenant the same Veil remains unlifted because only through Christ it is taken away he's saying that the people can read the word but they don't get it they they should be able to read Leviticus and see the sacrifices the scapegoat and the wave Chief and the sin offering all of that represented Christ it was manifested when Christ came Christ is the entire mystery of God revealed in the New Testament the New Testament isn't just writings in the Bible after Jesus was born it is a testament that all the Old Testament taught all the teachings in the Old Testament was fulfilled in this man named Jesus Christ that's what make the old Old Testament so beautiful I love reading the Old Testament because I can see here is Jesus all the way through and then in the New Testament wow fulfilled over and over again that's why Paul the very end of Paul's life he was reading his Bible the Old Testament and people were coming in and Paul was showing them look this this scapegoat going out whatever it is these prophecies are fulfilled in this man named Jesus Christ and people would come from near and far just to hear this wisdom of Paul and he would tell them about this man Jesus Christ fulfilled the Old Testament it showed that he is the fullness Jesus of the godhead he is the fullness of every sacrifice he's the fullness of every prophecy he is everything and he replaced in this atonement that Jesus made it replaced an atonement that was imperfect a goat can't die for me a lamb can't die for me only Jesus Christ could die for me it just makes the Old Testament so much more beautiful when you see it was fulfilled in Jesus Christ and the same thing with preaching the word today it does not do any good to sit and listen to a sermon preached unless that spirit is made alive in us and God is interpreting what that Minister says or what what that what reading the Bible says or the sermon that you're listening to it doesn't do any good until we are quickened with the Holy Spirit and it's made alive in us that Veil there was a veil that that they set up in the Tabernacle that Moses set up that that was a barrier between The Mercy Seat the holy of holies and one time a year that priest could go in there and he would go in and the power of God would come down and it was only that priest that could do it and he would make the atonement for the sins for the people but now when Jesus Christ died on the cross there was that curtain that veil was there it was ripped into symbolizing that now you can come to Christ and you don't have to go through a priest you don't have to go through anyone that's the whole meaning behind the Old Testament here it is and now you can go to Christ yourself amen you don't need someone verse 15 is that where I'm at but even today even this day when Moses is R the veil is still upon their heart and it's so sad that when a person is stuck in their religion or their denomination that they make the preaching of Christ of none effect because it's not about Christ anymore they still think that it's through their righteous Deeds that they'll receive Mercy you can't be righteous I think it was Isaiah that said Your Righteous Deeds are filthy rags to God brother random said I love this quote Grace is what God did for you and works sorry I already read that one brother Jordan and works is what you do for God what a what a I mean very wise statement Grace was there for me but now I love him so much here's my Works Lord here's what I want to do for you then Jesus said he also said if you love me keep my Commandments nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord the veil shall be taken away verse 16 nevertheless when it shall turn to the Lord that Veil shall be taken away so when you finally turn your heart heart and your mind to Christ to what he did on Calvary to why his blood is an atonement when you turn to the message of love and patience and forgiveness that's not taught in the law but is manifested in both the man and the message of Jesus Christ that's when things change then there's no longer a covering over your eyes you see you clearly see the meaning behind the Old Testament you see the meaning of the words of God in Jesus Christ becomes real to you and then you are filled with his spirit and you become one with the word and you are reborn into a living breathing disciple of Jesus Christ and as I said then you are able to open your Bible and apply this to your own life it shouldn't offend you if it's something that disagrees with the way that you are living pray about it and say Lord where in this word what do I need to do to change my life because I want to do it because here you are here is your perfect word from God himself not from a preacher from God himself and you're reading it and it you need to say Lord how does this effect interpret your word to me because I want to live up to this word as I said the men they can open their Bible and see that they can be more of a husband to their wives they can be more of a dad to their children and as I said before the new testament's vague it's not cut and dry it's vague because it allows for the Holy Spirit to come in and interpret the law was imperfect before but with Christ it becomes perfect amen now the Lord is that spirit and where the Lord where the spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty we see that the Lord here and the spirit are the same thing it makes not a trinity of three separate but equal Gods but of one God operating in three different capacities but it's one God and where verse number 18 but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord another translation says and we all with unveiled face now that's brother one it's not going to leave us anymore that shining Glory that's that's within us now it doesn't Fade with an unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image from one degree of Glory to another as the King James says from glory to glory for this comes from the Lord who is the spirit so if Moses experienced this change that was so powerful that his face shined but that Glory faded over time Paul is saying here that that's not anything compared to what you have because that same Glory that was up on the mountain in the in the burning bush that same Glory that came down into the Tabernacle now at the day of Pentecost that same Glory entered into you and now you shine forth as Sons and Daughters of God to repr represent the Jesus represent Jesus Christ a resurrected crucified and resurrected Jesus Christ then we can pray as I open my bible and I see here Lord it says that I'll be healed so I'm going to act on your word I'm going to believe your word Lord it says for me to change my ways in these certain ways I'm going to act on your word now Lord you act on your word because you promised at the day of Pentecost when they received the Living Word of God and the spirit of God would no longer fade like it did for Moses so much so they receed that they went out and they started preaching and there were people that spoke to different languages people were hearing them in their own language this is the glory of the Lord shining forth after they had received the Holy Spirit so much so that even the shadow of a disciple going by someone who is sick just the shadow going over they were healed in the name of Jesus Christ that's Glory that and it doesn't fade that Holy Spirit is as strong today as it ever has been the people saw this and they were cut in their hearts they were they were like Lord this is amazing if the musicians could come Acts chapter 2 Peter is preaching they're doing Miracles speaking in tongues they're they're preaching the gospel and other languages that they didn't speak they go to Peter and they say this now when they heard this they were pricked in their heart they were cut in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Bre what shall we do that's where we should be that light should shine forth all the time glow not a a glow that Fades but all the time this gospel should shine forth this Holy Spirit should shine forth and it's it's not a temporary thing this will last us through eternity and then people will see and they'll say what must we do this is this is something that I've never been I've never been introduced to this Jesus Christ how maybe they always thought that he was just some some past person that taught you to live a good life but no this Jesus Christ is alive he rose from the dead and he's alive not in a man but he is alive in men and women of God and then people will see say I need to do something with my life I need to change what must we do and Peter said unto them repent go back on your sins change don't stay in your sins come to this water be a different person repent and be baptized every one of you that doesn't leave any wiggle room to be baptized in any other name or in any other way repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins for the taking away of your sins in another place it says come to the water that you may be washed your sins may be washed [Music] away and it comes with a promise Bianca you back there it comes with a promise that if you will do this that same spirit that same anointing that same Jesus Christ that you will receive the gift of the Holy Ghost the same gift that Peter had when he preached it the same gift that Peter had when he walked by and his shadow caused people to be healed the same gift that Peter and John had when they came to the man at the gate called Beautiful the paralyzed man and they said Silver and Gold Have I None but that which I have to I give to you rise up and walk that same gift of the holy spirit will be in you I don't know if I can say that this is the best part but this is a really really really good part for This Promise is unto you yes and to your children and to all that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call how many people in this building today have been called by Jesus Christ I have amen I'm called by him brother the Manny I'm I'm called by Christ where else would I go what else would I want and his word is is real to me it's not this Old Testament where I have to go down and check the boxes it's a new testament where these boxes and all of that is now in me and it's alive and it's living and it's making every decision for me that is the gift of the Holy [Music] Spirit Mama V this lady I talked about she might not fit in our ranks to today but I'll tell you what I've really appreciated her that lady she she told me yesterday she we talked shortly and she said if you're ever out in three points um she said come see me she said I'll make you a meal she said it might not be good food like you're used to but it'll be it'll be something to eat God bless her I believe Heaven's going to be filled with people like that that have taken their life as Jesus Christ did and given it to someone else now I give my life to Christ now Lord these works that I live in my life this holy life that I live trying to follow every Commandment that you said trying to take your word and apply it to my life now Lord this is what I do for you I'm a failure I'm going to mess it up but I'm going to do everything that I can I'm going to live a life that is pleasing to you because I want to give you something it's a beautiful story brothers and sisters [Music] it's it's life God's word is life and and Isaiah said let me read it Isaiah said this in Isaiah 5511 he says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing whereinto I sent it amen this word that God gave us if we will accept it and we will we will read it and Ponder and pray over it then it won't return to God void it's going to accomplish in our lives what God intends did and one of those things if you have it on your heart to be baptized we have at least one if you have it on your heart to be baptized that's one of those things that God said to repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the washing away of your sins it's a good time to do it Bianca are we still on sister Missy and I would encourage anyone else to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ if you want your life friends if to change if you want to do it this

wasn't anybody in the fellowship hall and I think it was right before service and I walked out and sister Bianca was there and she was leaning up against the counter and she was facing the wall and I could see that she was deep in thought and uh walked up to her and I said are you okay and she said every time that you mention baptism she said every time that that you ask she said there's something inside of me that just wants to go and she's prayed about this and she's thought about it for a long time and we talked again on Wednesday evening about what baptism means and she really she says I I I want to do it it she says it's really it's important to me and I want to do it right now so much so that her dad she talked to all of us know brother Shawn she talked with her dad and of course her
