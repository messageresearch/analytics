the hot water in ja pan and he's going no no no no and mama said let him touch it once and they won't do it again and daddy said yeah but if I if he does it my way he'll still have his hand and

[Music] all through it all I've learned to depend one more time oh through it [Music] all through it all I've learned to trust in Jesus [Music] through it all learn to depend upon God's word amen special blessing tonight brothers and sisters first let me greet um brother Bill sister Marcy God bless you welcome from up in Flagstaff I don't know if brother Aaron already welcomed you and greeted you but consider this another one God bless you I met him out outside here in the um in the fellowship hall and um I don't see any other visitors Kurt brother Kurt you're not a visitor sister Olivia God bless you it's good it's good to have you with us special blessing as I said that we get to hear at testimony I don't know there's probably 50 between 50 and 60 people here in this room tonight every single one of us has a testimony and every there's no testimony any greater than any other one some testimonies might relate to my life some testimonies might relate to your life but they are all testimonies of how God came down and lit the fire in our lives there was one man that um he was blunt blind I believe he's born blind Jesus came to him talks to him he uh Jesus does a very strange thing he he he spits on the ground and he makes some mud and he takes that mud and he puts it over the Man's eyes and he says now go wash in the pool and the man received his sight and he didn't know who prayed for him so then he's going around and everybody seeing this man that they knew was blind and and the priests come to him and they knew who did it they knew it was this man Jesus called Christ so they go to the parents and they're like who did this what what happened to this man and his parents are like um because they were about to be excommunicated from the temple the parents was like well don't ask us he's old enough he was like 40 years old ask him so the priest go to him and they're like they asked who did this to you who healed you and and are you worshiping this man of be elub and all that and he says listen he says you say that he's a sinner he says I don't know he says I don't know if he's a sinner I don't know if he's a saint he says but what I do know is once I was blind and now I can see now that is our testimony we heard about the woman at the well this morning how she she met this man this Messiah and he starts telling you have had five husbands and the one that you're living with now she says Whoa she says I perceive that you're a prophet she said the Messiah is supposed to tell us these things and he says I he and then that sister she goes out and through through her testimony her testimony through her testimony she goes back to her town and she starts witnessing come see a man who told me what I have done isn't this the very Messiah and here they come and they started coming to Jesus from that sister's testimony so we see this book this book right here is full of testimonies and one of the one of the greatest things about this book is when Revelation chap 22 was written and the last verse was pinned and they put the period there it didn't end those testimonies continued and they've continued now for over 2,000 years and they're still coming and we are going to hear another testimony tonight of how the candle got lit brother Ron let's all stand brother Ron glidewell if you've been around the Tucson Tabernacle for very long you know the glidewell family they've been pillars in the church for a long time brother Ron not only has he been a blessing I'm sure to many people here he's been a blessing to me he's been a friend and and real encouragement to me over the past year and a half or so and I'm honored to introduce our brother brother Ron glidewell and he can tell us how that candle that's burning in his heart got lit brother Ron let me just pray for a minute Close Our Eyes Heavenly Father we come before you truly humbly searching our motives Lord that we bring no attention to ourselves but Lord that we would encourage those that that struggle some Lord that maybe have a sorted past even those Lord that I think they're good and that we all need salvation amen and Lord may you use me in these words that I may encourage those that that are questioning their salvation that know someone or themselves father that that just need a closer walk with you which we know we all need to draw closer to you Lord so I pray that you would just inspire me and and if not Lord just allow me to to encourage I thank you Lord Jesus for this in your wonderful and precious name amen you can be seated if you like um am I speaking loud enough into the microphone I know I've sit where you are so many times and we have people that you know they turn their head and they talk and you can't hear them so I thought well well I could criticize him or what if I'm up there someday so so you know I'm I'm very um cognant of the fact that those that put forth the effort to to to have this church to to take the time to to learn the songs to uh use their talents uh the pastor the musicians the everyone that puts forth the effort it it it didn't just happen you know you just don't drive down the street and everything is just there someone made the effort and I would just like to thank those myself that I appreciate that there's always there's always been someone there's always been a witness you know throughout the ages and the generations God never let the light go completely out um he's always been faithful um I have a few scriptures written down that I try to have have some kind of a theme to my testimony but uh I believe as I found my way back to God of course he never lost me I was just out of his will and it's it's so it's it's difficult where do I began I I was raised in a in a Christian home I have to excuse me here I have an issue with my right eye so I have these magnifying glasses I can read but uh if we go to se brother if we go to Second Timothy 3:15 i' like to just read that scripture if I can find it see second Timothy and it reads like this and from and from that child thou H has known the holy scriptures from that as a child that has known the holy SP scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus even though I many times did not obey God's word many times I wasn't sure if it was for me but my mom and my dad were faithful to take me to church and to do the best they could to teach me the word of God Amen and I encourage you that have families bring your kids to church read them the bible teach them the word of God and you know they might not show any any sign of anything I know my my three daughters I my I preached them on the way to church and the way to home and theyd sit in church you know what they said we don't remember any of it wow it's okay they're under the token now those of you that have heard the message you know what I'm talking about but it took a while for me to get there to understand this as a child I'm I'll be 70 years old my birthday in May and so many times I saywell Lord I've missed my opportunity to do anything for you but because I was taught the word of God I remember Moses I got 10 more years to go before I'm ready to serve you know he was 80 years old when God finally when he went to Egypt to bring them out and he was preparing him to that point you know some of us start at an early age some of us start later so whatever age you are and you think well I've done nothing for God there's still hope because I believe we all have a testimony we all have a responsibility to share what we have that's right amen uh how do how do I serve God I remember brother green was he was trying to to get every aspect of serving God and he says well those of you that sing loud he says uh Inspire those around you to sing and praise God uh and he was trying to get everybody to inspire someone else uh he said if if you uh and I I'll share this I he said if you have a complex and brother brandham said this he says go the opposite way and quite frankly I was my I don't want you to be afraid of me because I was so rebellious I I um some of the people really didn't want to be around me and uh so I had a complex as you as you decide you know Lord I'm I'm going to serve you I'm I I can't be a sinner it just doesn't work for me and you have a complex that nobody likes you well they didn't shake my hand they didn't say God bless you and so brother green gets up and preaches see that's how God works is through preachers if you want to know if if you're having an issue you're reading the Bible and you're you're by yourself and you're praying as the Lord give go to church and listen to what the pastor has to say maybe talk to your brothers and sisters maybe a brother or sister says you know I had that same circumstance we're a family we're not meant to be alone I think that was established with with Adam he he didn't want to be alone now I I will skip around from so just got to bear with me but you know Adam didn't want to be alone I'm sure Adam as he was in the garden I've thought about this stuff many times and pondered it don't you know he saw Mr and Mrs bear they'd have a little cub and why that's so wonderful you know I had him had a heart you know see the Lions you know the Mr and Mrs lion and they have the little cubs oh my aren't they cute and kind of like job it kind of dawned on me where's my other half and God saw this need and said it's not good for him to be alone and I think that's that's all of us it's not good to be alone don't don't let Satan isolate you you know you need the fellowship you know because it's so easy for us to be alone and read our Bible and come off with some little idea that is so far-fetched that's right and it happens whereas I've done it where I I thought my this is this I think I understand what this means and uh well if I get a chance I'm going to tell somebody and then I get to search in a quote and as you searching quotes I end up reading the whole book wow he explained what I thought I knew and I was wrong wow we need to do that be be humble don't you know if God has revealed something that's the word if it's in the word of God put away your own understanding amen amen you know it'll get you into trouble like I thought nobody liked me nobody and if you if you put out that attitude then nobody will like you that's right you know and and those of you know here I'm a pest I'll walk up to you if you if you got your back to me I'll grab your arm and shake your hand what I'm doing is I'm I'm fighting that that that thing that would that would bother me I'm putting it down I'm not allowing that because I I was will show myself friendly that's good you know may maybe you just you were busy talking to somebody and say go well they they didn't want to talk to you I hope this helps and these are some of the things that that I've learned you know make yourself friendly uh get to know people get out of your little oh I'm preaching now get out of your click and go go mingle with somebody else I've done this for years and and uh we had a group that would meet on the North side after church and we had a group that would meet in here and a group would meet outside and some of the parking lot and I realized I wasn't get to fellowship with all my brothers and sisters so I'd make my rounds and I I I had to do that I had another brother that I I really held him in high esteem but my brother wouldn't give me the time of day and I just I thought well you know what he don't like me and I pondered this and what it does it puts bitterness in your heart and something this is where the Holy Ghost comes in this is how you know if you have the Holy Spirit or not something says what have you done what have you done to cause that brother to to even acknowledge you amen okay well I changed my attitude I'm going to get that brother's attention and I'm going to be his friend and I'll tell you what that brother I'll tell you who it was it was brother yoro and I have a 10th grade education I can't talk to him but you know what but you know when it comes to the word of God we're all the same we're all equals absolutely and I made an effort to make him my friend that's good and uh we had attended brother Mark's church for a while and he had some special meetings brother yoro came up and who did he seek out to confide in to talk to that's good amen you know listen to God it might take a while but his he doesn't he won't Lead You astray he will not so like I said from a child I was taught the holy scriptures and it never leaves you it never really does I'll try to condense some of this but we' were raised in in denominations and U I was told by my aunts and my uncles and different ones you have a gift yeah right I've heard this my whole life and I I didn't believe them I thought they were just being nice but I do remember that we would go to these these little special meetings and I was I was born in Los Angeles California and we moved soon afterwards we moved back to my mom and dad's Hometown in Arkansas so I spent several years in Arkansas in the small towns and that are not domination meetings and I remember we were shitari we were right if you didn't believe like we did you're going to hell and I heard this so much as a child my my mother's dad was a he was an alcoholic and he' been in prison Tucker Farm in Arkansas and I love that guy because he loved me my other grandpa he was a Christian but he gave me he didn't give me the time of day so who did I gravitate to wow very good who did I gravitate to so he was The Bootlegger of the town he used to take me in his a little car we go out in the sticks and he said I don't tell nobody where I'm keeping my Hooch oh sir Grandpa how was I he he's the first one that got me addicted to ice cream you know we had a it my Grandpa he was the alcoholic but he treated me so kindly and loving so and he hadn't treated my mom so nice I know she's watching this sorry Mom but he sure treated me nice and I love that man and I remember I would hear these people talk about yeah they drink beer they're going to hell they smoke cigarettes they're going to hell well here I am a six seven year old little boy saying I don't want my grandpa to go to hell I'm a child I hadn't even given my heart to the Lord yet and I'm already it's in my heart I don't want him to go to hell I love him he's my grandpa you see I believe the seat of God is in us if we're in the mind of God and he we're manifested in this time we are already sons of God we just don't know it yet and if we look back before that we finally say Lord I Surrender he was working with us I've heard him say that you know God is God was good to me today I believe that you know Revelation is something that God gives you personal it makes it personal to you I am persuaded God's always been good to me when I hear that I wonder well wasn't he good to you the other day was he good to you when you were born I can see he's had the hand on me ever since I was born I have issues that when I was born um quite frankly it was uh quite a quite an ordeal I won't go into details on it but it it it affected me most of my life of being ashamed and to be be shy I I failed many classes in school because I just when it come time to get up on the chalkboard I would just froze up and I wouldn't look at anybody and I was ashamed of who I was and it it it's a horrible thing to put that on your your children you know to put it on anyone that has something you know maybe they're not just like you but don't do that don't do that it it it caused me to to lean toward the devil wanted me to be part of his crew and so he befriended me and I was a little child and well the Christians I think I believe in God I always as as a child I'm going to confess I never doubted there was a God I just didn't believe he loved me I had no doubt there was a God he don't love me and I always wondered what's going to happen when I die you know because I've been taught if that if I don't serve God I'm going to hell you know they taught it pretty hard in Pentecost it is the truth but the hardness they had was just if you don't believe it just like we do and I remember as a child we had taken a trip to Oklahoma to uh visit my grandmother's sister wow they were Oneness they're totally off the base and trinitarians we got the truth see this is I'm leading up to something that so many people think they're right and someone else's is wrong truth is they were both wrong that's right that's good but we go we go and we get up to Oklahoma where my grandmother's people were from and uh they had already went to church so we walked in the church was full they were having a Revival I've been to revivals before I'm just a little boy and I remember well to talk about Aunt Johnny she's won this we she's sure a nice person but they sure got their doct and wrong and it went on and on and on I heard this the whole way up there oh man and I'm just a child but I'm listening yeah amen and we get there and these people are singing the same songs we sing they get the ladies had the long hair and they had the dresses and the brothers were dressed like my dad and like wow they look just like we do singing the same song and they were worshiping God with all their heart and I'll be honest with you it confused me wow how could they be so wrong they're doing exactly the same thing we do wow amen and you know as we got older and realized that that both them were wrong on their Doctrine but most of it was just wrong in their Spirit you know um and I've encountered people today and told them this story and they still defend the well the Oneness are radicals really if I'm not mistaken the Catholic Church killed people for not believing their Doctrine oh well I think that's radical so you know as we go along we need to have connection with God and let him lead us let him lead us to truth you know it it I am so grateful that that he led me to this message that's right but as a child uh we went my dad we went to all the meetings dad was looking for something and we went to we moved back to Los Angeles when I was seven and uh from there we moved over here when I was 12 you know for a child though that that amount of time is a lifetime and we went to these meetings and I kept hearing the same thing you know that we went to TL osbor meeting at the Cow Palace I think brother brand preached there also and I love going to his because he had films I love I was dicted to television from the time first time ever watched it and man we got he had this huge screen and they did films especially his uh missionary work in India wow and then he did a good job I mean it is like watching a movie and man I I like going to TL osburns you know it did I seen you know they'd show the paganism in India then he show you know they'd have a people giving their heart to the Lord and and uh you know he was he he was a good he was a good man to to get you to think about your salvation and your Eternal destination and as a child I guess I was about eight or nine I'm not sure which and he started talking about you know you continue this way you're you're going to end up in destruction and you won't have a when you die you won't you're GNA meet destruction you know he had a way of saying and something in my heart said oh my but it also is he he wanted he says give your heart to the Lord Jesus that this man died on calary so that you don't have to go through that if you give your heart to this Lord Jesus he'll save you that's pretty simple isn't it my little heart I listened to it and Mom and Dad had no idea what's going on we're standing there and I'd already determined well I've been to these Services many times he's going to give an alter call well I'm like the guy on a you're going to do the 50 yard dash I'm at the blocks I'm ready you know when he gives it I'm going and I remember they give the invitation and I had to push my mom and my little sister my dad I where are you going I'm going up front I'm going to give my heart to the Lord Jesus and I remember I ran to the to the front of course there's hundreds of them and at that time you know when we had those meetings people gave their heart to the Lord by the hundreds that's right it it's becoming more difficult just a sign of the times the men are hardened amen but I remember that just you can't put into words as a child when God come into my heart and I knew beyond a shadow of Doubt at that moment he had accepted my My Confession and science can they can say whatever they want to they haven't experienced it they're showing their ignorance I have been saved by the Lord Jesus Christ he saved me from my sins he lifted that guilt of sin off the this that little boy's heart and I was persuaded it was rather selfish I said Lord you need to come right now I'm ready that's how sure I was and that was the beginning of my conversion but it obviously had started years before and I like teal urn you know brother Brenham lik teal urn and he was a good man I believe he God used him many Souls were one to the kingdom of God and many Souls that through his ministry also believe the message and but here's the problem went back to school we had no youth program mom and dad didn't dad he he liked going to his room alone and reading his Bible and praying and then Mom would do her thing and uh it was you know go outside play and then of course none of my most of my friends at church were catholic I mean not church but at school we're Catholic or they were just huls so I didn't have any support I'm just a child but God had started the work in my heart and I didn't know what to do so I just went right back to the same little boy had always been you know playing rough and hard with my friends and you know we and amongst our little friends we'd swear and you know carry on and be silly and I knew God wasn't happy with that and each time though that we would go to church and as I got older I remember my aunt she was a woman preacher she says you need to receive the Holy Spirit Well I did so she tried to get me to say I forget what she tried to get me to say say it faster and faster and faster and my grandmother had her hands on me and I was just surrounded you know and they were going to get me prayed through the Holy Spirit and well you got it okay well I remembered when I got saved I didn't got it not yet and it was just a it wasn't time yet it wasn't time time I I had to go through some some hard times and so I became quite frankly disillusioned with the denominational church that we were going to and um they had a lot of the old-timers had been uh partakers of that first outpouring you know theza Street and brother Aaron the older ones knows what I'm talking about and I i' those men really really had an experience and I knew the difference uh we had a brother Thompson he was a World War I veteran and they would ask him we had a testimony service on Wednesday night and my he he was so enthused about how God had saved him through World War one and uh he still had that fire and he's the first man I've ever seen die in front of me he got up and I remember he was given one of his testimonies he was just on fire and they had a row of chairs that said on the right that' be your right and on each side we had the pastor and his wife they sat up front together and uh he sat down and we got up when we sang a song like we do it's just it's traditional I'll fly away and he did he did he sat there and took his last breath and that was it somebody said said brother Thompson's not breathing well his daughter was an RN nurse of course it didn't take long my dad's dead and I'm sitting up there watching wow I just seen my first dead person and because of the influence that television had on me about death and ghost and stuff I couldn't sleep all night I'd lay awake and I'd hear something and oh that's his ghost he's come to haunt me you know you know your you old child has these imaginations and and these fears and and S plays on that with a child and I didn't understand what had happened I should have been like my but now I have a different opinion you know if the Lord would let me get up and rattle on about my testimony and I was to sit down and die praise the Lord I'm okay with it don't no I I've had that discussion you know I've spent many times I drove a truck and I spent a lot of time alone and I I was persuaded that you know if the Lord asked me to give my life for him as a martyr I what else better thing I could do amen but as I thought on those thoughts something says that is an age we're living in I did I'm not calling my bride and the people of this age to die for me I'm calling them to live for me yes amen [Applause] amen and brothers and sisters being a martyr would be so much easier true it's tough and I I Now understand how easy easy it was for those people to be a martyr remember the story about the Roman soldier they were pushing him off the cliff and uh one man went up and I'm not going to do this and that Roman soldier says I have witnessed these people gladly praising and singing as they give their life and he takes they said that he took off his armor took off his and he says I'll take your place and he jumped off that testimony is a strong testimony but that's not the age we live in we're asked to do something much harder every devil in hell is against you amen he will do every trick he knows you inside and out he mimics your own voice and your thoughts and he will lie to you he will there's it just goes and your mind gets so confused and cluttered this is why you need to read your Bible and pray I know myself I as a child I had my nightmares and I still do sometimes and it's like you're when you wake up it's like you were there but I tell you what you go into your place you kneel down and pray and when you get up you're not afraid of anything what a change huh you can change the atmosphere right it's good you can but as I got more influence from from Evil I had a most of my dad's family lived in Los Angeles because after World War I they there was a construction boom in the LA area my my uncle was a contractor so they all worked for him and my grandpa and everybody moved to Los Angeles so they still most of them were there when when I was a child and of course you know by my grandpa kind of leaning me toward the unchristian-like life I I had two older cousins of my dad's older sister and uh we stayed with them for a while till we got our own place but uh my older cousin James he was a member of the Hell's Angels and so he was the tough guy nobody mess with James and then his little brother Billy I think Billy's two or three years older me and the beevans family were big people let's Glide with we're little you know we're small people and so I I I idolized them because I wasn't being a Christian and I just honestly I didn't see anything for me as being a Christian they just did the see I didn't see anything real and the things they were teaching were just like I just shook my head like I'll be honest with you this doctrine of a Eve eating an apple anybody that has the right mind but know that's silly Eve eats an apple and she knows she's naked then she has a child and then the whole world is cursed I never bought that that's why that when I heard brother Brandon preach serpent seed oh yeah that makes sense now I see the two Natures in me I see how that we're hybrid why that we're we're fighting this carnal nature that was inbred into the human race and yet there's also the human human part that that wants to serve God and there's a battle going on Amen and I go now that I can believe virgin birth why serpent seed explains it bypasses that act which is a carnal act God didn't mean for us to procreate like that if Adam and Eve would have wanted a cute little baby all they had to do is made their desire known and they would have had one and it would come just like they did see man is is so confused in our world they don't understand mankind was made different than the animals how many monkeys have built a church like this built a jet airplane wrote a dictionary I mean that to believe the the evolution the way they teach it it's like really that don't make sense even they say there had to be some kind of a link but they don't understand man was made after God he it just for better for worse here we are and so I I I lean toward the more violent aspect and I I started as I I left Elementary School and started junior high of Los Angeles Los Angeles it's always been Wicked okay very Wicked and as I entered into Middle School it was seventh grade 8th grade and nth grade well we had a lot of ninth graders that were driving cars and here I am I'm 11 12 years old and so the mix I don't think it's good to have a mix with little children with adults like that because the the the older kids bully the little kids or the little kids admire them and follow them into their Folly which I did and of course me having my older cousin he was he was a big kid his brother older brother was in the house Angels so who do you think I went after started my life as a little Thug okay and that's all that I can't describe it any other way I learned how to defend myself I learned how to fight I learned how to to be tough I learned who to be tough with which group to hang with it's an education Satan puts you through and it is absolutely contrary to being a Son of God and so well by the time we had moved to Tucson and I'll interject this brother brandham gives his you've heard the analogy of the eagle in the chicken yard now I'm trying to be a little little hoodle and a thug but remember I got the seat of God at me and I'm still observing everything and I remember my dad had a picture of the Halo brother brandham in Houston Texas and he'd always tell me he kept it in his bedroom says now he's different than the others okay and they had a a guest speaker at the little church we went to uh Jack Brown he had got out of prison and the way that the the churches do they have someone that has a an extraordinary like you know he killed 10 people and God saved them now he's preaching the gospel you know they like doing that you know and uh yeah it was absurd they Well Jack Brown had quite a testimony he'd been in prison most of his life he he was an excon big time but God he had had a real conversion and uh so after church I'm standing around I'm W to go home it's on a Wednesday night oh man we're at church again I don't want to be here and so I'm come on dad let's go and he's talking to Jack Brown and brother bram's name comes up and Jack tells my dad he goes you know well you know he he preached sermons and they recorded them on tapes would you like to hear one my dad said yes so that Saturday my dad packed me up with him I don't know why but he took me with him anyway and we go to brother Jack Brown's apartment and in this apartment he has two chairs kind of like that with a little table in between it and he has a real to and then there's a little couch I'm sitting on the couch watching them and he starts playing brother Brenham and I seen my dad him and brother Jack Brown got closer and closer they wanted to get into that tape they enjoyed it so much and on the way home my dad was different I saw when brother brandham talks about that chicken and and the eagle in the chicken yard I saw my dad when he heard that eagle cry he responded I've seen it when brother Brandon preached the story okay I've seen that I seen my that was it Dad Dad on the way home he's talking to me and remember I'm a little Thug and he goes I found what I've been looking for and um brother Jack gives them phone numbers and they they get the we go to brother Flanigan brother Flanigan's house and uh they introduce brother Monda and then uh some man that totally opposes the message had tickets to his last sermon leadership in West Covina and dad got a got a ticket and him and another man went to the west coina and he he got to hear Brother brenham's last sermon on the west coast it was quite a blessing to him and I remember said he said we're moving the Tucson he said this place is wicked it was it still is brother brandom I don't know if you know we we preach about the the earthquake on the west coast and I've heard a lot of interpretations but I know one thing he did say if you're a preacher he said get out of Los Angeles he said it's a preacher's graveyard and I think that pretty much if there's no preachers why would there be a congregation so la is so full of evil spirits that it's it's almost impossible to have a testimony in that place not to mention a prophet of God said that it was going to sink under the ocean well we don't know when that's going to happen it's going to happen we don't know we just don't know so I've heard so many tangents on that and I'll be honest with you I'm like brother Dan I can hear the tapes and form my own opinion I don't need you to give me your opinion about it that sounds arrogant don't it but I've heard it so much that I don't want to hear it you know I know why we moved because that place was evil and God told my dad you need to go someplace where you you can hear the word of God and we came to Tucson and as we came to Tucson there were a lot of people there just like us from California and quite frankly I wasn't the only little Thug okay California has such a way of ruining children in the educational system and all these brothers and sisters children they were as honry as I was I feel right at home you know but as I I witnessed and we went to church and I'm glad that my mom and dad took me to church I'm glad that I heard brother green and he he would have others that had been in the ministry and I heard Witnesses and I listened I'm sitting there might as well I mean you know um to go back a little bit my dad had built two churches and he had also done missionary work in Mexico well as being as a preacher's kid the last thing my mom and dad wanted me to do is sleep in church so my mom had a little thing she did she would take her hand two little fingers take the little hairs on the back of my neck and she jerk on them it sounds cruel don't it I've never slept in church it had its effect I don't know you might have better kids than I was but it worked for me man had hurt wow so consequently as little rebellious Ron sits in a church with a message being preached I stayed awake and listened uh because of my parents you know bringing me upright teaching me to respect and I did respect the elders in church even though I might not have been a Christian at that time the seat of God was in me yesen and I still respected brother green I still respected all the the people in church and I I was quite amazed at how many people had known brother randam and and I was thinking man how come we didn't get to see all this you know I I have no doubt these Miracles happened in his services but you know the Bible is it covers every base you know blessed are he that has has not seen or heard but believes you know I I believe the report that's why I'm here right now but as I got older I I didn't do very well in school I just didn't pay attention and rebellious and it went on and on and it it I'm not going to go into great details I don't want you to you know have this image in your mind of who I was but it it wasn't pretty it was it was Rebellion just absolute Rebellion against the word realizing now I was rebelling against the word of God not against my parents and I had a I believe I had a good experience about the age of 14 brother green had had a a kids camp up at Mount Lemon the U at the boy scout camp up there and we had the last night it just it was I don't remember who preached what was said but I know that we moved out of the main little they had a little room like a cafeteria and they had another little off room and you could fit about 15 20 people in it and people were G had gave their heart to the Lord in that little room I'm not trying to make up any Doctrine here about the little room but in that little room God came down and every single young person in that room was touched recklessly just like in the upper room I didn't see the flames of fire come down my eyes were fogged over with like a gray it was just that it was a spirit of God in there and the love this is what I remember the most that love and people that I really didn't like I was hugging them and I was telling them I sure love you and my sister had bettered a neighbor friend she hadn't gave her heart to the Lord and she's crying and she's hugging everybody it has fallen on everybody David Williams was there he's he forgot it I tried to remind him of that davood Williams he was a hardcore Cowboy I mean two he died with his boots on I guess I don't know but he was a hardcore cowboy and I seen the spirit of God hit Dave Williams and he went on his back and hit the ground face up speaking in tongues wow praising God I reminded him brother Dan and I went visit him I he said I forgot that I didn't God didn't forget amen maybe those years of Dave abusing his mind with alcohol alcohol or whatever it was it had caused him to for forget but see God doesn't forget amen they didn't have a genuine experience with God and I think I have some of the insights of kind of why he he did like I did he he got to looking at some of those that they were put up as so spiritual and they really weren't it's a stumbling block you know don't do that be genuine be genuine don't don't do anything to show or or to right now this this is a miracle this would be there's probably three things I never wanted to be a fireman a policeman or a preacher because well you know people try to shoot policemen and firemen might get burned up and preachers they take the arrows of criticism and me being as I'm a very sensitive person it it is a gift because I I don't want to put myself as anything but I do have a little bit of discernment but you know as I have a scripture for that but it basically when you receive the gift of the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit comes with options and sometime and but one of them is a when you buy a new car you you can get one off the showroom and it it has standard equipment if anybody bought new cars you know it is or you can get the one with leather seats Chrome whe those those are options well one of the standard options of the holy spirit is discern it to know right from wrong so anybody here says I want the gift to discernment well do you have the Holy Spirit it should tell you what's right or wrong and then it's up to you to make the decision which are you going to obey that and this is where the rubber meets the road so many of us rough shot over that unction of the Holy SP Spirit trying to gently guide us into a life that would bring us peace happiness joy that's what he wants for you brother brandham said he's a gentleman he's ain't going to make you do it sometimes he does though you know I had to learn the hard way it just seems to be it it was my my calling because of rebellion in it didn't have to be that way but there's a reason and a purpose for everything and so that experience was real to me but again this time I got to looking at people again no support all the boys my age pretty much were you know doing the world things and so I had I withered spiritually but God if you're one of his he's not done and so I withered again went into self-pity nobody loves me everybody's a hypocrite it's a lie it's just in your mind don't believe that don't believe that and so I got into some more trouble and consequently by the time I turn 15 I get to go to boy prison and I'm incarcerated for a year it was quite a quite a shock to me I'd gotten in some trouble in school and brother green and a brother from Canada they had meetings there they come and got me and took me home and we had some friends of mine we got to drink and at lunch and you know straight alcohol is not like beer you know you can drink a beer and you're okay you drink that much alcohol you're not okay and man they drug me home and things came out after that that me and some friends of mine had been involved in some some home burglaries I can't believe I did that you know people work so hard for the things they have I had no right to take them but I did and I paid for it too and I got into some other trouble and it it mounted up and so they put me in juvenile and kept me there and for a court hearing and as I went to the court hearing okay I'm 15 now I'm kind of a little smart like and I remember was Judge fry he's an old time for judge he's just old I mean he looked like he should have retired so my dad mom are there and I'm standing there and he tells me says uh you know I'm talked to your mom and dad before the court hearing said I think if you'll you'll straighten up do what your mom and dad said I think I can let you out and we'll just put you on probation and uh my dad steps in course he said basically you do what I say from now on you know well we went I was way past that okay I was way past that and I remember 15-year-old boy looking at a a judge I said your honor I can't do that that old man grab that gabble I think he's gonna break it I commit you to Arizona custody you are now a property of the state wow I had no no idea what that meant I learned later though they meant it so they shifted me to a place a halfway place up in Catalina called the U the youth center my that was an Awakening uhoh what have I got myself into and now I'm incarcerated with kids that were basically raised like little animals remember I was raised at a chrisan I was somewhat civilized these kids weren't okay they're foster kids they're illegitimate they got a grudge they hate the Mexicans hate the blacks the blacks hate the Mexicans everybody hates white people the white people hate them I was like wow what kind of zoo is this and I've never been racist and it was a shock to my system all my friends in elementary school it was an Italian a Mexican kid a white kid a Chinese kid even in junior high uh remember Big Mike he was a Wan he was My Bodyguard he liked me and he say anybody misses you they got to go through me well I already had a cousin to take care of that but Big Mike decided he's going to be in My Bodyguard and what it was is I was affiliated with one of the local little gangs in school and he wanted to be accepted but he was Hawaiian and he wasn't white so he wanted me to introduce him to them so he hung out with me and uh him and I became best friends and at an early age I remember I'm going back now we had to deal with the racist thing mom and dad are from Arkansas in a little town that my black folks didn't live in that little town and I was quite ashamed that when we go back there my dad was a good man but he'd get around his brother and their cousins and and I'd heard him use use the nword and I'll be honest with you it bothered me wow that I didn't like because I remember I'm going to school in California and it's a lot more liberal and accepting of people who are they are and and I went to Grand my grandmother and I just said Grandma they left me there with her for the day and I like my grandmother Glide well she was great she prayed oh my well that woman love praying she had Gardens and chickens and she canned and just what a lady and uh I asked grandmother about that and she just looked at me and she put her arm around me she says honey God loves all his children I'm a child but something inside of me understood the context remember brother brandom taught us the text and the context you know you can read your word but what does it mean I understood what she meant okay got it and so consequently I've never been a racist I don't understand racism I don't get it I'm I'm almost 70 years old and I don't understand it why you know why because I am a Christian I believe in God God made that man born in that economic or that color or that country that was his choice who am I to have something against him who knows he might be my judge one day I've never had an issue with that and I I just I still even as I progressed and I was in the Youth Camp you know got in trouble in youth Camp me and a bunch of boys yelling out the window at some kid that he had been on a pass and he was kind of a uh he got special privileges well we were jealous so we yelled profanities at him well the secretary to the the warden was walking with him so these boys tell her they're saying that to you so Mr McFarland and he died here just some time ago he ended up being the head of all of the uh the camps and uh so he comes in there and we're on lockdown lockdown means you're in your underwear you don't eat you don't sleep and it gets us all in a big room it's okay who said that well me and about five other boys knew we had done it and why you know I I've always been a standup guy and I had two friends that I had done all these burglaries with and I didn't turn them in I went I went I was incarcerated alone they didn't go I didn't tell them I didn't read him out I'm a standup guy and so it gets pretty bad we're there it's getting later and you know some of the guys are grumbling hey man somebody better fess up you know I thought you know what I'm going to do I'm I'm going to stand up and I'm going to I'm going to take the blame for this wow So I says I did it that man grabed me and he threw picked me up off the ground and slamed Me Against the Wall as hard as he could and was screaming in my face I'm thinking wow that was a mistake but anyway I got to spend five days in lockup and uh but all the guys that uh I had stood up for they they give me some of their food and stuff because they just you know they didn't feed you very well and hey you're a good guy so I established a reputation and but they were watching me too once a week we had a bus come down from from Fort gret Arizona at that time that's where they kept all the badest it's basically it's not a reformed school it's a boy's prison okay nobody got reformed up there they just became worse criminals and so we had counselors and they sent us the different places to analyze us and they they said you know you're do pretty good you know my dad had been a carpenter I think you might you know we might have a place for you and and uh maybe in carpentry school you going to be 18 and okay and then I got into the travel and so they'd read that if the guy get out he'd read the clipboard okay I remember some of the guys names my name gets red no that's a mistake I can't go to that place that's a boy's prison no no no I told my counselor I wanted to go to a foster home and if I was in a foster home I didn't have to go to I wouldn't have to go to church and I do good in school and I i' would be okay no you're not on that list I'm on the fort Grant list so I just kept getting worse and worse and worse and so I went to for Grant wow not a nice place I witnessed them young little boys that should not have been in this place with hardened criminals you said oh how can a 16 17y old boy be hardened you had been reading the news lately then I was in boys that bragged about how they had killed people and I believe they did and I seen how they bullied and abused these young by that time I had I had spent in two years in in high school I had been on the wrestling team so I was pretty capable of taking care of myself physically but I hadn't gained I was still pretty small so I started eating and exercising and u i determined I wasn't going to be one of those victims and I got to do some issues with some bigger boys and me and another boy we decided we're going to run away we're not staying in this place I'm just constantly trouble man it just seems like it follows me so they catch us you know we're out on a farm out in Wilcox and they middle of the night they come get us and bring us back and we go they call it meditation okay well we call it the hole and it's a it's like an 8 by 10 room cement they put a one mattress on the floor and you're in your underwear and you're in there for 30 days in the morning at 8:00 you remember these routines 8 8:00 in the morning I get a little you seen those little boxes of cereal you open up pour the milk in you get one of those with a half a cup of milk at 3:00 they bring out a paper plate one spoon of vegetable half a slice of bread and about a half ounce of protein I'm a growing boy when I went in I weighed about 170 PBS after 30 days I weighed about 100 pounds I remember my mom they gave it they led him to come visit afterwards my mom cried she just baled her eyes out what have they done to you I did it to myself remember I have to learn the hard way well consequently I I tried to stay out of trouble after that you know I didn't want to go back in there anymore but while I was in there we had a re Jones which was the Protestant uh chaplain and then there was father Sierra was for the Catholic I kind of like Father Sierra better because he bring his guys candy bars all Reverend Jones do is give you a track to read you know so one of my cellmates was a Catholic and say hey can my can he have a so father Sarah gave me a candy bar Catholic guy is not bad you know but we didn't have anything to read but the de Jones got permission brother and brother Nathaniel had let us send him a books and they just printed a spoken word um Daniel 70 weeks it's a a really nice book they had and so I read that book over and over and over and over you see God remember when you resist God and you're one of his he gets his way you might as well just stop resisting go ahead and say Lord here am I I surrendered that was a NAD though I didn't surrender but I read the book and I remembered it he made sure that I still got his word and I I managed to develop a reputation where I I work with a in the in the minds and we had a a little Pentecost guy was our labor for and he giv safety meetings and he loved giving safety meetings well he was a Sunday school teacher and he had a little saying he says I ain't bad but the bad don't mess with me you know and I pretty much had that reputation I when I got out of the meditation I ate twice as much food and I got a a detail at the at the dairy so I was lifting those milk cans and I was pretty stout little fell 5' 11 185 lbs and I can pick up three times my weight I can't do that now that's why my back doesn't work very well don't do that bad idea but I I experienced that and and I like I said I've never been a racist and that summer it was what fort Grant is it was an officers uh camp for World War II where they would take officers up there and train them and it was just a regular had the barracks and everything and that's what it was it was an officer so they had a pool and here's the problem none of the white boys go in the pool because I don't know what they feed these black guys but man they're big and they were intimidating and they loved they took over the pool well I I love swimming and we'd sit around and we you go in the pool I ain't going to the pool every time some guy go in the pool they grab him and hold him under the water he almost drowned and I've been one that I figure things out that's why I had not got hurt during my time of rebellion of course that's God and I looked at the situation I says you know what these guys can't swim so I thought H so I jumped in the water white boy you are crazy I went under the water and I took about three of them I grabbed their ankles and put my but see I had taken a breath of air they hadn't I grabbed their ankles and I pulled all three of them under the water and I held them and I held them and then I let them up we come up out of the water we're going to get you I did it again and the third time that was the end of it I was the only white boy got to swim that summer but I got a reputation because it was wasn't personal and I never made it personal I always respected these guys I gave them their respect and that's in in the Hispanic gangs they just want you to respect them I learned that uh I gave the Hispanic gangs their respect that's what they wanted I would not let them abuse me but I gave them respect and so I got respect you know and that's kind of a lesson here you know if you go into a place where you're uncomfortable show respect it just doesn't make any sense I'm going to go into a place whether it be another church whether you find yourself amongst gangsters whether wherever you may be I believe if you'll show respect you'll get it back and there will be there'll be so much trouble remember I remember hearing a saying that says don't start no trouble there won't be any you know a lot of times we're our worst enemy so as I learned respect brother green had brought some of the young boys up I think I don't know if Edmond had went up there that time he did and by that time i' had been there a while and I was pretty muscular and I I had earned my respect and so as we I went into the offices there there was a lot of the hey Gladwell what's up I mean it's you have to understand prison life is not like it is here it's about reputation and respect and if you don't have it you're in trouble absolutely and I learned God taught me how I didn't have to beat nobody up um I didn't have to fight anybody I just earned their respect that's godone you know he does that I didn't recognize it at the time um and so when they they brought the boys up the boys were like wow and I told them you boys don't want to be here they'll eat you up and I'm I'm sure some of the boys it had an effect on them it should have because I was telling the truth don't do like I did don't come here don't do that what happens is when you're in that atmosphere brother Dan I can't hardly see the clock brother Dan does that mean I just keep going you're an hour and 10 minutes okay I kind of lost my thought here but sorry I'm over 65 but anyway we we go through these things oh here it is it's brother Dan even now I'm still learning about what happened as I'm young by stories that are told Brother Dan tells us a story about brother brandham and Billy Paul talking about how far you get away from God that's how far you have to come back amen and I had there are still pieces to my puzzle that I'm still putting in but it's looking pretty good now and so this is why it's taken me this long to come to this place I probably should have been doing this years ago but I had a long way I picked up so many bad habits so many spirits so many attitudes one of them is defending myself I was very good at it because I don't believe in a fair fight if you're the size of Daniel Evans what kind of fair fight is that so I'm going to cheat I'm going to I'm going to kick you I'm going to scratch you I'm going to poke BR your eye out I'm going to get behind you I'm going to choke you I'm going to bite you I never believed in Fair fights and I was quite a force to be reckoned with because I realize there's no fair fight you know that's always this big guy well you well you did this and you did that you're 100 pounds heavier of me what was I supposed to do but you see that becomes a spirit and an attitude I've had a change of heart amen amen I would rather you hurt me than I hurt you I won't do that anymore I won't if you want to make me a martyr and beat me to death and praise the Lord I forgive you I will not defend myself any longer there's no future in it it becomes an attitude when somebody says something you defend yourself well what you just did you just defended that person maybe they didn't mean Nothing by it so not only do it you stop the physical aspect you stop the spiritual aspect of Defending yourself maybe the Lord had the person say maybe what they said is true and I needed that correction a change of heart it's not just a change of heart you got to change your mind how you think the Bible talks about get the mind of Christ I believe that he has revealed himself to me I really do and I believe that I have a a gift of imagination when I read my Bible I put myself there I've seen enough history and and seen enough movies about how it is so when I read the Bible I go there and when they talk about Jesus they didn't wash his feet remember these were not asphalt roads in these alleys these were dirt the they had animal power what do animals do and you walk in sandals they didn't have these really nice car heart boots you know and washing the feet M you know what you're washing off the feet of somebody and it was just it was just show of respect when someone came and you were invited to wash their feet and they didn't wash his feet I mean it what a the Lamb of God how they mistreated him and how that little that little woman she washed his feet with her tears and anointed him how precious I don't think I'd ever use that word to describe anything remember I was a tough guy how precious how special our Lord is you need to get to know him he will teach you who he was and what he did for you the greatest thing that happened in in the crucifixion was him saying on in Gethsemane I'll do it that battle was real said that his sweat was like blood that Agony he went through that man and I mentioned this to somebody the other day you know Jesus had been raised under the wrong woman foot how many crucifixions had he witnessed hundreds how many beatings they did this publicly to humiliate the people he knew what was coming he had seen these men beaten to death stomped to death crucified he knew how cruel the Romans were he had no doubt what was in store for him and so he said Lord oh Lord if this pup this cup let it pass but because he loved brother brandom said if he only died for you he would have done it that makes it personal doesn't it I feel that way I'm glad he died for you also but I'm sure glad he died for me amen but he didn't die he was he was tortured let's not sanitize the let's not sanitize this it was a horrible thing that happened you need to understand what he went through you need to have that time where you know what he did to save not just your soul every one had been born for the time of Jesus back to Adam they were counting on that day they were in prison they were they couldn't go any farther I don't believe they were in torment but they were in prison they were in a place brother brand called it Paradise but they were locked in there they couldn't leave waiting for the day of judgment and quite frankly it didn't matter how good they were if there was not a a a sacrifice of like Jesus if there was not that ultimate sacrifice those millions of souls come Judgment Day youart from me Jesus knew that this is this is real this is we sometimes we can't see it we're in our little sanitized world but it's real and Jesus knew they're depending on me and then all the generations that haven't been born yet they're doomed I have to but you know not everybody is a Son of God we know that we know there's two lines going down you know Cain's children they're the devil's children I don't know who they are I could have been one I don't believe I am now I've kind of went through that process and I I kind of detour a little bit but I've kind of went through that process there was a song by a man that he had had an issue with his girlfriend he starts out I wonder if it was my fault and then he sings another stanza you know it could have been my fault and then he sings another stanza it might have been my fault and by the end of the song he says it was my fault well I feel like that is is is in my Christian walk as a child I said I believe there are sons of God I wonder if I could be one of them and then as I get a little longer you know there's a possibility if I give my heart to the Lord I might be one of those and as I my walk grows with God you know it's possible I could be a Son of God and then you get to the point where you know Lord if I'm not a son of God why have you done all the these things to preserve me and why do you speak to my heart and I'm I'm almost there I am a Son of God Amen thank god well then once you're a Son of God you better act like it remember the story of Alexander the Great there was a young soldier that his mom had named him Alexander and he was just a cut up and he was an embarrassment and Alex they brought him to Alexander And he says you know son he says either you straighten up or change your name you know you say you're a Christian be a Christian yeah well how do I be a Christian ra your Bible and pray the Bible is going to testify it's going to show you and I I called the name of my my little testimony is find yourself in the Bible I have a lot of scriptures I've written down but I probably won't read them but I found myself in the Bible and I find situations where I did that and when when Jesus Calls the the disciples it's in John 15:16 he said I have chosen you to be my disciples well what is a disciple it's a follower of Christ he didn't just choose 12 he chose Millions but you know here is here's the kicker to it do you accept his calling many many he chose the 12 disciples you know the Rich Young Ruler if you read everyone that he said follow me they did except one the Rich Young Ruler he rejected eternal life he was called all the others say oh they they dropped what they were doing they followed him whether it be tax collector or fisherman uh whoever it was whatever sta station of life he said Timothy or not Timothy but uh Phillip Matthew Peter John and he would tell and they did that they had the seed of God in them but he tells the Rick Shan rder sell all you have and follow me why he rejected eternal life it's serious Bible says God's spirit don't always strive with man I encourage those that are listening or you have friends if God is calling you to do better do better if he says you need to step up a little higher step up a little higher if you don't know how get a hold of somebody that's been a Christian for a while see I'm I I feel like I'm I'm at a I've hit a glass ceiling I can't go any farther yes you can well brother Ron we can only go so far well you ever heard the story of Enoch he pleased God so much God let him just walk off the earth so you're there weren't many on Enochs but why not try don't be sat don't be satisfied with your spiritual condition you're either advancing there is no neutrality in in for the sons of God there is no neutrality there's no I'm just going to I'm going to hold my position well there is a certain extent but as your personal I'm talking about your personal walk you should be advancing you should be going close closer to God you should be confessing you know I believe I'm a Son of God I believe God hears my prayer see that confession increases your faith and I am here to encourage you I was a renegade I'm not going to tell you all the little things I did it it it's not beneficial I don't want you to be afraid of me and have afay to have your kids shake my hand but I'm not that person anymore it breaks my heart when I think why did I do those things Satan will take you down a road and he will it he will be like someone's hooked a chain to your ankle and Drug you behind a pickup that's how he treats his people he's that vicious and that hateful have nothing to do with his Spirit dedicate your life to knowing the will of God for your life and once you know the will of God do it I honestly never envisioned myself standing here doing this but if it helps somebody I'll do it I'm no longer ashamed of who I am you know God may be who I am he put me through these for a purpose uh during this time of of Disobedience I met my wife and if I had to been in that position and that time I wouldn't have met her he made her for me and he made me for her you know it seems she's always reminded me yep you needed a wife like me well honey you needed a man like me we were a perfect match and you know brother brandom talks about numerology my wife's numerology just goes on and on and on she's a little older than I am on her sixth birthday I was conceived I told her this is you know I no way she said Google it you know how we do that okay I was born on May the 30th it says your conception was probably around September the 12th that's my wife's birthday I said what do you think of that you know and it that's just a beginning of God showing me because marriage is tough this conflict of man and woman is it it's hard it's not easy but if you're committed it's worth it it gets better uh you go through different phases first you're married and it's the honeymoon then you have your children and then the children put you through hell my my my my wow have I cried many a time I get I used to get up at 2:30 in the morning go to work I climb in my truck and warm it up and cry what have we done to deserve this I don't know they're good kids now you know they're they're grown adults they've turned out okay my the things they put us through and I thought well maybe I deserved it may you know my mom and dad were probably right you know you're going to live long enough to see you know well I did they were right and our one daughter we just tried our hardest to get her to do the right thing and she said if you'll buy me a car you know okay and her rebellion was my so we go we buy her a car we come home we give her the car she grabs the keys out of my hand said I've got to go gets in the car and leaves I said let's chase her down I'm taking that car back my wife goes no hun let it go you know we have to go through these things God teaches us to endure you want endurance you want patience he'll teach you patience he'll teach you love I had one of my son-in-laws say how can you love one of our daughters she was just two of them really give us a hard time and he goes how can you love her how can you put I said I would disown her I wouldn't let her treat me like that we would move her to Phoenix then we' move her then she'd hook up with some boyfriend and he would be abusive and we we go and we'd help her out and just she'd crash a car and we buy her another one I was like how much longer can I do this and my one son-in-law he said I wouldn't have anything to do with her and I went in my truck and I pondered it all day long Lord what am I going to do and God came to me how do you know it was God he says do you love her I do are you ever going to stop loving her probably not is there anything your daughter can do ever to keep you from loving her no he says then lover that's how you know it's from God Satan don't talk to you like that see we learn the holy spirit is the discerner of right and wrong that was the right that was the counseling that was the the Holy Spirit speaking to me and I had listened to it okay and I got home and told the wife whatever it takes I'd have to say today that all three of my daughters are are good citizens of this the one that I'm talking about she is now she went to school to become an RN and now she's an FMP which is a family nurse practitioner we didn't give up on her you know God don't give up on us and when he reveals that he doesn't give up on us he shows us our past he said I didn't give up on you you did this and this and this and I still kept drawing you I still kept providing circumstances for you to serve me give her the same chance and that goes with everyone you know don't ever put anybody out don't say Well they're they're gone that's up to them and God I'm still going to treat him I'm going to treat him like I want to be treated and it it it's we need to learn to discern the spirits around us Christ is gentle he's forgiving he's enduring he's longsuffering and I'm sure glad he is just for my sake but I have a responsibility now and my testimony is I have to do that now I know at work and I worked at the mindes and I believe I lived a good a good testimony and I'll be honest with you they didn't like me I had talked to one of the brothers at church and I told him about some of the issues he saidwell just work harder well I did I was the hardest working man on our crew and you'd think that they would get positive response my foreman brought me in the office on a graveyard shift says I need to talk to you he said I'm getting some complaints and uh he said you're working too hard I so they nicknam me the preacher I thought it was pretty good I like that but as we go along here my my testimony hasn't ended here I've left out a lot but I'm continuing to grow I'm continuing to get I'm not the same person I was last year am and I don't intend I I intend to be if we're here another year I'll look back and say man we have to we're on our upward path don't be satisfied with mediocre Christianity being a Christian is great am it's exciting it's it's the even if you weren't saved it's the best way to live the way of the transgressor is hard so if you know anybody that's having issues encourage them be a good example remind them man God loves you do better and U there's so much more I could say but times running out right now but I didn't get to near all the scriptures but you know our pastor here has a burden for the lost souls am and I have a burden that when these Souls come in to let to to encourage them to grow don't you must have an experience if you know anyone and they they don't know whether they've receed the gift of the Holy Spirit or not work with them talk with them pray with them it's it's a wonderful thing to have that counselor that when you're in trouble when you're alone when you wonder did they preach the right thing well I found that every time I've been in a service I try not to disagree I try to find something that I agree with and you know when I do that I get something out of it and I go away fed so don't be so disagreeable let God lead you and love one another but most of all honor and respect this word amen believe this word amen it will lead you I know it's my time is is about up but here is a reality we're all going to do the crossover one way or the other amen I believe in the resurrection I believe in the catching away but I've watched people die in my lifetime and I've seen easy Crossovers and I've seen horrible crossovers I watched the man die he had wrecked his car behind me and was thrown out and I held him in my hands and watched him die I don't think he was ready he was struggling I watched my dad pass away brother Arie was there thank you brother Arie and he witnessed it was a very smooth Crossing see Dad was a Christian I watched a lady that I know well I watched her pass and it was not pretty she struggled and she groaned and the river Jordan was it was rough for her I hope for her sake that there will be mercy found but I know one thing she wasn't ready to die and it was a horrible thing watching her pass I just leave you with this you make sure that you've done everything you know to do and you know God will take care of the rest he will will he promised and if you're not where you need to be he will put you in a situation where you'll grow don't stop don't quit finish the race finish the race well I'm just going to pause I'm not done but I'll let you go here thank you for for listening to me and and for allowing me to pour my heart out there's so much more I thought I would say that I didn't but I hope this helped [Applause] Dan musicians can come I want to point out something about brother Ron brother Ron mentioned a couple times he said that he didn't have a support and there's only so much that parents can do and do you see how important it was only by the grace of God that brother Ron was so successful in life and and he has a family and he has a good marriage and he has all these things it's only by the grace of God brother Ron should have been a failure in life with the way that he was going he should have failed he should have stayed in prison but it was only by the grace of God the the kindness of our Lord Jesus that he got him back on the right path and do you see how important this church is brothers and sisters do you see how important it is for our children to have this support structure how important it is for the elderly how important it is for all the parents to have this support structure we can help each other we can encourage each other so that we don't see someone go down that that wrong path and if they're going down that wrong path we can reach out Heath and grab them and bring him back I think it was Jude that said that you reach into the fire for each other and pull each other out that is so important and brother Ron's testimony today is to me is a miracle that he ended up successful in life that he ended up with what he has now it was a blessing and a lot of it was was uh um I can't get the picture out of of my mind of him swimming down to the bottom of the P pulling grabbing those people's legs I bet it scared them to death let's let's all stand up again brothers and sisters this is how important it is you can look at this testimony for our from our brother and how much would it have meant to you brother Ron if if you had have had a friend if and I know you did and I know that there were those in your life and it can't always it can't just be Mom and Dad Me growing up I had a strong Believers in in my my two brothers and my sister and I had good solid friends but I can imagine where I'd be if I didn't have that and that's
