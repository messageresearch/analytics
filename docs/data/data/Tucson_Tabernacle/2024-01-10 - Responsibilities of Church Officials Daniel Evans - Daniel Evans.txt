you know those of us who live in this temperature when it comes down a little bit we get cold right away and uh we couldn't get it to work so I got a hold of brother brother Mike Walters and he came over yesterday morning to look at it and he told me you're going to need a new furnace it broke inside and he said the gas is going out and the Flames are going out sideways and I noticed that it kept turning on on but not really warming up and it had melted the control panel and then it wasn't until after I was driving after he told us the news and everything of course you're disappointed but he said you know you could have caught your whole house on fire if it hadn't burned out that control panel and kept going with where the gases would have gone and where the fire you could have burned your house down so I thought about that I said Lord you know even causing that way you still watch over us what could have been a a major disaster so I said you know in all things give God praise you

brother Aaron drink out of my water brother brandom said we should be able to chew each other's chewing gum I'm not there yet that's a that's a goal that that I have brother Josiah sister Katie just two good friends I I just think the world of these these two I call you kids the these two kids they um they're just so far beyond their years I remember seeing sister Katie walk up to the organ or the piano and and church and just thinking what a special young lady as young as you were giving your talents to the Lord Jesus I appreciate you appreciate your family sister Katie I'm going to be talking tonight tonight's going to be a little different I'm going to be just reading a lot lot of quotes we're trying to get ready for an election brother Kim is that brother Kim dingwall there brother God bless you I'm sorry I I was a mids sentence and I looked over there and see you and your precious wife I met you last year at Easter time I believe God bless you brother it's it's good it's good to have you um but uh back to Sister Katie I'll be talking about deacons and um trustees and pastors orders of service sister Katie comes from very very good stock if I've ever met a deacon in my life it's her dad brother Joel Robson he is the um really the definition that you see in this book of a deacon so sister it's good to have you here brother brother Josiah brother Kim is um a uh has a has a very good reputation also and all that you've done up done up at uh up in Canada and and the work that you've done and how many Souls that have been touched by your ministry by all that's been done up there so welcome we're honored to have you here I um I want to announce also as as you know that we have our church election coming this Sunday um we uh a very very important time it's important time for me because I've just felt like this is something that we've needed to have for a while now as I said last um Sunday evening I believe it was that this church had a founding pastor and I believe a founding pastor and a pastor that succeeds that founding Pastor are two different things and I believe that we can handle things differently brother green was a founding Pastor he came here he risked everything following the the leading of the Lord started this church and I believe the deacons and trustees also the prophet laid it out and I want to read to you something I said something last Sunday that I really felt from the bottom of my my heart I felt like if we can get these things in order that I believe the Lord will bless us now listen to this listen to what brother brandom said here he said now I want to say too I see brother Egan and many some of the trustees setting here after we had our trustee meeting the other night it is true I publicly before the church that each one of you are no longer appointed trustees you are elected trustees and your name is on the books all right and now they're going to have some more elections of deacons and so forth and brother Neville is we'll be calling those immediately after this service all right and for the treasure and so forth forth as we set the church up get it all backgrounds ready then we can have a Revival as it comes on that I found that quote today and boy it meant the world to me because I felt like that and I said it and now here it is the prophet vindicating what was on my heart so I'm I'm really really grateful that we do have this opportunity we live in a free country that we can come together that we can elect our own pastors we can elect our own deacons and offices of the church and we should never take that for granted leadership as I've been preaching on the Book of Judges leadership not only in the country but also in the church is very very important I know a brother that recently and this just happened he was recently voted out of the church now they had a church it was like 30 people and what had happened was this brother who was in the pastor the the pastor of the church someone had taken a picture and he was in the picture and there was some sort of a light in the picture and they brought that that picture to the pastor and they said what do you think about this don't you think that looks like the pillar of fire and the pastor said yeah it does look like the pillar of fire so what happened was after that they started passing the picture around and some of the people in the church got offended at that because the picture didn't have the right coloring in it it wasn't the right shape it didn't look right so they said well the pastor's lying about this stuff so turmoil in the church and they voted the pastor out is that not ridiculous now I'm not saying that it's a congregation's fault and I'm not saying it's the pastor's fault but that church did not have Unity if something like that can come in and divide the church and have the church vote the pastor out then there is something wrong in that church and that's why with our church I want to make sure that we are doing everything right and everything in line with the Lord and the way that he set things out so that we won't have those problems if there is a problem we can address those problems as the word tells us and we can move forward as a congregation as a family as loved ones and not have this Division and that takes leadership and that's what we are going to be doing this weekend is we're going to be electing leadership for this church I've seen so many problems with how a church May split or be divided and one thing that I want to point out is we need to use caution the Bible plainly says about the sisters that a sister is not meant to handle the word of God now we all know that and we can point our finger at Joyce Meyers and all these telang IST and all that but that doesn't do us any good to point our fingers at other famous evangelists what we need to do is we need to look within and say okay now what are we doing and how are these maybe sisters taking a little bit more Authority not so much in the church but in their families that's why it is very very important that we need to have holy spirit filled God called fathers Brothers men of God that know this book that are willing to lead their families willing to spend the time in prayer willing to spend the time studying willing to spend the time listening so they can not only lead their families but they can help out in the church they can be deacons they can be trustees they can be pastors they can help but we have to as men we have to live up to this calling that we have the Bible very plainly says that the man is the head of the woman as Christ is the head of the man so if we are looking at Christ and how great he is and all of the wisdom our lord Jesus has and all of his compassion on us and how perfect he is then we need to live up to our calling as being the head of the woman I'm not not putting the women down here I'm telling the men need to step it up every one of us live a life worthy of this gospel and worthy of the calling that you have as a dad as a husband as a brother live worthy of that calling amen and then the sisters give your husband give your father give him that resp respect that the Bible wants him to have let's um I want to read a few quotes before we get started into these offices and it's something that with this church and I've I've observed this church over the years and I observed observed how sometimes splits happen in the church and we have to be careful about what we are Desiring from a church now let me preface this by saying I think our church is too quiet the carnal the Flesh in me says that it's a lot easier to preach to a church that where you get some feedback it just is it's just it's just easier to do that maybe it's tradition that we're so quiet maybe it's personalities of the people who are here maybe it's that much of our congregation is new and they don't have the confidence to enter in maybe it's because we're not where we should be with the Lord or maybe it is because we are where we should be with the Lord just want to make sure that we are always we're not seeking something that the Lord doesn't necessarily want now I'm going to read a few quotes and I'm not going to necessarily put my interpretations on these um we'll start with the church in its condition brother Jeremy and I have some real loyal F Royal friends here that are very fine people they're very loyal to go to church no matter how cold it is they'll wrap up in a blanket and sit on a bob sled and drive the horse for 30 miles to get to church dramatic pause there they'll walk through the snow drifts and everything else young and old they'll all group together and one family gets the other and they'll start walking and they go it's the sacrifices that they make is what causes them to get so much out of the service when there's no sacrifice there's not very much to the service you have to really get down and do something that hurts real bad have to lay aside something and stop the work and do this or that to get to go to church and show God that you love him and you make a sacrifice to go it's then when you get something out of it my family my dad my grandfather drove all over the country to hear brother Brandon preach you didn't obviously they didn't have the internet and all that back then but I think it was seven 750 miles one way that they would drive every every Sunday they they drive for every the week for the weekend they'd come back get home at 4: or5 in the morning and then go to work work all week to get enough money to buy gas to go back up to the meetings and brother Kim they they greatly benefited from it but I believe in the supreme authority is the next quote I believe in the supreme authority of the local assembly yes Let each Church be its own choose its Pastor its deacons it's whatever it is and then that way the man in there there has no Bishop over him the Holy Spirit wants to speak something to that church they don't have to ask anybody about whether they could do this or do that it's the individual in contact with the Holy Spirit show me by the Bible what's greater in the Bible than the local elder or local church that's right yes sir sovereignty of the local church each Church in itself now Brotherhood that's wonderful all churches ought to be in brotherhood like that together but the Sovereign sovereignty of the local church notice Paul being a great Master teacher well trained on his road down to Damascus one day to arrest the people that were in his that were in this new way now he was sincere God does not judge you by your sincerity I never seen any more sincere people than the heathens many of them even kill their own children in vain for sacrifice to to an idol it is not the sincerity it shows you how important our Doctrine is all of these are leading up to speaking about the offices of the church Jesus told them after they had been next quote you can just leave the quotes up brother brother Jeremy I'm going to read quite a few of them Jesus just told them after they had been with him oh they ought they'd been out rejoicing they came back the Devils was subject unto them he said you're not ready yet go up to Jerusalem and wait till you're filled up you make too much noise and have all Steam and nothing it'll go out the whistle and you won't have any steam to roll the wheels we can testify and jump up and down and sing and everything like that but until God makes us in such a condition till we can recognize one another as Brethren until all malice Envy strife and everything has gone out of us our jumping shouting praising God organizing speaking in tongues and healing the sick and Performing Miracles and everything else will never amount to nothing come back and wait in the cave till we hear the still Small Voice that calls us to the S to to the service of God oh how we need it how the world needs it we need that God will provide I'm going to be talking about be careful about seeking that emotion we don't seek the emotion don't get emotion and the Holy Spirit mixed up the Holy Spirit does often produce emotion but don't think the emotion is the holy spirit I said sure next quote I said sure if they won't make the wheel roll right they've got to blow it out the whistle somewhere they've got a lot of steam I said and that's the truth if this Pentecostal Church would take a lot of its praises and put put it to work it would do something for the kingdom of God God give you the Holy Ghost you like to Shout by it and praised by it but just put that into gifts and wonders and go out on the street and get Sinners to come in and things like that your church will grow and everything will go along go along all right don't blow it out the whistle put it into action and make the wheel roll the gospel train next quote that's what I've always said about the two classes of people I meet the fundamental and the Pentecost the fundamentalists seen positionally from their schooling they know where they stand but they haven't got no faith the Pentecostals got the faith but don't know who they are see like I said somebody has got money in the bank can't write a check another one write a check got no money in the bank get them together wow I love that shows that God has a variety as I was preaching last weekend now we see that the Pentecostals is the one that's got the faith they believe it but they're full of fire they're but they're full of fire they're full of the Holy Ghost but they don't know how to settle down on the word on that word and say it's thus sayeth the Lord they blow it all out the whistle with screams and shouts and runs if they could ever throttle it down you see a church stand on her feet in power and Glory where there would be a book of Acts wrote behind I'm going keep going on the next quote but what the church needs tonight is to know how to control these gifts see for evil spirits can come in and speak just the same as good spirits can speak you know that and you must have the spirit of discernment to know that they have had it in the Bible times why if they didn't do it why did Paul say Let One judge and and the people judge so so forth those gifts of Prophecy everything is supposed to be correctly put in order for Satan can imitate every gift that God's got every gift he can imitate it and you must know the right and wrong and by its fruits you know it watch whether it comes to pass and whether it's truth or not and that's the way you know the spirit how many false prophets when Jesus whenever Jesus was talking about the end time it it seemed like he always said don't be deceived when he says in the last days when Paul says in the last days perilous times shall come how many times have we heard don't be deceived so if we are in those those times we know that there must be deceivers Among Us I'm not talking about Benny hen and T evangelists those Brothers I don't know I don't know what's right or wrong that don't have anything to do with me I'm talking about right here Among Us Cain was such a person as that he was very religious indeed now if religion is all that you have to have then God was unjust by condemning Cain because he was religious he was just as religious and sincere as Abel was now remember he thought of God he worshiped God he had a church he built an altar he made a sacrifice he prayed he worshiped but he was rejected no matter how Esau was also see religion see that is Satan Satan's business not to kill the whole thing but just to contaminate it that's all he ain't going to kill the whole thing oh no not Communists no not the Antichrist is not communism the Bible said it would deceive the very elect the elect if it was possible one more now I've mentioned be careful don't necessarily seek the gifts seek the GI of the gifts and then those things will come now listen to this now how do we handle it if we see maybe error in the church but here in the Tabernacle we want you all to know these things here when God begins to pour out the Holy Spirit upon the people sometimes I know I've seen people get in the flesh when they were under the anointing of the spirit Spirit I've seen them go to extremes with things but don't you say nothing about it you respect it you bow your head you might not understand it neither would I this is a prophet speaking neither would I but I want to respect it anyhow now we must have respects to God and when God pours out the Holy Spirit I just say thank I just say thank you Heavenly Father you are doing something for that poor precious soul that wants to come to you to your home like I do someday do you see the love that brother Brandon presented do you see the patience that he he presented so when we get when we do something wrong or maybe we get the Lord might touch Us in the spirit and we get excited and we might take it somewhere where he didn't want it to go have patience with that person but let's also not be afraid to praise the Lord to shout in the spirit don't be afraid to do that but also temper it with is this the holy spirit always and don't take it where the Lord doesn't want it to go as I said I look back at the splits in these different churches and many times it's because the people have wanted more emotion in the worship but those people who wanted that followed after Ministries who strayed often strayed from the word and made something of themselves that they were not as I said they made many of them would say that they were prophets and then prophesied falsely many of them and they're out there my point in saying this is if we see a deficiency in this church I I've I've mentioned things that I I would like the Lord to provide you might the pastor might be gifted in handling the word but he may not be a Gifted Man In Worship or the pastor may be a Gifted Man in leadership and he may not be a gifted man in being able to expound on the word but that's why God sends gifts into the church some Apostles and Prophets and evangelists and teachers and pastors he sends these gifts he sends worship leaders he sends the different offices of the church to help the body one man can't do it all as I said last week God's plan is like a puzzle and you dump the puzzle out on the table and you have all these different people pieces and you start picking them up and you you can't they don't fit But as time goes on you can put these puzzles in the right put these pieces of puzzle in the right place and then the Masterpiece starts to form and every single piece has its own place and no peace is any bigger than any other no peace is any more important than any other they all have to be placed before the Masterpiece is finished and that's the way our church if we are deficient in something pray that the Lord will send it to us we're together in this if I'm weak in certain ways ask the Lord to help me if you're weak in certain ways I'm asking the Lord to help you we need to be together and move forward in this as a team now let's get into the church offices and again this is isn't like one of my normal sermons I'm reading a lot of quotes and I'm going to continue to read a couple more here because as I said before these offices in the church they're not necessarily defined very plainly in the Bible but we can all rest on brother brandom's message and we can take brother brandom where we can't pull out of the Bible we can take brother brandom there and say this is the guidance that we have this is an extended quote but it's it's a quote that and I'd encourage you to listen to Hebrews chapter 7 and the whole Hebrews series is uh is really nice brother Bram talks about a lot about church order there but Hebrews chapter 7 number two I'm going to read this extended quote it says this by the way while I'm speaking somebody around this country somewhere is guilty of writing some cards to move brother Neville out of this Pulpit you're going to have to settle that with me now the reason I read that part is this is Brother bram's church this is the brandham Tabernacle brother brandham was there and they obviously even them had some issues so have patience it's it's okay if we have I think that we've had a beautiful time so far I haven't had any we haven't had any big problems but they might come brother Kim do you think they pretty much all of them have problems don't they but right so they might come but I'm just right here even the brandom Tabernacle with brother brandom there you're going to have to settle that with me uhhuh that's right yes indeed now I want you something about the Deacon board the Deacon board has not one thing to do with that Pastor no sir now we're getting into church order the congregation in full has the authority it isn't a deacon board is just the policeman here in this church just to keep order and so forth but when it comes to rules the whole church has to say so the church is built upon the sovereignty of the local church therefore I have nothing to say in moving this pastor or putting one in I own the property it's given to the church you all are the church you people are the one who control you're the church yourself and the church the Holy Church of God is the sovereignty of the holy spirit in that church the only thing I do is on the property give it give it over to this church as I give it over for a church and it's tax-free and the church elects their own pastors I have nothing to do with it and that's the only way no Deacon board can do it the Deacon board only keeps order and things in the church the the trustees they have nothing to do with it only repair the church they can't do it until there's the whole trustee board meets and says we'll build this or we'll do that then they have to ask the treasur if they got the money to do it yes sir but if there's a complaint against any member if a member has a complaint against one another or something wrong you're supposed to go to that brother yourself and talk to him you and he alone right there let me just keep my place right there Jesus said the same thing he said if you have a if a brother sins against you he said tell no one and go to that person how many of us live up to that here again brother brandom is saying that then if they won't receive it then the next thing takes place you take one of the deacons or somebody and go with you to that brother then if he won't receive you then you come and tell it to the church then if the church then if he w't won't receive the church then the Bible says let them be as a heathen and a Publican that's right and any person that knows a guilty person and you don't go to them and talk then you're the part of the Church of God is going to answer for that sin then you're part of the Church of God you are going to answer for that sin that's right and if and if any persons then has a complaint against a deacon or against the Deacon or somebody in the church it takes three people three people would come and say witness the mouth of two or three Witnesses come tell the pastor that there's a grievance against a deacon then if there's a grievance against a deacon the Deacon isn't a just man or isn't a perfect man he must hold the office of a deacon blameless and then found blameless and if that congregation finds out that the Deacon is not holding that office he gets three with them and takes to takes it to the pastor that Deacon is asked to stay home overnight night and then the pastor comes and brings the congregation together gives the grievance and if the congregation votes for the Deacon to continue on the Deacon continues on if he if votes for the Deacon to be dismissed they elect a new Deacon that very night see therefore no one person has nothing to do in this it's the majority of the people yes sir if 20 votes for him and 21 votes against him he goes or vice versa that is the sovereignty of the local church and then each one of the members has to has has a say so in the church anything goes on wrong then they can come right around and the only thing they have to do is to be before God that they are absolutely see that nothing hinders the moving of the church but the full and complete authority of the church is the pastor read that in the Bible see if it's not Bible order that's exactly right there's no one above the Elder I have nothing to do with what brother Neville does here that's up to you and brother Neville if brother Neville wanted to preach Jehovah Witness Doctrine that's up to you and him and you see if he wanted to preach anything he wanted to that's between you and him that's all if the congregation votes for him in there to preach that that's all right that's up to him the only thing that I do is just owning the property and if somebody and if something another comes up that's like moving the pastor and they want to take a vote on that you couldn't ask a deacon to do that you'd come ask me I'd come down and say if you want to move the pastor tell me why has he done anything yes we caught him drunk or we caught him doing things doing this or doing something that wasn't right have you got three Witnesses of it yes we have do you see how let me stop right there you see how messed up it was about that picture and misinterpreting that picture brother bram's talking about a man cheating on his wife for going out and getting drunk or doing all that and the brother misinterpreted a picture and the church was in such disunity that they voted him out for it um them Witnesses must first be tried don't receive an accusation against an elder L It Be by two or three Witnesses and let them first be proved against the Elder then you have to swear it that you saw it and proved it I'll um I'll go down to the last paragraph brother J me 2933 now coming to this blessed old message here now you now I want you to know that this is tape recorded remember this message and the tape recordings of the church the orders of and rules of the church is on tape recording that's according to the Bible we don't run it there's nobody in head no all we're all the same but we got a leader that is the pastor as long as he's led by the Holy Holy Ghost that's true now one more quote before I get into the office of the Pastor now each one of these has things in common and I think that your meeting should not be to not be together but it should be as each office because the deacons has nothing to do nothing to say to the trustees unless they got some business to present to them and vice versa the trustees is over the finance and things of the building they have nothing with the deacons the deacons are the policemen of the church and they are assistants to the pastor and the trustees is holding of all and the trustees is the holding of all the property the trustees has nothing to do with the spiritual end of it and the Deacon has nothing to do with the financial end of it therefore it must be in the Sunday School Superintendent is over Sunday school so the reason I read that in depth is because really of all the research that I've done and it's been really Decades of of searching that quote that I read brother brandom addresses pretty much everything in that long quote so now we are educated to what the prophet said we know the difference between a deacon and a trustee now let's dig into the Bible and we will see the qualifications here 1 Timothy chapter 3 verse one this is a true saying now this is Timothy this is Paul writing to Timothy and he's giving him instructions on how to manage this church and how to CH choose the church officials this is a true saying if a man desire the office of a bishop he desireth a good work now I'm making the Assumption here that almost every B Bible scholar makes and that's and I believe I can completely back this up with the scripture that office of a bishop means an overseer or a lead leader or a local priest or a pastor he is the leader of the church a bishop then must be blameless I'll address that in a minute the husband of one wife that the man is loyal to his wife and has only one wife and back when it was written I assume that it was probably legal to have more than one wife but today this means that that man cannot be divorced Vigilant every other translation I read says temperent he doesn't have a bad temper and he's has control Sober Sober is respectable and of good behavior given to hospitality and apt to teach that word apt means able now able to teach this pastor must be a preacher now this is something that has gone on in the message and especially lately where a man is trying to govern a church trying to Pastor a church and this man is not a Gifted Man in the scriptures he's not able to preach as it says right here he takes the office of a pastor and then he either streams in another Pastor or he just plays tapes now if he wants to just play tapes that's up to him and whatever is good for the congregation but he must be able to dig into this word and preach the gospel it is a requirement here and if he is not able to do that he can't be a pastor he is disqualified right here first sentence very very important that that man how can you counsel somebody if you with marriage and divorce or whatever it is you have to be able to open your Bible and say Here's what the Bible says you can't defer to another man if there's a problem in the church church that's why you're the pastor and contrary to popular perception a pastor's gift is not only in standing in front of the congregation and expounding other word this pastor must be able to rightly divide this so he can handle every situation in the church and especially conflict when we see when we see a central organization dictating how a service goes or what the Serv what should be set in the surface whether it's a tape or what whatever it is that is the very definition of a denomination we would never do that but we do and if you don't have a pastor friends you don't have a church that's just it's just by definition that word blameless I said that that I was going to come back to it and it and it says the same thing for a deacon it doesn't mean that you've never done anything wrong or that there's no past sins in your life every living breathing human human being has past sins but blameless means above reproach as I said the Deacon has the same qualification and a blameless means that this pastor or this Deacon is living a Godly life he's not cheating on his wife he's not breaking the law he's not embezzling money from the church he's a godly man living a Godly life he lives the message that he preaches not given to Wine he's not a drunk nor Striker he's not violent not greedy a filthy lucer but patient not a brawler not Covetous filthy lucer as you know is money and it's not just money it's dishonest money there should be no pyramid schemes in the church there should be no parties where the Deacon's wife or the pastor's wife milk the people for money with high pressure sales now I know it happens it started way back when remember brother Kim Wa with Tupperware and and then it went to like Amway and then it goes to essential oils and it goes to all these things that they have these these group get togethers and then it's pyramid schemes and all this I won't have it in this church I don't agree with that that's not making money in an honest way that's using your friends and then if everybody just kind of Trades money it doesn't work and especially with the pastor the deacons and the trustees absolutely not now as far as filthy lucer also brother Brandon made the statement one time that tithes go to the pastor but then he also said that he re receives a salary of $100 a week so I see so often the pastors and they go back to the box after every service and they're the ones that collect the money and they go in and the trustees never see it that's not what brother Brandon was saying when brother brandom said that the ties go to the pastors he he talked about soup suppers and having all of these different fundraisers so that you can pay the pastor the pastor enough money should come in to pay the pastor a salary but saying that all the money goes to the pastor that breaks the whole thing here then why did he have a salary one that ruleth well his own house having his children in subjection without gravity again this this also applies applies to a deacon ruling well his own house is that his children are in subjection to him and they respect their father in his walk with the Lord because the children grow up with the dad they see the dad's faults they see his weaknesses they see his strengths so as as they're growing up they may stray and they all do that doesn't disqualify the pastor what disqualifies the pastor is the kid saying my dad's a hypocrite and I I don't respect him there's a difference there for if a man know not how to rule his own house how shall he take care of the Church of God not a novice lest being lifted up with pride he fall into the condemnation of the devil that word novice means a new believer where he is a pastor or a deacon he needs to be tried first this can't be he can't just have just come into the the faith and just started believing and and he may be a great guy and he may be filled with the Holy Spirit and all that but there is a time of trial that we all go through not just a pastor not just a deacon or a trustee but all of us we go through that that trial where we prove our faith to the Lord and to each other I still think a young man in his 20s and 30s can be a pastor or a deacon but there still needs to be years of experience there behind him not months or weeks moreover he must have a good report of them which are without lest he fall into the reproach and the snare of the devil he must have the respect of the people outside the church if you have a bad reputation in business and at your work and all of that how are you qualified to be here as a deacon or a trustee or or a pastor that's your personality that's who you are and if you're outside and you're sinning those sins will be brought into this church let me read um the uh I'll read what I have for the uh statement for the pastor for the church bylaws and I want everybody to review this um because we're also going to ratify these bylaws this this Sunday it says here for the pastor the pastor provides spiritual leaders ERS ship and is the ultimate Authority in all major decisions of the church he sets the order of worship ministers or arranges for others to minister at Public Services provides counseling for members and their children ensures the church finances are collected and administered ethically and perform such other duties as are commonly associated with being a pastor Pastor must meet all qualifications set forth by the Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 3 and Titus 1 among among other things he must be married not divorced a good father a loving husband a man of good reputation hospitable and must handle his own finances well I wrote those words and that those are going to be if voted on by the church and accepted by the church those are going to be in our bylaws now the Deacon says this deacons provide assistance to the pastor and are responsible for maintaining order in the church this includes but is not limited to such things as assisting in serving communion bringing various matters to the attention of the pastor they may handle requests for minor Financial or other assistance deacons do not make financial decisions concerning the building property of the church or church expenses such as salary salaries or offerings to the Min to ministers qualifications like the pastor and associate pastor a deacon must meet all the qualifications set for by the Apostle Paul in 1 Timothy 3 so let's get to the office of a deacon um verse number eight likewise must the deacons be grave not double tonged not given to much wine not greedy of filthy lucer as I said earlier grave is usually translated as worthy of respect holding the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience now if brother Brandon would have defined what that means I would read the read the quote here the Amplified Bible says this and and I I couldn't find anywhere where brother brandom Define that the Amplified Bible says this but upholding and fully understanding the mystery that is the true doctrine of the Christian faith with a clear conscience resulting from Behavior consistent with spiritual maturity in short the deacons must understand what the Christian faith is and live that before the people understand what they believe and let these also be first proved then let them use the office of a deacon being found blameless so a deacon needs to operate as an usher or a trustee or some other leadership position in the church before he is ordained as a deacon and a deacon is a spiritual role in the church so a deacon a trustee can too but a deacon especially can have a Ministry a deacon uh Stephen Phillip both of them went out and preached the gospel LED souls to Christ operated as evangelist Miracles followed those Brothers they were able to go out and have this ministry and still be a deacon in the church one thing a deacon does not say though it does not say a deacon is able to teach that's a myth so many US of us have heard that the Bible says a deacon is apt to teach or brother brandom said a deacon is apt to teach that's just not true it's not in the Bible and it's not in the message so it's not a requirement it is something that many deacons have that gift but it is not a requirement for as for the word as far as the word goes even so must their wives be grave not slanderers sober faithful in all things so this is very very important just as much as a God calls a deacon he also calls his wife into this ministry a Deacon's wife can't be partakers of the gossip of the church she should rise above that just as a deacon should she needs to be in service needs to be available to help she needs to always be willing to give a hand or even just a shoulder to cry on she should be a respected sister in the church God calls these sisters and he very plainly lines it out right here that that sister needs to be living a life that is worthy of what this 1 Timothy chapter 3 says let the deacons be the husbands of one wife ruling their children in their own house as well I covered that with the pastor for they that have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Jesus Christ when uh brother brandham was dedicating my aunt Carina my my grandfather was a deacon and he says this he says gracious heavenly father as we stand here before this Deacon tonight speaking of my speaking of my grandfather dedicating in front his child in front of the audience and truly a fine office he holds for a deacon must be found blameless the husband of one wife controlling his family well for if he doesn't know how to control his family how can he control the house of God and we thank thee that this brother has met these qualifications and find in him the spirit of God now I've talked with my grandpa many times I've talked with my grand really all the deacons at the Tabernacle from way back when um brother wheeler brother Hickerson was a very very close friend he was like family so we talked a lot about what brother brandham was like and how and the roles of the Deacons brother brandham was not a dominating man who made every decision for the church the brothers did their best to operate according to the scriptures under the leadership of brother Brandon and brother Neville and they would ask if they had a question but if someone was causing a disturbance in the church they didn't ask brother brandom they took the care of the situation that was their job not the pastor's job that's the Deacon's job to be able to use the wisdom to take care of any typ type of disturbance or any type of problem that's in the church and the same thing with the sisters that are the wives those sisters should ask their husband the Deacon not ask me but ask her husband and then take care of whatever situation it may be and then the deacons answer to me and if if you've done wrong then then we'll discuss that in all this work it says here I want to read that again verse number 13 it says for they have used the office of a deacon well purchased to themselves a good degree and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus so in all this work that these deacons perform you purchase for yourself a good degree and great boldness in the faith that is in Christ Jesus so having that being elected to that position have faith in your prayers and the congregation should have faith in these deacons prayers these brothers are living a life they are purchasing this this great honor that they have with all of their efforts and always being in church and going and visiting the sick and doing all these things and then God will honor what they have done and bless all of us these things write I unto thee hoping to come unto thee shortly but if I T long that thou mayest know how how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God which is the Church of the Living God the pillar and ground of Truth and without controversy great is the mystery of godliness God was manifested in the flesh justified in the spirit seen of angels preached unto the Gentiles believed on in the world and received up in into Glory Paul always ends up with the Lord Jesus whatever Direction he goes whatever he's teaching it always comes back to the Lord and I'll cover the trustees quickly here um the trustees and the bylaws the trustees oversee the real property of the church and advise the pastor and congregation regarding the church property as well as the overall Financial condition of the church trustees May sign deeds and other legal documents necessary for the functioning of the church managing its properties and similar tasks on behalf of the church major financial decisions require a formal vote of the trustees with a majority required in every member of the trustee board casting a vote the P the pastor casts the deciding vote in the case of a tie and the pastor has veto authority over any decision that does not receive unanimous vote from the Board of Trustees with three or more trustees on the board trustees may or may not have signature Authority and a trustee must be a voting member of the Tucson Tabernacle responsibly manage his personal finances be of good moral character and conduct his life in a way that reflects the nature of Jesus Christ he is not subject to the qualifications of deacons and Pastors in 1 Timothy 3 brother um brandham had a number of Trustees one of those was brother Roberson brother Roberson was divorced and remarried he was not qualified to be a deacon but brother brandham still had him on his trustey board now I think we've covered everything as far as the vote this weekend and for the visitors it's not a normal service I was trying to Define these because I want to make sure that we're all in one Accord I I want that I want to I want the lord to bless us I want him to be in everything that we do and I want to do things right and lay a good foundation as I said earlier um on my WhatsApp broadcast that I will send out a copy of these bylaws to everyone we will vote yes or no on the bylaws read them check them and pray about them contact me if you have a a problem with them as I said last Sunday night I've asked nominated before the church brother Aaron Gara who's been a man that has been faithful always serving the church and is I think is well proven one thing about a deacon that Deacon has to be here almost every service of course they can go on vacation but they need to be faithful here always brother Aaron Brother um Lyall Johnson again a longtime member of the church here well proven um a man of of impeccable Integrity as I think all the brothers are then brother Jordan Peterson also brother Jordan is acting now as a trustee in the church um I think that brother Jordan of course he he's a great trustee but I think that um with brother Jordan's personality uh uh I really think that he could serve the church better as a deacon the deacons have to be able to and I think brother Jordan and all the brothers can the deacons have to be able to to um uphold the law they need to be able to go to someone and and tell them they're wrong or go to the children and and tell them not to run around in the in the in the sanctuary when we've let out or or whatever that may be and that's not that's not easy for most people to do but these these brothers I believe can do it and I think that they're going to make very very good deacons um as far as the trustees brother Arie Peterson back there who is um always here the brother is the most faithful Brother anytime there's a problem with anything I call Brother Arie and he's he's up here and taking care of fixing whatever he's he's a very very loyal and and very righteous man and then the same with brother Ed dugall I was just here with him last night we were here for a couple hours just going over things with the church and the church building so two Trustees for now three deacons and that also leaves many a few positions open and I would like to fill those positions also in the in the future I know it's not normal um service but are there any questions that anyone has I'll do my best to answer okay no what we'll do is after praying about this I think the best thing to do is a two-year term for each position brother Brandon was plain in and I I skipped that part of that quote brother Brandon was plain in saying that the pastor is not voted on he said no not the pastor but the trustees and the deacons he's Pastor until but I feel and we are a sovereign church we are not the brandom Tabernacle I feel to be voted on during the elections and there will be twoyear terms elections and then you as brother brandom said in that quote then the officers in the church will decide do I want to continue on or do I want to resign my position and have someone else go before the church for a vote and then they'll they'll be voted on every two years any other questions I'll close with this quote and the musicians can come again I want to read that one that I that I said earlier you are elected trustees and your name is on the books and now they're going to have some more elections of deacons and so forth and brother Neville is will be calling those immediately after service all right and for the treasur and so forth as we can set the church up get it all all backgrounds ready and then we can have a Revival as it comes on you may not think that the world may not think that these things are important but God requires things we want to have every duck in a row we want to have every piece placed in the puzzle and then God will pour out his Spirit do you remember I talk about it fairly often how when Solomon's Temple was built everything was finished everything was according to God's plan and David had given them Blueprints and everything here's how you do it everything was lined out it was finished and then God came down and entered into the temple and friends that's why I want to be I want to make sure that we are correct in everything that we do let's all stand I'll read one more quote here brother Bram says this now I think it's our duty to make the inside right by the grace of God to be so grateful to God that our that this will just not only be a beautiful building that will come to but may everyone who comes in see the beautiful characteristics of Jesus Christ in every person that comes in may it be a consecrated place to our Lord a consecrated people for no matter how beautiful the structure is that we certainly do appreciate the beauty of the church is the character of the people I trust it'll always be a house of God of beauty brother Paul and I brother Paul Murray back there and I have been talking and how the true temple of God the True Church of God is not this building it's not it's not just the place to worship the true temple of God is the individual that makes himself or herself ready that does everything that they can honors God does all the all the Commandments and then says Lord here I am and then that Holy Spirit comes into that individual that is the true temple of God and this church I want to be made up of hundreds of those temples bringing their fire into this congregation worshiping worshiping in spirit and in truth as I said earlier there's a motion there there there's the word there there's the Holy Spirit there and everything operating according to God's perfect will we may be shouting or we may be sitting in our Pew crying but it's the same holy spirit that should be operating in each person God bless you all brother [Music] Aaron Oh Sister Martha said that um brother Glenn her dad is on the way to the emergency room with some concerning symptoms Karen his wife is really concerned and shaken up I know that many of us know brother Glenn he's a man of God let's all bow our heads heavenly father as we try to get our church right in every way Lord we don't want to leave anything undone and Lord as we do everything that we can we know that we lord can claim the promises that you have given us to pray for the sick Lord that to do Miracles father as we do our part the best that we can now father we bring brother Glenn before you in the name of Jesus Christ Christ and ask Lord that you would heal him may your hand be upon him Lord in Jesus name amen he wants me live brother K brother Kim to give until there's just no more more to get I'm going to love love till there's just no more love I could never never out love alone I'm going to live the way he wants me to live I'm going to give until there's just no more to give I'm going to love love till there's just no more love but I could never out love the Lord God bless you this evening it's wonderful to be here with you again we were here last year at the time you have Harmony we're a little disappointed that Harmony didn't happen but we but we understand we understand these these things you know I have to tell you that I've been a a student of church order for a very long time I've been involved in writing bylaws and and I actually wrote a book about it once and and uh I have to tell you that was an excellent job this evening it was just so nicely laid out from the message and you know as we progress through life like I can look on my experience and I've held almost every office in the church other than Pastor or Deacon and uh so I have a lot of experience with it but as we grow through life we realize as you know you know those of you who have gray hair have you come to realize how little we know yes you know the younger ones know a lot but the old older we get the more and more we realize we don't really know anything yes amen that's the truth and so we're so so thankful to have the message of the hour that we can take it we can open it up and the instructions are plain I liked when when he said you know brother brandom has clearly explained how it's supposed to be and how all these things are supposed to be the challenge is getting us to our spirit to agree with that right of course that's the that's the purpose of the holy spirit so like I say really nice to be with you you here today and uh I I really enjoyed it I knew what you were doing tonight cuz I read it on your website and I actually wanted I was I you know there's a lot of churches here and we know people at different places and uh based on what was on your website is why I came here tonight because you know he basically said he was putting this and you know you we have to look back in the scripture you know we can go back to Elijah and you probably talked about it but Elijah when he was rolling the stones together and all those other guys were trying to have a Revival they were trying to get the presence of God to fall and they were cutting themselves and having this great emotional experience and here's Elijah just quietly Rolling Stones amen putting things in order put it's a restoration Ministry that we're under yes and so restoring and putting things in order you know I traveled around the world with brother Harold hilderbrand some of you know who he is sure one of the greatest Apostles in the message that I know for a Setter in order of churches and when we look behind behind him so many successful churches all over the world you know he was doing this he'd go into a place where people were Loosely gathered around the message and he would put the church in order and put the pastor in his place and and the deacons and put all that in place so and and I look today and those churches that brother Harold founded 40 years ago and 30 years ago are still all strong growing churches upon which God poured upon which God for a great Revival in these last few years of over a 100,000 people baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus in the last five or six years in the country of Uganda on the backs of those Church those churches that were founded and and and established on the word of God it's so important to put that in place and it it Thrills me when I see what when I see it being placed like that because I know what the trajectory is amen amen you know often times when a new church starts you wonder well I wonder where that's going wonder how that's going to turn out you know but when you see the foundation is on the message of the hour we're seeing the restoration being put the things being put in order and then when after Elijah was all done and all the stones in place here the are everything's in place then he said Let the Fire Fall amen and it did and it did so that's what we expect that's what we expect for this church when we see a pastor with a vision to put the church in order and to set it up you know it seems it it it can almost seem carnal and mundane and he seemed a little carnal all you do these guys were having Revival they're jumping out and they're shouting and they're prophesying they're having a great time and here's Elijah you should put stones in place rebuild the altar well that's not very exciting but when he got it in place the fire fell yes did amen let's pray together again it's wonderful to be with you here tonight father we bow before you tonight Lord so thankful for the grace that you've shown in each of our lives and that one common thing that brings us together Lord your Holy Spirit and your forgiveness Lord Lord you told a story once of two men going up to the temple and one said I'm sure glad I'm not like the denominations I'm glad I'm not like this person or that person and one smed his breast and said oh God forgive me a sinner Lord amen and father that's where we are tonight Lord forgive us father for our sins father forgive us for the things that we do and the time we waste Lord but father we're so thankful that you've called us Lord You've washed us you've cleansed us and we're now Sinners saved by grace Lord Jesus by your sovereign Mercy father we ask Lord that as this church is setting itself in order and father no doubt the Holy Spirit moving sovereignly throughout this church Lord that you would come Lord establish the work Lord and that you would multiply the work Lord and that you would you know add those to the church daily as as you would call them Father Lord we've heard the reports of different ones coming in Lord and father so thankful Lord that this Lighthouse is is shining here in this community Lord and father no doubt you've got children throughout this area Lord that have been snared that are enslaved by sin and enslaved by the enemy father may this be a place where they can come in and be refreshed Lord and be born again and their lives start again Lord and Blossom in you oh God that's our desire father we pray Lord for the pastor Lord that you would lead him guide Him Father hold them in the palm of your hand Lord we pray for the congregation Lord that they would hold up the minister Lord as no doubt he's a target for the enemy Lord that they would hold him up in prayer that they would stand shoulder toosh shoulder with him even when he's wrong Lord Jesus Lord have your way we pray we thank you for your grace in Jesus name we pray amen amen just told Brother Ken or brother Kim about our project to send a shipment over to Uganda it's a that's a blessing that I said that remember as I read those quotes at the beginning and as this revival continues to build that we've been seeing in this church and and as the spirit continues to grow remember brother Braham said don't blow it out the whistle allow that steam to go back into the engine and make those Wheels turn and win souls to Christ put that work put that power that comes by the Holy Spirit into winning those Souls friends that's the most important thing that we can do while we're here God bless you
