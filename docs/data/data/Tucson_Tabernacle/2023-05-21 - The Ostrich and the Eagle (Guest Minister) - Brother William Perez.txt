and go as I please but there's just something about a Sunday morning when we can just forget about things that happened in the week and just just concentrates on what God has done for us will do for us but what's amazing is what he is in this time in this hour is doing for us amen he is so good I granted I I it's it's a privilege for me this morning to be here it's my first time in uh in Tucson Tabernacle um brother Daniel gave us the opportunity uh thank you you may be you may be seated for uh for a few moments we've got to spend a little bit of time of fellowship and a meal with uh with brother Daniel last night got to meet uh brother Ed I had talked to him on Friday on the phone but it was sure nice to meet him um he gave us a back uh back door back seat back uh backstage yes backstage tour a VIP tour last night um I gotta admit I was lost took us through all the rooms and I'm like man this is uh this is amazing here but wow when we stepped into the auditorium here wow I said my goodness what a privilege uh to to see that that sign that I've only seen in pictures of Jesus Christ the same yesterday and today and forever amen he was uh he's still the same God 2 000

brother I see brother Daniels this is Stephanie God bless you good to see you see you again every other face is brand new to me so I I look forward to to greeting you all after church giving you this uh the handshake and uh and introducing my family I want to introduce them as well this uh this this morning um and ask them to stand my wife sister Debbie my oldest son Noah Isaiah and Ethan God bless you sure is wonderful to have them here also very happy to have brother Roger and Sister Laura thank you thank you so much for being here with us you know brother Roger and Sister Laura have been have uh there at well they've been with us for since the early 80s that's right I was maybe about two or three years old when Sister Laura and brother Roger they they moved there to to Silver City and um we are we're we're so uh thankful that what God has done through them all these years and uh and what he is continuing to do amen I I had a um just a small thought this morning but I'm going to ask you to stand for the reading of the word and um you know we find ourselves in so many uh situations sometimes um and I found myself in many situations that that I that I looked at and I S and I finally realized those are self made situations wounds that are self-inflicted so many times we we uh we feel wow the devil's on my tail the devil's after me my goodness and no it's you know you you really have to look at yourself in the mirror and say man that is my that is my worst enemy right there that's that's my greatest enemy right there is I have to overcome William Bettis I don't know about you you guys might be different this morning than me but but this is what I have to overcome sometime but the word of the Lord says in the Book of Psalms chapter 27 verse 1. simply says the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear that is the question the Lord is the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid another question when the wicked even mine enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat upon my flesh they stumbled and fell though an host shouldn't encamp against me my heart shall not fear the war should rise against me and this will I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion I don't know if any one of you can say um for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me He Shall Set me upon a rock amen let us pray dear gracious father thank you Lord for your goodness we thank you for this day we thank you Lord for your your children that are here this morning Father what an opportunity this is not to hear from me Lord but we pray that we hear from you Lord and Lord we ask that you just anoint my lips Lord bless the ears of of the congregation here Lord and Lord May the loss be found May the sick be healed father and may the saints that are here be blessed we ask these things father in your precious and holy name amen you may be seated I bring greetings from our from our pastor brother Kayla Perez they're in Las Cruces New Mexico and my also my brother Tomas Perez Jr we uh they want us to greet you this morning and they send their love and we we uh we sure love the people here in Tucson Tabernacle we sure love our brothers and sisters here amen this uh this scripture the lord gave to me just maybe just a few minutes before I got up here I was uh I was talking with brother Aaron this morning he said just be yourself and um I thought I my thought changed just slightly after he told me that said just be yourself because when I was growing up this was the last place I wanted to be was behind a Pulpit I never I never grew up saying how I can't wait to be a preacher no I I grew up my my father was a was a pastor missionary for for over 50 years um the Lord sought it fit on the 8th of this month to take him home and we uh we had the privilege of of laying his body to rest this past Wednesday and what an example that he has laid in my life in lives of so many people and I was uh I was going back to what brother Aaron was saying I said you know I told my dad when I was young I said I don't want to be like you I don't I don't think I have that calling my brothers they were both pastors and everyone assumed well you're going to follow in the same in the same footsteps I said nope I said I'm happy I I started playing the uh I started playing the drums when I was seven years old in church I played different instruments in church and I said I am so happy doing this just stick me in the corner away from everybody and don't put me in front of people so As I Grew Older I um I developed when I was younger a problem stuttering so I said Lord well that's that just proves everything I can't even speak in public so so you so thank you Lord there's there's another excuse I have so as time progressed um I I felt that I felt that pool later on in life and my dad told me son you can't run away anymore you're done running I said well I said I I feel like Jonah you know you know what was interesting I was I was uh I was looking at the life of Jonah and how he was how he was running from what God was calling him for and this is how this is how far he he was running brother and I want to give you a little perspective of how far Jonah was running Joppa was on the Far Eastern side of the Mediterranean Sea tarsh's is on the western side of the coast of Spain bordering the Atlantic Ocean that is approximately approximately 2200 miles that would be the distance from Atlanta to Los Angeles of how far Jonah was trying to run away imagine that in a small ship but imagine this now the distance from Joppa to Nineveh is approximately approximately 700 miles in essence Jonah ran as far away as he could in the opposite direction I found myself in that situation so many times trying to run away from what God had planned in my life I tried everything that I could as a human to distance myself from Ministry even though I loved coming to church I loved playing for the Lord worshiping the Lord I said that's that is going to be the Pinnacle of my life that's going to be the Apex that's exactly what I want to do is just be there to worship you know many times we do find ourselves struggling trying to find what our purpose in life is it's so it's so easy especially as young people and I've and I feel for our for our youth for our young people what situations that they go through each and every day and how much harder it is each generation that passes by it gets harder and it gets more difficult for them and you look and you see young people that are still serving God and you say wow to serve God as a young person in this age you say wow because you know that God truly is working in their lives and I see some young people this morning and I say wow God is working in lives God is still changing lives no matter how difficult the situation is he's still changing he's still calling he still wants you as his son and daughter you know and I I found myself trying to compare myself to an eagle thank you but really when I looked at how my spiritual life was it was not the life of an eagle amen we we have so many songs we have so many poems uh different things we have pictures of beagles and saying that's me and we and we get so pumped up we get so excited yes brother Branham talks about the eagle that's what I am but really when we look at ourselves who do we see what do we see and you know what I found myself looking at it's going to blow your mind I don't think you're all ready for it this morning it's the craziest thing I found myself like an ostrich I don't know if you ever heard a message about an ashes before but I found myself as an ostrich I looked at myself and I and I say wow I've got these beautiful wings I stretched I would stretch out look how beautiful my wings are I would flap them around I would say my goodness I look beautiful but as I looked in the heavens and I saw those around me flying how I wished I could fly with him and as I tried to to maybe flap my wings a little bit for some reason I couldn't get off the ground because an ostrich is not made for the air an eagles made for the air but a ostrich definitely is not made for the air you know when we when we uh when we see an ostrich you know in the in the Book of Job and what's amazing about the Book of Job is is God is uh in in in the uh if you want to turn it into the uh book of jobs it's chapter 38 excuse me I'm sorry it's chapter 39. and we're going to start with verse 13. and it says gave us doubt the goodly wings unto the peacocks or wings and Feathers unto the ostrich which leaveth her eggs in the Earth and warmeth them in the dust and what's amazing about if you go and read this chapter of job 39 God is asking job these questions about different animals and it's so amazing that thousands and thousands and thousands of years ago that this text was written scientists can go back and say how correct that is which leaveth her eggs in the earth and warmest them in dust and this is this is when you find yourself not caring about what you want in your life not caring about church not caring about your brother not caring about your sister you find yourself as the ostrich is when which excuse me verse 15 and forgetth that the foot may crush them or that the wild beast may break them she is hardened against her young ones as though they were not hers her labor is in vain without fear because God hath deprived her of wisdom neither hath he imparted to her understanding and when you take a look at this scripture God is trying to convey something to job he says you see these animals you see you see how I've made them I want you to take a good look I want you to realize what I do not want you to be many times we see scriptures of things that God wants us to reflect of things that God wants us to be but we see the scriptures and we see scriptures of what God does not want us to be like we see we want to be like Jesus oh how I long to be like him we sing the songs and I take a look at the mirror and I see myself I had seen my reflection I said that is not a reflection of Christ that is a reflection of William Bettis because when I looked around I I when you grow up as a as a pastor's son as a preacher's kid you develop complexes you develop uh you you sometimes develop develop bitterness towards the brothers and sisters that has nothing to do with you and you start and you start disliking people I don't don't want to say hating people that's that's that's that's harsh I I never did that but you you start disliking people and you start wishing wow why why can't they why can't they get it together why can't they just be good people quit fighting love each other and you have no problems and I I tried to figure that out as a child and I I just could not figure that out could not figure out why there was so many issues and when you try and figure things out as a child you start like I said to start developing complexes complexes and then you start developing bad feelings and then I started developing I didn't start liking people and I I saw myself in the mirror one time as I as I Grew Older I just said I I just I just don't want to be around these people I just I just I just uh I just just don't like the situation I looked at myself and I said wow I'm uh I'm a good person I don't cause too many problems I don't have too many issues I think I'm a better Christian than those people that have been in the message 30 40 years that I didn't think gotten that that I didn't think had it together and I I started I started having uh bad feelings but I also started getting this superiority complex I started yeah look at me I wear a suit to church every day or every service I get up and I and I and I S and I sing and I and I and I play and I am a I am a good Christian I don't cause any problems I don't cause any issues look at me wow so one day I had a dispute with a with the brother and I said you know what I can't I can't forgive you for that there's what you've done what you've talked about what you did it's Unforgivable how can you even call yourself a Christian and and as I as I walked back I said I felt pretty good about it because I said you know what I stood my ground I said what I had to say I didn't mix words but I I I did it I stood up for what for what is right and when I and when I looked at myself I said it's pretty good but there was a time that I had to ask for forgiveness there was a time that I that I had said something bad about a brother and as I was contemplating on how to approach the situation I remember looking at myself my reflection and asking myself these questions have you ever lied I said yes I have you ever stolen yes I have you ever talked evil against a brother I said yes I have so why are you not forgiving a brother and why are you asking for forgiveness and I looked at myself and I said and these thoughts came just roaring in my mind I said if I'm if if I'm not able to give forgiveness how am I able to receive forgiveness and I remember the Lord as he came down he said first of all before you even asked for forgiveness she goes you make things right you get on your knees not on not just on your knees but you go to that person and you forgive them he said you want forgiveness in your life you want to be an eagle you can't be an eagle you can't even fly you can't even walk your EarthBound you're you're so Bound in Chains but you're not bound in the chains of Satan you're bound in the chains of William Bettis you're bound in chains that you have created for yourself and I said wow Lord all it takes is a moment to look at yourself in the eyes and then you and then you'll understand what it is to be forgiven you'll understand what it is when somebody speaks evil against you and save me and you tell them brother it's okay I forgive you it's all right but let's not do it again let's continue on so as I was reading about the ostrich I I took some things from from this from this passage and I said wow how the ostrich is so selfish many times we can't be selfish right only only William from New Mexico is selfish thank God nobody in here from Tucson is selfish praise the Lord for that we've come a long ways but so many times we we get so selfish of of of what God has given to us and so many times we keep it for ourselves now I know this message this morning is is is simple very simple but I want to make sure that this message this morning not it might not help just but one person this morning and that and praise God if it just helps one person but but as as the scripture is unfolding and it is telling us about this this ostrich it says the ostrich doesn't even give natural affection for her offspring and I'm and I say wow Lord how different that is from an eagle you know you see an eagle you'll never see a nest of an eagle on the ground like an ostrich you'll see the nest of an eagle way up high on the cliff you'll see where it's protected the ostrich doesn't care about protection for its eggs it doesn't care about its natural affection towards its eggs it just lays the eggs and goes on let the sun warm up the eggs let this let the let the dust cover the eggs who cares if if feet trample on these eggs it doesn't matter because I have no connection to the eggs anymore so many times when we see our brother and sister we're like the ostrich we might see our brother and sister go off they might not come to church anymore or they might even go to a different Church and you can say well since they don't come here anymore they don't go to to Williams church anymore well I don't have any affection for them anymore I don't have I don't have a sense of responsibility for them anymore they're going to do whatever they want so I'm going to do what I what I need to do and that's it and we get the ostrich mentality of not caring of not of not having that affection for our brothers and sisters how how important it is to love one another I mean it it's this is this is kindergarten first grade stuff but if we can't even do the very the very simple things in life how is God going to give us more responsibility in the greater things in life if he sees we can't even we can't even take care of our neighbor that we can't even take care of our brother take care of our sister how can he give us much more responsibility it's just like me in a business I ask God Lord bless my business Lord just may may just open up the windows of heaven and just ring down on us you know we live in a desert right I live in a desert right Tucson is in a desert you know what happens when you get an abundance of rain at one time everybody's well aware of that right we're in the desert we're not there in Florida or any place okay you know what happens when we get a bunch of rain we get destruction so basically if you don't have your stuff together God is not going to rain down on you with blessings because those blessings are going to destroy you they're going to bring bring destruction to your life so here am I Lord open up the windows just let your blessings fall upon my business fall upon my family and what does the Lord do he starts his Blessing he's like okay here you go wow that's all God had that's all God had was just a door but I I mean I I thought I was going to be at least at least driving a beamer by the end of the year still I'm in my 2013 Ford Ford Fusion it's 120 000 miles I'm gonna say Lord but that's the way he does things he says I can't take you to the heights if you if you're if you're just if you can't even handle the little the little thing that I'm that I'm that that I have given you if you can't even handle that and take care of that how do you expect more oh but he opens up that window and it starts or opens up that door and the blessings start flowing out little by little it's not what you wanted because God doesn't give you what you want because if we're given if God has given us what we wanted we'd be pretty messed up right Lord give me that uh give me that 10 000 square foot mansion they're up they're up in the catalinas you know I I deserve that you know and when it comes time for property taxes when it comes time for for for heating and and cooling it it's like Lord I mean you blessed me and I can't even I can't even pay the the electricity on this place it's not going to bless you with that because he knows you can't he knows I can't handle that but what he gives to us what he shares with us that's so wonderful it's so great what God does for us and how thankful we are and what and what does he do it starts growing starts growing I'm not trying to teach a a Prosperity Gospel at all no it's not it's not what that's not what we're all about if God didn't do anything for me for the rest of my life it's already sufficient what he's done you got to look at God that way and and instead you're we're just like Lord give me this give me that give me this give me that give me that no he's he says I've already done enough isn't my grace sufficient for you isn't what I've done on the cross sufficient for you so I found myself as an ostrich trying to get up to the Heights when troubles came around when fear was around what did I do I ran I ran like the ostrich when trouble was near when I couldn't run I put my hand in shame I put my head in the floor but you know what's wrong with that so many times when we when we feel like we well I'm gonna just I'm gonna hide I'm gonna put my head in the dirt like like an ostrich and No One's Gonna find where I'm at you because you see in our minds it's like that that uh uh it's like that that saying out of sight out of mind right so if I turn my my back from a from a problem and and not look at it while it's not there it's what we have in our mentality right that's like the ostrich she's he's he's he's putting his head down thinking that all his problems all the fear all that all that what's coming against him if he puts his head down that it's just gonna vanish that it's just gonna go away and so many times we we I'm gonna say I I look at that and I see myself well if I wait five more days all this is gonna pass by okay so I'm not gonna I'm not gonna think about it I'm not going to deal with it I'm gonna just let it fly by well after five days your problem is still there and now it's worse so here's brother will the ostrich putting his head in the sand thinking that all his issues all his problems are just going to go away but you know the the issue with that people might not see your head but they see that gigantic body sticking out right they see that gigantic body sticking down they're like like what's his deal he's trying to hide are are you serious God's looking at you and he's like are you serious you're trying to hide you think you've you think you've hidden yourself from me I can see that gigantic body poking out are you serious and it's like wow wow Lord I'm just I'm just I'm just trying just to get away and he says haven't I shown you haven't I shown you that in the time of trouble where I would hide you where I would take you he says I I am I'm not taking you and laying you on the Earth I'm not taking you and laying you in a nest by a bush where anything can get a hold of you but where I'm taking you is to a place where nothing else where nothing else is going to harm you and when you look at that your mentality everything in your life starts to change you start looking at yourself instead of an ostrich you start looking at yourself as an ego job 39 again verse 27 doth the eagle Mount up at thy command and make her nest on high she dwelleth and abideth on the Rock hmm upon the Crag of The Rock and the Strong place from thence she seeketh the prey and her eyes behold afar off her young ones also suck up blood and where the slain are there is she you know I I was uh I was trying to find a quote of brother Branham on an ostrich and I found one and it says as careless as the ostriches of her eggs excuse me and some of them remarks that how that the ostrich thinks he had hid himself now that's true when he sticks his head in the ground but the most of him is still is still looking out so that's about the way we do some time we try to hide our head behind something there's always maybe we're still showing you know he sees every bit of us you see you know as I as I as I Grew Older and I got into my teenage years I would see this and when and when brother Branham made this quote we try to hide our head behind something to me that something was religion I don't know about you this morning I would hide my head I wasn't a bad a bad child I didn't party I didn't drink I didn't smoke I didn't do drugs all of that all of that I didn't the stuff that I just mentioned I didn't do it because I I felt convicted I just thought it was disgusting that was my thing I I hated this the the smell of smoke I hated the smell of beer that's why I didn't do that stuff it was disgusting to me not because oh I'm a pastor's kid I'm convicted Lord no it wasn't that way at all but I hid myself behind religion I hid myself behind the fact that I was a pastor's son that's where I would hide myself this morning I want you to ask the question where am I hiding where are you hiding ask yourself the question where am I hiding are you hiding behind something or are you like the eagle hiding on something because what a difference that is when you are hidden when you hide yourself behind religion you hide your yourself behind that you're a good person and that's and that's and that's okay that to be a good person that's great there's a lot of people I encounter on a daily basis on a daily basis that I that I know I would say these people are the nicest people I've ever met these people are just are just so welcoming and they have never once in their life stepped into church they never once in their life had anything to do with God but yet they are the nicest people and many of you have met them many of you have met people like that and then you deal with some people in church and my gosh they're the rudest people I've ever met the brother knows what I'm going through you know what you know what I mean brother Amen to that and so were so we're hiding ourselves behind something always hiding waiting to make sure nobody sees what we're doing did I believe to a certain extent I believed I believe this message I believe there was a prophet I believe what God did for me what Jesus did for me on the cross there was one day there was there was a brother a very very close friend of my father because his name was brother Fabio Bernal from Bogota Colombia I must have been 16 17 years old he preached the message that just shook me to my core and his title of his message and his thought was close to the cross but far from the blood I found myself as I was playing in church close to the cross but that's all that I would see I would I would just see the cross thank you Lord cry some tears every now and then thank you God for what you did but yet I found myself so far from where God wanted me to be shook me to my core and I said wow how is that possible that I have been in church my entire life I never went to a bar I never went and did drugs I never went partying and and and and and did all these all these bad things how can I still be so far from God because it doesn't matter that you come to church you every single day you could be in church every single day and that just means that you have nothing else to do because you're not you're not coming for the right reasons you're just coming just to fill up just to fill a pew you're still far from God I said I'm not like those people out there look there's they're way further from God than I am and God will show me are you are you serious I said well it's the way God deals with me sometimes that's the way that I hear hear hear hear hear and speak to me sometimes is when he says are you serious are you are you really are you really trying everything that you're that you're doing everything that you're going through are are you just are you just trying to find a way out and I said Lord I I'm not I'm not bad and God says you're still far you're still far you're still an ostrich can't go up to the you can't go up to the cliffs yet you gotta you've got to make your way to the cliffs he says but I'm going to provide you away I remember I was I was I was I was I was 14 when my mother passed away and for many years I I I took it out on God I said God I said I can't believe that you would do something this to me I can't believe that you would that you would hurt me so bad and my my mother had she had uh she had cancer she had she had passed away from cancer um and she had it I was I was seven years old when when we when she first got diagnosed with cancer and I said Lord I said I said I see so many so many people that are being healed I see I see so many people that are that that that didn't even know you that that didn't even come to church and I I see I see them I see them being healed off the street you know I saw that so many times in the ministry of my father when I was a kid that he would just be be outside he would yeah we would leave a service he would go down the street many people would just follow him and he was there for hours just praying for people on the streets and Miracle after miracle that I saw and and and and I said Lord why aren't you doing that in my life you know years years past and the Lord revealed a scripture to me that I would that I'll never forget that and that I had read hundreds of times and it's about the it's about the Hebrew children and when the when the when the Hebrew children are talking to the king they said yes we know that that if we don't bow that you're going to throw us into this fiery furnace he says the Lord or he says our God is able to save us we believe that but even if he doesn't he's still the same so when I look at that that sign says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever just because God does something for me doesn't make him greater just because God doesn't answer a prayer that you think should be answered it doesn't make him any less he's the same he doesn't he doesn't decrease or he doesn't increase because of what he's doing in your life he's the same when I read that scripture I said what faith that they had they said because they knew there was a possibility of death but they knew that there was a possibility of life as well and that they knew that either outcome was the same I'm going to say that to you one more time they knew that whatever outcome was at the end it had the same results because God Was the Same in their lives whether whether they died or whether they lived the results were the same and when I looked at that and I saw God in the scriptures speaking directly to my heart he said oh my goodness how how so many years I have wasted just just dwelling on my own self-pity not realizing yes the Lord took my mom but the Lord healed my mom and what greater thing to see and to understand is that when God takes someone what their what whatever physical ailment they went through God has healed them from that and when I begin to understand as a young man that is that is what God is doing I said okay Lord I'm ready to shed these ostrich wings I'm ready to get rid of these I'm ready to get rid of these wings I said Lord I'm ready to start flying he said well you can't fly yet you're just a little baby he says I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna show you how eagles take care of their babies he says when when they have the eggs they take them up into into a high place they build their nests high from everything from all the elements from any any predators and what they do is when as when is when the little the little eaglet starts coming out of its out of its shell the mother eagle start going and she'll start feeding him and as it grows and it's ready to take its flight the mother eel just doesn't throw This legal and out no she takes them on their on her back for a few test runs she says I want you to to fill the wind in your face I want you to I want you to experience how how the rain when it's coming down touches your beak I need you to experience that before I let you go and when you experience that when I experienced of what God has has for me then I realized okay it sure beats being on the ground because as as Malachi four five believers how many Malachi 4 5 believers do we have in here we have a few in here right we weren't made to be on the ground we were made to be up in the heavens to fly to fly in the heavens oh but when you're ready you might get nervous because that's your that's your that's your first flight your first solo flight you might get a little bit nervous but God says I'm I'm don't worry I'm right there you're gonna you're gonna get a little push you're going to be in the air he says but remember how you flapped those wings when you were when you were an ostrich and you thought you were so awesome but you couldn't you weren't going anywhere he says now you want to you want to do the same thing you want to start flapping those wings it's going to take you places it's going to take you to places that you've never even been before it's going to make it's going to make you look at your brother a little bit a little bit better why because you're not seeing your brother from a perspective of the ground you're seeing your brother in a different light your senior brother your brother from a different angle and when you see your brother and your sister from a different angle of what you used to see them before you start to appreciate what God is doing in their lives now I can understand brother Ed now I can understand brother Aaron what they've gone through not just from my perspective but when we look at somebody when we're up and up in the air we can look at them through God's eyes God's perspective and seeing okay man was I wrong about them man was I was I was I judging them so harshly so fiercely why was I even doing that what a what a great what a great man brother Ed is I never I know why because now we have a different mentality we have a different thought we have a different way to think we have a different way to view things not just in a natural sense but in a spiritual sense and when I when I was finally able to grasp that when I'm finally able to understand what God is doing and what the purpose of my life and what God wants me to do I finally realized of where I needed to be you know I I spoke in my father's service on Tuesday night and I spoke of a man that has so much love for his family so much love for his church so much love for his people and I was so grateful because when you see when you truly see the love that that someone genuinely shows you you're not seeing that person love you you're seeing the way that God loves you and that's what I was so grateful for is because in the beginning I didn't see it because I was trying to to view things in a natural way but when we really start looking at our our our brothers and and we start looking at each other and in in a different way in a different light you just see God all over them you see the love of God displayed from one human to another it's incredible what God can do just with you just as insignificant as you might think you are just as small as you might think you are this morning God doesn't see you that way God doesn't see you as nothing God doesn't see you as just just just uh just a blip on the radar no he sees you as his child he saw me as his child when I was unlovable when I was without hope without without without uh uh without a plan without without anything in my life he came down to me and he said you said that word you're supposed to be supposed to be up in the heavens with me and I thank God for that and I know that you this morning you do as well but this morning whatever your situation is whatever your condition is this morning God sees you there is not a place that God will not go to get you he sees you don't ever think for one minute that God doesn't see you he knows where you're at but he's waiting for something he's waiting for you to tell him Lord I need a change I need to change these wings I need to change my situation from being someone stuck on the ground to being in the heavens I'm going to ask you to stand this morning if you find yourself in that situation this morning even if you need just something just just a prayer this morning I'm going to ask you where you're at just to just to raise your hand if you found yourself and said Lord I'm I'm stuck I don't know where to go I'm stuck in this situation I I I just need I just need your help it's just he's just a prayer away we don't realize how close God is to us but he's but you just got to make that just oh just that effort just to break gravity a little bit and not worry about what your neighbor thinks not worry about what your husband or your wife thinks [Music] but said Lord [Music] I need you [Music] I need you in my life I need more of you each and every day there's not a day goes by father [Music] that I don't need you Lord I know that you've blessed me yesterday I know that you came down on you yesterday came down on Friday Lord [Music] on Saturday Lord but today it's a
