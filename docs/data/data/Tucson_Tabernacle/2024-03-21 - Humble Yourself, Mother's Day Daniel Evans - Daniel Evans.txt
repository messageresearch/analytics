and when I glanced at it I'm glad I read it twice [Music] because I read it and don't get this spread around but this is what I read that brother John Hall had passed away but it says brother John has two very important prayer requests and I'm glad that's all it is because when I first read it it shocked me for a moment then I read it again if we'll stand together you have a need a desire sometimes we raise our hands and maybe not something specific or intention but we just I'm raising my hand Lord I need you I need to hear from you Michelle let's just bow our hands Lord you've seen the hands raised in the hearts here each one represented and you know what it is maybe to one it would seem like just something real simple and Lord would you really be concerned about something like this it's just maybe it just seems real light and to others Lord there's some heavy burdens as my brother John Hall very important prayer request and some things that were saying Lord we're going to commit it completely to you I there's nothing I can do about it Lord but commit it to you and trust in you Lord would you bring comfort and peace Lord healing or healing to needed Lord answers to questions that they might have Lord that maybe it's troubling them Lord a mother a father Lord calling out as brother Ronnie said his mother was praying for him maybe they're praying for a loved one a son a daughter

come in relax and enjoy the Tucson Tabernacle we got some really good people here God bless you all and and welcome we had a uh we had a youth event um on Saturday or Friday night and uh it was really a blessing to me and maybe I got the most out of it but there was we had we had a bunch of um we had the younger ones here and and I surprised the kids with uh I rented a lamb like a real one and uh so so we I guess it was a sister Angela I guess it was a two-for-one offer so we got two Lambs that came and and the family they were uh kind of some Rancher type people the 4-H people so they they came in and and I was telling the story at the beginning because I wanted to surprise the kids and I wanted to make this lamb I wanted them to know what this meant so I was talking about the Book of Leviticus and how that when an offering was made that it had to be something had to give its life something had to pay for our sins it had to be something that was innocent that had no sin because you can't pay a bill if you don't have money in the bank and that's how that's that's I described it a little bit and I said so what would happen is this person that wanted to make a sacrifice he would take this defenseless lamb and he would put his head his face to the Lamb's face his head to the Lamb's head and he would say that I give my sins over to this little lamb and then because God required death for sin and then this um this little lamb the priest would take it and he would cut this Lamb's throat and this little lamb would die for the sins of this person that lied or that cheated or that stole and it's funny the little guy I don't know if they're here this morning are they it's a neat family the kids you know they were just um like farmer kids neat little kids uh probably shouldn't say this but I'm going to say it anyways the uh the the little the little guys look like you ever see the little kids in uh Mad Max a long time ago with the long hair and run around they look like that man they were just there's these these tough little guys and they came in they they were listening they were listening as I was as I was talking about this and I was talking about that that the sins of this man that that lied or cheated would come on upon this lamb and the little guy goes that's not fair and I was like huh you're getting it you're getting it that this lamb had to die for the sins of this man so then I went to to John chapter one and I said now there was John the Baptist who was a prophet of God and he's there in the Jordan River and he sees this man walking up to him and he looks at it he looks at this man and he says these words he says Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world and the little guy I noticed he looked at me and I asked the kids I said so what do you think happened to this man Jesus and I said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world and the little guy with the long hair he said they killed him he got it that simple little that simple little message he understood that this lamb that had no sin in the Old Testament they would sacrifice that and then Here Comes This one Jesus who had no sin and they he was killed for the sins of others and I told the little guy I said I said brother you know now you know more than 90 percent of Christians in the world that you understand that so we went out and and saw the Lambs uh remember their names and tinkle I think it was tinkle jelly and tinkle because tinkle tinkle lived up to his name yeah they're very cute so what was neat is these Lambs come out and they were big you think it's this little lamb you think of this little this little thing you know you always see pictures of Jesus and he's always holding a lamb and it's this little tiny thing well these were bigger and I was like I first saw him I was like well that's not a lamb that's a that's like a sheep well it was a lamb and it brought my mind back to Leviticus and it said that this lamb will be of one year old and without spot or blemish and I was so blessed I was looking I was saying okay this isn't how I had my picture this is this lamb right here is it's it's grown kind of and and as I was looking at it without spot or blemish I said I wonder I said did you have these in 4-H and then I don't know Sister Angela one of them said this is the Pima County champion so I thought wow here is this lamb that is about it and they said it was 11 months old so this lamb was the exact same age as the Lambs were that were brought to slaughter and this lamb was the Pima County Champion so it was without spotter blemish I got the chills thinking about it we thought they got them chills right now thinking about it so that was exactly the type of lamb that would have been offered for for the sins and it just it was it was blessed me it blessed me so much and I I thought about this lamb and I thought about how this lamb he's really defenseless he didn't have a way he couldn't the kids were messing with them and and he was just he was he was trying to kind of get away but he didn't have any defenses he couldn't kick he couldn't bite he couldn't couldn't do anything all he could do was kind of move away defenseless and I was thinking on that and I was thinking on that during the week and I just kind of thanking the lord over yesterday and and thinking about how that to give your life for something else and I thought about this is really this is this is the role of a mother a few years ago Stephanie and I were out walking and in Jeffersonville and we were we had this just a beautiful place by our house that was it was a park and it was a pretty Lake and trees everywhere and and we'd go out there and we'd walk and I saw this young lady she was maybe I don't know 30 years old or so pretty girl and she had a a baby it's about five or six years old maybe seven and this baby obviously was down syndrome and I looked at her and and I looked how much she loved that little baby that little boy and she put him on the swing and he'd swing and he'd laugh and he'd he'd come back he'd be like Mommy Mommy and he'd come running to his mom and she would she was sitting on the on the bench there and he'd go running and he was just having so much fun and it was in the middle of the day during the week and I thought it just touched me so much to see that mother and how much she loved that little boy that was her that was her whole life was this little kid and she he would he would run and she would show him how to do stuff and she'd let him in the water and he'd he'd kick the water and come back and I thought I thought Lord how beautiful it is for this this little mother and that child the bond that they have and I thought I even told my wife I said I said honey I said I said that's me I said that little boy I said I I feel like I can't do anything I feel like I'm just I'm just so dependent on on on my father you know he's my father my mother my sister my brother and and I was just I just as I was seeing that love I just saw thought how beautiful that is that Bond I was talking to a brother the other day and his son is uh handicapped and and um he was telling me he said he says you know he says we're just waiting for the Lord to heal him and I said brother I said wait a minute I said you're trying to put your son in this box that you've created I said he's a happy young man I said he's he's got a good life and he goes through life and he's got a lot of Joy I said would you want and it may be the Lord may want to change him I said but but would you would you want to change something that God has said and set forward and try to judge it according to your judgments I said maybe the Lord wants him like that to save him for all the nonsense and garbage that we go through all the stuff that we have to live with yeah and you know he said he said well brother I said I never I never thought about that Abraham Lincoln he said this he said The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is the hand that rules the world even Abraham Lincoln way back there he saw the importance of a mother and motherhood in in our society and the influence there's no one that influences a child more than a mother he said this also he said all that I am or that I ever hoped to be I owe to my angel mother now if you know Abraham Lincoln's story this Angel mother he's talking about died when he was nine years old she made such an influence on his life in those nine years that he says he says everything that I ever was everything that I hope to be and this is a man that changed the world one of the greatest greatest men that have ever walked the Earth Abraham Lincoln one of the most Gallant men and he said that everything that I am I owe to my angel mother who did this before I was nine years old influenced me so much and then so after this lady this mother died there was another um Abraham Lincoln's dad married another woman a couple years later and and she says this her name is Sarah Lincoln she said this she said Abe was the best boy I ever saw this is his stepmother she says this she said this when Abraham Lincoln was assassinated after he died Abe was the best boy I ever saw I can say what scarcely one woman a mother can say in a thousand and it and it is this Abe never gave me a crossword or even he never gave me a crossword or a look or never even refused in fact or even an appearance to do anything that I ever requested of him he said he never told me a lie in his life he never evaded never equivocated and never dodged and then that man says I owe everything to my angel mother wow you think of the influence that our our moms have and a mother is one that she's willing to sacrifice everything for her babies and it's just inner you know for for for many of us it's a lot more difficult to do that I was I was saying that I was going to give the testimony of what happened last week at Jericho Tabernacle and and it it was a it was a failure on my part to to do what what so many mothers that I say that I'm just talking about right now that they do which is just sacrifice everything now there's there's a few people here that were at that that service last week so I got up there and and I was ministering and it started okay and then I got down to a scripture that I really wanted to minister on and and I started reading this scripture and and I read a quote and and there was something that just wasn't right it was something that wrong that was wrong and I was just trying to I was just trying to push and and the problem was there was no anointing there there was no God wasn't with me and it really it scared me so I said well Lord I can just push on whatever would I do so I just stopped in the middle of the service and I said I said there's something wrong I said I said friends I said and something on the order of I don't know if I've grieved the spirit or or what's going on but I just don't feel the Lord's pleased or he wants me to go in this direction so I bowed my head and I said let's pray and we prayed and I said Lord if I've done something but I just asked that you'd forgive and that that you would take control now and sometimes we have to stop if we've been wrong you know the old saying is is when you've when you realize Heath you've dug yourself a hole what's the first thing you do stop digging and that's how as as I stopped and I said okay Lord I'm sorry and we prayed and then after I said amen something happened there was a strength that just came down and immediately just started ministering from that point so so we were the the the service and what was so strange is is I was ministering brother Jeremy you were there I was ministering on the scriptures that I had read earlier but earlier there was no anointing God wasn't with me but now he was there and things started changing and things started moving forward so we finished and it was just it was it was a wonderful service people were standing and and then I left and I went in the back and I went to the ministers area and I got down on my knees or maybe I leaned up against the the desk and I started weeping started just just crying to the Lord and then the brother that that was with me that was the translator he started weeping and and we were just the spirit of the Lord was there and and I and I just said I said Lord sorry I'm sorry that that failed you and I'm sorry that that I I did this and in my mind I said Lord thank you for being there but I just embarrassed me I I feel bad for what I did I feel like I got up there and and I just it did it didn't look good then the question came down to me now it may have been just my mind thinking it I don't know what it was but that question came into my mind and said oh so it's about you huh oh no Lord it's all about you and I'm sorry for even even thinking that and I remember thinking if I have to jump up and down and do jumping jacks and stand on my head to get the people to recognize the Lord Jesus I'll do it if I have to make a complete fool in myself I'll do it and I was thinking this and then the door opens up now this is just within a minute or two after I left the pulpit the door opens up and here comes this young man and he is bawling crying I assume he was some sort of an official in the church because he was able to get in the back and he was just crying and he says brother he says he says I need to be prayed for I got to get rid of these feelings that I have and he was he was struggling with something that not not something that was unclean but just a a weakness that he had so we prayed and he was just weeping and and he left and another one came in and and he was he he was asking Lord I just brother can you pray for me we prayed and then one of the deacons comes in brother Daniel you need to get out into the congregation you need to get back out there walk out there and ever there was the the the uh platform the the the um the altar was packed with people just crying out to the Lord and worshiping and I thought oh Lord this is this is just beautiful and people were coming up they were praying we were praying for the people and it was just it was just a tremendous experience but it took having me having them what I said having to make a fool of myself but I'm admitting it and saying Lord I was wrong and then the Holy Spirit was free to move and I think that is the that is the trait of a mother and how mothers they don't care they are going to you see these Mama Bear moms they're going to protect that baby no matter what you know every every mama bear as I've always said thanks every thinks her baby's the blackest you know they they all think that that they're the the best baby in the world my kids are so as this mothers as these mothers go through we see some just tremendous mothers in the Bible there was a lady that we all know about is very famous her name's Hannah and Hannah she had a desire to have a child in first Samuel chapter one she had a desire to have a child and she wanted this child so badly it was just everything that that she could that that she could be a mom and she had a husband not much is said about this husband but I want to talk about this man for a minute his name was Elkin and elkina was a good husband he was a great man so she would she would go with her husband to worship and then the the there would be people that would make fun of Hannah put her down and this elkana he was he was so honored that she was his wife she he would bring her with them and and he would just he just felt so bad for that she couldn't have children and he said he said this he said he said honey he says am I not better than ten Sons won't you love me just trying to comfort his little wife the sweetest sweetest thing but Hannah she she still was steadfast let's turn I want to read to you about how we should act as families let's turn to Ephesians chapter 5. verse 21. says this Paul is addressing the family unit here he says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God he says wives submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body how much the husband love his wife he's comparing this relationship of a man and a woman between Christ and the church how much do we rely on Christ and how much should our how much should the dads and the husbands how much should they represent Christ to the family therefore as the church is subject under under Christ so let the wives be unto their own husbands in everything when he says everything there's no other translations it means everything husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word look at how Paul here is showing the nucleus the the nuclear family the mom and the dad and the children and he's saying put this word first in your family and you husbands you husbands you act like Christ to your family you love them like Christ love the church how many times have we got on our knees and said Lord help me so how much should that husband in the family that father how should he act how he should he should represent the Lord to the family and just do anything that he can we should have it says washing of the Water by the word we should have in our families we should put the word sinner in the middle studying the Bible as a family teaching our children these Bible stories and telling them about it the love of Jesus and telling them about these Heroes of old so that this word won't depart from them later on it'll come back I promise you that he might present it to himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so what men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself the husband and the wife are perfectly one for no man ever yet hated his own flesh but nourishes it and cherished it even as the Lord the church for we are members of his body of his and of his flesh and of his bone for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband Paul here he's commanding us to love each other as Christ has that relationship with the church he's saying that that this family is a reflection of the relationship between Christ and us so if this family if there's something wrong here we need to get it right we need to we need to love and and have this unity and it doesn't say it does not say here that well if she's Worthy or if he's worthy he said do it I'll go to uh First Peter chapter three this will answer those questions First Peter chapter 3 verse 1 says likewise you wives being subject to your own husbands that if if any obey not the word they also May without the word be won by the conversation of the wives so so he's saying here that that you can be such an example you can love your husband or your wife so much that they're going to be one to Christ just because of the way that you treat them well they behold your Chase conversation coupled with fear English Standard Version says this when they see your respectful and pure conduct verse 7 . likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife as under the weaker vessel and as being heirs together of the grace of life that's your prayers be not hindered look how important again that relationship is with the husband and the wife that it's not if if there's a if you're doing your wife wrong if you're not acting like your husband if you're not representing the lord well your prayers your very conversations with God are hindered so if if there's a if there's a dispute in the family or if there's there's some sort of of conflict our prayers are hindered you can't get around the family unit it's very very important the cohesiveness of the that nuclear family the mom and the dad back to Hannah and elkanah Hannah goes to the Altar and she was praying and she wasn't even saying anything out loud she was just moving her lips so the priest there Eli he looks down and he thinks that she's drunk or he thinks that there's something wrong and and he rebukes her and he says what's what's the matter with you you're drinking wine or whatever and she says no she says I'm just praying I just I just I just have something on my heart and as she was praying it's very important she said she said Lord if you will give me this child I will give it back to you I'll dedicate it back to you so then later on God hears Hannah's Hannah's Prayer and he gives her this child and she made the commitment to give this child his name is Samuel one of the greatest prophets in the whole book she made the commitment that once he has weaned that I'm going to give him to the temple I'm going to give him to the Lord's service so just this short amount of time that mom had with this baby that was that time that she had to build his character into this great man of God and she did it she she accomplished that goal and like I said he became the greatest one of the greatest of all the prophets because of the influence of Hannah just when he was just a little baby remember remember Abraham Lincoln until nine years old and his mom teaching him we have a another lady of course named jacobed Moses's mom they were the situation was they were killing all of the children that Pharaoh was he wanted to wipe out all of these Hebrews because there were too many of them they were they could raise up an Army against him so he started killing all the all the boys and they would take these midwives these evil women would would take these these babies and they'd kill them and throw them out in the river and and it was just it was a terrible time and here is this jock a bed with her little baby and she doesn't know what to do they come by knocking on the doors searching the house I heard you have a child and you know the women who try to hide them they take the babies they kill them so what she did she goes and and of course they were I'm sure they were praying all the time jacobit takes and she builds this little basket and makes it to where it's waterproof and she takes her baby and she puts that baby into this basket closes it up and puts it out into the Nile River trusting God trusting the Lord that he'll take care of this baby I see so many mothers today and so many fathers and how we we pray for our children we should that home that family should always be a place that they feel welcome so jockey bed takes this baby and she puts them out into the into the river trusting God and that's how what we do we dedicate these children to the lord it's the best that we can do we say Lord I'm going to do the best that I can until I can't do any more and I'll give this baby to you and I just pray Lord that you take care of it and it did and and Pharaoh's daughter picks it up out of the river and starts raising it and then as you know you know the story Miriam was going on and and she says hey I know somebody that can nurse the baby so they give the baby back to the mother and she had just a short amount of time again she didn't waste any time Hannah back to Hannah as she was nursing this baby as she was taking care of this baby her own baby before she gave it to the priests she wouldn't even go worship she wouldn't she wouldn't go with to make the sacrifices with her husband she wanted to spend every moment with this baby because the time was limited and here's Djokovic she's doing the same thing she's spending every moment this baby Moses it's strange to me the two of the greatest prophets that have ever lived Samuel and Moses it talks about their mothers and how important mom was so Moses grows up as you know and delivers Egypt who delivers the Hebrews from Egypt then we see in Jesus's time we see that there's there's a lady that that came to the Lord she was a Canaanite she wasn't even a Hebrew she comes she comes to to Jesus and she bows down and she says Lord she says Thou son of David she says my daughter has a demon my daughter is suffering and it may be something like schizophrenia or maybe something like drug addiction and maybe maybe it could be a million different things but there was a demon that was that was hurting this her little girl and she comes to this man who she she knew about him she comes to Jesus and she says she says son of David she says my my daughter Jesus ignored her foreign about someone that's willing to make a fool of themselves for their daughter Jesus ignored her and she stayed on and the disciples like get out of here we don't we don't need you here and Jesus Jesus says yeah you go he's he says I'm not sent to you people did not matter to her she was willing to make a fool of herself she says Lord but I need you and he looks down at her again and he says you know what he says it's not right for dogs like you to come in here and to be with us what would you have done how dare you but she had her daughter first she makes this statement she says Lord but still the dogs can get the crumbs from the master table master's table humbled herself again and then Jesus looks down at her he's as great as your faith great is your faith he says this moment your daughter is made well what if she wouldn't have done it what if she wouldn't have brought her problems to the Lord you know it's it was everything to her this little baby I remember remember my mom you know I all of us we love we love our moms I remember Mom would we didn't have there's we had times of Plenty and then we had times of very very little and I remember that uh I like to play when I was I like to play marbles with the kids at school and uh I um you know I'd save up my money and I get my marbles but I didn't have anything to put it in put them in and Mom she uh she took an old pair of jeans that I had and she sewed she she sewed up the the bottom and she made a she made a little uh drawstring around the top and put a shoelace in there to where I could I could put my marbles in there and I could close up the bag and and I was like I had the coolest marble bag in the whole school because my mom she loved me and I said I liked maybe I shouldn't mention marbles it's kind of like gambling for kids but uh sorry I have to I want to get emotional but she loved me and I remember I remember one time I was this kid that I always wanted people to like me and then I was kind of a maybe not in the popular crowd when I was little and and it was kind of I guess it just wasn't attractive to the girls and I wanted I wanted to I wanted the girls to like me you know and just like everybody does we're all human beings and I felt so so so bad and and I remember I had a notebook that I used to go to school in my backpack and and I took my backpack out I took my notebook out and I was in class and and I looked on the front of the notebook and all the other kids when they had girlfriends and stuff they'd write little notes to each other in the notebook well I looked on my notebook and there was this heart and it said I love you I was like it was in girls handwriting and I set that Notebook on the corner of my my desk you know and and and I was proud and even to my friends like that's not your handwriting I was like nope I didn't tell them it was my mom but but I think that that you know with all with all the everything that was going on in all school and everything that that you know I wasn't I wasn't anything special but I had a mom that thought I was special I had a mom that loved me more than anything in the world and and she always made it to where I felt like I was important and I just I think back about about the times growing up and and how many times when I got older unfortunately I got more popular as I got older bad I'm not I'm not uh and uh remember staying out late and coming home and seeing my mom with the swollen eyes and and seeing her they were waiting for me and she'd been crying and praying for me her Wayward Son and I wish I could take all of that back I wish I would never have done anything like that to her she loved me but I did but she was there for me no matter what no matter how bad of a kid I was or how much I disrespect her mom was always there Isaiah 66 says one as one who a mother comforts so will I comfort you the Lord speaking how much how much do our mothers comfort her but then Comfort us but we see that that God is so much even greater than a mother and now I look back and all the mistakes that I've made and and how the what I put my mom through the anxiety and everything I did the same to the Lord Jesus and how much greater is the Lord than Mom how much more does he love us the the Bible says it says I as he says a woman can forget her suckling child but I could never forget you that's how much that's how important our lord Jesus is and how much he loves us and he's there and I never ever want to hurt him again how many times have I have I failed him but but even as I fail them on third on Saturday last week even as I failed him he was still there and I was like Lord I'll make a fool of myself I don't care Oh do whatever you want to lift you up Paul said we are fools for Christ and we should be we should be willing no matter what it takes I will stand for that man I'll stand for that man that died on the cross oh Lord whatever you require I wanna I Wanna Be There I want to stand I want to stand for you or see of course I think it's she's probably the most special lady in the whole Bible is this young lady named Mary and what Mary went through she was she was obviously a good girl we don't know much about her we just we know her lineage but we don't know much about this this young lady and this Angel comes to her and says that you're going to have this child and all that she suffered the rumors that went around her that that not that she had an affair and got pregnant but that she had an affair with a heathen and got pregnant the rumors went around that that she slept with this Roman soldier and and and that dogged her her whole life even as Jesus was growing up it was with her but she stood for God and as he was growing up I'm sure Mom was so proud of her little Jesus how that he was just this the best kid that you could ever have I think about how this Abraham Lincoln's stepmom how proud she was of Abraham Lincoln and how proud that Abraham Lincoln's mother must have been and and the the influence that she had on him Jesus made Abraham Lincoln look like the most vile sinner that's ever lived growing up and her being just so proud of this this kid and loving him and and and raising him up and the bond that Jesus must have had with his mom is just he never failed her you know he never did something wrong I was thinking about that this morning and last night as I was laying in bed I was like oh that's the one I want to be like this man that never failed this man that that she is a mom that that she could always count on him so if uh it's just a little if you'd come get ready to close and the musicians thinking about this man Jesus and and as he grew up and and she saw him up there preaching and all the sick people would come in and she saw him heal every single one she saw him stand before the Pharisees and the Sadducees and preached the gospel standing up up against everyone a real man the most perfect man that had ever lived and then she as things go on she sees them right into Jerusalem on this donkey and the people singing Hosanna and throwing their clothes their coats in front of the donkeys about how blessed this man is coming in and then all of a sudden he's betrayed him he's taken imagine Mary imagine you know thinking about how much our moms worry about us and think about us imagine she felt the same thing about her son and here he is carrying this cross and she was there she saw him walk by and she was with these these sisters and they're weeping and then he goes up and he he's nailed to this cross and he's lifted up in front of the people and there is her little baby there is her little baby that she loves so much and there he is suffering embarrassed he's up there and is the most beautiful thing in the world you want to see the relationship between a mom and a baby and a young and her child Jesus is up nailed to the cross and he looks down and he sees married his mom down there [Music] and he's up there and he sees his buddy John he looks over and he says basically says John take care of my mom he says take care of my mom he says he says mother behold your son son behold your mother take care of her and from that moment on the Bible says that he treated like her like his own mom and he took care of her the one disciple the one person that was never killed for his beliefs of all the disciples it was John that lived to be an old man and he was always there no matter how long Mary lived that man was there to take care of her how important was Jesus's mother I'm not saying that that's the only reason that John lived so long but it's a reason so he's up there and he had just said as he's on the cross the day before he had just said that if I don't go then this Holy Spirit this comforter he's not going to come down to you and there he is with his mother and he's there and on the cross and he's and he sees her crying and and it's like he didn't say this but Mom if I don't go you're gonna go to hell so is everybody else now look how the rolls switched now who's taking care of who there's Jesus up there and he's looking down and he sees his mom and he's if it was just Mary he'd have done it Keith it was just you bro you'd have done it if it was any of us he would have done it but he's there and he's on the cross and he gives up by his own choosing gives up his life so that not only his mom but that all of us could be saved there's all these mothers in this room and and I don't believe that any of of you all love your children any less than Mary loved her babies her son Jesus and the love of a mother I just think is so so beautiful and it just it touched me so much to see that young lady and her child and how much she loved him just taking care of him and and watching over him and just seeing the joy and him running around I wouldn't change that child for nothing [Music] he was a good boy and he was just so happy love the Lord I don't know if he loved the Lord but I know the Lord loved him give him a mom like that think about [Music] think about that lamb on Saturday and it wasn't their fault like the little boy said it wasn't his fault But Here Comes the sins upon that little animal [Music] for our sins greater than the love of a mother and here comes the Lamb of God as the Book of John says and he says oh this is all of it all the way from Genesis when Abel was making sacrifices at the altar the very first people that lived making sacrifices here all the way back and then through Leviticus and Moses and all of them they'd come down through this is the Fulfillment he says Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world and from that moment on it was over and if we could just accept that Lamb of God if we could just accept a love that's far greater a love for me personally that's far greater than my mom ever loved me is that love that Christ has for me friends it's it's beyond measure I love him do you love him a there's nothing we could ever do that would warrant what he did for us but we can do our best we can thank him I would never [Music] I'd never forsake my mom you know I would never say I don't know that lady I don't I don't want to be any part of that woman um I would never do that to my mom neither would you [Music] but yet it's so easy to do it to our Lord [Music] let's make sure brothers and sisters make sure that we're putting the Lord Jesus in the place that he should be in our lives this Mother's Day you don't have to can if you want you don't have to come to the altar the Lord knows [Music] dedicated the one that was up there that that died that said that if I go not if I'd not killed if I don't die then you can't receive the same spirit that you can't even be saved if I don't go to the cross I'll go to the cross for my kids of course every mother would go to the cross for their kids but he went to the cross for all of us everyone so let's dedicate Our Lives friends let's dedicate Our Lives to the one that is worthy we do that we think about him do we have some folks that would like to be baptized if you could um sister Guerra if you could if you could there's there's some sisters if the brother if the sisters could go with

life rededicate your life to the Lord today this is the day you may never get another chance I see those Souls going back there it is it is so important and just think I remember when the change came
