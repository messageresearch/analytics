portal here will be glorious I do declare for God's own son will be little time that meeting Amen at that first part of the last verse up for the Jeremy where the doubters will be missing altogether had someone talking to me earlier this week and made a comment about the number of firefighters up on the mountain fighting the fire he said I heard there was 900 firefighters but I don't know if that's true or not I thought and we've really gotten to a place in our society where we can't even trust the facts anymore we're just we question everything we're not sure what's right I mean it's not anything you know it's just the way we've gotten as a society is amazing something as factual as the number of something we can't even know if we're right on you know we've done that that point where we get to the doubters and then there's the grumblers you know it's hard sometimes I take criticism pretty hard come and say something to me I kind of take it a bit hard the Denis McGarry he told me a while back a lot about a month ago he said you know you shouldn't let anything that anybody criticize you stop you from doing what's right started thinking about that I said I guess that's true I should shouldn't let that bother me so much but there will be no grumblers and there'll be no doubters right all be believers we'll all be thankful will be all grateful and just appreciative what God's done in our lives amen amen want to believe him amen amen you just want to play only believe all things are possible just have a few requests turned in this evening ask brother Baggett if you would just come this evening just talk to the Lord on our behalf to pray with him as he leads us in prayer that lord meet every need amen prayer request prayer prayer from brother Aaron Guetta he said her for my sister-in-law Elizabeth get it asks prayer concerning her job status her boss quit and Elizabeth does not know if her job is safe remember that request in prayer no I had a phrase along this line I was thinking about giving this evening and I didn't even see this note here until I just read it to you all so I guess I'll give lord praise for this you can take care of every job and no back in the beginning of this whole time we've been in idle a our whole team off hourly people in the next day they laid officially laid all of us leadership off and they came back to a few of us so we'll give you a base salary for rolling 30 days until we know kind of where we're at so the Lord's provided the last few months haven't had to worry about too much even with attempting to sell the other house having two mortgages and everything the Lord's provided our needs that's what he promises he'll provide our needs had heaven kerime if some people came over the house about a month and a half two months ago for dinner after just came for dinner or just time of fellowship after a Sunday morning service Kevin Carey and brother Matthew Paden were there we got to talking about government jobs I went looked online at the USA gov John or whatever it is started looking at him and out of all the jobs you know you can filter different departments and so I just kind of filtered it all down to the departments I thought would be interesting to work I've done this many number of times throughout the years never really found anything that was either I thought I qualified for was something that would be a match there's this one job out of like 37 jobs that I kind of narrowed down to you that just the description job description I felt like it's really a perfect match well I could apply but I don't know they don't work for the government for the rest of my life or whatever you know I applied the last few hours that the job was open kind of forgot about it it's really the only job I probably took serious as far as a job that would be more significant I got a part-time job during all of this working in Office Depot but hadn't really done anything beyond that just felt like the Lord is providing her needs busy with a lot of things so it never really we took a road recive approach to it anyway a few weeks ago they reached out to me for an interview and so I did the first interview in the second interview and they said I wasn't the final final steps and they there's a few little issues with different things with the homeschooling part but they gave me a job offer today about eight thousand nine thousand dollars more than I had asked for so accept it this afternoon and so we'll just see where the Lord takes it but you know for the federal courthouse here in Tucson and I think you know the Lord has his his hand in everything and for not really probably saying giving it much thought about exactly where to go you know maybe not worrying about it like I probably maybe should or take serious responsibility I don't want to say that I didn't have any driver motivation but I felt like the Lord was providing our needs and I didn't have a clear direction but just to just go right into something like that the Lord Lord can guide the foot steps for each one he knows what we have need of it will just guide us through every situation so I just want to praise the Lord for that and thanks brother Aaron said that a lot o brothers the ones that come from wmo their grandma passed away I guess this week I just want to remember them to prayer also sister Yarborough sent me a request right before service to pull this up have it up here she said request here she said sister Jill mcGarry's father in law which for the Bobby McGarry or the Bobby just have lost his life sorry no the Bobby mcGarry's wife just passed on just of heart failure but this is brother Robert mcGarry's dad he is in the hospital with kovat they say he has pneumonia as well or the Robert is also where the Robert also has Co bed has been sick for over a week he's staying in his father's house when the Robert is and sister Jill is taking care of Jeffrey so they're hoping that Jeffrey doesn't get the virus just ask that we pray for the Lord's the will the mind protection and healing so let's just remember that request prayer and I know there's a number of other people think up there I think my brother-in-law might have gotten it as well as my sister-in-law so remember the ones the Saints around that may be dealing with different ones we've got sickness with the Lord can protect us from everything amen and keep us from all things I just want to get one other praise a friend I've mentioned to a few people disappear a few weeks ago and he was found or came back he's a black gentleman and like just all the things going on the unrest just kind of got gotten to him and he just decided to go off grid kind of regretted not telling his mom I had about two and a half hour long conversation with them today it was just good to be able to talk to him and just know that something didn't happen to him that was bad or what girl or just kept him through that and brought into a new place spiritually he just feels like he's closer to the Lord as a result of just this time of ways I just wanted to thank the Lord for that publicly because I know I'd mention it to a few people and just was praying for him let's just stand this evening let's thing only believe is bag.even coming speak to the Lord for us yes only me whoa leave me all things are possible [Music] Oh [Music]

are so it's good to be part of the family God how many appreciate you today to be part of the family components as just our heads for a moment we thank you Lord that today for others is a day that you

wherever they might be we thank you for them more than one of these days this which we see through a mirror today one of these days we showing me holy Lord and it won't be long come and speak to our hearts Lord that our hearts rejoice in your presence today nor to be asking Jesus Christ amen while you're standing let's just read that first scripture in Ephesians where in Ephesians 3:14 and 15 this evening if I would have title this tonight I would say seen yourself through God's eyes seeing what the Word of God says about you and taking for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named Amen you put yourself in it amen praise God you may be seated self from whom the whole family in heaven and earth isn't brother Matt asked me with him at Watkins to announce that he would be here with us this coming weekend brother Darrell Ward has felt that he should stay away a little little longer just to be safe though with a possibility that sister Rachel would come with him he wasn't sure if that was gonna work but he was planning to be here spoke with brother Dennis for a few minutes on Monday made it home safely and I asked him how did it go home he said it was good I I went to the car and my wife was getting in the back seat and I said no you're driving and I'm going in the back seat he said I fell asleep and when I woke up we were all yeah I remember one time coming home when the girls were young and those have you been and while remember the fellowship meetings if they would have here and then Phoenix and Flagstaff and one in Flagstaff was usually at the end of July early August we all decided to go up there one time when the girls were little we left early about 6:00 in the morning and we went through Sedona and did that if that whole trip up there and I drove all the way up there and then we had this service at 2:00 and then finished around 4:30 and maybe five o'clock and they invited us out to eat so we all went out tweets it was about 7:00 when we started heading home and in those younger days that wasn't too hard to do so we drove the the girls pretty well all fell asleep and eventually my wife did too and we're driving home and we were just about home we were about Red Rock or so maybe Picacho Peak hitting home and I decided to wake her up I said honey start waking yourself up I'm getting really really tired you're gonna have to finish the drive home we had a past Pinal park and the next exit was ours Marana I said so we're stopping at the next exit you'll take the car from there so she's wiping her eyes and she's trying to wake up we pull into the Marana Road exit she wakes up she started looking around and she looks at me says we're home she goes that wasn't very nice of you today I think I would have done that way back there somewhere thank the Lord that we were able to do those things brother Dennis enjoyed himself and we enjoyed having brother Dennis daily I believe it was a blessing to us so the Lord is good to herself this evening and I I I went back and revisited something I spoke here nine years ago back in May and I had had it found a little it was there I was actually at the dump throwing some stuff away and I kicked a box out of the way and all these invitations fell out they look like wedding invitations or something like that so I picked it up one up and I thought I'd read it to see what it was you know and when I opened it up this is what it said if I could give you one thing in life I would give you the ability to your see yourself through my eyes only then you would realize how special you are to me and I thought boy that was some nice words somebody wrote for somebody else but I said Oh Lord opened my eyes and let me see what you see in me how you think of me and I saw I could understand in them that is sort of the thought and I remembered that and I was looking at some of those things and I just said you know when we look to the Word of God and we can see ourselves in it we are looking through God's eyes because he took and he wrote ahead and written down so you and I could see ourselves and you know when you look into the mirror of God's Word what are you supposed to look at are you trying to see yourself if you look in the mirror of God's Word and all you see is yourself there's a problem there but you have to see what God says about you and begin to look at that so two of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named mrs. Jesus Christ you know it's sometimes you get a little bit you start your wondering isn't really am I ever going to come to that image that maybe an image that you've formulated yourself when I become a that good Christian this is going to be like this and this is a I'll never have a problem like that all you know and you get disappointed in yourself but you can go back and you can see some of the scriptures and you can encourage yourself by the Word of God because the Word of God is true it never fails you know it is better to believe what God says about you than what you know about yourself because what you know about yourself can disappoint you quite often but God's Word never fails so in st. John chapter 16 we'll look at verses 26 and 27 and and here's your Jesus is speaking to his disciples he says and that that day you shall ask in my name and I say not unto you that I will pray the Father for you for the father himself loveth you you know was easy for the disciple standing there well your Jesus you know you're the one he's promised well yes of course the father has you and eternally says you're going to be able to talk to the father just the way I talk to the father because he's your father he says for the father himself love with you because he have loved me and believed that I came out from God and as he was the first the wave sheaf the first then all his other children followed the same way as part of the the children of God st. John 17 we'll look at three verses there 10 22 and 23 and the word of God again does not return void it'll accomplish what God said it will do it never fails and he says and all mine are thine and this is in Jesus Prayer and thine are my and I am glorified in them so who's he speaking of my name is there Amen in the next two verses - and the glory which thou gave a--the me I have given them that they may be one even as we are one I and them and thou in me that they may be may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me amen that's the Word of God is telling us what he thinks of us I was looking at a couple of things that brother Branham said here and we'll share a couple of these quotes with you and we'll start with letting off the pressure and sometimes you you you find one and another and then next thing 45 minutes or an hour has gone by and you've just just just been reading and say my he said look at that look at that and you have just say okay I've got 40 of them how do I cut it down to two or three yeah they're all good he says I'm only trying to represent him reflect him like in a mirror - you making my life his mirror that he might reflect himself so when you're looking into the mirror of god you should see Christ in that mirror because he's reflecting himself through you and he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the stature of a perfect man you know in the old time when they used to make gold before they had this smelter to burn it out they used to beat the gold out beat the sludge out the iron and the copper and stuff out and just keep beating and turn it over and beating it the Indians do that now beating the gold and they beat it you know how they could tell all the iron was out of it and all the dirt and stuff and the dross was out of it when the one that was beating could see his own reflection like a mirror in it it was clean and clear through til it reflected the beater now you and I aren't and this earth to beat one another God does that work God is the one who wants to see himself reflected in you you know I'm not it's not the job for the minister the husband or the wife or whoever it is to beat the other one to try to say this is what I want you to be but God himself you know the things in your life that he is ordained and you say well you know God wanted me to do this and I went this way and I did this way God knew that it doesn't surprise him it's all part of the process that he works through in your life and and you know sometimes that process for one maybe one day and that prophets were processed for another maybe six months but God is going to accomplish what he said he would the reflection of the beader is what we're looking for there and then identification I believe is the next one in 63 we all remember this one this little lad must have been raised in such a home and when he came down to visit his grandmother he was talking about the old houses that they might have had a little piece of mirror and you know he talks brother Brahim talks about when he was shaving and watch his dad shave with just a little piece of glass hanging off the tree you know not a full-length mirror or nothing like that you know and he came down to visit his grandmother she had a door on the back side of it was a mirror and the little ad was kind of lonesome and he was looking all around the house and after a bit he happened to look through the door and it had been closed since they come in and and in the mirror on his side he saw a little boy and he started to the little boy and to make friends with him and we began to look into the glass he got up close and he turned around he said why that's me I want to be able to come to that day one say why God that's me that that's me I've been beat I've been the shape I'm beginning to look like what God wanted what God saw in me when he looked over and he said Abraham my friend I'm gonna go down and talk with him and be with him when he went down as a fourth man with the three Hebrew children they had gone through all they had and they were beginning where God desired that fellowship because they were looking more and more like him he says why mama that's me and that's what we want to look at tonight I want to look at me and I want you to look at yourself and as we look into God's great mirror of his word let's let's be able to identify ourselves what was some that we're going to speak about some of the characters of other times you know when we look at the scripture sometimes we look at him saying well yeah well they were godly men they they had this they had that well that's the same about you if another book of Acts is gonna be written what's it going to be written like just like the godly men in this book it doesn't change he says be able to identify ourselves with something that we're going to speak about some of the characters of other times and I want to see myself in God's looking-glass because if anything will show you where you're standing it's this book there is no book like it because it tells the truth I don't say that other books are not true but I know this one is true it's all truth because it's a Word of God now Jesus gave us the example of what we ought to be looking at when he reflected his life to us through the word that we should see when we when we look into God's mirror we should see ourselves identified with him that is a perfect example you know an American light to you you know you you say some of these mirrors they're slightly distorted and you're trying to see it this way and you're trying to see it that way but God's mirror is pure perfect and true no distortion in it at all no no fate or anything back to it or anything like that I laughing and you'll laugh with this one there was a lady standing in front of the mirror and she was kind of bullying and just she was all upset and and this other this gentleman walks up to her and maybe he wasn't a gentleman after you hear this but he comes up and he says ma'am why are you crying and she says look that mirror makes me look fat and he being a nice guy said well then my eyes have the same problem you know okay now this is going to this is going to drive a point when you look at it in the natural sometimes that'll deceive you when you take and you look at it through your own perspective collison there are some distortions and you begin to question did it really mean that is it really saying that but when you look at it through what God's Word says it is true and if you fall short of it then you can say Lord then I know this is where I need to I need some more work Lord I surrender do some more work in me you know we say give me patience Lord and could I have it now yeah no patience is overtime patience goes on so he said that is the perfect example God's Word I think we have one or two more there identification then what an example how would our life reflect to his and he made the example of what we should do how we should be we should see him when you look in the mirror and the problem is we see ourselves and we get disappointed but let's look at what God said you know I look at this and I've thought of this many times we look through the the New Testament and the Old Testament the in the Old Testament the actual account of the lives of men like Abraham and and David and Samson and Gideon and some of them and we would say wow you know Gideon he was a good man but he tried the Lord he kept saying you know let me put a fleece before you in the Lord too Kate and he were doing let me try another one you know and and God would do it again anyways and and Abraham lied to the king about his wife David we know the life of David and the many of me says you know we would look at them he would say how can they be but then you go to the New Testament and in de Hebrews and you see God's account of them by faith he staggered not at the promise of God and you go well then what was that that looked like a stagger to me but God said he staggered not God looked me on the outter and looked down into the heart the heart the desire to be like Christ the pool the desire when when others said ah this is close enough this is good enough you know that c-average is good enough when God said no it would be hole complete it would be perfect he said we should see him when you look in the mirror see Christ the mirror of his word he says how that he did that for love when you realize that everything God has done had a love motive behind it that's how God works and then I think at the last one exposition or or we have one more for identification there and let them and let it be born again and a new nature come in that's the only way kill the nature of yourself that you might be coming and then the word becomes a living thing it expresses itself through you see then you're looking in the looking-glass when people sees you as a mirror when people begin to see Christ in you he says because you know God has made a way people don't read the Bible so God has made you a Bible you are what you do people is looking at you and and you know they can say if there's a Christian and when you say you're a Christian when somebody says you're a Christian what are they saying you're a follower of Christ you know that's the true definition of a Christian a follower of Christ if you say you're a Muslim nobody says oh they follow Jesus Christ if you say oh I'm Buddha they say oh you follow Jesus Christ no that has a whole different represent but if they say you are a Christian you're a follower of Christ you're identified with Christ and it made me think because I've heard the term oh they're Branagh mites and you know what I'm not a Brahmin right am i but I do follow the god of brother Branham and and and I don't take it wrong in one sense if somebody would call me a brand of might I'm not gonna be offended by it but I but that's not who we follow Paul said follow me as I follow Christ and brother Branham said I preached everything Paul preached so when when I come out you know I still see you know you lean this way and I still see that you go this way and and that's okay we're still going through life we're still going along but there comes a time when somebody says you are a Christian you know in in your in your conversation in your actions in your dress all of it together the true life of God begins to reflect he says so he made you the Bible the only one some people will ever read you are what you do people is looking at you and then the last one in the exposition of the seven churches I know thy works if a man fears that he might not please God then let him fulfill the word if a man wonders if he will hear these words well done good and faithful servant and I think every one of us are striving for that looking for that day to hear well done come and enter that one to the joys of the Lord he says let him fulfill the word of God in his life and assuredly he will hear the words of praise those words of praise the word of truth was a criterion then it's a criterion now there is isn't another standard there isn't an plumb line as the world is going to be judged by one Christ Jesus even so it's going to be judged by the word if a man wants to know how he's making out let him do as James suggested look into the mirror of God's Word it's okay and sometimes you know you'll stand brothers you know sister you share something with them and you ask for some advice or or you tell them be honest about me tell me how you really feel tell me what you think and they say well you know you've got these strong points but you know you you've got this and I'll share something that happened the other day I was with my old boss and we had played golf and we had a a walk on a guy that just played with us a nice old gentleman and we're talking and I got to talking to him and so I was sitting at home and my phone went off about 10 o'clock at night and I was still awake and I saw was a text and my boss was texting my ol boss and didn't know I was included so I started reading their text and so my ol boss goes he said you know and he says so we had this guy that walked on with us and Aaron talked to him and kept him you know entertained and all he goes and I didn't have to listen to Aaron and I'm reading it and I go he's right Aaron talks a lot that's true and he had no idea I was reading it he thought it was just going to the boss so he was saying Fanning I mean so after a little bit I just responded hey guys good night going to bed now and then the whole conversation changed and that's okay because yeah I do talk a lot okay all I do and that's okay I would just be nice to the guy and everything and Tony doesn't like to talk a lot and that's perfectly fine but you know it's sometimes somebody will discover themselves or unveil themselves or you know the mirror shows what you are my wife when I told her about it she goes and what did you do I just told him goodnight they knew it got all quiet after that that's all right you know and and so as we look at that you are a written a living written epistle of God and so let's look at some scriptures here and some things that he says and we have read Ephesians in st. John and 2nd Corinthians 4:18 let's let's go there first God's Word never fails and never returns void while we look not at the things which are seen but at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal well we get caught up on what we see some time the the outer man the one that Paul said o wretched man that I am Who Shall deliver me from this guy we get caught up with that one sometimes you know but but when you get feeling of that go back to Hebrews 11 and start reading God's account of his children and say Lord do you could you say the same thing about me by faith Stephan stab staggered not at the promise of God you know and if you would I asked Abraham and Abraham as a memory would have gone a few times but Lord then what was that but the record shows that you staggered not at the promise of God that's what God has said so we're looking to those things which are not seeing 1st Corinthians 3 12 13 12 sorry says for now we see through a glass darkly but then face to face now I know in part but then I shall know even as also I am known I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them that's what God's Word said but brother grain you should talk about brother branham watching brother branham a drive-by on the car and he would look and watch him he was usually singing I'm so glad I can say I'm one of them he wasn't going down the street singing oh me oh my oh look it just poor old me no I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God Jesus James 1 23 and 24 for if any be a hearer of the word and not a doer he is like unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass it's another word for a mirror and he but behold of himself and goeth away and straightway forgetteth what manner of man he was James is save you only listen to it and you don't put it into action every time you go back to the mirror you're gonna see the old man you're gonna see the one that frustrates you usually gonna see the one that you say I got to do something about that guy and he says but a door of the word of God is going to begin to see a different reflection hey hey I see more of Christ in me somebody else is gonna be sa my goodness there's something about you today there's a radiance about you there's a presence about you it's beginning to show more of Christ and that's what James says a doer of the word of God not just coming Sunday and hearing coming Wednesday and hearing or wherever it is but putting those things into action this is 1 John 3 and verses 1 and 2 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it didn't know him it knew him not beloved now we are the sons of God not when we cross into eternity now we are the sons of God and it does not yet up here what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is again we are looking into the mirror of God's Word and by doing that we will be like him because you are what you eat you are what you read you are what you feast on you are what you spend your time with that's the truth I've shared this testimony when I was a young man we first moved here from California and and I really like sports and I would go watch we graduate from Sunnyside high school we'd go watch their football games we started going to the U of A and I was talking to a brother one day and I was telling him how much I struggled with him and he said well where were you Friday at the football game where were you Saturday at the football game but I came to church Sunday hmm but you struggled through Sunday what were you doing and he said brother Aaron is pretty simple stop spending your time there quit feeding that part I look back now and I say you know what I don't miss it I don't need it at one time it seems so hard to be without it and today God will do that work you begin to look into the mirror of God's Word now I like this one I've used this scripture many times Jeremiah 29:11 we all know it before I know the thoughts that I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace peace is an absence of war when there is peace there's not a conflict when there is peace there's not anguish and there's rest in peace thoughts of peace he says I'm looking at you settled grounded at pcs those are my thoughts for you not of evil to give you and expect it and to give you the very thing I promised you to give you the very thing the Word of God says that's my desire that's what I have planned for you and I thank God that his plans never get sidetracked hey they are constant we look at Philippians 4:13 and and we like to use this one and and sometimes I tell myself in the morning your attitude when you're getting up in the morning can determine the rest of your day you know it's it's and I've shared with you I have good Mondays because of a lot of other people don't so somebody has to hold it up so everybody makes it up on Tuesday and I have lousy Tuesdays and one day I started telling me that's what you've been saying for a long time you keep saying I have lousy Tuesdays why don't you change that you wake up in the morning thinking it's Tuesday and you would say you do that yes I did it for a long time i I didn't dread Mondays but Tuesday I say it seems like Tuesday's my day always goes backwards if it's gonna be a problem something's not gonna work something's gonna break Tuesday and you know what Tuesdays have been a whole lot better now because it just changed my attitude they're still Tuesdays but my attitude is different about him he says I can do all things through Christ which strengthens man because I can know through Christ who strengthens me that's Paul saying I can do all things you know and and then we look here at there's a lot of scriptures today because it's God's Word we go to Hebrews chapter 11 and we know that Hebrews is the Allah is the 11 is the faith chapter 4 by faith Abel 4 by faith Abraham 4 and you know faith a couple of ways we explain faith is believing and having faith in God but brother Branham says faith is a revelation when God when it becomes real to you when you realize that what God said he meant because it becomes part of your life you know hearing brother brother Jordan's testimony he didn't put himself he didn't he didn't get how does it say whatever starts saying Lord and you're not giving me a job lord I can't find a job and and spend that time he said Lord I lay it in your hands and his hands and God looks at said and says hey that's faith now brother Jordan maybe I'm not saying there sometimes the thoughts didn't go through your head but you refuse to listen to those and say no your word says so and then God meets your need and sometimes I've had had this happen to me when suddenly you realize wait a minute I forgot I asked God for that anyways the life because he takes care of you watches over his children he takes care of his family he's talking to to his disciples and and he says oh you know you've been being earthly fathers when your son or your daughter your children ask you for a fish you don't give him a serpent when they ask you for bread you don't give him a stone he says how much more your heavenly father constantly Jesus is reminding us who we are who we are you know he would say you're your party you're part of my you know you're part of me as I'm part of him we are of the same father I I've said this and I'll say it again be careful who you call not your brother your sister well you know that's not my brother and I'm not talking in the physical sense I'm talking as a Christian because if their father is God and you said that's not my brother then who's your father never put it in that perspective well he's not my brother he's not my sister you're saying we don't have the same father and if that person is a child of God be careful be careful what you say about someone rather than say lord help me to see or help me to walk in their shoes for a little while now it when you walk in somebody else your shoes for a little while sudden you say wow now I understand why why they feel or out they're going through you know I had somebody tell me isn't brother Matt a little too young to be a pastor and I said you know I laughed about it and I said well he is young because I'm on that side looking this way now but when I started here at church I was 29 years old about 30 31 but brother al Peterson asked me to start helping back there in the back at the door and people were looking at me like you're pretty young but I didn't think I was I thought I was old enough and big enough and strong enough but now I'm looking at 60 looking back at 36 and saying yeah he's a bit young but you know what huh in that sense age doesn't matter to God he can call him when they're six he put he put Kings in Israel at six and eight and 10 years old gaudiya what do you do now and some people a brother branham is there and when he's on the other side he's talking and that sister came up to him and she said you don't remember me says no I don't and she goes I was 90 years old when I came to the Lord God knows what he's doing I said no he's not young he's in God's hands and I look at some of us and say oh they're too young no they're not they're in God's hands they're learning and you know as you learn by experience and the best way is by experience there's a lot of book learning without experience you know different ones that say I read the book I used to laugh because a friend of mine son who was maybe about 14 years old we were doing something at his house and his son turn around so I mean this is how you do it this is how you do it this is how you do it as the boy walked away his dad goes he read the book last night so now he's an expert because he had just read the book I think we were talking about loading bullets I was just getting into it and he kind of laughed I go yeah but down time he learned how to load then I could ask him a question I said okay will you do it you do it this way this one this way it's good it's good to read book but it's better to learn by experience above that book to begin to experience those things in your own life because whether experience comes responsibilities God begins to say that's a responsible one there is one who has learned there is one that I can trust that I can give some authority in this situation something you know I guess so that when Satan comes and says Paul I know and Jesus I know but who are you then all he can say brother Merle I know sister Amelia I know why because they have learned and have become that which God has said to each one of us is that same place you know I sometimes we feel well and and and well I'll have to have a minister pray for me I'll have to have a brother pray for me I'll have to but what about that child of God sitting next to you who can reach out and touch the Lord's Hill because they've learned through experience in the globe you know watching God move in their own lives and he can have that faith he says so in Hebrews we were looking at Hebrews 11:40 watch what he says here the last scripture of that God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be made perfect they without us for that portion of the body that thing would not be complete or they wouldn't come to the full blessing yet because we're part of it you're as much a child of God as they were a child of God you're as much a child of God as Abraham was to Abraham was given a promise to you as given a promise and he's the same God that fulfills it as He fulfilled it with Abraham as he fulfilled it with Moses and each one he does the same with you you're just as important you mean just as much to him he said for they without of us would not be made perfect or the other word for there is complete and whole your part is needed also 2nd Timothy 1:5 now I I just was thinking about this through the family watch this Paul is speaking to Timothy says when I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee which to our first in thy grandmother Lois and thy mother Eunice and I am persuaded in the awesome a godly heritage that was passed down Paul began to see Timothy now you know what there's a lot of the same action the same rillette resemblance as that godly mother and that godly grandmother Paul B that's what he's identifying it and I want to take that a little further acts 239 the next scripture exercise x2 39 for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the Lord our God shall call he's telling here he has pointed out to Timothy where it came from in here and acts he's saying it's to all of God's children as to as many and then then again in acts 16:31 and they said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved and thy house I've claimed every one of my girls in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I said they're part of my house my dad claimed me and it's gone down the lining Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I've shared this with you when when I was talking to the insurance agent as as they as each one of the girls were getting their cars and nobody when they could afford a car and for the insurance they could have a car and and I called his name's Dave then at the insurance agent and I said Dave are my girls up to date on their insurance because I didn't want a surprise dad I got an accident and I hadn't paid for my surance for three months what do I do now you know one of those type of things and Dave made this comment to me he said Aaron these were his words he goes if all the kids were like your kids we wouldn't have the problems we have he goes if they can't pay it on the due date they'll call me I say I'll have it there tomorrow or whatever there very attentive to it and dad took a nice deep breath and said thank you lord you know but right about then I thought to myself Lord all right my girls making things right with you is that blessed assurance are they talking with their agent about blessed assurance you know because I see him at home I see it him at church but I don't see him on their jobsite I didn't what are they doing and the Lord I was driving down the freeway on my work truck and the Lord took me right then and there right to job and I said job laid a sacrifice every morning in case his children had sinned and God said I will honor your prayers for your daughters that's what he said to me and what a blessing so a few weeks later I'm studying and I if I find something brother Graham said I usually will go up a couple of paragraphs up and down just to make sure I'm getting everything he's saying there and brother Brahim saying something and he goes that's like like a good father he said just like job a good father just like job every morning would lay a sacrifice for his children a good father would I said thank you Lord you just double confirmed it for me every morning and I pray for them and ask for them I say Lord I'm a they keep their hearts right before you may their attitude be good may you know if they make a mistake let him because God said to pray that way God said he would honor it and God has he keeps his word and so I just wanted to show it it's if you have godly parents it's a blessing in your life a mother and a father who would pray for you a mother and a father who would who would say you know daughter son don't be that way don't do that it's going to cost you so that's a blessing today you know sometimes you've heard people say well you need to go out into the world to get a testimony don't you you don't do that don't even listen to that stay pure stayed true I've talked to some folks who who are Christians now and they serve the Lord and they say some of those memories still haunt them because Satan will try to get back at you but if there's no memories there he can't hunt you with him but you guys say no I'm saying I wasn't involved with things my life was involved in prayer meetings my Volvo life was involved in Christian gathering my life was involved in this that's a godly testimony it's a good testimony romans 8 verses 14 and 19 for as many as are led by the Spirit of God they are the sons of God amen are you being led by the Spirit of God brother Jordan talked about in his testimony being led by the Spirit of God what is tell you here are sons of God 19 for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of god there awaiting us this whole creation is looking for redemption it's looking for its purifying it's looking to go back to what it started happening and you know what it are waiting for me and you because there's I believe I can honestly say we're in that time I have to believe that I don't want to see another 40 or 50 years of this I wanted to I want to go home soon and I believe the promises have got it but if it isn't today I'll still wait on it for tomorrow if it isn't I'm still gonna believe but the whole creation is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God and who are the sons of God amen God's Word says so and I've taken and chosen to believe that let's look at Hebrews chapter 2 verses 11 and 13 for both he that sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one the one that's doing the sanctification and the one who's being sanctified or one he says for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren saying I will declare my name unto my brethren in the myths of the church will I sing praise unto thee and again I will put my trust in him and again behold I and the children which God has given me I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God that's what God's Word says you know sometimes I look at the mirror and I have trouble seen it but I have to remind us what is God's Word say it up because that's true the rest of it isn't Romans and these these I did not give you these scriptures I just gonna I'm gonna give you what Roman Romans what they call us what Romans said is this is Paul writing he said in Romans chapter 1 he calls you beloved of God in first Corinthians to the Church of God in Ephesians 1 Saints faithful in Christ Jesus Colossians faithful brethren tightest God's elect that's how each one is addressed when you look at the opening scripture to God's elect to God's faithful to faithful brethren in John 1 my little children the elect lady sons of God chosen elect salt-of-the-earth children of light sheep of his pasture my sheep know my voice is it my sheep he didn't say any any sheep he said my sheep know my voice he says now look at here revelations chapter 1 let's read verses 1 through 6 the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what the book is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's nothing else but God unveiling himself which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified by his angel unto his servant John who bare record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and above all the things he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand a hearer and a doer of the word of God many have heard but didn't do but here he says they that hear the words and keep those things John to the seven churches were RNA which are in Asia grace be unto you and peace from him which is and which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his stone and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the Dead and the Prince of the king of the earth unto him that loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood and hath made us kings and priests unto God and his father has made us kings and priests you're included in all of this work he says to him be glory and Dominion for ever and ever amen I'm so glad I'm a part of the family of God God's Word will not return void with that it never fails you know sometimes we get a little should I say impatient God you know we I just want to see you know but it's through that testiness through that trying is true that that time that those those things are built you know if brother Graham type cities he says you plant that seed whatever it is and I always say an apple tree he uses that one quite often you plant an apple tree a seed of an apple tree he says and every Apple that it ever that tree will ever give is in that seat sometimes it's hard to believe that a seed this big might have a hundred bushels of Apple and but it does everything that God has wanted from you is in you it's planted in you every good thing that God has desired for you is in you brother Branham says he was God over us the pillar of fire in Ella him and then he was God with us in Jesus and then he said he's God in us in the Holy Ghost did he say there were three guards no it's the same one the same one that did those things when you go back into the Old Testament you saw the things he did the same one you see when Jesus is walking on is recorded is the same one that's in you today everything that you have need of is in you because you've got God in you and again that apple tree it's going to bring forth it's going to come it has its season and every Apple that's in that seed or that it'll ever give coming is in that seed all that I am and ever hope to be I owe it all to him and he's talking about that he says another statement that brother Branham it says when the bride realizes who she is she will be an invincible army I know she's a many membered body means me and you are included in that body you know sometimes they say well you know this one and that one oh it's a many member body it's it's it's each one of God's chosen and and another thing to remember and brother Ram says is strong a lot of strongly when we're all part of the body of Christ we're part of God what he's gonna map it and sometimes we get a little upset with our brother and our sister and and you know we might accuse them of somewhere we might look down on him brother Branham says remember it's not your brother's sister it's a devil you're pushed they're part of the body of Christ your brother and your sister it's it's they're striving they're looking they're wanting to be the same as you to reach to that place to here well done thou good and faithful servant yes you know with with it with experience you've been tested you've been tried you've been proven comes responsibilities because we heard when when when John or when would the Scriptures read written them and they're there and he said this is my beloved son hear ye when brother Branham is there and and and he ties his back into Moses when God tells Moses and he says why cry speak when brother when when he tells brother branham s speak to that storm was that just for them no what's everyone at you God's children your storm may not be as big as that storm but it's still a storm in your life maybe you're going to three-foot waves and somebody else is going through six foot waves but you're still in that storm let him speak or you stand him to say as God said peace be still because that's your part of the body you're part of him you know everything that you need to get from this natural life to eternal life lies within you in that seed which he said Christ in you the hope of glory so again just just to make Christians followers of Jesus Christ reflectors of Christ himself now we're looking in in just one more part here make sure I've got the right notes here because I just went through and I began to to look and see what each age was promised and in the first age he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death to the overcomer and the second age he said he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he that overcometh shall know I'm sorry I got these two mixed up he shall he that overcometh shall not be hurt of the second death to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth to each age is given a promise and it culminates in this age here and he said and he that overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of a Potter they shall be broken to shivers even as I received of my father and will give him the morning star what promises we have of God to each one to each age brother Bram says they carry over the promises carry over into each age till there comes to his fullness he that overcometh the same shall be clothed in white raiment and will not and I will not blot out his name out of the book of life but I will confess his name before my father and before his angels could you imagine and who wants to be picked today to raise your hand sister Holly you didn't raise your hand your name gets confessed before your father and his angels put your name in there you understand that you mean that much to him you're part of him and you say well no well only that well you know no you caught in you the hope of glory he says him that overcometh will i make a pillar in the temple of my god and he shall go no more out and I will write upon him the name of my god and the name of the city of my god which is New Jerusalem which comes down from heaven from my god and I will write upon him my new name you know sometimes you just have to go back and read it and see what God says when you're feeling a little bit down a feeling a little discouraged and filled little left I'll get back into the Word of God and see what he says about you now behold I stand at the door and knock to our age he comes and he says Eddie I'd like to spend some time with you today I'd like to have some fellowship with you I'd like to come in and and and what's your favorite meal sit down and have it with you he says if any man will hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me I was hearing the testimony brother Joe Reilly's testimony and I had heard brother Dawson's I'd heard for the Joe Riley he's senior son one time so I had not heard his and he was talking about a time in his life when he had moved from California here to Arizona and he had asked the Lord if the Lord could arrange for him to have five minutes with brother brown he said Lord if I could just have five minutes because he had a couple of questions he would like to ask so he said he was out working there and in there where they had the pecan girl been all and he he sees a car drive up but he's not paying too much attention to it because he's doing something and next thing you know brother branham is standing there next to him and he turns in you know he's amazing brother BAM says hey brother Joe would you and your wife like to go to have lunch with us and he said my wife that morning wasn't feeling good and she didn't even make breakfast and fingers so I went and I said honey do you want to go have some lunch and she says I'm not feeling good brother branham wants to know and she says sure so they went and had lunch and it was about ten of them they said they had and they went to a restaurant they sat there and she says I asked for five minutes I got five hours that's the God we serve he says I had three questions I asked because he had been raised Pentecostal had always been taught that that speaking in tongues was the evidence and he had some questions we're going down and driving down and I'm thinking I need to ask him I need to ask him and brother BAM turns around he goes now brother Joe about those three questions and these three scriptures you want to ask me about his Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever you have a question in your heart you have something you're desiring and a minister stands up and he says now let's open up these scriptures and he began saying you're saying Oh Lord do you know how much I needed to hear that today he's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he changes not he can use your brother he can use your sister he can use a sign sometimes on the side of the road a billboard it'll say Lord I needed that today open up the scripture of the day and you have some in your heart and there's the answer God is able to minister to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame in a set down with my father in his throne to the overcomer to God's children to his elect to his elect lady to his chosen one he said to that one that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my father stone amen what a promise we have if the musicians would but come back up so when you get to looking in the mirror and you get to seeing yourself take another look at the mirror and see what God says about you said Lord let me see myself in the mirror God's Word the way you see me how you speak of me how you felt about me that while you were on the cross I was on your mind because you look for that portion of of you you wanted to restore he knew me and yet he loved me he had seen a finished product and he said they are mine these that you have given me our mind as he praising in in chapter 17 he knew me yet he loved me he whose glory makes a heaven shine a man do you love him today do you appreciate his goodness are you going to take his word what His Word says about you more than what you're feeling about yourself at times I got a little piece of news today and when I first heard it my first thought was I'm gonna quit my boss called me in me said you know how it's been a little bit slow and it has been work and he said the big boss in Phoenix called me and said I think we're gonna start using Aaron up in Phoenix he's gonna have to drive up to Phoenix now to work and I was I was hoping for the deer that everyday you know and I had told my wife I know things are gonna change work is slow they're gonna either let some people go or what and one of the service techs up in Phoenix is going to be going through is in the hospital of surgery and they said we'll just have Aaron come up here and work on some days but you'll probably be about 150 miles extra of driving and that's what went through my mind first Oh Lord no and after a little bit I said to my wife we've been expecting it God knows I don't need to trouble I don't need to lose sleep over God has it he knew me ooh oh hey the heaven what so ah such words was [Music]
