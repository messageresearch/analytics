with you tonight thank you for being here Welcome to our Wednesday night bible study we're continuing to investigate the life of Joseph the lessons that it has for us the last few weeks brother Daniel has brought us lessons about generational curses and blessings the nature of and need for repentance we'll see these two themes play a major role in tonight's portion of Genesis and uh by the way there's a little single sheet handout with the verses and some of the images tonight back at the ab Booth when you leave if you'd like like a copy before we resume our study though let's one more time join our hearts together before the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus it's such an honor Lord to come together to come together by choice not being forced not being prevented but Lord because we just want to be with each other we want to be with you we want to draw closer to you we want to know you better Lord we look to your your word we look to your spirit Lord accept our worship this evening Lord accept our praise accept our prayers Lord we just pray that you'd guide whatever is said this evening Lord that it would help some Lord and that it would hinder none and we thank you in the mighty precious name of Jesus Christ Our Lord amen for our opening verses I'd like to read three short passages they bear on events in Joseph's life and the parallel life of his brother Judah which we'll cover in tonight's lesson God willing two readings from the gospels and one from Genesis the first is found in Mark 15 is that the crucifixion some of the very last words that Jesus ever SP at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice voice saying in Aramaic alo alo L which is being interpreted my God my God why hast Thou forsaken me here we see Jesus in the moments of his greatest suffering feeling completely alone not only abandoned by his disciples not only bearing ridicule from from the crowds not only physical torture and torment but abandoned by his own father who had his baptism had said from Heaven you are my beloved Son the second is a portion of the genealogy of Jesus adoptive father is mentioned presented in Matthew the first chapter when the names are from the Greek translation I'll read them from the Old Testament version of the name as we go through these few verses may make it easier to relate as we proceed this evening the book of the generation of Jesus Christ the son descendant of David descendant of Abraham Abraham begat Isaac Isaac begat Jacob Jacob begat Judah and his Brethren Judah begat farz and Zarah of Tamar and farz begat hezron and hezron begat Ram there's something in this thread of generations that should give us hope strengthen our faith assure us of God's grace we'll get to that a bit later this evening and finally two verses from Genesis 41 that were part of our previous uh Wednesday evening and the story of Joseph Genesis 41 verses 50 and 51 seem to be having a minor technical difficulty here let's try this again um could you advance the slide please thank you and unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine came which asath the daughter of poera priest of own be to him Joseph called the name of the firstborn manasse causing to forget for God said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house another translation says God has caused me to forget the troubles I suffered at the hands of my family please be seated last time Joseph came from Piper's dungeon to Pharaoh's Palace and interpreted Pharaoh's dreams Pharaoh promoted Joseph to be number two in the Kingdom he engineered and had built perhaps the first major Waterworks project in the world known even today as the Joseph Canal thank you to supply the fume Basin and approximately double the cultivated land area of ancient Egypt this assured sufficient grain to feed the people during the upcoming famine along the way we saw biblical and other evidence to determine the years and confirm the Pharaohs of Joseph's time the famine was not only in Egypt but in surrounding areas including Canaan where Jacob and his family began to face starvation let's pick up our story as Jacob prepares to send his sons to Egypt to buy Grain Genesis 421 now when Jacob saw that there was Grand available in Egypt Jacob said to his sons why do you look upon one another he said behold I I have heard there's food in Egypt get up and and get down there buy Grain for us so that we may live and not just sit around until we all die Egypt it's been about 22 years but nine of the sons remembered what they had done selling their brother Joseph to be a slave in Egypt and Joseph's 10 older brothers went down to buy Grain in Egypt but Benjamin Joseph's full brother Jacob sent not with his brethren for he said lest perhaps some Mischief befall him the sons of Israel came to buy Grain among those that came for the famine was in the land of Canaan among those that came it's an important statement to help set the context for what happens next the famine wasn't confined to Egypt but was experienced in the surrounding areas as well this makes this famine really severe it's not only affecting the weather pattern 2,300 miles to the South and the highlands of Equatorial Africa which source the Nile here's the equator here's these high mountains the highest mountain highest point Mount kilamanjaro at 6,000 meters nearly so this is very high area you've got uh what's now Lake Victoria feeding the White Nile mountains of Ethiopia feeding the Blue Nile joining at carum now it becomes red but only on the map not in the water unless Moses is cursing it and that Nile then flows north into the Mediterranean but it's not just affecting Egypt and that it's also affecting the weather up here in the Eastern Mediterranean and these strange conditions will persist for seven years the result is that people are coming from all over the region to obtain grain keep in mind that while there are Empires that are forming and what is now Iraq Iran turkey this area these Empires are beginning but they're in very early stages National governments like we think of hardly exist Egypt is very unusual in that regard Canaan consists of various city states for example there would be many small diverse groups coming to Egypt to buy food roads are more like Trails unpaved paths no trucks awaiting entry to Gaza with thousands of tons of supplies no trains no planes no container vessels just pack animals mostly donkeys carts or wagons would be crude and slow with wooden axles and wooden Wheels no tires subject to frequent breakdowns so they couldn't be loaded very heavily no proper suspension systems and they were pulled by animals which also need food and water not all nearby city states are friendly Egypt wasn't always a nice neighbor often conducting raids into neighboring territories so the Egyptians have to set up border checkpoints and so forth more so than normal in the past no one had passports credentials they couldn't fly flash their iPhone and get past the border so there had to be other means by which you would check people and be sure they had a valid reason for coming Egypt would be worried that some of these neighbors under the guise of coming for grain or perhaps just taking advantage of it will be spying reporting back to the local governments on what they see in Egypt probing looking for possible weaknesses things that they can exploit in future conflicts and since Egypt eypt is also experiencing a severe famine it is weakened much of its military is deployed to guard the granaries from theft the result is a heightened concern about foreigners taking advantage of the famine to identify weaknesses in Egypt such was the economic political and Military context and Joseph known as Zapf panea was the governor over the land of E Egypt and he it was that sold to all the people of the land Joseph's Brethren came to Zapf pan and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the Earth it's unlikely that Egyptians far up the Nile had to come all the way down to Joseph and then go home with grain there were storehouses all over the land but it appears that foreigners were required to see the viser of all Egypt and Joseph saw his Brethren and recognized them but made himself strange unto them it's not too hard with a shaved body a wig not his natural hair color a golden signate ring eyeliner speaking Egyptian and named zapa panea and smelling a bit like a spice Caravan no it wasn't too hard and he spake roughly unto them them that had been so grously cruel to him and zfa said through an interpreter unto them whence Come Ye and they said from the land of Canaan to buy food Joseph recognized his Brethren but they didn't recognize him Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed of them which doesn't mean that he'd forgotten those dreams just that they came to his mind at that point as his brothers were bowed down to him fulfilling his first Dream and he said unto them your spies to see the nakedness of the land you're come playing into the paranoia of the time and maybe just maybe seeing he now has the upper hand over them careful Joseph and they said unto him nay my lord they're afraid spying is punishable by death zapa has the power to have them killed they're veh in their denial n my Lord but but to buy food are thy servants come we're all one man's Sons we're all true men Joseph thinks yeah right true to whom true to what thy servants are no spies and he as Zapf panea the man with the power to snap his fingers order to their deaths no further questions asked no no trial no defense attorney no appeals said unto them nay but to see the nakedness of the land are you come you say you're true and honest I don't believe you you're lying you're spying sometime during this interrogation he asked have you a father or a brother and they said thy servants are 12 brother and the sons of one man in the in the land of Canaan and behold the youngest is his day with our father oh how that Revelation must have hurt and what is not and Joseph as zafa panea said unto them that's what I spake unto you saying you're spies right on the off chance you may actually be telling me the truth hereby you shall be proved by the life of pharaoh you shall not go forth from here except your youngest brother come hither not your father or not even with your father just your youngest brother send one of you let him fetch your brother and and ye the the rest of you will be kept in prison that your words may be proved whether there be any truth in you or else by the life of pharaoh surely you are spies that's a really strange test if they were lying all all they had to do is get someone to come back from Canaan and claim to be the younger brother and an effect called zafaf Pan's Bluff how would he know this Egyptian guy how could this be a truth test but the tenor and fear for their lives not thinking clearly they came in peace with money to buy Grain and now look at their situation and why why is Joseph only concerned about seeing his full brother Benjamin and not his dad stay with me and he Joseph put them all together into Ward not The Roundhouse the VIP prison that he was in but place called a a place of bondage a house of bondage he put in there for three days likely the time he'd spent in the sistern and Dothan wondering about his life and Joseph had them brought to him and said unto them the third day this do and live for I Fear God they've had three days to be in fear for their lives Joseph also had three days to consider his own actions toward them to develop a plan a test to see if they were the same crew that had mistreated him the same crew that had slaughtered the men of sheam or if They Were Somehow different now and in spite of his probable desire for Retribution Joseph knows he can't follow through on those kinds of thoughts he has to resist them why because he fears he respects God he's seen God's hand in his life how God is using him to save the lives of so many remember all this conversation is being handled through an interpreter zafaf pan is speaking Egyptian the brothers are speaking Hebrew this do and live for I Fear God if you be true men let one of your brethren be bound in the house of your prison go carry grain for the Famine of your houses three days earlier he was going to send one and keep the rest of them in prison now he's keeping one in prison and sending the rest why sending one with all all that food through a land that is starving would be inviting attack by others coming to Egypt to get food wheat was like gold now there'd be a large enough group to dissuade any potential attack on the 250 to perhaps 300 mile Journey back home through the desert but bring your youngest brother to me Joseph longs to see his little brother again don't bother to bring Jacob just bring Benjamin again you must ask why why why doesn't he want to see his dad what's going on so shall your words be verified and ye shall not die and they did so and about this time there's probably a conversation in Genesis 44 21- 23 that we'll just insert here because it's likely when it happened and and Joseph said bring him down unto me that I may set my eyes upon him that's what Joseph wants that's why I put Joseph's name there and and they said the lad cannot leave his father if he should if he should leave his father his father would die and zapa pan said except your youngest brother come down with you you shall see my face no more no more food you'll all die of starvation again why would Joseph insist on seeing Benjamin even if it meant his dad might die of a broken heart does he think ah you're just exaggerating he's not going to die of a broken heart or is there some other reason is there something else at play watch and they Joseph's brother said one to another we're very guilty concerning our brother Joseph and that we saw the anguish of his soul when he besought when he begged us and we would not hear therefore is this distress come upon us yeah Joseph's thinking you got that right I begged and pleaded with you so-called honest men you just laughed hit me again then sold me to the ishmaelites I'm being far nicer to you than you deserve listen closely now Joseph is and Reuben unknowingly back again in the role of Reuben The Rescuer I love this part Reuben answered them saying spake I not unto you saying do not sin against the child and you would not hear Joseph is thinking yeah right Reuben you instigated me being violently thrown into the empty system for three days before you conveniently disappeared therefore for behold also his blood is required and Joseph's blood runs cold they knew not that Joseph understood them for he spake unto them as zapan a pan by an interpreter and he turned himself about from them and wept what's going on Joseph has just had a shock probably second only to the shock of being beaten and sold to the ishmaelites or maybe greater for 22 long years he was certain of something that he now realized was probably not true remember the Battleground with Satan is in our minds Joseph's no different than you no different than me we each experience things we understand those experiences from our personal perspective like the brother that stands here some some time and says now you were telling me that this puppet has a cross on it not true I don't see the cross I see a cabinet doors and a shelf and you say what are you talking about brother L there's a cross there well different perspectives looking at the same thing Joseph's experiences in Dothan were brutal but he didn't have the whole picture now he's exposed to a vital truth that will change his whole outlook on his past and on his Dysfunctional Family remember the rule God laid out for Noah After the flood God speaking to Noah in Genesis 9 and surely your blood of your lives will I require at the hand of every Beast will I require it and at the hand of man at at the hand of Every Man's brother will I require the life of man who so shedthemusic or manslaughter that's why they set up the Cities of Refuge if somebody accidentally killed someone there was no bad intent there was nothing if he could get to the City of Refuge they couldn't get to him until he could plead his case before a judge there right and and if it turned out that it really was an accidental thing there was no culpability well then the guy was safe as long as he stayed in that City of Refuge this is a very strong law established from the time of Noah and the state by Reuben behold also his blood is required is another way of saying Joseph was killed and now we have to pay the price his life was taken and now our lives are forfeit and these words of Reuben shock Joseph Shake him to his very core why initially the first wave of the shock because Joseph thought ruin was in on the plan to sell him into Egyptian slavery after all it was his idea to can find Joseph in a pit now he realizes that Not only was Reuben ignorant of what then happened to Joseph but that Reuben had stood up for him against his brothers Reuben wasn't present when Joseph was handed over to the Israelites but apart from that bit of knowledge Joseph had no idea of Ruben's role at Dothan then the second wave adding to the shock he realizes that the other nine were content to let Reuben believe this why would they let him believe that lie that Joseph was dead and what's the gut-wrenching implication the realization that sends him from them to weep and anguish this must be why he never heard from his dad Jacob because if Ruben believes Joseph was killed then Jacob probably believes it too it's not knowledge commonly within the family apart from the nine guilty brothers that Joseph was sold to slavery they saw the coat dipped in goat's blood and thought Joseph was dead his dad must have also been deceived into thinking Joseph was dead the nine covered up their treachery with some other lie some way to convince both Reuben and Jacob that Joseph had been killed and not by them have you ever asked yourself this question perhaps as we've been going through this series or thought about it why did Joseph never reach out to his dad who had loved and protected Joseph as his favorite favorite son we talked about Joseph appealing to the ishmaelites when he was being my dad's a rich man I'm his favorite take me up there you get a lot more money from him than you will selling me down in Egypt but they wouldn't listen to him Joseph never understood why his dad didn't send a couple of fast camels with money or armed servants to rescue him during that horrible two week forced march across the sin into Egypt Abraham rescued his nephew lot why wouldn't Jacob rescue his son he never understood why Jacob never tried to find him and by his freedom after he was sold as a slave where are you Dad why don't you come for me I thought you loved me I thought you cared about me was I wrong my father my father why have you forsaken me why was he simply forgotten left to live in misery and die in pain as a slave in Egypt it's the most likely reason why Joseph never tried to reach out to his father once he was able to do so it would have been possible at some point as pifer's Chief Operating Officer easily done by the number two man in Egypt for the last eight plus years why didn't he because Joseph thought that Jacob had written him off that his dad somehow knew but didn't care about his plight either way he didn't want to see him Joseph was in anguish and pain over his rejection by his own dad but now Joseph suddenly suspects the reason Jacob never tried to rescue him the nine brothers had convinced Reuben and therefore likely Jacob that Joseph was dead and that's why up to this point Joseph showed strong interest only in Benjamin not his dad why would he name his firstborn son manasse caused to forget I can see him holding his infant son rocking him gently telling him in tears my dad said he loved me when I needed him the most he wasn't there I'll do a better job with you son I'll love and protect you as he should have done me I can forget that whole bunch now that I have you manasse but now what is Joseph gonna do now overcome with emotion at this sudden realization based on an overheard chance comment from Ruben to his brothers this twist in his entire thinking and mindset for the last 22 years and he turned himself about from them and wept and after regaining his composure washing his face fixing his eyeliner Zapf Pano returned to them again and conversed with them and then directing his guards took from them Simeon and bound him before their very eyes and sent him off to the dungeon the prison for the brothers is not the roundhouse the the VIP Detention Center where Joseph was held it's a house of bondage and why Simeon he was the second oldest and the one who undoubtedly consistent with his nature took pleasure in beating Joseph seeing him handed over to the Israelites then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with grain and to restore Every Man's money into his sack and to give them provision for the way and thus did he unto them and this is all done an Egyptian the brothers don't really know what's going on they're completely unaware of the plan that Joseph is Now setting in motion and they the the nine brothers because simeon's in prison laided their asses with already filled and tied off sacks of grain and departed then from the graner and as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender and all of their donkeys not just his at the in he saw his money for behold it was in his sack's mouth it wasn't buried within the sack it was right there right at the top all part of the plan all part of the test will these honest men return the money will they just go on to Canaan will they bring it back with Benjamin will they pretend it never happened and he said said unto his Brethren my money is restored it's it's in my sack and their heart failed them they were afraid saying one to another what is this that God hath done to us we've just escaped with our lives our brother Simeon is in Egypt probably is a slave to that strange man ZF pan who knows where he is or with whom what's going on this is a Strange Land This egyp eypt we need to get home figure things out and they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan and told him all that befell them saying the man Z AF pan who who's the lord of the land spake roughly to us took us for spies of the country we said unto him we're true men we're no spies we're 12 brothers the sons of our father one is not the youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan and the man the lord of the country said unto us hereby shall I know that you are true men leave one of your brethren here with me and take food for the Famine of your households and be gone bring your youngest breth unto me then I shall know that you're no spies but that you're true men and so will I return to you your brother and you shall be able to conduct business in the land of Egypt and it came to pass as a emptied their sacks that behold Every Man's bundle of money was in his sack and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money these aren't checks these isn't this isn't paper IUS or Federal Reserve notes these are gold coins silver coins these are uh these are real money they're they're they're not what you get when you push the button on your iPhone and they were afraid or or or even your Android and Jacob their father said unto them me have you bed of my children Joseph is not Simeon is not and now you will take Benjamin away all these things are against me and Reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if I bring Benjamin not not back to thee deliver him into my hand and I will bring him to thee again my youngest boys either my youngest boys either and he Jacob said remember Jacob holds a grudge against Ruben for what he did regarding bilha and he'll hold it till his dying day my son Benjamin shall not go down with you for for his brother Joseph is dead he's left alone if if if Mischief if some Calamity be fallen by the way in which you go then shall you bring my gray hairs with sorrow to the Grave chapter 43 and the famine was sore in the land it continued when the man said to us ye shall not see my face except your brother be with you and Israel said wherefore have you dealt so ill with me Jacob is very self-focused as to tell the man whether you had yet a brother and he may have added something like look this guy's number two in Egypt hundreds of other groups have come to him for food he won't remember you I'm not risking the life of Benjamin and they said Pro probably a little exasperated dad the man asked us straightly of our state and of our Kindred saying is your father yet alive have ye another brother we told him according to the tenor of these questions could we certainly know he would say bring your brother down Judah said unto Israel his father send the lad with me not with us with me and we will arise and go that we may all live and not die both we and thou and also our little ones dad you you may think he won't remember us but we can't risk all of our Lives hoping he will have forgotten us have become her husband to raise a child to her Judah had promised this to her but he didn't follow through he had no intention to but she needed a child preferably a son for her Security in that place and time if there were no male children of Judah then he would be expected to siren Heir for her in the name of ER because in that time and culture women had few rights leverate marriage was a way to provide so tomarrow sets a trap for Judah she knows her father in- law knows his habits knows his inclinations when Judah saw her he thought her to be in Harlot because she'd covered her face a cultural identity and he turned under her by the way and said said go too I pray thee let me come in unto thee for he knew not that she was his daughter-in-law and she said what will thou give me that thou mayest come in unto me Judah really didn't know his daughter-in-law the veil would cover her face but not disguise her voice maybe she used a different voice to maintain the deception I known a few people that use different voices from time to time and he said I will send the a kid from the flock and she said wil thou give me a pledge till thou send it she is playing him perfectly and he said what pledge shall I give thee and she said Thy signant Thy bracelets and thy staff that is in thine hand and he gave it her giving up his symbols of authority bearing his name for a moment's distraction and came in unto her and she conceived by him and she arose and went away laid by her veil from her and put on the garments of her widowhood again telling the world of judah's failure as her father-in-law and Judah sent the kid the Little Goat that he' promised by the hand of his friend hyra the adullamite to receive his pledge from the woman's hand but HRA couldn't find her Judah doesn't want to be seen looking for a prostitute to pay her appearances are very important to Judah then hyra asked the men of that place saying where is the Harlot that was openly by the wayside and they said there was no harlot in this place hyra uses a different word translated as Harlot there's two words in Hebrew for this there were women who were prostitutes and then there were those who were what they called Temple or sacred prostitutes kesa the word being derived from ho cadesh there's no Pagan Temple near the place where Judah and HRA encountered tomor the men tell them he's mistaken Moses is using a clever play on words here how so tomorrow is actually forcing Judah to do what the law required of him thus her action can be considered cadesh righteous using the term from Pagan practice to describe her motive we're taught to check our motive and our objective before taking action judah's motive and objective were clearly immoral and sinful but to Mars and seeking an heir for her own security and in compliance with the law and culture of the times were holy righteous it's a little hard for us to comprehend in this day and time and hyra returned to Judah and said I cannot find her and also the men of the place said that there was no sacred harlot in this place and Judah said let her take it to her in other words let her keep the things given her in pledge lest we be shamed Judah wants to keep up appearances behold I sent this kid through you so I could save face and thou Hast not find her I I did my part well it came to pass about 3 months after that it was told Judah saying tomorrow thy daughter-in hath played the Harlot and also behold she's with child by whoredom Judah said bring her forth let her be burnt again playing to appearances this now gathered crowd I'm the righteous judge she is guilty centuries later judah's descendant David would demand death to a rich man that stole the only precious thing a poor man had and the prophet Nathan would point to David and say thou art The Man 2 Samuel 12 we're often I'm including me and the we ready and quick to condemn others for the very actions of which we ourselves are guilty the reference here to David is also a text brother Daniel used last week in his teaching on repentance how appropriate for tonight and this portion of Genesis watch when she when Tomar was brought forth into the Town Square sent to her father-in-law she is taking a big risk here surrendering the evidence of her innocence of her righteousness if you will to the one who is demanding her wanly cruel death saying by the man whose th are am I with child and she said discern I pray thee who are these the the the Signet the bracelets the staff and Judah acknowledged them that they were his and said she careful it doesn't say he said to himself or thought well she he used the third person she not the second person you he's not speaking to Tamar at this point no judah's addressing the crowd which had gathered to see a young woman burn Judah had just realized he was about to not only murder his daughter-in-law whom he had betrayed but kill his unborn child as well for something he himself had done he's had a reckoning a realization of what he was and had become and no longer wanted to be that person a process of transformation had begun which we'll see comfort fruition in chapter 44 Judah said to the gathered crowd she hath been more righteous than I because that I gave her not Shaya to my son he's making a public confession 1 John 1:9 we read if we confess our sins he's faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness and he Judah knew her again no more Judah had just had a turning point he's acting on it repentance change in heart change in Direction it came to pass at the time of her labor that behold Twins were in her woman came to pass when she travailed that one put out his hand the Midwife took and bound upon his hand a Scarlet thread saying this came out first should have been the first born right and came to pass he drew back his hand that behold his brother came came out and she said how hast thou broken forth this breach be upon thee therefore his name was called perz which means breach afterward came out his brother that had the Scarlet thread upon his hand his name was called Zara when I think of this I think sometimes we raise our hand to the Lord but then we withdraw we have to follow through we have to follow through Judah returned to Hebron with Tamar and his three sons Sons Shaya FZ and Zarah his two decades of dulum running from his family his responsibilities while embracing his sinful life and culture brought out the worst in him and then in a critical moment the Lord used that to make Judah see himself mirrored in God's word like us today realize his sinful State confess his sin and repent turn around he wasn't instantly transformed but the journey had begun much like us just like me a broken human a work in progress but a work in progress Judah is a changed man now he's ready for his role with Joseph back to our story let's let's pick up at the end of judah's plea to send Benjamin with him to Egypt for their second trip to buy Grain he says to Jacob I will be shity for him of my hand shalt thou require him if I bring him not unto thee and set him before thee let me bear the blame forever for except we had lingered surely now we had returned this second time and their father Israel having seen them return observed the transformation of Judah relented and said unto them if it must be so now do this uh take of the best fruits of the land in your vessels carry down to the the man a present a little bomb little honey spices and myrr nuts and almonds bomb spices myrrh traveling to Egypt with the same smells that Joseph endured 23 years earlier in his journey into slavery and take double money in your hand and the money that was brought again in the mouth of your sacks carried again in your hand perhaps it was an oversight but take also your brother Benjamin and arise go again unto the man and God Almighty give you Mercy before the man this zaap and pan that he may send away your other brother Simeon and Benjamin if I be bevd of my children I'm bered and the men took that present and took double money in their hand and they took Benjamin and Rose up and went down to Egypt that trip will take them a week or so we'll let them travel wondering what fate May await them at the hand of Z andna pan when they arrive what a surprise awaits Joseph another shock the impact of sharing of the testimony of the repentant the confirmation of his surmising about Jacob we'll meet with them again when they arrive next Wednesday the musicians would please return it's so easy for us to see in our lives and the circumstances in which we find ourselves and lacking the larger picture to misunderstand others even those closest to us Joseph had lumped Ruben in with his brothers when they sold him to the ishmaelites yet Reuben was actually doing all he could to save Joseph and return him to Jacob Jacob whom Joseph thought had forsaken him completely was deceived about Joseph's condition and convinced he was killed by wild beasts he saw it on Instagram far from forgotten Jacob was in mourning and grieving for his favorite son Jacob had no idea what it actually happened to Joseph and Joseph had no idea what his father had been told but he imagined what he then thought must be the case and he filtered the statement from his brothers that his father was alive through that imagined truth a truth that was no Truth at all and felt at that moment even more isolated and rejected in spite of the additional pain his limited perspective brought him and even using it Joseph was being trained by God for his role in the first installment of God's promise to Abraham back in Genesis 12 I will bless them that bless thee curse them that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed we know the ultimate fulfillment of that prise is fulfilled in Jesus through the line not of Joseph but of Judah and Tamar he came to the lost the sick the outcasts Jesus did the despised the weak the poor the Hopeless the helpless he came to me let's close this portion of the service and worship and sing remind me it's all about him his love and mercy and abundant grace the things that I love and hold dear to my heart are just borrow they're not mine at all Jesus only lets me use them to Bright my life so remind me remind me dear Lord roll back the curtain of meory now and then show
