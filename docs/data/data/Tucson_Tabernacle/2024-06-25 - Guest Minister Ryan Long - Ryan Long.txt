tonight maybe 10 minutes or so and then we will go right into the worship service tonight um this morning good friend of mine brother Ryan first time I ever heard him speak was um was at a Minister's meeting up in Phoenix and the brother struck me as having a very very good understanding of this book and the thing that I appreciate and I've said this before and I I said it last weekend about brother Ryan the thing I appreciate brother Ryan is I don't believe that his understanding of this book is in any way swayed by any type of a narrative or any type of a u trying to fit the mold of a certain type of preacher and I think that's why brother Ryan is such a blessing is because he is going straight to the author amen and he is blessing us with his understanding and with his revelation of this word so let's stand as I introduce my friend brother Ryan brother [Music] Josiah thank youate can use me Give Myself Away I give myself away so you can use me take my heart take my life as a Living Sacrifice and though my dreams all all my plans Lord I place them in your hands I give myself away I give myself away so you can use me I Give Myself Away I give myself away so you can my life is not my own my life is not my own to you I belong I give myself I give myself to you my life is not my own to you I belong I give myself I give myself to you I give myself away just sing it to him if you [Music] [Applause] would I give myself away I Give Myself Away so you can use me let's just bow our heads as they continue to play that this morning I truly believe it's each one of our desire to be used by God to be a part of God's kingdom to be part of his economy and to be used by him in whatever way he sees [Music] fit the song is very approp roate we have to give oursel away in order to do that I have to give up my ways I have to give up my thoughts I have to give up my actions so I can take on his and Lord we come to you this morning not Lord with our ability Lord if we have any ability Lord would you just take that and set it to the side Lord help us to surrender that to you lord lord if we have our own ways and our own thoughts of being a Christian Lord being a person Lord worthy of your love let's set that aside this morning Lord would you help us do that and Lord would you just open your word to us this morning Lord yes amen not only just open the word but may it become a personal word not yesterday Lord but today a personal word today Lord for every heart Lord that wants to hear from you Lord that is in need need Lord that is in a trial Lord that is going through something Lord if whether it be a high or a low this morning would you would be a god this morning Lord help us Lord we're we're we're no good Without You Lord amen not one of us lord is good without you amen but I I really do believe Lord the sincere desire lord of the people that are here this morning that have taken the time Lord to to come and be in your house Lord is to give their own way and put it to the side Lord so you we may receive you Lord but we can't do that without you lord lord just help us to Just Surrender this moment to you Lord this next small time and Lord I think we would just be marveled at what you could perform in such a small amount of time Lord I think we would be surprised Lord at the lives you can change Lord in just a minute just be with us this morning Lord as we want to open your word Lord we want to read from it we want to hear what you have to say to us this morning amen Lord we worship you and we praise you Lord would you just inhabit our Praises now this morning in Jesus name amen just appreciated that song brother Josiah just uh just seems like it was the right song at the right time and really appreciate you the church here in Tucson and want to say good morning to you and God bless you and ask if you're just feeling all right this morning you know and and if if you're not feeling right and I I I seem to ask this all the time when I'm at home but you came to the right place if you're not feeling right if you're feeling down if you're feeling a little beat up you came to the right place this morning if you're feeling good you came to the right place this morning and if you're not feeling like a Christian sometimes I I don't know if you ever feel that way um I'll just be honest I do um this is the place to be this morning you know maybe when you don't feel like being here the devil will tell you you need to go somewhere else you're not you're not worthy to maybe even come in the doors you ever gone through that before I might be the only one brother Dan you ever feel like you're not worthy to even walk in the doors of a church because of something you thought something you did something you said that's just the devil trying to keep you right from a change from deliverance from something to take that that thought or whatever it might be from you and set it aside and and I I'm I'm so glad that you came this morning maybe despite what you have going on maybe despite what you feel you came this morning and and uh I certainly came here despite what I felt despite what I think and and I'm counting on the Lord as much as you are counting on the Lord maybe a little bit more maybe just I think a little bit more and I appreciate brother Dan as always is definitely definitely a true friend um just appreciate and love the people here in Tucson um so good to be here thank you for the invitation as always brother Dan um to those that that put in all the work last night I know you're standing a little bit and if that's okay I just want to take the time to thank those that that put in time yesterday set up the sound set up uh the the electrical the those that were practicing here for the last few days um the sisters and and that put it together the food and serve that it you know maybe somebody may not notice it but God notices it and I certainly notice it and I want to say thank you for that effort it it it just means so much and you just never know what a little action might do for somebody you know somebody might just come off the street and hear something and it it didn't come from a preacher right I say that again it didn't come from a preacher it came from a Believer but I'll tell you this you are all able-bodied men ministers you are all Ministers of the Gospel you may not stand behind this little 3-ft section of wood right here but you're a minister correct and what I saw last night was a Ministry I just wanted to say thank you I appreciate it it it was definitely a blessing and I hope that you continue it uh we'll read a scripture I know you've been standing for a little bit and um I just wanted to settle my nerves a little bit um you know just I I would ask you to say a little extra prayer for me this morning Lord just take these uh this nervousness away give me the right words to say that are his words you know I have notes and have scriptures but brother Dan as you know you just come up and you say Lord I want to surrender even these notes that I have even these scriptures to you may you just say what you want to say this morning let's turn to Matthew and we'll just move forward and trust in the Lord this morning how many how many came to receive something this morning all right so that's the best sign I could ask for right there because then I don't have anything to do with it I don't have anything to do with it the Lord's GNA use whatever instrument or whatever speaker he wants to to get to you if you have an expectation and if you have an expectation strong enough to raise your hand you say it's just raising my hand well the word says that that could be the difference between you going to heaven and going to hell it's just raising your hand up because you know what it is it's the song we just sing it's a lord I Surrender and I'm going to show you that I Surrender and that's what I got have to do as a minister that's what you have to do is sit and where you're at if we do that there is no telling what God could do in our presence today on there there there is not a soul that's low enough that he can't pull up to literally say you will be with me in Paradise today and and I'm that Soul I'm that Soul let's turn to Matthew 5 this is uh I I just I don't want to talk to you about anything new this morning I don't have anything new I just have what the Lord put on my heart it's it's a scripture I think I mean I think there's people who recite this scripture maybe don't even know it's from the Bible but I but I still want to read this scripture because it's what the Lord put on my heart this morning Matthew 5:13 Jesus is preaching a Sermon on the Mount maybe the most famous sermon ever preached and in the middle of it he says you ye are the salt of the earth and I want to tell you this morning that if Jesus was standing here preaching to you he would tell you you are the salt of the earth correct amen and and I don't I don't want to I don't want to break this down too much but it does not say you will become the salt of the earth brother Daniel I want you to try to be the salt of the earth this morning that's not what it says it says you are present tense the salt of the earth but if the salt have lost his Savor wherewith shall it be salted what a question it is thenceforth good for nothing to be cast out and be trodden Under Foot of man and I want you to notice this next to me he says you are the light of the world now now think about this Jesus himself God in flesh is standing before a multitude of people and and brother Dan I would expect him to say now I am the light of the world but Jesus instead under in insiration says you are the light of the world while he yet stood there before them and maybe that's just you say well that's just the way it was written if we could just grab a hold of how Jesus was thinking and what he meant by that I think it would change our lives you are the light of the world a city that is set on a hill and cannot be hid neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel but on a Candlestick and it giveth light unto all that are in the house let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven you may be seated I I just love to take these little scriptures and I just read past them I'll just be honest sometimes I just read right over them brother Aaron and and and you know somebody else will read it and I thought I didn't even know it said it that way if I just we just take the time and slow down and examine each one of these words he says let your light shine amen okay I I I just I just want to start with this do you believe that that these words that we just read come from God right that there's no trick question not right here do they come from God okay is God does God know what he's talking about amen this is good this there easy questions does God lie no okay so when God says something does he mean it yes okay that's good so then do are you the salt of the earth that's good it's sometimes it's a little bit quieter but it's still there are you the light of the world do you feel like [Laughter] it right I mean sometimes I do sometimes I don't amen that's the truth for me sometimes I do sometimes I don't and and I I want to I want to go into what the word says because you think okay sometimes I do sometimes I don't I must be a make believer I must be a doubter I must be this I must be that because if I don't feel like it all the time there must be something wrong right but does God lie does God know what he's talking about when God says something does he mean it yes okay then it doesn't matter I know this is just so so basic and rudimentary it doesn't matter how I feel if God is not a liar and God knows what he's talking about then I can look myself in the mirror and say you are you're you're no good you're no good but yet God is not a liar God knows what he's talking about and God said that I now I can't claim it for you this morning that something that that that that not even God can do for you is make a choice did you know that you know the I want to I don't want to get ahead of myself here but but when God asks you or tells you to do something in the Bible you know that he is there to do that for you we'll we'll I'll read you scripture for it but there's one thing that God cannot do for you and that is make a choice because if God could make you make a choice then it's not a choice if God could make you love him then you're not choosing to love him you're just you're just you're a train on a track and there's nothing you can do about it God puts before you a choice between good and evil between him and not him amen and we make that choice now when I come to that decision what are we going to do I think all of us will say well I choose God right I choose God but then hard time set in right hard time set in and then we start to question did I really choose him or even worse did he really choose me there's another scripture with this is similar and I just wanted to talk to you a little bit this morning about Salt and Light and there's a scripture this this this is the one I think we all know you're the salt of the earth but if the the salt has lost its Savor brother brother Brandon mentions this many times but over in Luke um and not to say that contradict but I just kind of like another perspective of this and Luke is talking about this same scripture if you want to write it down you want to turn to it's Luke 1434 and he says salt is good but if the salt has lost his Savor wherewith shall it be seasoned it is neither fit for the land nor yet for the dungill but Men cast it out and he says now if you have ears listen to what I'm telling you and and you know all the maybe the sermons I've heard about salt and and things they they talk about salt being a seasoning amen a seasoning that if you put a little bit of salt in in maybe a food if you put a little bit of salt in a situation it changes that situation and I believe that if you take just a little bit and sprinkle it here and you know maybe sometimes uh if you've ever heard a sermon on salt you you kind of like liken yourself to the salt and you say if if I just place a few Christians here and there it will make things better and that is true but there's so much more to what Luke is saying here about salt he says that if the salt lost its Savor that it's neither fit for the land or the dungill and if you really start to look into that and you start to to to study that a little bit salt has more uses than just a seasoning what they used it for in this time I'm I'm not a historian I won't I won't go into anything I probably get fact checked brother Dan but but you could look this up they use salt they had a they had a source for it the Dead Sea and the reason why it was so valuable is they actually used this salt as in their Gardens and in their plants and if you take salt I'm I'm not a chemist but if you take salt there's anybody ever heard of potash okay s in the Bible that is salt potassium chloride and they would use it because it actually promoted the growth of plants Hallelujah when they took salt now you would not think if you put salt on Plants it would do something but in this form if you took salt and you put it on your plants in your garden in your trees life would come forth to God gives you maybe another view of salt right now now what did he say in the first scripture you are what you're salt how many is that all right we got there was less hands but it was we got a few hands how many is salt am does God know what he's talking about does he lie okay so if he says you are the salt of the earth let's figure out what salt does and and I know I know maybe what you're thinking because it's the same thing I'm thinking brother the more you describe what salt does the less I feel like salt right oh salt does that too well I don't know if I do that but it's so beautiful because God doesn't say try to be this right you know maybe work on becoming salt what he's telling you is that you as a Believer how many can say you know what despite all my struggles despite all my doubts and despite my unbelief I'm a Believer that's in the Bible I I Lord I don't know what it is I I fail every day but I believe you okay then if you do that and you truly mean that then God is trying to tell you that you already have in you the ability to do this correct you already are the salt of the earth amen now I want you to notice he didn't say you were the Earth you are the salt of the earth and salt has another property it says here so in one sense the effect of salt is that it it causes life to grow yes and I'm not making a stretch of that that's literally the use for it but it says here it's not fit for the land if it lost its ability and the other thing it's not fit for is the D hill now you could say what is that for but you actually look up that word that is that is not the manure pile we're just going to get a we're just going to get a little bit country this morning that's that's the restroom and what they would do is they would take they would have a area where they where where the restroom was at and when they were when they were done they would take salt and they would spread it over that area because what salt did is it killed anything that was corrupt anything that was bacteria anything that was toxic the salt would would inhibit the growth of that and if salt has lost its Savor it's neither fit to inhibit the growth of something bad or to promote the something good does that make a little bit more sense now what it's it's salt well brother I just want to be I just want to be salty yes but what does that look like what does it look like to be salty what is it what is it actually to be the salt of the earth and and and if we believe that these words from God and we believe that he's saying something true but we don't quite feel like the salt and where is the problem at right and anybody that has any humility you would you any Speck of humility you would read that you are the salt of the earth you are the light of the world and if you had a little bit of humility you would say I just don't know if I'm in that place right now am I'm struggling with this I'm struggling that I'm supposed to be the salt I'm supposed to be the light of the world and yet sometimes I can't even be a light into my own path path wow I can't even see where I'm going and I'm supposed to be the light for somebody else am and what is happened when we have these thoughts what has happened in that moment when you think that it's because you think and I think we have something to do with it Hallelujah right there we think that it's because of my ability that I'm going to be the light to the world because of my ability that I'm going to be salty but salt is just salt it is what it is it doesn't have to try to be salt it doesn't have to try to be turn into salt it just is salt amen and I think the mistake that I make a lot of times and I don't know about you but the mistake I make is trying that's it is trying am I saying go do nothing am I saying just go out into the world go do whatever you feel like until God does something with you well there's people that have tried that in the Bible and the ones that belong to God got turned around real quick now that can happen but I'm also telling you that if you feel if you think and you believe that you are not doing what God is supposed to be doing maybe stop trying to do what God wants to be done and let God do it this song I Give Myself Away Hallelujah means that you don't have anything to do with with it Hallelujah it means that your ability is exactly what is getting in the way of God's ability sometimes we try to be the salt of the earth and just end up the Earth amen and and the problem can't be with God right does God know what he's talking about yeah he does know what he's talking about and I think sometimes this translate over that that we we think that we have to do something in order to receive God into our hearts now I know this is n just for the young people today but I I but I know that they are sitting up here and it's maybe it's for everybody but I but I want to talk to the young people because I want to tell you this that the young people today are special and I want to I want to read you something if it's okay I didn't I didn't really I didn't know if I wanted to read this or not just wanted to make sure that the time was right but my wife had sent me this years ago and I've never ever forgot it and I've kept it you mind if I just read this little thing she sent me and it's not only to you young people but it's to the parents that have children which I need to hear I I need to hear Brother Kurt because I'll tell you I'll be honest sometimes I have a fear for my own children I fear what's going to happen to them I fear what they're going to be around that's not of God the only reason I'm afraid is because I'm trying to do something out of my own ability for my children God says this don't feel sorry or fear for your kids because of the world they're going to grow up in now I don't know about you but I can look I can I can look at the world today and think it is so evil it is so bad this is 10 times worse than when I was a young person maybe a hundred times worse mostly because of this right it's not just the young people that struggle it it's adults too but because of this this little thing is oh I I can't even I don't know if you've ever said this I can't even imagine being a young person today and you know the truth is that's right because you weren't meant to be a young person today you know who's meant to be a young person today right here you can raise your hand you were meant to be a young person today in this generation why because you were made for it brother Dan I wasn't made to be young person in 2024 and God knows that that's why he had me a young person in in the '90s and the 80s amen but but our youth today are special because God made them to withstand The Temptations of today that's correct he made them to be salt when it seems like you cannot be salt he says God created and called them for the exact moment in time that they're in amen you think how am I going to I don't know if you think this as a young person how am I going to live in this I want you to know that God made you able to overcome this time when Maybe somebody else could not have done it and I want to tell you this you are the first generation that's going to overcome this age because the last generation had their age to overcome and you can glean from them and you can ask them for wisdom but you you are as the Bible says a chosen generation you are a generation that for the first time will overcome this evil age their their life it says wasn't a coincidence or an accident raise them up to know the power that they walk in as children of God train them up in the authority of his word yes amen teach them to walk in faith knowing that God is in control yes I meant to start a timer brother Dan I'll take I'll take a couple minutes off of it I know you didn't ask me to I just realized I I was meant to start when teach them to walk in faith knowing that God is in control Empower them to know that they can change the world you say I can't this world is is is lost I believe this world is lost but I I I was talking to my son maybe a week or so ago and I said I H I've had the wrong mentality for for quite a long time and the Lord corrected me through a a minister you might none of you would know him but a minister that came and spoke with us and the Lord just straightened me out I used to have the mentality of you know what this world is lost this world is doomed there's nothing we can do to save it just let it go I know that sounds awful when I repeat it to you but that's what I was thinking you know what you can't save the political world you can't save America you can't say it's turned its back on God all these things and then I got straightened out by a minister who said well we still have families that live here we still have communities that we can take we still have cities that we can take we still have states that we can take because God has not losten and I have this I have this mentality that that God just lost and not lost but you know the world is this and we have another kingdom but I live here now I live here now and I'm not going to be defeated in this world and then maybe go to the next World and I'll have Victory there we are going to be a Victorious people here I'm not going to be amen I believe that I'm not going to be the salt of the earth in heaven I'm going to be the salt of the earth here I'm not going to be the light of the world in heaven no the lamb is the light there where do I need to be the light H I need to be the light right here and there there there's there's people there's families who are struggling and they need to hear about Christ and to have this mentality that I had of well the world is just going to to Hell in a hand basket that's not the mentality of a Believer the believer has a mentality you know what I don't care if if 99.9% of the world is against me I'm going to go out and I'm going to witness about God because if I can turn just one person to him it's worth it and I'll tell you it's worth it because you were that one person corre that somebody took the time to tell you about God oh I was born in a message church so was I and I still had to hear about God I still went out and did whatever I wanted to do and still had to come to God you can change the world now this is not a a a you know a raw just get your motivation up this is the truth God knows what he's talking about God knows what he's doing and when he says it it means something amen it's not just God saying okay I'm going to Rally them up so they'll feel good no no you're going to come you're going to come to a test yes amen and God and the kind of God that I serve is going to be there in that test and say just step to the side give yourself away just a little bit and watch me go to work don't teach them to be fearful and disheartened by the state of the world but hopeful that they can do something about it every person in all of history has been placed in the time that they were because of God's Sovereign plan correct he knew now I love this now he knew Daniel could handle the Lion's Den that's correct amen oh Daniel poor Daniel he got plac no no he put him exactly where he needed to be because he equipped Daniel to be able to handle that how much more you amen how much more are you amen sometime do you feel like Daniel sometimes no not you you're actually Daniel do you feel like Daniel in the Bible sometimes do you feel like you can handle Lions Den sometimes I do sometimes I don't he knew David could handle Goliath he knew it's funny I had this down brother brother Dan he knew Esther could handle hymon you want talk about you know sometimes I think our sisters get left out a little bit right we have all these examples in the Bible but God used Esther God used Ruth God used Rahab God used women all through the Bible and and and you're and there's no there's no lesser amen it's all through the Bible amen he knew Peter Peter could handle persecution he says and he knows your child can handle whatever challenge they face in life he created them for it don't be scared sced for your children but be honored now this is for us parents don't be scared for your children or your grandchildren whoever it might be but be honored that God chose you to parent the generation that is facing the biggest challenges of our lifetime rise to the challenge it says raise David's raise Esther's raise Ruth's that's that's what we have to do as parents and we don't do that by telling them stay away from the danger ous things amen there's there's something else there's something else about salt that just it's just so beautiful salt has and this is you can find this is not my words this is right in the message salt has no effect unless it comes in contact with something man says this you have a piece of meat here and a barrel of salt here I imagine he was doing this and you've got to get them together the salt to the meat or the meat to the Salt to preserve the meat that's the way it is now if you don't you don't hear anything else I'm going to tell you listen to this sentence we've got to get the believer with the unbeliever yes sometimes that just sometimes I I think sometimes we hear no no we just need we need do we believe in assembling together yes we do but sometimes assembling together just becomes an assembly correct am we just become another assembly we assemble ourselves together so that you can regroup so that you can re-calibrate so that you can heal so that you can come together to go out and be salt to the Earth because salt in a group salt in in a container in a box doesn't do any good to anybody as powerful as it is the ability to promote life the ability to destroy evil does no good as long as it's in the Box amen I know this is so simple that you brother that's what you're preaching on is salt but but yet we have the ability to do this and sometimes we go I'm just going to I'm just going to be with those who think like I do who believe like I do well then I'm sorry but but but salt isn't doing anybody any good amen the salt has to come in contact with that thing that needs the salt in order for it to change it even has to come in contact for you to recognize that what God was saying was the truth because you can think oh God tells the truth and then God says yeah but you're the salt of the earth well well I think brother Dan's the salt of the earth amen that's not what he said he said you were the salt of the earth and I think sometimes we need to actually see this working in our lives we need to go out and actually be salt in order for us to go wow God know really knows what he's talking about yes because we're we're never going to say God doesn't know what he's talking about and yet do we go and do what he says there there's a disconnect somewhere and why oh I don't have the ability you don't need the ability you have one thing to do amen you have to choose amen that's the only thing I I I want to tell you this there's not one thing in the Bible that God asks you to do or tells you to do or commands you to do that he doesn't then come and give you the ability to do did you know that it's so beautiful the Bible says this I wrote down some examples he says the Bible says to have faith amen hallelujah right we I mean that's like the basis of our of our Christianity is our faith the Bible says have faith faith is the only thing that will please God and I don't know maybe it's just me but sometimes I find myself Lord I don't know if I have faith for this or I'm trying to I'm trying to have faith think about that statement I'm trying to have faith but if we search out the Bible it says that he delivered the faith unto the Saints that's corre so he tells you to have faith and then says oh by the way I came and I brought it to you it's my faith exact I want you to have my faith because my faith in my word doesn't fail amen he says the Bible says resist the devil and he'll flee from you am right anybody ever have any trouble resisting the devil amen I'll raise my hand amen amen the word says that if you have problems resisting the devil brother bam says then you don't have the resistor capital r inside of you yet you can go look it up he tells you to resist the devil but he's the one who comes in and resists the devil GL to God it's not my ability amen the Bible says to seek Him search it out though and he says you can't even seek him unless he seeks you first amen the Bible says to love oh that's a hard one it's easy to love those that you like it's easy to love those you get along with it's easy to love those you agree with and the Bible says to love even your enemy but then the Bible says behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon you he tells you you need to have love and it says by the way I gave you the love that you need to have so if you're doing it it's because I'm doing it yes the Bible says to confess him when the Bible says that if you confess him before man he says I'll confess you before the father there's not one thing that God asks you to do that he hasn't already done and is going to put in you the ability in fact he's already put the ability in you because you are not going to be the light of the world you are the light of the world and what do you have to do you have to choose he says we've got to get the UN believer and the believer together that's right you've got to get them into the church into the salty bunch of people you know salt makes a thirst doesn't it and if you eat salt you get thirsty and God wants his church so salty till the whole world will thirst to be like them just think oh if I can only live the way that woman lives she if she ain't the most sweetest peaceful person never out of humor never fussy she's always kind trying to do something to help somebody else why she's a credit to any man's Church yes sir that man's used he's he's a neighbor he's a gentleman he's just so full of the love of God you can see him at all hours of the night on his knees somewhere praying it's time to check up it's time to check up this morning he's always ready to do something he's always talking about the Lord and his Mercy that's the way to make the world salty you do not become you do not have an effect on the World by being like the world salt has an effect on the World by being completely different than what the world is that's the only way it can have an effect you you are influencing the world not the other way around it it says if you try to be like them you lose lose the Savor now you know salt never stops Becoming Salt you know if you are salt you are salt but I love the Scripture it says it starts it it's thrown out into the road and it's just walked upon what happens is all that salt just gets mixed in with dirt and you can't tell it apart you can't even tell it apart from the dirt even though it's set aside if we've lost what makes us salty if you try to be like the world if you try to talk like the world if you try to dress like the world if you try to think like the world if you try to act like the world then your salt has become of no effect to the world Amen they say well I'm going to go and I'm going to I'm gon to I'm going to be like them so that I can influence them over that's not how salt works I'm going to become like meat so I can salt the meat right no and I know this is just so simple but it's but but but I've done this I I've I've tried to be a light in to the World by taking on darkness and and and then then sometimes it's worse we try to isolate ourselves with other salt also no effect to the world Amen it it's just salt it's just light but it it it it it means so much when you really look at the ability that you have to literally you have the ability to promote life the word goes so far as say that you have the ability to create an atmosphere around you I don't know if you've ever done this and and I think I more and more I need to be careful about how I pray for what for the things I pray for I don't know if you've ever prayed this way Lord I want you to give me uh now you can plug in what you want Lord I want you to put me in a workplace where there's Christians at Lord I want you to put me in a school where there's people who believe like me Lord I want you to create Lord I want you to to just just keep me safe when I go to college keep me safe when I go to school you know may there not be anybody who comes up against me may I not have to deal with Spirits that's not that's not the right prayer you know that sometimes God will put you in a place where nothing else good is at because you are the light of the world amen amen I I think we need to be careful Lord uh we need to be careful about the way we pray Lord just put me in a place where there's no there's no unbelief or put me in a place where there's other Christians that's good it's not wrong to work with other Christians but what if God wants you in a place where there are no Christians because you are the salt of that place amen because you are the light to that place just a little bit of salt can change a workplace it can change a college it can change a high school it can change a church just a little bit of salt that's where it it's powerful what it can do why because it prevents by its own ability evil from growing and it promotes The Life of Christ prise the lord and it's like well sometimes we want to shy away from that I I want to challenge you this morning no no no you need to look pray to God lord where do you want me to be salty at I saw last night on the middle of on a street corner people wanting to be salty that's what I saw in a worship service and guess what happened people who were thirsty started to come they might even know I I imagine those those the Mormon Brothers didn't even know why they were drawn but you know what it is I don't know why but I'm thirsty I didn't think I was thirsty but all of a sudden I'm thirsty I'm going to stay well that's a good I'll just stay maybe just maybe just a minute longer and maybe just a minute longer and maybe just a minute longer is it because is it because we did anything oh sure there was singing there was music but it's because God he came down in an atmosphere that was made for him and God works the ability of us not us H uh the scripture says may they when they look at you may they see your good works and glorify the father I love that scripture because if the scripture had said if they see your good works and glorify you there's something wrong but imagine when the world can see your good work and the first and only thing they think of is wow there is a God not oh man this is a great sister this is a great brother oh I just really like them but no when they see your life they know there's a God praise the Lord and I'm telling you that's what it's like to be the salt of the earth I I I need to move forward if we're okay here fine what are the characteristics of somebody who is salty and it's right in the same exact sermon he's preaching he says if you want to know if you want to know what it's like to be the salt of the earth you want to be the light of the world we think I don't know what you think but sometimes I think okay I need to be I need to be strong in the Lord I need to be I need to be a a minister I need to be an evangelist or I need to be just uh I need to be uh so zealous for the Lord I need to be have this this Mighty faith I'm just telling you what I think I don't know if you think this way I I just need to have this this powerful Faith that's never defeated I need to uh all all of a I need to do this I need to do this I need to do this and he says let me tell you what the characteristics of somebody is salty it's right in the in the Beatitudes it says uh it's poor in spirit well I can say Amen to that one poor in spirit those who mourn you know what that means well well everybody Mourns brother no it means those who are grieved when they do something against God does that mean I'm I'm telling you the way that I think sometimes is well you would never do something to upset God right and then right out of the bat I fail well I guess I'm not the salt of the earth because I I said this I did this I know he's not pleased I must not be the salt but yet he says no no when you're grieved that you do that it's actually a good characteristic it's not the characteristic that you don't oppose the lord it's that you are grieved when you do am cuz many times our thoughts our actions not even intentional are opposed to the Lord sometimes I pray for things and it's the exact opposite of what I should be praying for and I had a good motivation to do it and yet when he comes if you will listen and take the correction that is a characteristic that I'm sorry it's not a characteristic that you could have naturally it is a god-given characteristic gentle merciful Peacemaker well I started to read these and I thought do I have these characteristics I I have to say I fall I'll fall short pure in heart and persecuted that's the characteristics of somebody who's salty and I don't It's just sometimes it's the opposite of what we think sometimes we think it's this powerful powerful Christian and to God this is powerful yes it is yes it is to God this is powerful being gentle being merciful you say no no you need to be able to preach and you need to be able to speak eloquently to God this is powerful and to God this is something that any brother any sister any young person can have in their life and I want to tell you something you already have it in your life correct amen otherwise the Bible would say become the salt of the earth amen but it doesn't say that and I just want to move forward it says um how did Stephen do it talking about Steph in the Bible brother manam says this and let your let your light so shine before men he never we're talking about Steven now the first martyr he never performed any Miracles although he know that Christ was a miracle performer correct amen kind sounds like sounds like me a little bit I don't know about you sounds like me a little bit he knowed all these powers and things but what did he do he just presented his life in such a way that they saw it was the power of Christ not the power of Step not the power of the church that Steven belonged to the power of Christ and I want to tell you this this is for everybody but this for the young people because I know what goes through your mind I know what goes through your mind you start to self-examine what you do you start to self-examine how you are and immediately you disqualify yourself from being salt right he says you may never see a vision okay but you may never put your hands on a sick person and feel the charge of almighty God make a skeleton of a man turn back to life again you may never do that you may never see him standing Yonder in three and four rainbows now listen that sounds Grand you may never see his image how about this you may never hear his voice I'm telling you there shouldn't be one person now that's disqualified you may never hear his voice but you can still be a signboard that will reflect Christ yes amen amen by a life that's been so pure and unadulterated from the world not cluttered up with dirty things around your life but a pure thing think about those words a pure thing that'll cause the Hungry Heart to hunger and thirst to be like you you are the salt of the earth and if the salt has lost its Savor wherewith shall it be salted that's right let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works see what you do and glorify the father that's in heaven signboards reflecting yes he says you are the light of the world I had this written down but for time I don't know if I want to go into the there's there's just real quickly I think sometimes we think of light in in different ways but the but the word talks about three different lights talks about the sunlight now we have a great example this weekend man when that sun is shining it's hot it's warm we feel we feel the sun race it gives life to things it causes it causes nature to renew it causes plants to renew but as soon as the clouds come over that Sun's gone that light's there but it can't be seen I think sometimes our light to the world is exactly the same way I think sometimes our light to the world is just like sunlight when it's good brother Daniel it's good it's good but then Storms Come and and I felt so good a week ago or I felt so good a month ago maybe a month from now you'll feel good about the song service you had last night but a month from now will you feel the same way Lord Lord I felt so good when we were doing that worship or I felt so good in that service what happened a storm cloud came over because that was that was a light that wasn't sustainable although good and it has its place the sunlight is not what we're trying to be we shine forth like Christians we look like Christians we read our Bible and pray and then sometimes one thing happens and that's all out out the window let a little let a little sickness come let a little heartache come let a little crisis come and all of a sudden we forget to be light to the world and the and the world no longer sees a Christian they just see a person and he talks about he talks about another light he talks about the light inside the inner Court he says that's when you're in the outer court and you're walking around in in in the sunlight he says but you enter into the inner court and now you have the seven candlesticks that are lit he says and those seven candlesticks are lit by Theo that the oil is the holy spirit he says that's that's not a light that being covered up by clouds he says that's that's a whole Holy Light that's when you've had an experience with God that's when you could say Lord I I know that you're real I know it's not just a flash of light outside I know it's just not a sunlight Lord I've had an experience maybe I'm not where I should be but Lord I know you're real lord I trust I believe that you're in my heart but I don't know that you're in my heart because he says sometimes those candles although they're great he goes sometimes they get a little bit smoked up amen sometimes he the candle goes out and you have to relight the candle amen he says but there's another room Oh Glory Hallelujah there's another room Beyond the Veil amen he says that light when you enter into that light amen it can never go out he says it's not and I I I had this in a quote I I'll have to find it for you if you want but he says it's not even this bright light he says it's just a a dim constant light always Shining and he says when you enter into that you're actually hidden inside that light am and he says he references the scripture when you enter into my rest because I'm telling you there's nothing that is more stressful than trying to be the salt of the earth when you're trying to do it there is nothing more stressful than trying to be the light of the world when you're trying to be the light of the world I I I'll tell you right now there is no rest in that amen it's constant stress constant worrying constant worrying about what you look like your image but when you're hid in Christ you don't have to worry about those things let let clouds come that doesn't affect the light that's in you let sickness come let death come I I I just love the word because he says well brother Brandon we uh I had a family member that got sick and they died he says praise the Lord anyhow I lost all my money I lost my finances my house he goes well just praise the Lord anyways there's there's a light that cannot be affected by what happens to you only you can have an effect on the world not the other way around there's sometimes that there's a our hunger our joy and our worship sometimes gets covered up by clouds and crisis and we start to think Lord am I even one of yours am I even a child of God do I even have the light and I'm telling you we're trying to we're trying to rely on our ability amen we're trying we're trying to be the light of the world we're trying to be salt but that's not how light works and that's not how salt works and maybe you'll even start to question whether you're really a Christian maybe you'll start to ask is it really worth struggling and fighting when it's just easier to give up right amen I know how it is to be young person and I think there's even I don't even say just young people there's us adults that feel that way am amen how can I be the light of the world when I can't even be a light for myself Jesus said in John he says are there not 12 hours in the day if any man walk in the day he stumbleth not it's good when we're walking in the day brother Kurt oh man when it's sunlight oh it's good to be a Christian when it feels good when everybody agrees when there's amens he says but if a man walk in the night he stumbleth because there's no light in him what happens when it's night what happens when the light goes out what happens when the clouds come when he says that you're the light of the world that holiest of holies is what he's talking about evil thoughts will come to afflict you but they don't have an anchor habits try to get back into your life they have no foothold over you why because you're hidden from them and it's such a paradox he says that there you'll be like a city on a hill whose light cannot be hidden and here's the Paradox of it is not your light you're hidden inside of that light think about that when you think about for that for a minute you think about Peter walking by the Gates of Jerusalem and he walks by I believe it was Peter I fact check myself on that one and just the shadow of him passing over somebody and that man is healed was it Peter's Shadow and how is a shadow cast when a light hits an object I I I could just picture it now if maybe if I were sitting there and I look up you just see light you don't see Peter you just see light because he was hidden in the one who has the ability to raise a man from his from from his feet from his crippled State it's not Peter amen but at that moment Peter was a light to the world Why by being hidden in the light it it's so simple and yet if Peter would have tried to be the light to somebody that's not how it works if Peter would have tried to be the salt of the earth it wouldn't have worked that way Jes you've entered into his rest he said and I I I just want to close I know this is maybe simple and it's maybe short I don't know how you feel about the short part button he says notice let us remember he also created our bodies and won't our bodies have to obey him that's that goes back to does God lie no does he know what he's doing okay then what's the problem and I think sometimes the problem is and I'm just I just want to be honest with you I think sometimes the problem that keeps us from being light and being salt is that we're ashamed of things that we've done and every time we try to be salt and say Lord I'm I I want you to be the salt I want to give myself away shame of things that we've done comes right up before our face and we turn around we walk away from the opportunity and and and that's the beautiful part about the Lord is that he creates I I think he creates the whole situation so that the thing you're ashamed of comes up before your eyes and he's right there and he says okay now I can't take it from you you have to give it Oh Glory and I created this whole situation I preached a whole sermon on a mountain about you being salt about you being light so that the thing that kept you from being it comes up before your face so I can take it away from you praise the Lord and and you maybe that's too simplistic but I think that's how the Lord works because I'm telling you when I picture myself Lord I I want to be the salt of the earth I want to be the light of the world the things that I think prevent me from being that come right up before my face and it's I'm telling you in those moments it's never what somebody else did it's always what I did and that's when you know it's true yes when you know it's the Lord showing you because we could sit here and think oh I got problems and it's you don't know it's because of so and so and it's because of my family and it's because of this my past it's because of all these things we have legitimate traumas we have things that have happened to us but if the thing that comes before your face I guarantee you will be the thing that you do the thing that you think the thing that you say and and and and it's the Lord creating a whole sermon a whole situation just to reveal to you the thing you need to give him Hallelujah isn't that powerful he's he's just so gentle about it though he doesn't come and say oh I don't know look at you you're just so you're you're so bad and if you give me this thing I'll make you good no he tells you you're already good amen you're already good it says salt is good that scripture yours the salt of the earth you're the light of the world and then when your own unction which is the holy spirit in you creating that that unction that says I don't know if I can be that because of this he goes ah there it is there is the thing that was keeping you from being the light of the world let me just take that from you but guess what you have to give it to him yes amen he say I don't know if I can give it to him I'm telling you this is the moment for you to give it to him yes now you could wait for some meetings you could wait for a prayer line you could wait for an altar call or you can just do the one thing oh Glory that is yours to do Hallelujah and that's make a decision Hallelujah and you say well that sounds like good good Baptist Doctrine yeah but there's truth in that there's truth in making a decision amen there's truth in saying Lord I don't deserve you I don't deserve to have this thing that I do taken away from you but Lord I need it gone and you can't do that until you really just face what you struggle with and say Lord I do this because I like to do it Lord I I like to do it be honest with them otherwise it's just hiding it from him it's saying well Lord I'll give you this little piece but I'll keep this other piece back here and then we expect to be the salt of the earth sometimes it doesn't it doesn't work and he cares so much and he wants to take your burden more than you want to give it to him yes amen that he'll create a whole situation that is thousands of years long for you to come into a situation where your own shame the things you do are right before your face so that he can gently remove them from you yes he does very good he says you surrender your thoughts to him Surrender Your Life to him Surrender Your Faith to him correct and watch that body obey what he says if that doesn't happen then he's not God and I believe he's God if that doesn't happen then he's liar and I don't believe he's a liar if you're a drunkard and you can't quit surrender that life to him and watch you'll drink no more if you're a habitual smoker and tried to get up give it up and can't do it Just Surrender that to him and watch what happens I'm not going to add to the word here but let's just make it for 2024 if you can't control this give it to him or is it better for you to walk around saying oh I'll defeat this I'll overcome this but if we read the Bible and you search it out you can't overcome unless you have the Overcomer inside and and I'm so and you know what I I'm I'm so tired of the devil telling telling people especially our young people you know what you need to get clean enough to get the Holy Ghost amen I believe in sanctification I believe in justification but there is nothing that cleans you out like the Holy Spirit now I want to ask you a question if you can live a life good enough to be worthy of the Holy Spirit then why do you need the Holy Spirit that's the question if you can live a life worthy of it then why do you need it Lord I want to be clean let me get cleaned up so you can come inside and God's saying let me come inside so you can be clean Hallelujah Lord let me let me be the salt of the earth let me be the salt of the earth so you can be a sweet Savor and he's saying let me in so you can be the salt of the earth Lord let me let me get cleaned up let me get good enough for you to come in and how are we going to do and I know maybe we don't think that or say that but we act that way sometimes we act that way sometimes oh Lord I I when I really really feel good enough I'll go up and I'll get prayer how about right where you're sitting right now you can make a decision and say Lord I'm no good but I believe your word and I believe you're not a liar and Lord if you say that I'm the light of the world Amen I don't see it I'll just be honest with you Lord I don't see it but you got to make it happen you want me to be the salty of the earth I'll go and I'll be willing to go where you send me but Lord you better make me salty cuz my salt it doesn't do a single bit of good for anybody my light oh it'll fade it'll fade I'll go out and I'll be a witness in my light as soon as a storm comes that person will stop seeing a Christian but but if I'm hid in Christ he says if you make that body come back in subjection to the word how are you going to make it subjection to the word if you're not in the word amen how do you even know what to make it subjection to get into the word oh we got preachers that's I'm sorry but that's not enough the preacher not enough it's not enough to come here on a Wednesday and on a Sunday and that's how you get your food amen right amen get into the word I'm preaching to me I should just sit right down there with you and say it that's the truth but you've got to surrender to him you've got to believe him he made our bodies they obey his will do you believe that he asks if you're a Christian you'll have to he said you say oh he makes our bodies obey oh I I don't I believe we have jurisdiction over them you know what that is I believe that I have the willpower I believe that I have the faith I believe that I have what it takes to overcome he says you're not fully surrendered yet you might have given part of yourself away but you haven't given yourself away for you are not your own you are dead amen amen dead and hidden in Christ and I'm so grateful that I don't have to rely on my ability to be the light I I I've never been more grateful than today that I don't have to rely on this person's ability which is none to be salty amen you yourself are dead and your life is hidden God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Ghost how are you going to get away from that I think we need a Revival he says our lives are dead we are dead your own thoughts are dead he says you think pure thoughts and I know I I know the first thing that comes up well brother I I might have a thought that's not pure it's got to go to die we're not exempt from having thoughts attack us but salt it it in inhibits the growth of that evil you might be attacked all day long but salt does not allow it to grow sure there's sure there's evil sure there's bad thoughts sure there's filth but salt doesn't allow that to grow you'll come in contact sure you'll come in contact but you have a power an overcoming power in you and your life is hid in God through Christ and sealed by the Holy Spirit until the next Revival no he says until the day of your Redemption and we know we've passed from death into life I I had other I'm just going to leave it there if you just I I just want to ask you I I'm I'm never never been one that had the ability to to inspire people for an alter call for for any of that but I could ask you a simple question you have one thing to do and that's make a decision now you said maybe you say I made that decision years ago you have one today you have another decision today he's a new God today he's a new God today am amen you say I decided I decided years ago I decided a month ago I decided a year ago but what about today and I maybe if we just close our eyes because you know I I don't know sometimes we get a little bit ashamed to even raise our hand maybe ashamed of what somebody would think about us maybe somebody would say well what do you have in your life I won't even I won't even have my eyes open but if there's somebody who would just raise a hand you say it's just a it's just an act it could mean the difference between life and death amen because at the bottom of that hand is a heart yes amen and and and I'm telling you that you are not going to become the salt of the earth you are the salt of the earth but if you have something that is in the way if the Lord's put it before your face and he's done that no man can do that no preacher can do that only God can bring up what you know is in your heart and put it right before you and I want to ask you would you give it to him this morning and I promise you that your body your mind your spirit will come into obedience to him if you just surrender everything to him it's such a simple request it's a simple message and yet sometimes I think we miss just a little bit of a surrender and maybe we surrendered but we built up our ability we built up our faith we built up our way of doing things and the Lord says no but today I want want to work through [Music] you and with nobody nobody looking around would you just if you feel that way if you believe that if you're sincere in your heart and I think he knows your heart would you just raise your hand to [Music] him and God you only are Lord looking at these hands and you're looking at a heart behind those hands and Lord you're looking at Lord a desire for somebody to be your light Lord for somebody to be salt like you are salty Lord and Lord I I I just I pray Lord that it's not just an emotional workup Lord Lord we could we could have an emotion and we can leave Lord and be gone a day later Lord but that real genuine change comes into the life of a person behind a hand Lord if they know you Lord would they just be able to raise their hand say Lord I know you but I want to know more of you Lord I've lived in your light but Lord I want to enter in and be hidden in that life forever Lord Lord maybe I've basked in your sunlight Lord in your candl light Lord but I want your Holy Spirit Lord Lord I want to be so filled with it so filled with it Lord that when someone sees me Lord when you walk into a workplace when you walk into a school room or you walk into a business Lord there's your people are drawn to these lives father and Lord we cannot do that of oursel Father Lord takes you doing that and in a simple prayer Lord just a simple request it it it's not a motion lord it's not a working up of the people Lord It's a simple belief Lord only believe in you and I believe that there's hands raised and I believe there's Hearts behind those hands Lord and Lord we have no ability to do this except you give it to us Lord and I trust you'll do that work father Lord would you just Lord speak to the heart if there's a hand raised Lord would you just speak to their heart Lord you can do it like no one else can do it Lord Lord no minister no mother no father is like you Lord no friend is like you Lord [Music] Lord just help him don't let him back away Lord don't let him be satisfied with just a feeling Lord let them know Lord let them only be satisfied knowing that you've come in Lord Lord that they're hidden inside of you it's not a process lord it's not years long it can be right now father would you come in Lord and clean up the [Music] house clean up the building Lord from the inside of out Lord those that raise their hand Lord wherever they walk Lord may they be a light

talked about the Apostle our brother mentioned Stephen Stephen was that light and he made an influence on people he lit up the world and there was a sinner young man there that hated Christianity he hated this religion and Stephen was that light and he spread his light before and this young man saw what he did and that young man took what stepen sacrificed and that young man in the The Sinner that he was that young man changed the world his name was Saul of Tarsus and God used the testimony of stepen because he was the salt of the earth he was the light of the world let's all stand
