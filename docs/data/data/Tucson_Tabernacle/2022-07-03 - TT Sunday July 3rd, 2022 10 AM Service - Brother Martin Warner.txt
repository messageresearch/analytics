lord he has risen from the dead and he is lord [Music] every knee shall bow every time comes that jesus christ is lord scripture tells us be still and know that i am god and it behooves us just to let go and let god sometimes we get anxious we get word we we try to figure things out and make things happen and god says i have it under control i've already seen the end and it is well and just for us to have confidence in that i appreciate you know the time of the the season here in the united states is independence day freedom from the rule of another government but today you look and wonder where is the independence where is the freedom but as i was thinking of that and i opened up the scriptures to revelations chapter 21 verses 3 to 5 of where the jordan would put that up and it said and i heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and this is what is and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes he says and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain before the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful you can hang your eternal destination on that and then revelations 22 verse 20 he which testifieth these things saved surely i come quickly amen and we answer even so come lord jesus in in what an independence day that'll be what a day that'll be just to think of those things so appreciate that sister priscilla always when i see her when she comes in i'll ask i always ask her do you have a song for us and appreciate that today good to be in the house of the lord today and we do have some needs and things to bring to your attention our sister zumbrunnen is asking prayer for her brother-in-law he's in stage four cancer sister kathleen there was a man that had already been put in a tomb and sealed and they closed it and he said lazarus come forth nothing is impossible for our god if we can't believe it just remember sister martha and caitlin and kenneth they'd been been a little under the weather let's just remember them in prayer for full restoration an update on brother simrock he was beginning to respond and actually talk back and wanting to eat the last i believe that was yesterday let's continue to remember him to the whole family at this time for complete health and restoration brother lyle's sister heather had gone to england they were going to be there they should be coming back this week brother ed and sister kathy left on for a couple of weeks and i believe brother peter and his family should be arriving tomorrow the next day from their their two-month trip also and then brother tony let us know that sister mary had been taken to the hospital in a lot of pain again this would have been friday they kept her overnight the hospital down in green valley they really haven't found what's causing the the pain the doctors are she's home now but let's just let dr jesus take care of that and just believe that together so we know this is a time of the year when folks leave they travel and and uh lord be with each one that is traveling today so if you'll stand with me good to have you brother dan heaven's back would you come in and take these requests and pray over them the lord is mindful of his children he says he even typed himself to as that mother hand that hovers over her little ones he's the same way he's with us today it's good to be back and see you all let's bow our heads and in this solemn moment as we're together and we know that it is written that wherever two or three are gathered in our lord's name that he would be with us friends if there would be a request that's on your heart something that's dear to your heart that that you need to answer from the lord friends if you would raise your hand [Music] that our mighty god might look down upon and see that hand almighty god how great you are lord and how you're mindful of your children we pray that that lord as as we lift these requests up before you cancer or whatever it may be that even the doctors may not know what the sickness is but lord you know father we lift these requests up before the almighty god that created these bodies that created the heavens and the earth that can heal every disease that promised us that you would heal these diseases father we lift them up before you along with these requests whether it be for family or friends or children lord whatever it might be that these requests would come before you in the proper way and lord that they would they would come into your ears lord and that you would answer lord we bring these requests before you with the faith to know that you are able and father with the remainder of the service we ask that you would be with us anoint our dear brother here as he brings the message to us father anoint our ears also that we may hear what the spirit is saying to the church father we love you and we have confidence in you in jesus christ's name amen what a mighty god we serve sometimes we wonder lord i might say lord what's taking you so long but he's got perfect timing in all things it's it's for the character building of ourselves not him he's he's he's everything he needs to be but sometimes we need some work and we just have to say lord help me to surrender help me to yield help me to give it all to you sometimes you you struggle with it because you're hanging on to your end of it and he's saying let go and let god have his wonderful way so we have our brother mark warner down from canada and his wife with us and i'll i'll let him uh it's there a little late celebration of your anniversary he said so i don't know how many people come to tucson to celebrate their anniversary but he chose to do so now we're privileged for that today so usually we're trying to go out of tucson especially this time of the year so let's remember those also the young people in the byc camp i know brother kevin and paul murray took some young folks over there and others and not just and i understand that portion of the young people wanting to be around the young people that's when we were young we did the same thing but you know but they would meet god because that is the blessed assurance that is the portion that holds them you know it just i remember as a young man in the pentecostal church all the young people would go to camp and all but they'd come back and then nothing would change it was from camp to camp but when you meet god that's where the change takes place so let's let's pray that that would be something for for those young folks to meet god and have that assurance in their life that god is with me he keeps me he watches over me amen amen amazing grace i don't know that we could ever sing that song too much because it is the grace of god in our lives how many would say amen to that no it is the grace of god in your life amen amen [Music] how sweet the sound always like me i once was lost but now [Music] i did miss one my mom is here today after her ear surgery i'm glad that she was able to come today doing much better just believing god for for a complete restoration of her healing but you know one of these days all of this will be i don't even think it'll be a memory anymore rather it'll be a rejoicing oh when we've been there [Music] make sure that assurance is in your heart that you will be there we've no last days to sing god's praise and when we first began let's pray somewhere oh praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god praise god we've seen that one more time through many dangerous toils and snares through many days first toils and snares [Music] have already gone was grace that brought [Music] thank you sisters that'll be all the singing will do god bless you today amen and greet you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen it's good to be here with you again in tucson as brother aaron said it's it's an odd thing to come and kind of have an anniversary getaway to the desert in the middle of the summer but you know i find god is in odd things you know the prophets preached on the oddball and that's what we are we're just oddballs to the world and we do odd things so i told one of my friends you know we're going to the desert to do some fishing i like fishing he said you're going to fish in the desert i said yeah i'm going to fish for souls i'm fishing for souls i'm fishing for a rainbow trout that's always on my mind you know the prophet when he went on his anniversary he went on a hunting trip he took his wife on a hunting trip well i take my wife on a fishing trip a spiritual fishing trip and uh i i met a rainbow yesterday at the costco amen they're all out there saints they're out there and they just need you to talk to them amen so god bless you and greet you from the saints in edmonton uh the pastor jerry fury his brother harold's son-in-law and also from the tabernacle end time message and the other tabernacles around edmonton they all greet you they sent their greetings to you so god bless you and uh i just had uh had something i want to share with you today i last time we were here we spoke on the missions and we had a service but this morning god was pressing me to to go this way so i have something on my heart i believe you know we we had many dangers toils and snares to get here we had plane cancellations flight cancellations we had when we just prior to the trip we both got coveted and we hacked and we coughed for weeks and then my wife got a abscess wisdom tooth an infection very painful on the nerves there was just so many other things satan tried to break my arm i'm supposed to get a a pin in here when i get back for an operation my hip hip gave me problems went right out my back my lower back went out many dangers and i'm sure you can say this morning coming to church just to get to church sometimes there's many toils dangerous but we're here and we're here to have church we're here to praise god amen we're here to give god the glory amen satan will try and he'll try but you know the thing about a believer is he never gives up he always if he falls he gets back up like that little bozo we used to get at christmas when you punched him he went down and then he'd bounce back up there's just some some kind of a bounce in a believer amen that you know you're down you're down you're down what else could happen and there's just something in you it just picks you up and it lifts you up amen it raises your hands amen like the brother saying this morning god's not dead i feel him in my hands i feel him in my feet i feel him all over me amen i know i know when his anointing isn't here i know when his presence is near i just don't go by feelings but i know when he's here amen we should know that touch amen brother aaron god bless you this morning and it's uh it's a privilege to be here and and to share a few things where aaron and i were speaking in the back and you know sometimes a message it has two or three parts or four parts or five parts or but i just i said i would like to take the two services because i don't want to keep the people too long and once you get preaching it there's nowhere to stop amen so i just wanted to bring it half this morning half this evening how's that amanda my wife is here she'll keep the time i'll know by her face amen so it's good to have my wife here god bless her and it's been 39 years brother aaron not 38 39 years amen amen and i wouldn't be in this pulpit this morning if it wasn't for her amen so behind every man of god every son of god there's a daughter of god amen and it keeps the balance oh praise god let's just pray this morning as we look to the word father we want to thank you lord we can greet the people feel the spirit of god here lord feel the liberty of the holy spirit lord i know you've lord dealt with me and i know you've been dealing with the people lord through the week and through the month or through the year father you've been dealing dealing dealing and speaking and speaking and as our sister saying now we and brother aaron mentioned we just want to be still now lord and have the holy spirit ears to hear what the spirit is saying to the church this morning lord we want to hear what the what the spirit is saying we don't want to hear what a man says we don't want to hear what a man's thoughts are or man's ideas but we want to hear what you're saying lord this morning to the church speak to us lord speak my lord as isaiah said and i'll be quick to answer the lord here am i send me lord father here am i this morning lord speak to me like samuel here am i lord i hear your voice i want to hear your voice this morning i want you to speak to me in revelation grant it lord and if there's any sick among us may they be healed father does any discourage lift them up if any depressed lord just lifted off them this morning lord whatever needs there are this morning we ask in the name of jesus christ that satan would be defeated lord that his spirit would be bound this morning lord and that we'd have our perfect liberty in christ this morning to worship you in spirit and in truth we ask it all in the name of the lord jesus christ amen maybe you shake hands with one another as you're seated wish one another god's blessing amen i didn't have you stand for the reading it's a little lengthy so i don't know if the brothers have it up on the on the screen or not the scripture esther chapter one esther chapter one amen uh we'll read from there this morning esther chapter one now it came to pass in the days of the hazardous this is a hazardous which reigned from india even unto ethiopia over 107 and 20 provinces that's really the known world at that time so he this king was alpha and omega he ruled over the whole world as it was at that time so that's the type we're we're looking at the king this morning the king of kings that in those days when the king of hazard sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in shusha and the palace in the third year reign of his reign he made a feast unto all his princes and servants and power for the power of persia and media media and nobles and princes of the provinces being before him so this is uh to the elders like the old testament saints he made a feast to them when he showed the riches and glory and of his kingdom in honor of of his excellence majesty many days even 104 days 180 days and when these days were expired the king made a feast unto all the people that were in were present in shushan the palace both unto great and small seven days in the court of the garden of the king's palace so this is like the new testament he had an old testament feasts he has new testament feasts and then he goes in to describe the the hangings on of the court and everything we're going to go to verse 9. and also vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king of hazareth vastis it was not vasti's house it was the king's house this is the we are god's house this is not the deacon's house the trustees house amen the pastor's house this is not my house this is god's house this is god's people but she didn't have that revelation so it belonged to king hazardous and on the seventh day when the heart of the king was merry with wine he commanded muhuman bizarr harbona big tha abetha zazar carcass and the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of the hazaris the king to bring vasti the queen before the king with the royal crown crown royal to show the people and the princes her beauty for she was fair to look upon so a hazardous the king wanted to put vasti on display he wanted to display her her beauty amen her royalty her as a queen now just think of us the church this morning the prophet said the bride will be on display and that's what the king wants but the queen vastly refused to come at the king's commandment by his chamberlains therefore was the king very roth and his anger burned within him that's verse 12 now we'll skip to verse 16. and we know the story that he was roth and his he counseled with his wise men it's always good to take counsel there's safety and a multitude of counselors you know we need one another we need the gifts we need the wisdom in the body so we look to the elders for counsel so mumukum answered before the king in the prince verse 16 vastly the queen has not done wrong to the king only but also to all the princes to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king hazards for this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women so that they shall despise their husband in their eyes when it shall be reported the king the king answered a hazardous commanded vashti the queen to be brought in before him but she came not likewise shall the ladies of persia media say and say in this day unto the king's princes which have heard of the deed of the queen thus shall there rise too much contempt and wrath if it pleased the king let there go a royal commandment from him and let it be written among the laws of persians and meads that it be not altered that vashti come no more before the king of hazardous and let the king give a royal estate to unto another that is better than she and when the king's decree which he shall make shall be published throughout all this empire for it is great all the wives shall give to their husband honor both to great and small and the saying pleased the king and princess and the king did according to the word of mamukum for he sent letters unto all the promises unto every province according to the writing thereof to every people after their language that every man should bear rule in his own house and that he should be it should be published according to the language of every people so uh we'll stop there this morning and we'll pick that up we'll pick up a few other scriptures i just wanted to give you a background to where we're at this morning what we'll be touching on this morning on this story of esther how many are familiar with the book of esther how many have read the book of esther amen it's a wonderful book and it's really a hidden book you don't you don't hear too many people preach on it that much i haven't in in my 40 years i think it was it was about 40 some years 42 years ago 40 years ago i was down here at this altar and i prayed all night and i fell asleep right there as a young person and somebody put a jacket over me and i woke up in the morning and we were you know we were brother aaron we were on fire we we were desperate we were desperate for god and you know there's a lot of things that have passed by but never lose that fervency young people you have a chance at the word you had a you have a chance at the revival your own revival amen so this morning i'll try to keep on my subject but like the prophet said sometimes you need to go over here because this one's down here and you need to pull them out of the ditch don't lose your revival stay in revival stay in a revival you can be in a revival if you're if you're in a hospital bed if you're sick as a dog you can be in a revival i learned that from a widow woman that met that met brother branham i learned that from her when anything would go wrong she'd say praise the lord praise the lord sister you know who i'm talking about amen everything was praise god all things work together for good amen whatever bad things are happening it it's it's a good thing in god's sight he'll make it work out so so here we see this morning the book of esther you know the prophet didn't preach much about the book of esther he talked about it in marriage of divorce so the book of esther is a is a wonderful book it's a book of a love story amen mainly a love story the king's heart he loved esther above all the women all the virgins he had a precious elected wife out of all those and that's that's his love toward us this morning he loves us he desires us to prosper and be in good health more than we want to be he wants us to give the holy give the holy ghost to us more than we want it he wants to give a refilling to us more than we want it it's but it's how bad do we want it amen this morning so a love story first and principally a love story about a king and a queen about royalty you know people get so caught up with england and and the platinum what is it the platinum anniversary yeah and it's wonderful you know knickknacks and stories about that and all that but you know that's not the real royalty hallelujah there's kings and queens sitting here this morning amen kings of of the of the earth of heaven and earth we're kings and priests the bible said so we have to rule over something god's given us something to rule over and this morning we need to rule over our own spirits we need to get in line we need to you know to tune those instruments get a tune-up amen from the neck up amen that's what we need a real tune-up a lot of times you know that's why we come to church you know sometimes people just come to church for the blessings you know and just to shout or sing or that's wonderful we should do that but this is the house of correction this is the house where god will speak to us sovereignly the king will come down and use a vessel one that he's chosen maybe an oddball like me out of the frozen north to come to the hot desert you know i have in mind i haven't been minding it at all i i just walked i got off the plane i said this is africa this just feels just like africa i'm home i'm home and i haven't been bothered at all just wonderful so praise the lord a love story it's a it's a book about election it's a book about headship it's a book about desperation about purpose it's it's it's a book about the church it's a book about feasts and rejoicing and and it's a book about war and the greatest battle ever fought amen it's it's a book you know that's about placing placing us placing the church placing esther esther had to be placed she had to be put in her position so she could avail so she could intercede so she could stand in the gap are you with me this morning amen any anybody identify with that this morning amen we can identify with bible characters and i just started to look through this book of esther and it just started to open up i thought my this is the book this is a hidden book this is the book of redemption this is a bride's book this is the bride's book it's been hidden you know until those seals were revealed and the light came through the messenger no one could see this do you know that esther really in the jewish or the hebrew meaning of esther there's a connotation of hidden means hidden to be hidden to be a secret there was a mystery around esther and amen and there's a mystery the bride is a mystery amen the bride is the mystery of christ revealed amen christ was the mystery of god revealed the bride is the mystery of christ revealed in you and me amen now those are just words i know those are just words this morning we heard that many times and we can say amen to that yes check check check but is are you the mystery are you the mystery this morning can you identify yourself as an esther do you identify yourself that way as the as the bride as the queen of heaven we wouldn't we wouldn't be so defeated if we were we need to lift up your head your redemption drive near amen get ready we're getting out of here amen it's time to look up amen i'll i'll try to i'll try to focus and stay with my it's hard it's hard sometimes but i want you to get this this morning i didn't come this far just to play church i'm not playing church anymore the prophet said we've gone to church long enough we've been here for 40 50 years some of us and and it's time we recognize like esther who we are amen not not something to make us proud not not to get swelled heads that we're in the message and we have all the knowledge no but to have the spirit and character of jesus christ amen flowing out from us amen to to everyone we meet amen praise god always with a burden amen so a book about so many things salvation redemption the book of redemption and as i thought about it you know esther she she needed to be cleansed you know she needed a cleansing esther i might shock it esther was a sinner esther was a sinner born in sin shaped in iniquity coming to the world speaking lies esther was esther was brought up in the message my she had a tutor amen mordecai just so you get the background a little bit mordecai was a type of the holy ghost esther's tutor king of hazard was christ the king amen the seven chambers were the seven church age messengers and they were one the ones that were telling vast he come in come in come in it's supper time and vastly the pentecostal church refused to be further pregnant with the word of god for this hour right is that right amen she refused and to refuse the holy ghost to reject the seal of the holy ghost is to receive the mark of the beast what a sad ending for vasti she was put away in divorcement amen but that's now think about it where are we at this morning where we had as individuals where are we at as a church think about it amen let the holy spirit magnify it let him put the the magnifying glass on it the prophet said we'll miss it if we don't have the token to magnify it amen that you have to have the token to see these things or they're just preaching the message amen just like i was in the catholic church for 19 years before i was saved i knew the mass i knew the the the emblems i knew the whole thing i could say it i could say it before the priest said it and that's the way some people brought up in the mess they've heard it and heard it and heard it but you need that something you need a personal contact this morning amen i'm getting ahead of myself but we'll get into that tonight but let's let's let the lord have his way amen so it's a complete book of redemption amen and esther needed a plea placing esther was a sinner saved by grace amen she had to go through a purification process she had to be called first she had to be justified then she had to be sanctified for six months with the oil of myrrh and then three months again with another oil and all the things that pertained to the virgins amen for what her cleansing amen some people sit in the message for years with with under justification or say or even sanctification but never get filled amen never get filled it's time amen you've got to have the wedding garment on before you go in that place and esther had to get cleaned up first hallelujah esther had to get cleaned up let the holy spirit clean us up amen that's why we come to church amen not just to see how good we are amen or or you know try to duck the preachers you know preaching sometimes and hide behind somebody else amen let's get real let's get real let's have the real thing or nothing god said i'd rather you be cold backslidden or or hot but not lukewarm amen god hates lukewarmness he hates it in us saints and i hate it when i see it in myself if i get lukewarm and slack and lazy spiritually and not no burden for souls no burden for anyone else just living my own life making my own living where are we going what are we living for what are we working for the prophet what are you living for what are you working for to live what are you living for to die and you're not fit to live until you're fit to die and that was the spirit that esther had to come to finally she had to be willing to die she had to be willing to come to that place to empty out amen after she had been sanctified after it's not just paul said i die daily we need to die daily saints not just one time oh i had an experience here at this altar 40 years ago some of you weren't even born 40 years ago amen you know you think of it how many were here when paul kane spoke in 1981 one two five you hear brother five hands paul kane spoke here i was i was at this altar we were praying for a crippled man to get healed but it doesn't matter how long we've been in the message how long has the message been in you amen how long how long you've been in the message but how long has it been since the message christ is the message been in you amen and if you need something this morning if you need a revival there's a revival here it's here it's right here in this church amen all it takes is one to start a revolt what was the welsh revival one man oh my i'm getting off my subject see praise the lord we'll never get through so let's let's but i feel the pull you you operate the gift you know we can stick to our notes but you know maybe you pull on that gift you say lord have that man speak to me amen i think i told that story here i was sitting just a couple years after that in the church and the lord been dealing with me about the ministry and i said well if you're the same god that's on those tapes and the woman said have that man speak to me and brother braham said you just said have that man speak to me so i said have that man speak to me tell tell me that i'm a preacher say martin brother martin is a minister i said well if this this is real if this is really real those tapes and only god could do that he said then have him speak to me and brother biscuit was standing there and he said by the way brother martin is a minister is anything too hard for god but we make it hard we we should challenge we should challenge it we should take the challenge of the word the word challenges us to believe only believe all things are possible this morning only belief amen so esther now you know it's placed the book is placed perfectly between you know after ezra and nehemiah because it was the restoration period and then the bride was restored amen the bride tree was restored and esther came on the scene amen so uh and so esther she she was adopted by mordecai and so she had the spirit of adoption esther had the spirit of adoption and the spirit of adoption is in the bride that's why she says abba father amen that's what draws abba father father that's what draws us amen that's what's that's what's in the bride the spirit of adoption so this i took this subject because it really presses me down and it challenges me and it reminds me as an individual and as a church that we hear what the voice behind the voice is saying amen the voice behind this voice the voice behind revelations 10 7. that was not brother branham's voice that was not a man's voice now i know you can go too far with that but it was god's voice it was the voice of god it was it was the voice of god to a generation to a bride and you've got to hear that voice not just the man's voice but the voice the voice of the man within the man amen so just so we get there and we give you the background a little bit and we give you the the types of christ the king and uh we didn't pick up uh haman he was the adversary the devil the serpent seed amen the seven chamberlain's mordecai type of the tudor the holy ghost see the story of esther is a story of election and i want to just hit a few points i want to hear election headship amen there's redemption also and there's other subjects that would take weeks to to take and break down but i just want to hit those couple this morning the story of esther is is a story of election of the lamb slain before the foundation of the world his master plan of his masterpiece esther was a masterpiece she became a masterpiece her name was written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world esther's name that's why she had to have a name change right are you catching it you had to have a name change i had to have a name change brother brown said i don't call you church i call your bride i call you mrs jesus amen you're not just you're not just any church hallelujah you know we're not just a lodge this morning you know some people are satisfied with a lodge the tucson tabernacle lodge well this is not a lodge this is the bride amen we're not playing church we're not dying we're not sitting here dying on the pew amen there's life here amen because jesus is here jesus is life amen the prophet said tell me what life is and i'll tell you what god is who god is tell me what life is and i'll tell you who god is he's life amen he's he's overcoming life within us amen the devil can stop us brother evans the devil can stop us he can try to discourage us well you'll never you don't feel like preaching again do you no i must well give up how many times was this my last service i think the last time i was here i said that in phoenix after i left i said this brother aaron this has got to be my last service i mean i'm in my 60s i can retire i've i've been through the mission fields i've i've done my part i've you know i figured i'm making a deal with god right just let me retire and drift and you know and then here he comes again here it comes again amen you can't retire you can't stop i'm sorry you can't god needs his soldiers he needs to place he needs every one of us what if there was no one here this morning to hear the word preach brother what good would be to be called to preach what good would be if no one came amen so we need one another we need every part and and this covet isolation thing that proves it more is satan trying to isolate us discourage us amen no communication oh we can't invite them over for fellowship because you know what like i told you last time i was here i had the rcmp after i come back from africa the rcmp at my door is that right mr margie checking on me because i refused to go and stay in a motel with a bunch of people with coal bed i said i got my rights i got a right to go home and be with my wife after being on the mission field i said i got a right to sleep in my own bed oh now here i go brother aaron oh my so the reason you know it's important to see that because esther had a name change she god spoke her name before the foundation of the world god spoke your name before the foundation of the world because the it was you know revelation 13 all all will worship him whose names were not written in the land's book of life before the foundation of the world why doesn't denomination see that why don't they see election amen election looks back to foreknowledge predestination looks to destiny amen we came from somewhere we're going somewhere hallelujah we're we're not just sitting around waiting no we're we're in motion we're men and women and sons and daughters of god in motion hallelujah like joshua he was a man of motion amen he wasn't a man with a stick he was a man with a sword we got a sword we got a powerful sword this word is powerful it's a powerful word you got in your hands you young people you you you schooled aged children you know you you that were raised in the mess you got a powerful weapon you just pray and ask the lord how to speak how to talk and how to not talk amen how to not say nothing sometimes just be an esther on display i can't walk like a woman so i'm kind of manly but you know she was on display esther was on display and that's sometimes all the world is looking for an example some a real chris there's there's something i met a man yesterday in the costco there was something about him and he did a favor from me a kindness and another man oh my they're just there's all kinds of opportunity salvation and redemption are two different things you can lead somebody in christ they could have salvation eternal life on the other side maybe inhabit outside the city just so easy they don't have to darken this door you can lean them to christ but redemption is to bring back that was was yours brother aaron you you were you were there hallelujah we knew one another hallelujah we knew and then just by earthly chance we came in contact amen god has a reason god has a purpose when i was laying there at the altar 40 years ago i didn't think i'd be standing here but in god's mind before the foundation of the world he orchestrated it twists and turns and ups and downs you don't even want to show your face in church you ever been there yeah we've all been there if we're real about it we've all failed many times amen it's not the failing it's the getting up it's it's it's the faith that he's a redeemer that he's a savior that that what he did on calvary that becoming an advocate was for me so i could get up again hallelujah oh i have i feel religious this morning you know you hear brother branham say that on the tape oh my i'm going to work in my truck and i'm listening to the tape amen and you hear the guy next to you with the boombox and and i'm going praise god praise god and they think yeah yeah he's one of us no i'm one of them i'm one of them i'm so glad to say that i'm one i'm so glad to see that that thrills me when i hear the prophet say those things and then speak to me right off the tape break to me amen that yeah you keep listening to the tapes and never stop listening to the tapes there's a lot of scarecrows out there but never stop listening to the tapes amen so where am i at okay we got a little bit of time so that the name was important because you know it's important a name is important your children's names are important what you name your children amen because it brings on a character and you keep calling them that you keep calling them that you see like the prophet said in the old testament the the patriarchs the mothers when they were in childbirth they would groan out their names issachar dan amen benjamin not knowing the prophet not knowing what they were saying prophesying putting them positionally in their place amen like he did us rather this morning positionally in your places every one of us you have you know other people can get up and leave or go here go there but you have to stay you have to stay it you know i remember i remember that that widow woman i lived with for three years when i came in the message as a single boy she she told me that one time and she lived an example amen she had many many supernatural things she saw elijah come up to her door different things happened and uh very supernatural she got to meet dr branham she put in her diver went to meet went to see dr branham this morning in edmonton isn't that wonderful but it's nice to be trained up i was trained up god sent me to a widow's house funny strange odd young man living with a widow in her 60s but she taught me a lot of lessons amen and we can we can talk the talk but when it comes to the pressure that's when we really shows who we are that's when we we really know if we got the goods and saints we need to have them if god crushes us if he whatever he does if he never never heals me again amen he's still god if i pray for 500 at this altar like i did in africa i prayed for 800 at an altar individually in a hot country because my heart went out to them amen if you're sincere and you come to this altar for prayer and you know god's going to give it to you god will give it to you amen but you see it's we're we're changing dispensations the prophet said in the rapture message we are changing dispensations we have not passed this way before in the message these are different times these are these are very different times for us a different challenge and oppressing the darkness is pressing we've never met this challenge before so it's going to bring something out of us amen just stay just stay with it stay with christ and that's what i did with the widow woman that's what i learned with her just all things work together for good. amen and praise god for it so the name her name meant something her children's names meant something when she named them see it means something and uh we we like esther esther had to be ester she could not be hadassah is there any hadassas here no one named hadassah hadassah it means myrtle tree means myrtle leafs it's from the tree the myrtle tree and it's it's it's wood so it's an it's wood represents humanity amen we know that amen that's why moses had a stick but joshua had a sword amen the wood there had to be a change from a stick to a sword there had to be change from a hadassah to an esther there needs to be a change in me there needs to be a change in us every day i'm not talking about last year's experience i'm not talking about last week i'm talking about today lord change me the challenges i have ahead of me change me to meet those challenges hallelujah is that what you want amen sister amen brother amen amen amen praise god little little child saying amen come on saints say amen to the word i like a good healthy amen like a good healthy handshake except when my arm is not pinned here i gotta get it pinned so don't don't shake my hand too hard after church amen so praise god you know she could not stay hadassah she had to become esther she had to have a name change she had to be adopted she had to be adopted her parents had to die young amen her lineage you know all her lineage will get into that a little bit here we'll have a little time to get into that her lineage was predestinated for ordained foreknown by god from the foundation of the world her grandfather her grandmother all those things it's same as us and sometimes we wonder why am i this way i'd like to be like brother aaron you know calm and you know just you look at brothers and you think oh man i'd like to be like that but he made us each different a flower in his garden amen for a purpose amen to to reflect his nature his character amen and all those things see there's a meaning behind the name and that's what uh esther meant esther means in the hebrew star esther means in the persian star but the hebrew un underneath see in the hebrew this is an eastern book saints this is an eastern book and i never understood why brother bran would say that like we didn't have the understanding and we're english like we have the king james bible you know we we we we the prophet came out of america and he said it's an eastern book and there's hidden things and i never understood that so i'll start to look at some of the customs some of the culture some of the ways of the hebrews amen they're they're interwoven and we have some of those same ways and when we have some of those same cultures there's the same thing in the bride because we're we're of the same lineage we are we are the true hebrews we are the sons of abraham amen we we were there with him before the foundation of the world the same as they were there before the foundation of the world their names were written our names were written amen it's just that he's showing us a type here so in the persian yes so um i was reading i was looking into it and as i read this this esther two and five if you could put up real quick brothers i'm trying to look at that time because i don't i don't carry a watch but is that 11 30 on the on the back thank you brother so esther two and five i wanted it to read it from uh but we'll read it from from the scripture um now there in shushand there the palace there was a certain jew whose name was mordecai the son of jared the son of shema shemia the son of kish this a benjamin benjaminite who had been carried away from jerusalem with the captivity which had been carried away with draconia king of judah whom nezukanezer the king of babylon had carried away so this this uh this lineage i looked into it the lineage there was a rabbi so i looked it up and i found yeah that's true shimmy i was esther's and mordecai's grandfather and their fathers what was shimiya's sons right so i looked it up and uh and the tigrum which is is a hebrew commentary on the scripture culture weighs different things and interpretations it's an oral teaching on the scripture that started in about the time of ezra and so he says in there he says that mordecai was the descendant from shemiya benguria as as was esther so mordecai and esther were descendants of shimei and the day and that david's attitude to towards shimaya was initially due to his prophetic knowledge of the two saviors of israel that were to come from him so esther and mordecai came from shimaya and you know shimayi was the one that cursed david remember he cursed david said you bloody man you he cursed him the bible said with an evil wicked curse you bloody man all these things are coming on your head now david was walking up the hill a rejected king running from absalom his son right and walking up that hill and here's shimiya coming along the prophet said pointing his finger at david the prophet said he was a spiritual he was accusing his brother he was of the tribe of israel they were all israelites he was a benjamin he was a tribe of benjamin you know and i find that that evil spirit amen a brother will accuse the brother amen we see it right here amen and he had no right to do that he paid for that he died an awful death he paid it for that but he was still an israelite see enemies enemies within enemies without and now you know what i preach on in the mission field these are some of the things we get into shimmy and i still elect just like saul he took that javelin man david he wasn't he wasn't aiming for the wall he was aiming for david and he just let her fly sometimes you'll see those arrows just whoa where are they coming from the house of my friends oh we're getting real this morning we're getting real we know how we we have to know satan's tactics but what was what was david's attitude towards saul i wouldn't touch the hem of his garment it smote him to touch the hem of saul's garment but an evil spirit was on saul he became an enemy of the lord see and sometimes we'll get into it but sometimes saints we need an enemy esther needed an enemy he said she needed an enemy yeah to bring out esther not hadassah not this but at the esther inside you need an enemy i need an enemy it brings out the best in us sister marjorie it brings out the best in us it shows the real us when we're under pressure from within from without accusations as young people not being true at all some deacon accusing you some pastor some preacher accusing you of something you didn't do you lived through that and stay in the message and not say what do i need that for right you need it to bring out christ in you to bring out your adoption to bring out your election brother joel amen hallelujah we needed saints it's not easy it's not easy to go through it he didn't he didn't say it would be easy he never said the mountain would be hard to climb but he promised he'd be there on time amen he promised he'd be with us as young people you got a challenge ahead of you you that were brought up in the message you had a real challenge but identify with esther this morning she had challenges but she needed an enemy amen more of shimmy i was that enemy but it didn't matter to esther what she heard the testimonies she heard about that cursing about her grandfather cursing david she had heard about those things those bad things that happened in the message but it never bothered her amen she just kept walking she just kept stay she stayed humble under the tudor mordecai she stayed faithful to church she kept going to church anyway even if everyone left she she was going to go to church if she was going to be the only one there she'd be there hallelujah that's what god's looking for sister angelo that's what he's looking for that character amen if my mother doesn't go don't bother me my father doesn't go don't bother me if my son my daughter doesn't go don't bother me actually that's what they're looking for they're not looking for you to compromise with them they're looking for you to stay stand take your stand i'm standing for this oh yeah we heard dad on the internet about all this false this and that and yeah i'm taking my stand i'll die on this i'll stand and i'll die on this i believe this i don't care how many internets there are amen the internet is not our friend amen the internet will shut us down one day amen so she needed that name change because her lineage see her lineage she had to have something different than her grandfather her grandfather was in the message but she needed something different amen she needed a she needed the baptism of the holy ghost which shimmy i never had or he would have never cursed david you say well they didn't have the baptism the holy ghost they had the spirit of god amen and that was not the spirit of god amen so so mordecai was esther's cousin her father's nephew their fathers were brothers mordecai and esther's shimmy i being mordecai and esther's grandfather and a brother to saul no wonder he cursed that's my brother yuki you know tribe of benjamin cursed david on the run from his own son rejected king david had to experience that now i'm talking about election here david had to experience rejection we all have to experience rejection we all have to experience rejection can i hear an amen amen we all have to go through that friends family church members preachers misunderstandings we all go through it amen it's needed this too is needed amen so uh david needed to enrich his experience with that so you know uh but god made david's and and esther's too he made his mistakes work for good he became a rejected king by his own doing david's own doing his own mistakes in the flesh with bathsheba yeah that's why it came to visit him right in his own home we pay for it one way or another and you know what the prophet said about that he said david was exposed because he was elect he said the others hide the others would run but god put david's sin away samuel said god put your sin away he forgets it he forgot it amen if we could just do that as message people you know we're ra ready we're willing to give service and say oh well yeah i forgive you or we forgive you but will we restore that person is this not a restoration message is this not the restoration we're in don't we believe in elijah that will restore i will restore amen we you know people fall people make mistakes people and we oh there that's it yeah we forgive them but what about restoring about restoring them god forgot you know there's a saying that says you know to to air as human to forgive is divine but i i say to air as human to forgive his divine but to forget is eternal churches can forgive the church if you want to just stay i don't want to just be a church that's forgiven i want to be a church i want to be a bride that's justified that god doesn't even see it it's not in his mind it will never come into his remembrance amen when you think of when saul and david are sitting there they're not going to be talking about yeah do you remember the time by the grace of god you know when you threw that spear i just ducked out of the way they're not going to be talking about that it's not going to be david the adulterer it's not going to be rahab the harlot it won't even come into mind you won't even remember those things saints amen why hold it here well you won't even remember it there amen somebody got an amen hallelujah that should make you jump and shout and dance about amen all of my mistakes all of my failures he's forgotten them they're not there and i remind them oh i wish i could take that back what i said what i did and god says what what what grow up you grow up what's sin what sin blessed is the man the woman who god will not impute sin whose transgressions are forgiven and will not impute sin you cannot sin the prophet said see we got it we got to take that this morning i'm glad you're saying amen because you become the word as you amen the word as you receive the word you become that amen you're putting on the you're putting the sword up this morning you're putting the shield up no satan it's gone i repented for that thing i made a confession over that i went to the church i went to the deacons i went to the pastor i made my conflict confess your faults one to another amen that you'd be pray for one another that you'd be forgiven amen these are basic principles i know but we're forgetting them we're forgetting them in the message and i was born and raised spiritually in the message on those fundamental things i am not a legalist i don't think i'm a legalist but i've been booed out of pulpits in the message i've been moved boo how'd you like to stand up here brother aaron people boo you boo where you coming from boom just keep on preaching keep on preaching keep on preaching keep on preaching a lot of things happen so she you know her grandfather my just because your parents left the message there's that's one that you really can shine i know a young man in our assembly he's in the message he just come back to the lord he'd been backslidden from the message for since he was 12 years old or 13 years old his parents split up and his mom became a lesbian in them they were in the message both of them and and and something else happened there's father and different things terrible terrible things that how could you ever but god rich in mercy got a hold of that young boy 19 year old boy's life and he said this world is crazy there's got to be something real here there's got to be a god somewhere said i heard about a god when i was in church 10 years old i heard about a prophet where is that prophet i get a phone call amen i want to get right with god then praise god brother that's god in you that's not you that's god and you wanting that or you would never want to come amen he's serving the lord now amen brother aaron he's sitting on the front pew and he's clapping his hands like he was always there amazing testimonies and and have a dysfunctional family like that now his testimony his dad is coming his dad is coming along hallelujah you take the long road home but he took the long road around because so many things happened so many awful things can happen bad things happen to good people sometimes amen but he's coming home amen that young man is going to say going to be the cause god's going to use him for his parents i don't care what they're in i don't care how messed up how perverted how god if there's a seed inside there was a seed in rahab there was a seed and root there was a seed in esther amen and it draw it brought them to the king it brought them to election so i want to i want to just kind of yeah we got a few more minutes we just kind of wind this up on election i never got to head ship yet oh my that's a that's a hard one headship election is a little easier to speak on but headship my so anyway christ was an esther see and and that lineage she had amen even the bad things didn't stop her god was protecting the seedline amen because david could have cut off his head but he said now prophetically he knew that saviors that be that shimayai was an israelite and that was the seed of god and the seed would come through shimei producing mordecai and esther two redeemers that's why the book of esther does not talk about christ it doesn't talk about the future coming of christ because esther was christ mordecai was a type of the holy ghost which is christ it was all christ it was all god redeeming she had to stand in in the gap to redeem her people in a time of a death sentence amen the same as us in this hour gross darkness is upon the people we're living in the darkest hour amen and there's no that's just not painting a bad picture that's the way it is amen look at your gas prices i told a woman at the car rental i said she said how much you pay for gas i said oh probably about ten dollars your your money what yeah you're paying five or six here yeah in canadian right we're paying a lot more ouch ouch it's starting to hurt amen it's it's it's the squeeze it we're being squeezed they meant economically spiritually many ways the squeeze is on we're feeling it now america is feeling it canada is feeling it so we are here for such a time as this we've been placed positioned called elected you know esther needed the justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost she had to go in unto the king's chamber the holiest of holies right she had all those steps and we have to too amen no one else like esther no one else could take her place no one had the same looks as esther no one pleased the king more than esther amen no one had the same smile no one had the same fingerprint no one had the same eyes or mouth or teeth or lips it meant as you you're all we're all individually different amen and god loves us everyone amen just the way we are warts and all amen he loves us warts and all right that's our god aren't you aren't you glad for that you know what that's that's why esther is a book of love that's why all these things he had to go through all these things that we're not getting into but she had to go through all those stages so to show her love for god god showed his love for her by election how do we know his love by election not by how we feel not by how things are going amen but by his election he called you to this message he gave you a revelation of this message he put this message in your heart you couldn't leave this message if you sat on a bar stool tomorrow you could not leave this man this left message would not leave you christ would not leave you he would not forsake you you could forsake him but he won't forsake you amen i had a testimony of her brother just reminded me of that because he was sitting on a bar still raised in the message godly father preacher and these guys were thrown off on christianity said you know what do you know where a real one is he says yeah i know there's a real one he's he's home sitting in the house it's my mother he's a godly woman he's been a christian all her life and he said i've seen more miracles well i could never deny it you know and they laughed and he got up off that bar stool and he left and he went home and he got on his knees and he repented and he's never been back to the bar and he's a solid pillar in the church many many years but he's sitting on that bar still like that woman you know that that that her husband tested her brought friends home and threw the eggs and all that stuff on the floor and ah picked that up you know i don't like my eggs that way and oh must jesus bear the cross alone and all the world go free there's a cross for me to bear and there's a cross that'll set me free too amen amen many things now i don't know if i'll just get into into headship but uh yeah headship's coming maybe we'll just touch on it this this evening and uh how am i doing sister merger she's smiling so i'm doing okay amen there's so much here but election saints amen you can never get away from your election and that if that's one thing sitting under the ministry of brother hildebrand for so many years i understood what election was amen i understood what election was and i understood what headship is and in those years you don't you don't realize what you're being prepared for but you're being prepared for something and it's going to come into use like esther even after she was in the king's palace she performed the the commandment of mordecai just the bible said as she did when she was with mordecai see no matter where she was that stayed with her what she was taught by the holy ghost the holy ghost teaches amen god uses the man but it's the holy ghost that's teaching us right i never i said in all the years i sat under brother hildebrand i've never got a revelation from brother hillebrand never once got a revelation from my pastor the holy ghost gives us revelation and he's the vessel that just speaks it then you get a revelation brother dan greetings from brother brother uh ed hamilton from edmonton different ones amen you get a revelation i get a revelation we come together when a brother preached there that night he preached on the serpent seat and i'd been three services on the serpent seat just before i came here i said that's why i say amen amen and he brought out things i could i never saw see and it's it's the angle of the diamond right everything reflecting through and oh my it's beautiful it's a rainbow amen so you know we're coming to that time saints when we need to put on the stabilizers amen the pressure is on and uh you know if i had i had more time i you know we're we're living in uh an age a day when we see the word not of joel 2 28 you know the day of pentecost but joel chapter 3 the valley of decision the valley of decision joel chapter 1 talks about the restoration of the church and the bride tree joel chapter 2 talks about the book of acts and and the and the the new birth the new testament church the birth of the new testament church and joel chapter 3 talks about the day of the lord right in that same book and this is that what we're seeing now this is that what joel chapter 3 talked about gather all the nations bring them down to the valley of this of jehoshaphat would mean judgment amen we maybe get into that but i don't want to go in get into that now but that's where we're at and ukraine is right in joel russia is raiden joel all those types of raid in joel that we see it happening right in front of us and satan's trying to numb us what how with television with uh internet internet's television i don't watch tv i remember that's why i got booed out of one church i talked about not having a tv in my home and they booed me out and the guy came to me after he said well okay you're preaching now you're a legalist he said you're preaching on tv do you have a tv i said no i don't have a tv amen he thought you know i was a legalist preacher and i said no i said i wasn't saying the holy spirit told me to say that and that and now i can see why because you got a tv in your house don't you he said yeah that's taking your time brother that's taking your it's not what you watch it's how much it's the time you spend on that silly phone see i left my phone brother isn't that great oh that's what i do in africa i go whoop i can't get reception so don't need it what did paul do paul wasn't on the internet paul didn't have a cell phone oh and it went around the world the message went around the world why because hungry seed called for a preacher and and took them over the seas right down into that go to that village right there on the map go to that one there's seed in there amen that's how it works amen we don't need to rely on so much of these things and we don't need to get distracted saints by so much of these things it's not evil things that we watch i heard the prophet say the other day you know if you love the world or the things of the world he said that's the evil things not talking about the beautiful things the things you can enjoy he said those that's all right take a vacation go see somewhere beautiful do something nice all those things have fun we can do that amen but the evil thing see that's like i told you last time when i was in that uh in africa and i asked the man about the mamba he said the mamba yeah i see the mamba all the time and he said it just you ever see him on a highway i he said no he said because they they like to get in the bush he said well he said i said that's that's what brother branham said the mamba was on the internet highway he was on the internet highway that's where he was he was slithering just just you know see and and catch your eye see if that mamba can catch that bird's eye he can charm them out of the tree out of the bride tree he can charm them down i mean little things

says we are in heavenly places and he says that's the christian's position in christ part of him and i think as he was just speaking that talking about esther and the representation going back to the scripture part of david part of and it goes all the way to back to the back part of the mind of god a representation and that's what's drawing you that's what's calling you that's what's saying come up closer today and as i was listening to it just hearing what god is speaking to us through using our brother to imagine what god has done for us and you can't even begin to understand it but you can't believe it you can't accept it and what came out of my heart was bless the lord o my soul and all that has been within me bless his holy name for he has done great things amen here through the book of esther you can look and say hey that's me lord that's me lord there's a representation there how many would say amen to that today that's me lord whatever little part it is whatever great part
