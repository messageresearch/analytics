coming we've been moving to tucson for a year now and we have finally brought the last box in the last suitcase and the last trinket and everything else it's amazing how much you accumulate over the years so we're going to start accumulating again here in tucson now joshua chapter 4 verse number 5. and joshua said unto them pass over over before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan and take you up every man of you as stone upon his shoulder according unto the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones let's pray heavenly father lord this great scripture i pray that the same spirit that wrote this scripture down would be with us this evening and father would be present among us and that we could understand what you meant by this scripture in jesus christ's name we pray amen you may be seated and that's the name of my sermon tonight is what means ye by these stones first i want to thank thank some friends i want to thank of course brother aaron he texts me every once in a while i've been in jeffersonville keeping track of me and brother lyle the same i i appreciate you know you appreciate being on people's minds and i don't want to ever take that for granted i appreciate my friends i appreciate also my former friend back there brother matt mcfadden last wednesday he told everybody how much younger my wife looks than i do so brother matt you made a friend in my wife but maybe it's a little different with me um and i see an old friend back there that maybe 20 years ago brother heath and i were close friends and and uh we went our separate ways and i went across the country and and now brother heath it's nice to be back together again it's good to see you my brother god bless you um i had a dream on the way out here when stephanie and daniel and i were moving you know we had the we had the trailer in the truck and we were driving and um we stopped at a hotel at night i believe it was in oklahoma city and uh i had a dream now dreams we have to be careful with dreams they're not always spiritual sometimes we can dream dreams that that it's just maybe something that we want or or we can have bad dreams that that they're not real and and this one as as i want to tell this dream i don't want to i don't want to read anything into it but it sure did encourage me and uh what happened was i had just arrived in tucson and i uh i went to a gathering and it was this church and we were we were in a place that there was a courtyard it could have been here at the church and i saw i came in and i saw there was a sister sitting uh sitting in the courtyard in a chair and and she was very happy and everybody was just everyone was so happy and then i saw a brother aaron and aaron comes in and he was so excited and he looked and he looked so young he looked like he was about 25 years old black hair and uh i just admired him i thought nice a good looking guy you know and he was broad shoulders you know and and he came in and he was excited and he says he says i just witnessed to the church across the street and he said and to the apostolic church down the road and he said there's going to be people coming to the to the services from from those churches and brother aaron was really excited he was he he had he had fire in him and then there was another man i didn't recognize he was another hispanic man another young man and then he came in and he said he said some of the some of the people that have gone some of the of the young people that have gone he says i've witnessed to this person and this person and this person and they're going to start coming back to church and and there was there was such a joy and i remember seeing that that sister that was sitting in in the middle of the courtyard there and she was so proud and she was just so happy she was an older sister and she was just she was just sitting back and just enjoying it and everyone was so excited and and i thought to myself before i woke up from my dream i thought wow they're really doing it the lord is really using them they're really doing it and then i put my head down and i said lord all they needed was a little bit of hope it was there they just needed a little bit of hope and and then i woke up and so excited i couldn't wait till stephanie woke up to to tell her the dream and you know that next morning i said i had just i was so encouraged i had just the best dream so i'm encouraged and i'm just excited about the church i'm excited about tucson and like i said it may be nothing to it but it sure meant something to me so i'd like to talk about this great thing that happened with joshua now joshua was with moses all these years 40 years in the wilderness and all those old fighters had passed away and the problems when they were out in the wilderness wilderness wandering around for 40 years back and forth and the geographic area that they were in was fairly small you could you could walk across it and many times in a few days or even shorter so they they were they were going around and i would assume that they were fairly discouraged moses went up on the mountain and went to be with the lord joshua i was there and it was a time as you know the story that that the jordan river which separated where they were at from the land that was promised to abraham we call it the promised land and they knew that they were given this land but they wandered around and finally they come to this time and they come to that jordan river that separated them from the promised land and it was a flood as we know and it's such a such a strange time for god to lead the people to that jordan river at that time of year many times that's what god does and he does these things we say to show his glory he led he led them to the red sea the red sea parted and they went through and then now the same thing happens and they get to the jordan river now i want to read a lengthy quote from the bible you know brother branham said that we can say we can say things wrong and we can do things wrong but every service is a success if we read this wonderful book so i want to i want to read a lengthy a lengthy segment out of joshua we'll start with joshua 1 1 and and we'll go through these scriptures just to lay a foundation to uh to the scripture that i read at the beginning of the service joshua 1 1 now after the death of moses the servant of the lord it came to pass that the lord spake unto joshua the son of nun moses is minister now that word minister means servant moses is minister saying moses my servant is dead now therefore arise and go over this jordan thou and all this people under the land which i do give them even to the children of israel every place that the soul of your foot shall tread upon that have i given you as i said unto moses amen from the wilderness and this lebanon even unto the great river the river euphrates and all the land of the hittites and unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your coast and there shall not be any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so i will be with thee i will not fail thee nor forsake thee be strong and of good courage for unto this people shall thou divide for an inheritance the land which i swear unto their fathers to give them now listen to this only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whatsoever thou goest god says right here to moses he says refer back to the prophet's words and how often do we do that how often do we come to church and we don't refer back to the prophet's words we do every time and it's it's the precedent is set right here this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shalt meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein for then thou shalt make thy way prosperous and then thou shalt have good success in other words in that scripture he says never stop reciting these teachings you must think about them night and day so that you will faithfully do everything written in them only then will you prosper and succeed and friends we have a greater opportunity to do what joshua did because we have the prophet's tapes we listen to those and how many listen to these tapes right here god's telling us he's telling these people telling joshua listen to moses keep listening to him keep reciting these things verse number nine have not i commanded thee be strong and of good courage and be of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with thee wheresoever thou goest i'm going to claim that scripture for my own and i think all of us can claim that now the rest of chapter 1 joshua is getting the people ready to cross over into the land that god has promised them and promised as i said hundreds of years years earlier the prophet abraham and then he tells the people he says in three days we're going over get ready so then in chapter 2 and we won't read out of chapter 2 on this one but in chapter 2 is a very familiar story to all of us that's when joshua sends the two spies over and they go into the land and let me tell you those jericho people they were shaking in their boots they were and you can read in chapter two they did not want any part of that bunch of people over there they probably heard that the red sea parted they had probably heard that everything every place that they went to god gave them and here they go coming up to the jordan and it's like this river swollen but those folks over in jericho they're like this is not going to be good so joshua sent the two spies over they heard about this they searched the city for them you know the story about rahab and then they left they spent three days over there they left they came back and told joshua gave joshua a report joshua said we're going over in the morning chapter chapter 3 verse 1. i love reading this word and joshua rose early in the morning and they removed from him and came to jordan he and all the children of israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after three days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the ark of the covenant of the lord your god and the priests and the levites bearing it then you shall remove from your place and go after it so joshua says get up and follow that ark he said that ark was a supernatural sign to israel wherever that ark went you were safe it was like the pillar of fire that was with moses and and we see we see that supernatural sign that they could see and they could look at that ark they could see they could see the pillar of cloud in the day and they could see the pillar of cloud at the pillar of fire at night and they had this they had something that they could look at and they could see and then we'll shoot forward a long time i don't know 1500 years or so and then we see it the day of pentecost and we see what happened at the day of pentecost they saw the pillar of fire among each person and friends we have something that we can look at now it's not something we worship or we get weird about but we have a picture of the pillar of fire the same one that was at the day of pentecost the same one that was moses was following at night there's probably a picture right out here in the foyer of that same pillar fire it's a gift to us that we can hold fast to that verse number four yet there shall be a space between you and it about two thousand cubits by measure come not near unto it that ye may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way before and joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the lord will do wonders among you and joshua spake unto the priests saying take up the ark of the covenant and pass over before the people and they took up the ark of the covenant and went before the people and the lord said unto joshua this day will i begin to magnify thee in the sight of all israel so that they may know that once again he says it as i was with moses so i will be with thee for time's sake let's skip to verse 17 and and the priests that bear the ark of the covenant of the lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of jordan and all the israelites passed over on dry ground until all the people were passed clean over clean means all the way over now let's go to chapter four friends i could just read this and not say anything what a blessing that we have this this holy book here in front of us joshua chapter four verse one and it came to pass when all the people were clean passed over jordan that the lord spake unto joshua saying take you twelve men out of the people out of every tribe of man and command ye them saying take you hence out of the midst of jordan out of the place where the priest's feet stood firm 12 stones and you shall carry them over with you and leave them in the lodging place where you shall lodge this night then joshua called the twelve men whom he had prepared of the children of israel out of every tribe of man and joshua said unto them passover before the ark of the lord your god into the midst of jordan and take you up every man you a stone upon his shoulder according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel that this may be a sign among you that when your children ask their fathers in time to come saying what mean ye by these stones then you shall answer them that the waters of the jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the lord then it passed over jordan the waters of jordan were cut off and these stones shall be a for a memorial unto the children of israel forever for the heathen memorial as we were talking earlier today and the children of israel did so as joshua commanded and took up 12 stones out of the midst of jordan and the lord spake unto joshua according to the number of the tribes of the children of israel and carried them over with them unto the place where they lodged and laid them down there and joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of jordan and the place where the feet of the priests which bear the ark of the covenant stood and they are there unto this day for time's sake let's let's go to verse 19. and the people came out up out of jordan on the tenth day of the first month in encampton gilgal in the east border of jericho and those 12 stones which they took out of jordan did joshua pitching gilgal and he spake under the children of israel saying when your children shall ask their fathers in time come saying what mean these stones then ye shall let your children know saying israel came over this jordan on dry land for the lord your god dried up the waters of jordan from before you until you were passed over as the lord your god did to the red sea which he dried up from before us until we were gone over that all the people of the earth might know the hand of the lord that it is mighty that ye may fear the lord your god forever the reading of of the book of joshua and and what happened on that day and i love the lesson that the lord teaches us in the bible he teaches us once these things happen to bring our children back to these things that have happened and tell them this is what happened right here tell them this is what happens right here at this tucson tabernacle this is what happened in sabino canyon this is what happened in colorado this is this these things really happen my my grandfather i have two grand grandpas have obviously gone to be with the lord now i have a grandpa wheeler and i have a grandpa evans grandpa wheeler was a deacon in brother brahms tabernacle grandpa evans you've heard brother brown talk about him on tape quite often he's one of brother branham's closest friends they were both they were both in colorado when brother branham got the group together and he said now there's a storm coming the weather man says that there's a storm coming and we can we might get get stuck up here for a week you know it's gonna get cold it's gonna be dangerous we can go back down the mountain until the storm passes go home or we can stay you look to my grandpa evans and he says brother evans what do you want to do when grandpa knew who was with him just as you were caleb you would know who joshua was my grandpa knew who was with him and he said he said brother branham he said we came up here to hunt and brother bram said okay we'll we'll stay so then he gave instructions there was about half the group i think or more than half left and went down and then a small group stayed and it was my two grandpas i believe it was my uncle ronnie i believe it was vernon mann who is like a grandpa toomey for the woods i can't remember looking at the picture in my mind and i don't know if brother billy was there or not i think he was he was so he tells everybody as soon as that first snowflake falls then you make haste right back to camp because you could get lost you get stuck out there you freeze to death so my grandpa evans went up with brother bran and they went hunting up high in the mountain my grandpa wheeler now i know these stories very well because i've heard them since i was this my grandpa wheeler went along the creek bed because he knew when the blizzard hit he could just follow the creek right back to camp so my grandpa evans is with brother branham and and it started kind of rough out there and brother branham tells my grandpa he said brother evans he says i'm going to go right up over here and that was a very nice way of saying you go somewhere else so he uh brother branham went up over a saddle my grandpa said and the wind started blowing and the blizzard started coming down and it was freezing cold my grandpa said he said the worst was the wind the wind was blowing so hard and he said he leaned up against a tree to block the wind he was already way too far to ever try to make it back to camp the snow was coming down brother branham couldn't have been over a couple hundred yards away from him and he's leaning up against the tree trying to stay warm not knowing what to do now my other grandpa brother wheeler he's down at the bottom of the mountain by the creek they were very obedient when that first snowflake came he turned and he started running back to camp you know my grandpa he's like six four big lanky guy and he was going and there's my grandpa evans and he's up behind a tree and my grandpa wheeler and he's running along the creek bank during the blizzard my grandpa evans says all of a sudden the sky began to clear and it started to get warmer the wind stopped very quickly the sky began to clear and it seemed to part like this my now brother wheeler was down he's running and he's not noticing that it's sunny outside and he's sweating and he stops and the snow's starting to melt and man you know so so he gets back to camp my grandpa evans comes back to camp brother branham uh stayed and you know the story if you listen to this to the story on tape it's beautiful that's when he had time with god it's a it's a story that i grew up with and it's one of those stones that we can come back to these things really happened i'm a witness that these things happen i grew up with two different perspectives of that storm in colorado there's another there's another story you know and when i've been to africa the the africans love this story and that's when my family the evanses would drive up from um georgia to jeffersonville and they'd drive up almost every whenever brother branham would be they followed brother branham everywhere my grandpa would work all week to get up enough money to follow him to go to his meetings so they drove up and they were out to eat in louisville how many people have been to jeffersonville here so i know who i'm talking about okay so you know louisville is on the south side of the ohio river which is a giant river so they were they were eating and somebody stole their car and they got a ride to brother branham's house brother branham got the family together and they my grandpa said they got on their knees and they prayed and you know if you listen to the tape brother branham said that they sent the angel after the man that stole the car well brother branham in the meantime he says you take my car his brother evans take my car you know and you go and enjoy your with your family so so they they went out and and uh after a few hours they're driving now remember it was stolen in louisville they're driving in jeffersonville in a place called i don't know if you're familiar with eastern boulevard where it goes up underneath interstate 65 my dad says look there's their car parked right there not in louisville where it was stolen but over the river on the north side in jeffersonville right where their stomping grounds were they would have never found it but they drove right by it they're in jeffersonville my my dad's the one that saw it and and we know that story and the africans i don't know why they love that story so much but but you get a place like this and they all yeah you know they just go crazy over that another one of these stones that i want to bring us back to is marriage and divorce and and you know that brother branham gives a testimony during marriage and divorce my my grandpa i'll tell you i'll tell you you deacon brothers i want to tell you i want to tell you a story about the deacons that you probably didn't know my grandpa wheeler was a deacon and they were having uh it was who is this melchizedek and the marriage and divorce and these this meeting that they had and they had it at the junior high school in jeffersonville and the people were just piled in waiting to get in waiting to have these doors open well finally the deacons go and they opened the door and the doors flew open and they all ran in and they all got their seats didn't sell well with the deacon brothers they rounded everybody back up and said you're gonna go back out and come in like christians so so then so then they came back in but but the story about marriage and divorce brother brahm gives a testimony of seeing here in tucson seeing the pillar of fire up on the mountain and he gives a story about my uncle ronnie and ronnie saw that and and he saw brother branham soon afterward and he said brother brandon you're up in the mountain i said no no no he was taken back that that they saw that again witness that it happened so much so the founder of this church and you know the story the perry green he was brother brahm was praying for the sick and brother aaron and i were talking about it in the back back there brother branham was praying for the sick he said bow your heads and brother green he peaked a little bit you know the story the young man that had no eyeballs in his socket he watched and he saw those eyeballs perform the supernatural brother green the man that stood in this pulpit he saw that right the uh you know daniel let me tell you something my son there your dad me was dedicated as a baby right here right here that my parents brought me up and brother green dedicated me in this church so it's special to me that's where my ministry started is is is right here when i was when i was a little boy you know i think about the tabernacle and i think that that just after my dream and just being so excited the work here is not finished you know this church was the only church in tucson it was packed it was full and then churches started splitting off of it that's not a bad thing by the way that's good it's not that's not a bad thing churches started splitting off of it and forming their congregations and brother branham when somebody started criticizing um junior jackson and don ruttle you know those two brothers they started criticizing that and brother branham addressed it from the pulpit they said brother branham they're splitting the church brother brahm said no he said good he said let's empty out the church send him to these other places and we'll fill it back up again and then we'll empty it out again if we have to and we'll fill it back up again and the gospel spreads that's the right attitude everybody we all worry so much about splitting churches and you know and oh well you know they used to be one of us they're not they're not of us um what does it say they went out from us because they were not office which is a misinterpretation of the scripture by the way but they want to say that but no no no no they went out because they were probably led of the lord to go out so put somebody else back in the seat and whose job is that brother it's not just yours it's not just mine it's your job all of our jobs is to put people in the seats not to fill up the church not to pay tithes not to do that but because those people need it there's a need in the world and it's to bring the people back to these stones and let me tell you i want to be one of those stones that joshua that those men carried they picked up these stones out of the river they they're probably like this because they could pick them up on their own they put them on their shoulders and they carried these things and they dumped them in this place called gilgal where they camped and it was important to joshua because god told him bring people back to this place and that's what i believe this tucson tabernacle is by there bring people back to this we all know people that have left not gone to other churches but have left have left the fold and let me tell you it's not because they're bad people they're suffering get them back bring those people back because it will be a blessing to them we all need to work towards doing that these stones now our love i'll close with another scripture that will bring it all together and that's in first peter chapter 2. one of the stories one of the stones that i wanted to present to you is on my list i looked over it was my grandfather was uh i'll tell you from the beginning we have a few minutes um the evans is would follow brother branham around all over the place and he didn't know who they were you know they they they just my grandpa heard a radio broadcast and this man was preaching on there and he said wow this this brother's something special and it was actually it was a broadcast that came from cleveland tennessee and somehow it got all the way down to south georgia america and my grandpa was listening to it at the end of the sermon the the announcer came on there said that was william branham he will again be in cleveland cleveland tennessee tomorrow and uh at six o'clock or whatever it was my grandpa said cleo was my my grandma's name he said cleo pack up the kids we're going so they went and they went to cleveland tennessee their lives changed they saw that this man had something that in this man was this bible not just teaching it but this bible came to life everything that was written in this book of acts that should be among the believers this man had and he said he's got something and friends let me tell you about my relationship with brother branham's message is brother branham had something that i genuinely desire i want that relationship with the lord jesus that he had he gets so many there's so many people that criticize him say that he said things wrong say that that there was he contradicted himself he lied he did this he did that but i want that relationship that he had no one can deny that he came and and he the lord healed the sick through his ministry he preached the gospel how many people came to the lord jesus through his ministry there's there's very there's a lot of weirdness associated with this message people go too far and then they start drawing circles and cutting everybody else out and then there's this other side where they they hate brother brown because maybe they've been hurt maybe it's been presented to them wrong but then there's right down the middle of the road there's a prophet that brought a message to us that's true and i forgot what i was talking about i was talking about the story that uh that my parents were my my grandparents were following brother brown my dad and all of them their fallen brother branham around and they um they got to philadelphia and one of the campaign managers he saw these people and he'd seen them all over the country brother and they were just there all the time probably sitting in the front row they wanted to be close so he approaches my grandpa and says um seeing you around would you like to meet brother branham grandpa said yes i would that would be wonderful so i don't know this was in the mid 50s i think early to mid 50s and uh they um they had breakfast brother branham sister branham i think brother joseph was a little boy he was there and then my grandma and my grandpa and there was a there was a picture on the wall and it was a picture it was like a painting of a lake and brother branham looked up at that picture and he said it looks like a nice place to fish doesn't brother evans now let me tell you what happened the weekend before um jeremy i don't know if you know the story you're smiling my grandpa and my uncle and my grandpa's brother were fishing now there's fishermen here and there's a limit on bass well my grandpa evans didn't subscribe to that limit he's a good fisherman and they had three like potato sacks filled with bass and i think they one of those probably seven and then hundreds of fish in these bags and uh violating the law so what happened is they were driving along and and coming out they saw the headlights coming and my grandpa knew okay this time of night i know who it is so they stopped pulled the fish out of the car hit him in the bushes got back in the car and it just so happened it was a game word game warden said let me see your fish they're covered in fish scales and everything else and we don't have any fish and they search the car no fish so then this is okay so they get back back in the car my grandpa's driving along they get the fish out of the bushes they put them back in the car they get back in the car he sees the headlights again stops throws them out in the bushes gets back in gabe morgan says where's the fish we don't have any fish searched the car again happened three times three times so we go to the next weekend brother branham is with my grandpa he looks up at the sigh or the the the painting there and he says this looks like a nice place to fish brothers grandpa said yeah he says you know i saw a man he said uh he caught all these fish he caught way too many fish you know and he says and then he hit him from the game ward three times told them exactly what had happened my grandpa couldn't handle it anymore he said brother branham i'm guilty he said forgive me i i did it i did it my grandma she tells the story you know sister evans many of you know sister she's a funny lady she's like well you know well she shouldn't you know be doing that and and uh brother branham he says uh brother branham will you forgive me brother branham said i will if you take me down there fishing so brother random my grandpa took brother bram down there fishing and this is one of those stones he was bitten by a rattlesnake and he said now this is the story from the inside he told me he says you know he says i was bitten and he said the pain was so bad and it was bitten on the top of his foot and he said the pain was so bad my leg was just throbbing and it was hurting so bad and he said the tears were just coming out of my eyes and he went and he sat down on the bank now there was another brother with them and that brother went and told brother brandon brother branham was a little ways off and my grandpa was watching and he told brother branham and brother banham looked at him and then brother graham just kept fishing didn't do anything so grandpa is he's hurting brother branham after after a few moments he takes puts his fish and pulled down and he says brother evans where'd he bite you on the top of the foot and he said these words he said lord they shall it is written in your word that they shall tread on serpents and scorpions and nothing by any means shall harm them and the pain immediately stopped right there immediately stopped swelling went down he and then brother brahma's simple prayer he said so then he says i'm sorry about my volume brother matt i'm up and i'm down but thank you for correcting me um but uh he uh he said that brother branham asked him he said well brother evans you want to go back and he says no he said same thing that they were when they were up on the mountain he said we came here to fish so they fished all day and then they went back and and i'm sure you've heard the story that that um that they they went to the gas station which my uncle owned my dad's uncle and my dad was there and my grandpa was like you gotta know what just happened and and he he takes his foot and he's there's two holes in the top of his foot and he squeezed the two holes together and a little bit of blood came out and he says i got bit by a rattlesnake and a swelling and all this happened and and my dad was was so excited my dad my dad told us those stories of course i heard from my grandpa evans but i heard it from my dad many times over the years another one of those stones now we can bring these people back and they say you're crazy we say no we're not god sent a prophet in this day and he did say the same things that that the prophets before him did joshua parted the the jordan river you know brother branham healed the sick the pillar of fire the picture was taken over his head you know and and it was all done when i say brother branham healed the sake i mean jesus christ of course healed the sick through his ministry one after the other after the other now let's go let's go to my scripture here first peter chapter 2. peter says this he says we're for laying aside all malice and all guile two one through five we're for laying aside all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envies and all evil speakings as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby if so if so be ye have tasted that the lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a living stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of god and precious now he's speaking of the lord jesus christ here and he's saying that this lord jesus was a living stone this is better than bringing them back to joshua's stones this is someone that's alive he was he was this stone that wasn't dead that wasn't a story like i'm telling he was alive now the best part peter's going to bring us into this brother ye also you also as lively stones that lively is translated living you also as living stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ he's saying that we are these stones but not a story like i've been telling but a living stone friends i have seen with my own eyes i saw a man sort of my wife and my son saw a man that was dead for an hour raised to life we hear the tape of brother way when we saw brother brother way it was quick this man was dead for an hour or more and we saw it you remember buddy of course you remember we saw this man rise to life alive jesus christ alive today and friends what i want to do what i want to see and i'm i'm just so i'm so excited because the lord led me here to tucson i didn't know what's gonna happen i don't know what he's gonna do in the future but i want to have a part in this gospel and i sure you do too don't you and i want to be one of these lively stones that peter is talking about do you will you will you be one of these you can't just sit there and listen to a tape and think that you got it let me tell you this let me let me say this and um brother peter's a lawyer so these are these are my cl where's brother peter where'd he go there he is these are my closing state statements so no objections please okay i will present my evidence here in a moment um if believing brother brahm's message we know the evidence of the holy spirit is believing the word for your day but let me also say that acts 19 that paul that there was a group of people that came that paul came and i believe was in ephesus that paul came to them and they said ah we believe jesus you know we we john the baptist you know there was this man named apollos he was a great preacher he came in he introduced us to this christ and what did paul say paul says yes but have you received the holy spirit since you've believed james in his epistle they said the same thing to james they said we believe and james says oh you did good good for you you believe he said the devils believe and tremble there's more to it friends if saying that just because we listen to tapes or just because we believe brother branham if saying that makes us the bride then there is no holy spirit associated with this message but there is a holy spirit associated with this message brother branham had it we've seen it we've seen these testimonies that i've said there is a holy spirit associated with this message but we have something to do amen we have something to do friends if you want to take part if you want to have something to do if you have souls that are burdened on your hearts don't let it go go to those people all of us have people that we know that need to be here that need to fill up these pews for them can we stand stand together brother peter it means so much to me it means so much to me i was brother peter i read a uh a prayer request of some folks that i met today there i was at the gym and i wanted i wanted to get a workout in at lunch and just calm my mind and i started witnessing to these men and they just started weeping they they were having a tough time with wives that left them and they had they had med and and um we was there for three hours and they needed something they needed they needed the lord and brother arne you know what happened they said listen to this they said we're having a bible study tomorrow he said but we don't have anybody to teach it would you come so i'll be there at noon tomorrow so pray for me but the people need this message that we have so and it's friends if if you believe it will you make or you at least make a an offering to the lord today would you come to the altar if you believe this if you want to do something would you step forward step out of your proves and come this way if that you're going gonna do something if that you know people that need it this isn't a time to necessarily give your heart to the lord this isn't necessarily a time to to make the wrongs right we can do that but will you make an effort will you have somebody in your mind we have a soul in your mind that lord i'm gonna i'm gonna help that person it doesn't necessarily necessarily have to be the church but if you can just make their lives better if you can just encourage them to come to the lord jesus because you and i can't do it we'll fail but if they can get to christ then then he'll do well brother peter if you would uh go ahead and lead us in a song and friends as his brother peter is singing and i scott appreciate a very good singer i appreciate the song service earlier but if you if you go ahead with the song and just quietly friends whatever person's on your heart right now think about them and say lord i want to do something all right to be like jesus to be like jesus [Music] on earth [Music] to be like all through life's church they need you they need me they need this church they need the holy spirit this the work of the lord started right here in tucson arizona at the tucson tabernacle friends it can end right here it can finish right here

simple way like that to encourage my heart and he's jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and i remind you when when john and peter were walking back to the gate and that man that lay man
