there's nothing nothing to worry about I don't I don't have a list of any visitors I see C you got a friend there Chris Chris welcome man God bless you good good to have you and service you were some good friends of mine God bless you and any other visitors that we have that I might have missed look out upon the audience I think I recognize everybody it's good to have everybody in the house of the Lord this morning um I'm uh excited the uh I want to make an announcement if in case I forget the kids' rooms closed uh for another another day today because uh we're getting some flooring in we've got everything all piled up but it looks really good we got new flooring going in in the U in the lower rooms and I think it's going to be a real blessing to the kids the things that always stress me out I'd walk in there we'd clean the floor and there's black marks on the floor from the shoes and oh it's like but hopefully this new floor will will prevent that or you're going to have to check your shoes in at the door I can't handle it but uh it's it's all for the kids you know and it's it's it's for children of God and and we uh we talked about a couple weeks ago we talked about MDC and and that theophany body that's over on the other side and Jesus warned us he said be careful how you treat even these little kids because their angels are now beholding the face of God right at that moment so we always have to be careful and always respect to everybody even to the little kids have the utmost respect for them if you treat the kids with respect then you'll see that they'll be treating you in respect also we um we do we it's it's a great honor it's great it's really exciting I can't wait till we get done it I um I was born with a birth defect I didn't have any patience and and I still don't have any and and the Lord's working on me and but I just I can't wait for it to get done it's it's exciting it's going to be beautiful um and then once we finish in there then if the Lord's willing we'll move into this area we're also going to start on some landscaping and like I said a couple weeks ago I want to have a church meeting and uh just go over everything with the church just fill everybody in I think um everybody's going to be happy I think you'll enjoy um in the future when we when we get finished I um got a text this morning and um was reading reading in the news and uh about the Olympics going on over in France and uh the mockery that came from uh the the Olympic Committee and and what they scheduled in the Olympics to to start out the Olympics um on how they had a mockery of the Lord's Supper The Last Supper and they had instead of disciples and Jesus they had drag queens representing our Lord and the disciples that were there and it was it was a shame it was it was awful and as I started reading I said my goodness how could this how could this be it's something so big and something so worldwide as the Olympics and as I as I read they had drag queens carrying the torch the Olympic torch going to to light what they call the Eternal Flame it's not an eternal flame that Flame's going to go out and there's going to be a last supper one day and there's going to be a last supper for all of us and we better be right before before that last supper comes because then we'll have to go and we'll have to meet our Lord and savior I was I was sickened really by it so as as I read the article they interviewed whoever was in charge of representing those people that were in the um that did the parody of the Lord's supper and the man said he says we didn't go far enough he said the French government and the French Representatives didn't go far enough in doing this he said that the French people they don't it's not as accepted in their lives as this would have you have have you to believe and it's just it's the workings of the enemy to try to put this stuff in our face all the time and then eventually we get so used to it that it it becomes okay and then we just look past it it's like the the the the old story of putting a a frog in a pot of boiling water he'll start squirming and jump out but if you put him in there and you start to boil the water slowly he'll just stay in there and cook and that's what the world what's happening to the world today we just sit there and we just relax and all it's okay and more and more and more it happens and you know me I'm not against anybody and I'm not against if someone has that weakness in their life then okay that's fine I have seen people that were born that way that absolutely I could have I could see it when they were babies and all the way up until now and then I have seen now we see people that are being made that way because it makes everything accepted and and they get accepted from this group and now it's starting to be the trending thing to be that way brothers and sisters let me tell you it's a sin it is an absolute sin it's taught in this Bible it's a sin they say it's not in this Bible Jesus said in Matthew chapter 19 that a man and a woman are married and he doesn't say anything else about anything and he shouldn't have had to for heaven's sakes just common sense will tell us that but let me tell you that I understand that some people are born that way I don't question that I was born a sinner me the guy standing up here I was born with weaknesses that I had to overcome in my life that I am still overcoming so why does if you're born a liar or if you're born a cheater or if you're born something else that you have to overcome that but they don't have to overcome this I don't get it and then they press it upon the world it's a sign it's a sign of what is is about to happen and these signs have have come come along and over and over and over throughout history and God has done the same thing over and over throughout history they came here with Adam and Eve they had they had impurity there they had sin there they ended up God destroying it with Noah violence spread across the Earth God destroyed it with Sodom and Gora it was a prosperous time there were rich cities God destroyed those over and over and there's many many times in the Bible I mean the Tower of Babel same thing they got so educated and so powerful God destroyed that it's whenever we take our mind off of Jesus take our mind off of God and put it on something else that God's justice takes hold um I did want to read something this today just it got me all worked up and uh and not like I said not against the people if you have a weakness there overcome it I have weaknesses too I try to overcome them every day no we don't have to accept that because it's sin we do not have to accept that because it is sin amen just like we don't accept any other sin Galatians 6 verse 6 I'll read the new New King James Version if you could put up the the King James it says this let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches be not deceived God is Not mocked which is exactly what they were doing God is Not mocked for whatever a man SWS that will he also reap for He Who SWS to his flesh will of the flesh reap corruption but he who SWS of the spirit will of the spirit reap everlasting life and let us not grow weary of while doing good for in due season we shall reap if we do not lose heart therefore as we have opportunity let us do good to all especially to those who are of the household of faith so brother Manny you get to prefer the you get to prefer the Christians a little bit more it says it here but but still we reach out out to all people and I'll add this that if you are complacent in people mocking God if you don't stand up against it then you are also guilty of it I know that that's we might just turn our heads but me standing in this Pulpit it's my job to condemn sin and if I just look by it and I will be guilty of that same sin that's that's part of the word it's part of being a Christian now you don't attack a Christian never attacks you don't go after someone and and talk about and and run someone down because you might not struggle with that sin that they have but you don't condone it you don't say oh it's okay it is not okay and I'm not just talking about the drag queens and homosexuality I'm talking about lying and cheating and gossiping and and all of these other things we don't condone those things if they are a Sin then there a sin no matter what these have been times in just the past 20 30 years these have been times of unprecedented prosperity in the world the world has money we all might think that oh we're taxed too high or we don't have enough or or we want more but these have been very very good times people aren't going hungry here in the United States and in most places of the world people are generally very prosperous but look what Prosperity produces brothers and sisters it produces sin it produces it it it it makes it too easy to where we are not crying out out to God but then hardships and suffering then that produces repentance because it makes us more reliant on God so we see that that and I'm talking in general senses you know I'm not I'm not saying if if we're not if we're prosperous that that there's going to be sin in our lives I'm not saying that but I'm saying that in in general times of prosperity have turned our way our eyes away from God and it's the times of suffering and those times according to the Bible they're coming and I I feel I feel bad I feel bad that that we have taken these things and and really forsaken God and made it to where that Lord you're not as important to us and and not just I'm not talking about the people in our church I'm talking about this whole world and to allow something like this that I just mentioned it's just it's not right and to support it it's not right and the Bible says that we're going to reap what we saw and I just pray Lord and know that we want the Lord to come and we look forward to that day but I also pray that many many people will come to the Lord before that time maybe by my witness maybe maybe by your witness the love of God and many people that may be mocking God now always be kind to them always have a reach out a hand of love not to condone what they're doing but to help them and then you might see that you might win a soul to Jesus Christ and what greater honor could we have on Earth than to win a soul to Jesus Christ I always I always wondered why that John the Baptist was the greatest of the Jesus said he was the greatest of all the prophets why did he say that it's because he was the first Christian and he had the first converts to Christ of course he was the greatest because he was by his witness at least John and Andrew they came to the Lord so if he was the greatest witness then we also have that opportunity to lift up Jesus Christ to the world and to be that witness we um go on through the Hebrew series and it's much of it is repetitive is repeating back to what was said earlier and so we're going to start in Hebrews 9 and I I want to just I sent some pictures to the to the brothers back there and what I would like to do is I'd like to explain some of these things that are constantly referred to in the book of Hebrews which is the high priest and how the high priest went into the Tabernacle of the Lord and the holy place and and how the the high priest went into that holy of holies once a year and then inside that holy of holies is the the Ark of the Covenant so brother if you could put up that first picture this is a picture of this is just a general picture of what the Tabernacle in the wilderness look like you can see that pillar of cloud that pillar of smoke in the back and that is probably representative of of the the spirit of the Lord coming down into that holy of holies that you can see there that on the outside you can see the wall and you can see the the different places of worship in there and of sacrifice and if if you go to the next slide here is just a general diagram of what we just saw so at the front you have the altar of the burnt offerings that's where they would make the the U the offering for the people and then you have the bronze Laver where where they would do their ceremonial Washings and then the golden lampstands which we know is the manora there and then the table of the shoe bread the altar of incense and as you go left you get more Hol holy and then the Ark of the Covenant there in the back behind a thick curtain in a small room the Ark of the Covenant if you go to the next slide just a simple Box overlaid in Gold small not very big inside of it were the um it was a a basin a bowl that had Mana in it and in that bowl that Mana remember if it wasn't kept if it was kept over a day that had spoiled but the Mana that was put in this Ark never spoiled and then when a priest became a priest that he would take a piece of that mana and and taste it for years and years after that so there's that bowl that has the Mana in it and then there was the Aaron's Rod that bued and bore olives or bore I'm sorry bore almonds and then there were the Ten Commandments the two tables of stone that were inside of that box right there so that is back into the holy of holies I just as as we go through the book of Hebrews and as we've gone through I want you to kind of get a picture of what this is It's a tent that's portable that's moved in the wilderness and then later on that tent became a temple remember David wanted to build the temple and he said and the Lord said no but your son Solomon can build that Temple so then Solomon built this permanent structure for the Lord and called it the house of the Lord if you go to the next slide there and that was built in Jerusalem and it's said to have been built on Mount Mariah which is the place that Abraham went to offer his son Isaac so it's a very very special place in history and you can see there you can see the smoke coming up is probably the the altar or the the burnt offerings there and I want to read part of a story to you and I don't usually recommend books because I don't read very many books but um this one is some was one that I read years and years ago and I've read it a couple times brother brandom actually told my dad to read this book he told my grandfather to have his children read this book it's called Prince of the House of David and it's a story it's it's written in the late 1800s by a man named uh Ingram and uh it's a parody it's about a Jewish girl named Adena and how she left her home to visit this holy city that you see there of Jerusalem and the the book is a series of letters that Adena writes to her father her dad was a rabbi and she was on her way to Jerusalem to visit and stay with her Uncle Amos who is also a rabbi and she and while she's on her way to visit she uh she's describing what happens and eventually in the book she comes to meet this Rabbi named Jesus it's it's a beautiful Story one of the it's the best book aside from this book it's the best book I've ever written or ever read and I recommend it it's hard it's hard to understand because it's written in late 1800 English but it's a really really good read and very very it just puts you into the situation of um the time that Jesus came I I loved it so much that Stephanie and I even considered naming our our daughter after this young lady in this book named ad Aden very very good book so I want to read a portion on of this book I changed a couple words just a few here and there to make it make it more understandable she says this and remember she's writing back to her father she says on reaching a high place Jerusalem appeared as if R risen out of the earth I cannot my dear father describe to you my emotions on beholding the holy city these emotions have been experienced by millions of our people they were similar to your own emotions as you related them to me all the past with its mighty men who walked with Jehovah rushed to my memory and compelled me to bow my head and to worship and to adore at the sight of the temple where God wants alas why does he no longer visit Earth in his holy house where God Once dwelt In The Flaming shikina and made known the Oracles of his will we entered the city just before the 6th hour of the evening and we're soon at the house of our relative Amos the levite I was received as if I had a daughter's claim to their Embraces and with the luxuries which with which they surrounded me in my gorgeously furnished apartment I am sure my kins folk here mean to tempt me to forget the joys of of home there that I have left the rabbi Amos and his family all desire to be commended to you he seems to be a man of piety and benevolence and greatly loves his children I have been once to the temple its outer Court seemed like a vast Marketplace being thronged with men who sell animals for sacrifice which crowded all which crowded all the parts thousands of doves and large cages were sold on one side and on the other were stalls of lambs and sheep and calves and oxen the noise and the bleeding of which with all the confusion of the tongues made the place appear like anything else but the Temple of Jehovah it appears like desecration to use the temple thus dear father and seems to show a lack of that Holy Love of God's house that was once characterized by our ancestors on reaching the women's Court I was sensible of being in the I was sensible of being in the temple by the magnificence which surrounded me with what awe I bowed my head in the direction of the Holy of holies I have never felt before so near to God clouds of incense floated above the heads of the multitude and rivers of blood flowed Down The Marvelous steps of the altar of the burnt offering alas how many innocent victims bleed every morning and every evening for the sins of Israel what a sea of blood has been poured out in ages that have passed what a strange fear ful mystery that the blood of an innocent lamb should atone for the sins that I have done there must be some deeper meaning in these sacrifices dear father yet unrevealed to us you can see you can put yourself in the place of this young Jewish girl as she arrived at this city a place that she'd heard about her whole life and then she she goes there and she sees she doesn't understand why why does this lamb this innocent creature why does it have to die for my sins I I I don't understand the point in all this and so many times it's the youth that might say I don't understand the point and it's something that we need to be able to explain to them last week I heard so many more probably more comments on on the sermon last week than I've than I've really ever had in the in the year and a half that I've been here and they were uh the comments were you know sometimes I just don't understand the point of many of the things that we do and my answer is usually well if you don't understand the point if you don't really get it then why are you doing it if you don't understand if you don't really believe this then why are you doing it just because you've grown up a certain way or just because you believe a certain way you have to know there has to be something inside of you that it hits home and it's not just well a Christian does this or a Believer does this or that no you have to understand the point and the book of Hebrews is written so that we might understand the point in all of this that it might become a Living spirit and that word might dwell within us so that we can understand why why certain things are done and then you might see that well we're doing this why well just because that's tradition and it may not necessarily be right as this young lady Adena was seeing that that there has to be something has to be something more to this so let's go to Hebrews let's start chapter nine let's continue on and uh let's start with verse 11 for time sake it says this Hebrews 9 vers 11 but Christ being come a high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands don't forget that very important Christ a more perfect Tabernacle a tabernacle is a tent you saw the picture of it this Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by the blood but by his own blood he entered once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us book of Hebrews continues to to remind us of that high priest and how he would go into the holy of holies once a year and make atonement for the people for if the blood of blls and goats and the ashes of a heer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God this is a a personal relationship with God brothers and sisters that's that's the whole theme of the whole book Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve a living God you in particular in particular you do it and you see that a works-based Salvation is a failure Jehovah Witness there a works-based Salvation they go to door to door they spend their required hour or whatever it is a month and and they they do that because that's required of the church Mormons the same thing they're works-based salvation Catholics same thing it's a works-based salvation but the reason is because they're all based on the church and furthering the church they think that if they can get a convert to their religion then that soul is saved they're not thinking about the individual and they're not thinking about the needs of that individual if they can get them to Christ then Christ will fulfill those needs it's that's that's the whole meaning that's the that's that's the point of it all no church no Organization no denomination nothing can replace a personal relationship with Christ I know that seems a bit cliche that seems a bit Elementary but that's the meaning of the book Genesis to Revelation that's it right there and for this cause he is the mediator speaking of of Jesus for this cause he is the mediator of the New Testament that by the means of death for the Redemption of the transgressors that were under the first testament they which are called might receive the promise of inheritance remember that word inheritance for where a testament is there must also of necessity be the death of the tester for a testament is a force after men are dead otherwise it is of no strength at all while the tester liveth it's a bit hard to understand but let me read to you the English Standard Version the English Standard Version I use that a lot it's a more literal translation than the King James version it's it's not that all that old so it it uses more Modern English but it's to me it's a very very good translation because it is very literal says this English Standard Version verse 17 if you could yeah leave that up there for a will takes effect only at death since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive so if I put my son Daniel in my will he receives a certain part of my estate when I die but it doesn't mean anything until I'm dead until I'm gone until I die he doesn't get an inheritance until until I die and the promise the promises of redemption of adoption of inheriting eternal life they are not validated until a death has occurred because they are inheritance and then someone might ask why so I don't understand why did Jesus have to die well brothers and sisters it might not make sense to us that Jesus Christ had to die for our sins but it doesn't have to make sense to us God is Sovereign God doesn't twist his way of thinking and his law to match our understanding and the way and the things that we want we change our understanding we change our emotions we change our way of thinking to match what God has set before us it's not up to God as I said to reform to conform to our religion it's up to us to conform to his religion let's skip to verse number 22 and almost all things are by the law purged with blood and without shedding of blood is no remission so again something had to die for us to live it's got to be personal and I think that that's where so many of us miss it is we think that everything's just okay because we cause our call ourselves a Christian or we're baptized or whatever might be but it's got to be a personal it's got this has got to be between me and him you remember when uh when Trump when they when they shot uh Trump a few weeks ago a couple weeks ago and um there was a man that died in the audience this man when he died he laid across his family to protect him because he knew the bullets were coming so he laid across his family and he took the bullet for his family imagine if you were his daughter and you were laying under your dad and you felt that bullet go into your father and die that's personal imagine how you would feel imagine if if you knew that he was he was on top of you and he protected you how much would you think of your dad how much would you love your dad after that that's how personal it needs to be not only did he die on the cross not not only did he take a bullet like this man did but he he did it in in a much harder way than this man did he thought about it he had to he had to make this decision he knew what was coming he he were in The Garden of Gethsemane he was he was just so upset and so worried and and he just he got down there he's on his knees and and he was he was so in such anxiety that even blood was coming out of his pores and he said Lord if it let this cup pass from me I don't want to do it but he said but your will be done and you know why he did it for me for Daniel Evans and if I'm the only one he did it for me just like that man Laying across his daughter and taking the bullet for his daughter imagine how she feels about her dad and how much she's going to love him and we to love Jesus Christ even more and if as I said it needs to be so personal that if I am the only one he still would have lived the life that he lived he still would have gone to the cross and he still would have died for me just me or just you that's how much he loved each of us that's what Christ means this book of Hebrews is bringing that out and I say a lot that it's not about about you you know and I'm always talking about it's like well I want this and I want that well it's not all about you if you're a Christian you should want to help others but really this book it is about you it is about me it's about Redemption it's about eternal life it's about Joy it's about love and it's it pertains all of it pertains to me he did it all for me and he did it all for you if you truly accept it it is a personal Messiah we need to know him be on a speaking basis with him verse 23 it was therefore NE necessary that the patterns of the things in heaven should be purified with these but the Heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these for Christ is not entered into the holy places made with hands which are figures of the true copies of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us so the Tabernacle in the wilderness the temple built by Solomon they're not the real thing the real thing is that Temple that's built without hands and here it Likens Jesus Christ to that Temple he's the one all of this was just as we'll read here in a minute it was just just a shadow it wasn't real but when the man Jesus Christ came it was all manifested to him and then he takes his spirit and he pours it down upon us and then we become his Representatives speaking with the authority that he gives us and the prince of the House of David as as the the book goes through this Adena she finally understands the meaning of all of this at the end when she finally meets Jesus Christ and she understands why he came and it's not that spirit and that that understanding of this word when it comes down into a human being then we become that Temple that is not made with hands and that Spirit becomes the law that is in us and it's magnified so now we can understand what to do in each situation it gives us that understanding that Holy Spirit that's what we should always seek and we always want to do better for the Lord but if we don't have that understanding we're not going to get it right it's just going to be the law and the law was not meant Christ was meant to fulfill the law nor yet that he should offer himself often as the high priest enter into the holy place every year with with blood of others for then must he often have suffered since the foundation of the world but now once in the end of the world world hath he appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself so Christ died for our sins once he entered into the holy place and that is for all eternity he doesn't have to die on the cross again just like taking a a goat every time that I sin and and offering it on the altar Christ did it once and that was for all but neither brothers and sisters neither do we have to continue to make intercessions for our own sins or to continue to make sacrifices for our own sins we sin we repent we feel bad we try to make it right we bring it before the Lord and then he forgives our sins don't don't pull it try to pull it back out from under the blood it's gone so many people and it's so hard for certain people to to get past their sins that they have done and it ruins their life it puts anxiety on us it it puts this guilt on us place it in the hands of the Lord and that's it it's over Christ can handle it believe me he can handle a lot better than our worries can handle it or or our anxiety can handle it verse number 27 and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this judgment so we all say we're going in the Rapture and the Rapture is going to happen it's promised it's going to be here they've been saying if you read in first and second Peter Peter is I get ready it's going to happen happen and that's how every person for the last 2,000 years every True Believer it's going to happen and and they're they're excited about it and then they die it's okay if we live like God is like Jesus is going to return tomorrow our lives will be get to will be better and he is going to come and just like I was talking about earlier these are signs I think undeniable signs that he is going to return we're seeing the same signs that happened every time that God pronounced judgment on the earth and he's going to pull out his sweetheart his bride he's going to pull her out before it really gets bad but and we should always be thinking about that and we may die in the flesh and then pause for a while until he comes and and brings us out brothers and sisters but what we all have to do is we all have to die our to our own selves we've got to die to ourselves and got die to our way of thinking and die to that stubbornness that is in us and that religious spirit is often very very stubborn we've got to die to that you know you you think about this 50y old man that lost his life at that Trump rally do you think when he woke up this that morning do you think think that he thought today's going to be my last day no my grandma I got a 97 year- old grandma and she's going to outlive many 16-year- old kids she's going to outlive many 50 year olds our time could be any time and we always need to be ready for that we are looking for the Rapture but the Lord may come for me before that Rapture and we need to be ready for that always seeking God and having that relationship Lord what how do you want me to act today what do you want me to do where do you want me to be always seeking that and always ready I I had a high school friend that uh right after high school he uh he was driving and lost control of his car and he hit a cable and it killed instantly you know a 19-year-old boy was he ready when he woke up W up that morning he did not there was no thought that ever crossed his mind probably that he is going to go to meet his maker this day was he ready all of us should be ready we don't know God doesn't usually reveal to us when we're going but he warns us and we are we can look around the world and we can see this warning now to be ready and if you're ready to meet the Lord you're also ready to meet a potential believer if your life is right you're ready to go you're you're you're you've made peace and everything is is is going right in your life of course you'll sin you'll do things wrong but you have the blood of Christ you understand Jesus Christ now the Lord might use you to now witness to someone else and then you can impart that joy that you have to someone else verse number 28 so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin un Salvation let's go to verse let's go to Hebrews 10 let's continue on for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of things can never with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually to make the comers there unto perfect so remember adena's letter to her dad that that book I know it's a fictional book but it was very very well researched and done she might have said I don't understand the meaning of this it's because she was just seeing the shadow of what is real and that's what the law was and that's what the sacrifice was and that's what the temple was and that's what the Tabernacle was it was just a shadow if you look at a shadow it's like I can see the outline of my hand I can see the outline of myself but it's not me if you look at me you can see all the detail in me you can see that yeah the round head is actually bald you can see the the skin tone and you can see all the different the different shapes if you're looking directly at that person but this is just a shadow let skip to verse 9 then said he lo I come to do thy will will oh God he taketh away the first that he may establish the second of course he's talking about the law and legalism associated with the law but to accept that we have to get rid of our own ideas we have to understand that there is a point in all this and there is a point in coming to church there's a point in singing songs of worship and we've got to make changes in our life and this all of this goes to one point which is as I've said getting to know Christ that personal relationship with God himself I was um I used to have Stephanie when we were in Jeffersonville I'd have Stephanie sometime drop me off in certain areas and I'd say just leave me for a couple hours and I'll just try to get somebody to listen to me try to witness and I was I'd go around and and um try to tell people about the Lord and and met this lady she was obviously uh on drugs and and kind of homeless and uh she was on the on the path so I started witnessing to her and ends up uh I called Stephany and and she picked us up we took her we took her to get some food and then we got her checked into a a shelter for that evening and her as I was talking about the Lord to her she said yeah I know people other people have told me all about this she says I understand that but she said it doesn't help me at all she says I don't have any money to get a to get a hotel she says I don't have food she says I don't have any of these things she said what's it what good is it for me just to know this Jesus and she didn't get the point she didn't understand it and everything that I said it it just it just wouldn't reson so it's like okay well we'll help her we'll feed her we'll give her some money we'll get her into the shelter and hopefully something that we said stuck but then there was another story and I told this story partly this story last week that there was a young lady that my brother had been in contact with and she was coming to the Bible study that he does on Wednesday night and I like to talk a little bit more about that young lady her name's Jordan she was 10 years old got in a fight with her mom 10 years old got in a fight with her mom mom and dad was split up her mom gives her a garbage bag put she puts everything she has in it she says get out and go live with your dad 10 years old so the little girl goes she lives with her dad her dad mistreats her horribly many ways she's the poor little girl she's living through this she tells her aunt her dad's sister and she says don't ever tell anybody of this she says if you tell anybody this your dad will be put in prison and then you'll have nowhere to go so it scared the little girl time goes on and she finally confesses to her cousin who goes straight to the police her dad gets arrested she time goes on she goes back with her mom a after after a couple years her dad's her dad's able to make bail right after that a couple years he ends up going to prison for for decades now she's with her mom and she turns 17 she graduates high school and she gets into college she gets this really nice scholarship to the University of Louisville that she wants to be lawyer because of all of this stuff that that's happened to her she gets this scholarship and she um um she gets a scholarship and and she she moves out and the scholarship says that it's a bridge program you you go into criminal justice for three years and then you go into law school for three years and if you you there's two stipulations you have to either live on campus or you have to live with your parents she was moved out she couldn't live with her mom and she couldn't afford to live with her parents I mean she couldn't afford to live on campus so she gets kicked out of school because she didn't meet those requirements then she gets a she gets a job and and she's going to work her way through school and then she gets she has that seizure as I said last week she goes into the hospital she's never had a seizure like that before and she never had one since the um the nurse witnessed to her about the Lord Jesus she gives her heart to Christ she changed that young lady she got the point she started going to church she saw how important that this community that's around her is and she she appreciated it and she loved it and she she saw that she can get strength from the church she gets baptized last week as I said and then she she witnesses to the to the group at the Bible study how she got baptized my brother asked her to give her testimony she gives her testimony to that group my brother asked her he says you know like what are you going to do are you going to try to sue the school she said no she said I'm going to work through it she said I'm a fighter and you see the difference between the two the one that I witnessed to it's like what can you give me the other one realized that all my sins are gone and there were many and now I'm saved and now I can't do enough for him very different stories let's go to verse 15 wherefore the Holy Ghost maybe one I've been thinking about it maybe we'll fly her out here and have her give her testimony to the church it just it just struck me so much and what this young lady has gone through and she's not complaining she's putting God first in her life where whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them after those days sayeth the Lord and I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more again he's quoting Jeremiah 31 as he did in chapter 8 as we've gone through and he says I'll stop right there for a moment I just thinking about how good God is and how how precious he is and that promise to Jeremiah I will put my laws in their heart it wasn't the it was just a shadow that Temple and all of the all the laws and all the rituals it was just a type but then when Christ comes he fulfills it and then he tells Jeremiah he says I'm going to put my laws in their heart they are going to be living walking talking Bibles and the spirit of the Lord is going to come from them it's going to go into them and they are going to do my will in all things how beautiful is that I just I can't I can't say enough about that how wonderful it is that he would put his law his word into to us into me what an honor I never want to forsake Him I never want to do something wrong I always want to serve him so then it's not anymore Thou shalt not go to movies Thou shalt not wear certain types of clothing Thou shalt not go to public schools don't Thou shalt not let your kids play with the neighbor koods Thou shalt not go any church outside your denomination Thou shalt not listen to any other ministers other than the ones that are approved by the denomination when you receive those laws into your heart those times stop and then whatever you do you do it in the name of Jesus Christ if you're going to go to a movie you do it in the name of Jesus Christ if you're going to visit another church you do it in the name of Jesus Christ if you go to school you're going to go in the name of Jesus Christ and you will be a witness to those other kids about Jesus you're going to be that Living Bible before them if you're wearing certain clothes you're going to do it in the name of Jesus Christ under the conviction that he put under on on top of you the Holy Spirit leading you in all things because he is dwelling inside let's skip to verse 24 and let us consider one another to provoke un love and to Good Works not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exort in one another and so much more as you see the day approaching he's saying we need to be in church it's important not only will singing and hearing the gospel do you good but you're also making a sacrifice to be here it's so easy to stay home you know do you think that I always want to be here do you think that the brothers that are always here and the sisters always here do you think they always want to be here and answer is no but they make that sacrifice and then when you're here have you ever regretted coming to church I have a couple times when when it got to be about about um really just about insulting other churches and and putting other people down and exalting ourselves over someone else then yeah I would have done better just to go to the local church on the corner or the closest one to my house I would have done better to go to one of those with just a just a group of people that love the Lord Jesus and lift him up and humble themselves but the most important thing the point of all of it is we need to be here we need to be part of a group do you think this young lady Jordan she is so happy that she's part of a group she's so happy that she has a pastor that cares about her she's so happy that she has friends because she knows how it is not to have that she knows how it is not to have that support and the Bible very plainly says hey don't neglect this come to church be part of it I understand you you all know that I'm not a legalist I'm not I'm not somebody who's watching every time that you you hear that's not the point the point is being part and the point is helping and not only do you come here for yourself but you come here for other people to that you can help others and encourage others where are we at verse number 25 I'll read it again not forsaking the Assemblies of assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is but exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching for if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no sacrifice for sins but a certain fearful look but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall Devour the adversaries um is it does it seem to you like he's saying that if we don't congregate we're sinning willfully let me read another translation maybe that want to make it easier which is more it says this and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and to Good Works not neglecting to meet together as is the habit of some but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day Drawing Near for if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins but a fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries same thing says the exact same thing I'm not a legalist as as I've said I understand that there's reasons that some that prevent people from coming to church I I understand that some people are not able to get out of their house and God has has giving us has given a streaming but we need to be part of that body and I'm not saying I'm really I'm not saying that if you don't come to church chch I'm not saying that you're sinning willfully the book of Hebrews is saying that it's a higher level than I am and it's it's important because as the manner of some there are many people no one here but there are many people that they don't go to church because when they come they're looking for something to criticize and you're going to get it wherever you are in my sermon today I'm sure there's many things that you could say oh well he was wrong on this and he was wrong on that and you might be right but it doesn't say that I'm going to be perfect or no that any other man is going to be perfect but it says that to come and to be part of it and I see so often that they just well I'm just going to stay home because I don't want to be part of that or or or I'm too good for that or they may or they they teach something that I don't agree with that's not according to the word that is called arrogance saying that I'm too good I know people they go from church to church and then they're just going to stay home because that's that's where they're the happiest because they're better and it's not right my little sermon on coming to church it's important I love you all so much and and and I know I look out across and everybody here comes and everybody here part and and I I do appreciate every single one but the Bible commands us to be part and to be in church and it is very important and it's not for God he doesn't need us we need him and when we come here it helps us and then we can help other people the more the more we have the the the better the fellowship and you see the kids and they have more friends and and they can draw strength from each other we all need that where was I at verse 28 and we we'll close he that despised Moses's law died without Mercy under two or three Witnesses of how so much of how much sore punishment suppose ye shall shall he be thought worthy who hath trotten underfoot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sent Sanctified an Unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of Grace this it's not all fun and games if there is salvation then there's also judgment if there's forgiveness then there's also Vengeance we want forgiveness we want salvation for we know him that hath said Vengeance belongeth unto me I will recompense saying the Lord and again the Lord shall judge his people it is a fearful thing thing to fall in the hands into the hands of the Living God it's only by the grace of God that those people that were mocking the Last Supper that they weren't brought into Judgment at that very moment and it's only by the grace of God that many times that I have made mistakes in my life and many times that I have been to La too LAX with things or I have been too jokey around that God didn't just strike me down right there it was because of the blood of Jesus Christ the same blood that I believe that is staying the wrath of God for those people in France that did that abominable thing we're all under the protection of Christ and I just pray brothers and sisters that we can that he will just T so we can get everybody that we can in before he comes but call to remembrance the former days in which after you were illuminated he endured a great fight of afflictions partly was she were made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions and partly whilst you became Companions of them that were so used for ye had compassion of me in my bonds and took Joy joyfully the spoiling of your goods knowing in yourselves that you have a in heaven a better and enduring place so the author is talking directly to people in a specific audience here and he's saying that because you're a Christian you had your your possessions confiscated and they were also kind to him and brother Lyall that's why I think that's really good proof I think that that Paul wrote this letter is because he is saying that you also were kind to me when I was in my bonds which Paul many times says that cast not away therefore your confidence which hath great recompense of reward for you have need of patience that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and Will T not and will not t now the just shall live by faith but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are not of them who draw back into predition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul is a very very diff very tough chapter but it l it ends on a very very positive note because we are not brother Michael and the the um musicians would come and close but we are not of them who draw back unto predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul how beautiful how beautiful is God's word his promises and this book of Hebrews over and over again and it just repeats itself and I was amazed that as I as I dug deeper oh he said that to chapters ago and it was constantly going back telling us that this Christ is the high priest that this Temple is just a shadow of what should be which is us living this law and then this law that was given is just a shadow that it should be lived through our lives are you with me are we together as I said difficult very strong chapter in this book of Hebrews but the next chapter I'm really looking forward to that is I believe it's called a lot of people call it the Hall of faith and it goes through many many different Servants of the Lord and how they overcame and how that they weren't they didn't get caught up in the things of the world but God was with them and it doesn't mention and the thing about the next chapter is so wonderful to me is every single one of them had fa faults and flaws but the Bible it doesn't mention any of them it just sees Perfection there because Christ has come to perfect it God bless you brothers and sisters brother Michael there are to R May f one by sight one by take the word of God what you see what you is what will be send your wngs to The Winds of f you can cl to a higher Place do not

sisters keep each other in prayer the Bible tells us in the book of Hebrews to assemble ourselves together I believe that's not just a church it's outside of church and it's also with our prayers for one another because we all need it it's it's everyone everyone's going through something we all need the prayers of of our friends that really love us and brothers remember just brothers and sisters remember each other pray for one another encourage one another because that day is approaching we're seeing the signs soon it's all going to be over and then the work on Earth is going to be done and

area of all Idol worshippers and she used to write letters and that was the only thing that she had was that letter it was an email I'm sorry the the email that the only thing that she had she had she
