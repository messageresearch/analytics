lord it's mine amen we have a couple of prayer requests and I'm going read them to you from Erica Morales please pray that my employer give me Sunday off amen you know it's sometimes we wonder about our employers and but I had an employer as a good man me and my brother-in-law used to work there together and they had all these radios going on and this playing their music and them playing their music and they'd put it louder because they couldn't hear and they'd put it louder and it got to be just bad in the in the air and one day he walks up to me and my brother-in-law Mike and he says I'm going to do something I think's going to disappoint you all but I'm going to make them turn off all the radios he said they're competing one another he says I know that's going to disappoint you all he said' but I respect both of you he says I couldn't be a Christian like you but I respect it so he turned all the radios off and I just said Thank You Lord God is able so I believe the Lord can do this and a prayer request for Sister Sarah Conner says please pray for my sister anlam she says last week we found out she has terminal cancer she believes in God and she has been healed before but this has been a rough for her just pray God's Will and pray she gets a peace about it all so God bless you and let's pray for Sister Sarah too as she's helping take care of her and I believe her brother-in-law had to be put in to be cared for as they we're taking care of her so she's part of the family of God so let's remember if you'll stand with me you have a need something Lord you know you know I I need you sometimes I don't have the words for it sometimes are just something inside so if we'll believe that if we can do that brother Ronnie would you make your way up here and take this and then brother Ed after that if you would come and prepare for the offering how many know God's A Healer how many would an uplift arm say I know because I've I've I've been I I've I've had that experience he's touched me he's spoken to me he's helped me he's taken care of a situation he hasn't changed he's not any less in fact I believe he's greater now as we as we allow him to be more in US [Music] amen as we get ready to pray let's think about Sister Sarah many of you don't know it but she behind the scenes has helped so many people I know she's helped our family and I'm sure she's helped many and she's turned into this request if we could just take it to heart you know and and just she as we all we love our family and our sister we pray that as her request has been made that the Lord would meet it and give Comfort if it's time for her to be healed and she'll be healed if not prepare her soul for the other side but give the Sister Sarah the Comfort let's close our eyes and think about him Lord we come before you this morning bringing these prayer requests knowing oh God looking upon ourselves and we're So Unworthy but Lord I am not looking at me this morning I'm looking at you and I'm believing what you said I believe oh God as we come before you and ask you to forgive us our sins that we hide ourselves in your Perfection that you said in your word that we are to be perfect and the only way we know is to be hidden in Christ so oh God this morning hide us in your blessed blood and your grace and your love and Lord for these prayer requests Lord we this is our opportunity Lord to if we haven't done anything all week we can do something right now if Satan is is putting guilt on us for the little mistakes we've made all week right now we can make it right this moment is Our Moment this moment moment oh God is a moment we can make it right if we back it a little bit you can bring us right back up to where we need to be Lord Jesus we believe by faith that we are a Victorious church that you hear and answer our prayers Lord and we don't come before you Lord because of what we are but we come because of what you are and you gave you gave us this faith and we are so grateful this morning that we can come before you through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and have faith that you will hear and answer these prayers it is so hard in our carnal minds but Lord these prayers go up into the very heavens to where you sit and you listen and you're compassionate and you will return oh God these prayers no matter what they are no matter how long it takes I might be gone when you hear and answer my prayers for maybe my family but you'll hear them for each and everyone this morning oh God let them have the Faith No matter how long it takes you heard our prayer and we will confess that it has been answered and we thank you in the Blessed name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you love him as our brothers uh get ready take the offering and we'll just bow our heads and I should have asked brother Ronnie to do that but Lord as they take the offering now Lord for its intended use may you bless it may we be givers with a cheerful heart Lord somewhere someplace Lord that this would would go to the use that it's needed Lord and you said if we would give you would give a return more abundantly and you've proved it over and over to us Lord so we just want to say thank you Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen [Music] amen let's pick up the pace a little bit there I'm so [Music] glad oh I'm so glad Jesus Set Me Free I'm so glad Jesus Set

you there's never not a Time to give him praise amen this morning we have our brother Eli back to minister and last Sunday was unexpected this morning he was was already planning to come and I know last Sunday as he's getting ready to come out he said brother Aaron pray for me you know so in my prayer I just said Lord you knew this day you're not surprised by it and he told me later he said boy did that help we've got a reason to give thanks and praise unto the Lord and he's worthy of all praise so let's just stand and um to I just uh there's so many different songs I wrote down here and I'm not sure which way we want to go but to God be the glory let's do that to God be the glory you have a reason to pray to God be the glory to God be the glory for the things he has done with his [Music] blood he has saved me by his power he has raised me to God be the glory for the things he has done oh to God be the glory to God be the glory glor to God be the glory for the things he has done with his he has saved me by his power he has raised me to God be the Lord all the [Music] things bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless his all bless the Lord oh my soul and all that is within me bless His holy name for he has done great things he has done great things he has done great things bless his holy he has done great things oh he has done great [Music] things he has done great things bless His holy name amen God bless each and every one of you so good to be here in the house of the Lord once more to just give God all the honor and the glory um walking out here and hearing brother Aaron sing these songs to God be the glory and bless the Lord I realize that our love is very uh something has to be caused for us to love the Lord and he said for God be the glory for the things that he has done and that's why we glorify him and then we begin to sing bless the Lord bless the Lord for the great things that he has done again and that's why we're here because I think something has happened in our lives and that's why we want to worship him that's why we thank him even though maybe we don't see a completion of of the work of God yet we know something has happened and that's why we worship him that's why we give him the glory because we know he has done great things in our life and because of all the good things he has done we can bless the Lord and um I appreciate that and and I love the Lord for that because if it wasn't for him I don't know where I would be he had to initiate his love to me in order for me to love him and I I I believe that's why we're all here today um I just want to greet you all in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ it's just a blessing always to be here and just to fellowship with each and every one of you and fellowship within the worship and within the word and um I I just feel a sweet sweet Spirit here and knowing that there's people here grasp Asing and thirsting for eternal life and you know it makes um even though we're humans and we're nervous it makes things a whole lot easier because we know that it's not the person coming up here it's not the song leader it's not the um the beautiful songs that we hear but it's people that are pulling for God and God has to come and he comes through the music and he comes through the song leader comes through the the message and can speak to us and give us what we need so um I I'm just truly blessed to be here today and um I just want to um greet you all um brother Octavio made sure to tell me to greet the whole church greet our brother Daniel of course he's he's over there having a good time such a um needed time 25 years and it's just such a blessing that they're there and um let's just continue to pray for him and um he made sure to tell me me to make sure to greet each and every one of you brother Evans he said tell them I miss them I miss them dearly and tell and just greet them for me and um it it just shows the heart of of Love through him the heart of of God through him that that he's thinking about you guys even though he's in Paradise right now so um it's just such a blessing and I I'm I always appreciate our brother Daniel and um just for allowing me to be here and allow giving me a reason just to be around you guys so um let's just go straight to the scriptures if you like if you would like to turn with me to um Ephesians chapter 3 verse 14- 21 and um we're going to be reading that and we're also going to be reading first John chapter 4 but I I'll be a little quick on that one but whenever you have uh Ephesians 3:14 you can go ahead and say Amen just so that we can follow along this this uh whole scripture from 14 to 21 is is Paul's prayer to the Ephesians he just went and told them all of these things how Christ should dwell in them and and um the life they should live and how much the lord loves them and then he said this is my prayer to you and um such a beautiful prayer he says for this cause I bow my knees unto the father of our Lord Jesus Christ of whom the whole family in Heaven and Earth is named that he would Grant to you grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with might by his spirit in the inner man that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith I I like the way brother Paul speaks because we can have outward blessings we could have everything that we need but he says no you need your inner man strengthened and and that Christ May dwell in your hearts by faith that ye may be rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend now this this is a very strange text right here Paul is going into to science here and he he started to go down the three dimensions here he says that ye may be able to comprehend with all the saints the breadth the length the depth and the height and to know the love of Christ which passes knowledge that ye may be filled with the all the fullness of God now unto him who is able and this is a new word that I learned but I like it because you know with my bad grammar I use when I I have I had to write s or had to I would always if it was a very like a cold cold day I would say it was very cold and I was so happy and this was so cool and and in grammar you don't want to use those so much but it's I'm trying to regard something at its highest and I believe it's called if I don't I might butcher it but it's a super superlative to where it it's regarding something at its highest and I and I like it because Paul he uses those words he uses very and so even Jesus when God when he says for God so loved the world he he wanted to regard it to the highest and he says he says that you may know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that you may F be filled with all the fullness of God now unto him that is able now he's going to use a lot of superlatives here that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all things that we ask or think according to the power that worketh not around us not wherever else but in US unto him be the glory in the church by by J Christ Jesus throughout all ages World Without End Amen and in John well let us bow our heads and then we can can go to John Heavenly Father Lord your your love is just so great for us father something that I think is is very misinterpreted not not to just by us personally sometimes Lord we we don't truly understand your love but father here in these these scriptures and these words you are saying that ye may know the Love Of Christ which passees all of our knowledge passes all of our thinking but Lord you want us to know you father and I ask Lord that this little service father that this talk today Father may allow them to see you a little bit more in your love father that they may fall in love with you just a little bit more that they may go on and knowing that they are solid in your word and solid in you father I ask that you bless your your people father and Lord bless each and every person that is expecting father and I ask that you just take control of this service without you we are nothing Lord we ask all this in the precious name of Jesus Christ amen and amen you may be seated 1 John 4:10 and I'm going to go all the way to 19 he says here in is Love Now John if you ever really want to know what love is John he knows how to explain it he he was called the the Apostle of love and and he was the one that Christ loved and he loved him and he laid in jesus' bosom but but for some reason he was bestowed with these words and he said This is Love here in is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and sent his son to be a propitiation for our sins and then in in verse 19 of John 4 1 John 4 he says we love him because he first loved us and that's my title today I love him because he first loved me am you know God's love is is not merely just um an emotion because you know what everybody needs love everybody needs love whether it's it's um from a husband to a wife or a wife to a husband or friends everybody needs love and everybody is seeking for validation and love and and something when they're they're in school or they're at work they they want to be loved but but God's love is not just in emotional love that we seek every single day God's love of course brother Brandon broke it down for us and and he went into the Greek and he said that love that we seek every single day that validation that's an ailio love that's a love a brotherly love that we have amongst one another that's a love that I have for my wife and my wife has for me and I have for my kids and my kids for me that's a love that us humans have for one another that that's something that we seek but but here God's love is a love that is a Divine love that passes all understanding the Bible says that passes all of our knowledge and all of our understanding of what we think love is because love AAL love brother brandham said that that love can be perverted real quick yeah and we've seen it many times we've seen it to where where somebody can love somebody so much that they'll they'll um kill people for that person they they'll love somebody so so much and and and it's such a passion within them that they'll do strange things and and it becomes perverted and and we all have that love and we can get angry we can fall out of love we can go back into love that is a filal love but God's love is an eternal love that is something that that passes all knowledge and it's not merely an attribute of himself so love isn't just oh he's a love in God see brother brandham said that God had attributes to be a father a savior a son a Healer a king he had attributes within himself and he wanted to express those attributes but love isn't an attribute for him John said it the best if you ever want to know the definition of who God is what God is listen to what John says he gave the best definition in verse 14 or verse I believe yeah verse um 48 he says he that loveth not knoweth not God for God is love amen so it's not merely an attribute of him it's not merely just something that he has that can be taken away or something that started but that's who he is is and that's why he had all those attributes to be a father a son a king a Healer a savior because within him was love and in love and he wanted to express his love to his people he wanted to express how much he loved we typically um love somebody when when when something is uh we find something lovable sometimes our love or we we know that our love it has a beginning our love was initiated our love can be provoked and it could be manipulated see see I didn't I wasn't born loving my wife I wasn't born loving my children I I I went and I began to initiate a conversation and we begin to be friends and we begin to talk and we we begin to like each other and she she kind of liked me but maybe I loved her before she loved me I don't know but I know that there was an initiation there to where I said well you know what I like this person even to the point that you begin to love them that's what our love is our love is initiated our love can be can Veer us off of the path sometimes be when somebody is In Love sometimes they do crazy things for love and it can be manipulated God's love never started God's love it it it originates within itself God's love is as Eternal as God is the Paul says if you can comprehend the wi the de or the width the height and the length of God's love and he said the depth also so that passes all understanding if you could understand that it goes beyond our three dimensions of length width and height but it goes into the deepness past every Dimension that's God's love God's love is not influenced God's love is as true as his own word yes prise God first John 5:3 he says for this is the love of God now he's explaining what love of God is again he says this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievious so that there's a correlation with God's love and his pure unadulterated word that when this is the love of God if we can stand on the word you know a lot of times we we see many times that people people stand on the word without the love of God he says this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and then he says and his Commandments are not Grievious we stand on the word yet we're not totally in love with the Lord what is it going to do it's going to allow us it's going to make us break nobody can what I've realized in my life is nobody can live the word nobody can live up to the word true I remember I had a buddy that just came from prison or it was I think it was jail only but he was there for quite a long time for months and and he came to me and and I took him to my house and I was telling him because I just gave my heart to the Lord and I was telling him how much God God is good and this is real and and God is he said you know what I've realized he said I read this book and usually whenever you're in jail or you're in prison you begin to read all kinds of things he said I read this book and I read that book oh yeah and I read the Bible all of it and that put me to shame because I didn't read the whole Bible but he said I read the whole thing and my realization is that nobody can live up to the Bible and for me in my ignorance I said no no no no yes you can yes you can and now that I I get older and I get older I realize nobody can us me myself I can never live up to the word of God it takes something it takes a spirit he said this is the love of God and only the way we can have the love of God Is by his only Holy Spirit and that's the only way we can stand on God's word that's the only way we can be true and faithful to God is by his holy spirit without it we're going to crack every time just like that coow hide brother bam talked about and that's in the Bible he said you put new wine every time that old coow hiide is going to break because we cannot be uh malleable to that wine to that Revelation to that word we'll never be able to we'll never be able to live up to that word but once have Christ in your life and then his word his Commandments they're not Grievous they almost become a a love chore it it becomes something that you want to do you wake up and you want to do it not that you have to do it right ah it's so hard to be a Christian oh it's so hard whenever they call me old fashion it's so hard you haven't entered into that part yet keep going you haven't entered into that place to where you could say praise God that I am reproached for my Jesus Christ praise God that I can stand on his word though the whole world uh hates me criticizes me the whole the whole world is going one way I can go against the current yes yes why because of the love of God love the God's love isn't a response to our love for him our love arises from his love for us his love doesn't rely on ours and it remains constant demonstrating The Sovereign free surprising unmatched nature of God's love God's love it doesn't need anything you know what's amazing is what you do when you backslide when you fall it doesn't move God's love God's love cannot be manipulated it cannot be provoked so no matter what the the Bible says God is love you know what that means it's been there in the beginning before the beginning it was eternal all the way way from predestination all the way to glorification God God's love has been there cuz it is it is God when you say oh the love of God you're talking about God himself so God's love he he didn't see you and see you live a good life and think oh man this brother he's going to give his heart to me and you know what I love him for that oh man he fell right here you know what I don't know I take that back no his love is a constant love his love is something that cannot be changed now the greatest one of the greatest scriptures that of the Bible that everybody knows is John 3:16 and where Jesus uses that superlative for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth than him should not perish but have everlasting life God so loved and and um I was reading where Charles spian he he explained that word so he said God has such love in his nature that he must needs to let it flow forth to a world that is perishing by its own willful sin and when it flowed forth it was so deep so wide so strong that even inspiration could not compute its measure and therefore the spirit gave us that great little word soul and left us to attempt the measurement according as we perceive more and more the love divine he said I can't measure it it's unmeasurable Paul says that can you understand the length the width the depth the height of God's love he says can you know the love that passes knowledge now that's a contradiction there because he's saying do you know something that cannot be knowable can you know something that has passed your knowledge it's only by The Experience God gives you it's only by knowing what he did for you when he so loved the world that he got Jesus Christ and gave him to us Jesus is the expression of God's love that's why brother bandam says Christ is the mystery of God revealed everything that God was all of his attributes everything that he thought in the beginning was Jesus Christ and he was the expression when he said God so loved the world he could have said he he went and sent Angels down for God so loved the world that he made a new one or he did this no he said he sent his only begotten son he gave everything for you and I it's easy to give when we have a lot it's easy to give a penny when we have a hundred but whenever you give everything that God's expression to us one of the greatest things that I've heard brother Bram say is is always thought God was mad at me but Jesus loved me and you know what I've thought that way too reading that Old Testament you're like oof that's hard and then you start going to the New Testament you just want to be in the New Testament because it's love love love but not knowing brother Bram says that love is the very Heart Of God that that the the whole Old Testament was God bringing back his his children back to him and finally he manifested it in the name of Jesus Christ and now the very Heart Of God went and was spit on and laughed at and beaten his heart how how does it feel whenever we put our heart in the line for somebody when we break down all of our barriers for this person knowing that that now my heart my love is in their hands I I've built all of these walls over the years so nobody hurts me I built everything so that nobody can attack my heart my love my affection but then you break everything down for somebody and you say here you go it's yours and then for that person to to disregard it for that person to laugh at it and and to to think of it as nothing what a what a heartbreak what a hurtful thing it is that's what Jesus did for us Jesus was the very heart of God and people laughed at him people didn't believe him and to the point to where he died on the cross for you and I but he didn't go there ignorantly he went there knowing there was going to be people here today people here today that was going to regard God's love and say Lord I'm lost Lord I have no other place to go Lord I I'm dying in sickness Lord my family is is in shambles you can come to the feet of Jesus and Jesus the very heart of God can take that sin can take your family can take that sickness and make it whole for God so loved the world Christ's Mission about God's love it recognizes and overcomes our sin that's what Christ's mission was it was so that so that he could recognize our sin to think of God's God that to think that God is indifferent to someone's life whether it's evil or it's virtuous that's a misunderstanding of God's love many people say well God loves me either way well God is love and and they're living in sin well God loves God loves yeah he does because the Bible says for God so Lov he didn't say the elect only he said the whole world so yes he does love he does Love The Sinner out there he does love the hypocrite he does love the backslider he does love the perfect one he loves everybody even the Young Rich ruler that turned him down Jesus looked at him and loved him the Bible says so yes God loves but the reason why he sent Christ because there was a problem between us and sin that it took us took us out of the of God and put us into a path that is nothing but judgment and wrath and now every single person that is born of this world is going to that judgment that is going to that wrath because somebody chose not to obey him so what Jesus did because God so loved the world he brought Jesus Christ and he says you know what I'll pay it I'll pay the the price I'll do anything that I can so that they don't have to die that's what God's love is it's not so that we can continue in our sin it's not so that we can say oh God loves me and continue on it's so that he could take us out of our sin take us out of our unbelief because for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever that's me that's you whosoever ever that's the elect whosoever believeth shall not perish but have everlasting life Paul says that you may be able to comprehend his love how can we comprehend it he says that the comprehended with the the length the width the depth the height that that God he even he he his whole motive of love he created those three dimensions so that he could enter into that length width depth and height so that we can know his love and I ask myself well how do we know the fullness of God how do we know his love and it's in Romans 55 it says and hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us that's how you begin to know God's love any other way brothers and sisters we we can never comprehend God what I've realized in my life I can never love God the way I really want to just like I said I can never follow his word I can never love the Lord with my ailio love that's what brother brandham says there's people in the mountaintops then the valley then the mountain tops they're happy then they're sad they love the Lord then they hate him why because we're we're trying to love him with our human love the thing is God understands that God understands that we are incapable that we are insufficient that there is no way we can love God the way he needs to be loved I I um was thinking about all of this and and I came across the story of Hosea and goer and I realized that that Goomer is me I does anybody know that story where God was having a terrible time with Israel and God brought this righteous man named Hosea and he said Hosea you your life is going to be a prophecy everything that you go through is what I'm going through with Israel with my people so Hosea a young man he says okay God whatever you want me to do he says yes I want you to go and marry a woman praise God praise God I've been in the ministry and I've been I've been um serving the lord as much as I can and and now God wants me to marry a woman yes I can go to the church oh I already know her name I've been talking to her and God say says no you're going to have to go to the bad side of town you're going to have to go to the bad places and find yourself a harlot he says what he say no no no no no no Lord I don't want to do that I don't want to do that he says no you are going to be a picture of what I go through with the unconverted heart with what I go through with my the children of Israel and what he goes through with us when we don't have the Holy Spirit he says I'm going to you're going to be the perfect picture of my undying love my Redemption story so he finds this woman her name was Goomer and this woman she she she was in the bad side of town she was raised uh in horri she didn't know anything about a good home she didn't know anything about God's love she didn't know anything about a prayer life she didn't know anything about goodness and love that was us when we were born we didn't know anything the Bible says we were in enmity towards God we were enemies we didn't know anything about God that's who she was and this man been saving himself for a good wife and God says no you are going to be my prophecy and and he went and he took her not to use her like every other man does like the world does but he had to go and make her a wife to him make her and not just make her a wife but he had to love her because he says you're going to be just like me and I love Israel even though they they deal treacherously with me you're going to have to love her she she was not what he thought his wife was going to be she she didn't know how to be loved or how to love she couldn't comprehend it that's not what she was raised by she didn't know how to to love him and and to be all of that that she needed to be but for something for some reason in her she said yes I I need to I I don't want to continue to live the way I live I can't continue to to live in sin that's why we made our step that's why we've accepted because we can't continue even though our life may seem righteous yet we're born in sin and our own self-righteousness can become our sin our own uh I've never done this and I've never done can be our own sin so we're all Goomer we're all unworthy but yet by God's grace God told him to marry her not just to just to marry her but to love her this was something that she wasn't used to this is something that she wasn't accustomed other men would use her that's what she was comfortable with but love see we're used to all of these things of the world we're used to everything like this but when it comes down to love undying love I don't know and even though she said yes in her lips her heart her mind she was still Harlot she still had that in us and and brother Bram says this statement in the message of Pride it's very hard statement but he's talking about this woman that that washed Jesus his feet we know what she was she was a harlot she was a prostitute and and and and then brother brandham says he says you say brother brandham I'm no prostitute he says I don't altogether mean sexually but prostitution on a higher level you can prostitute your time how much time do you give him prostitute your own selfish motives going and saying going around and saying well I belong to this church I'm better you're not you can prostitute otherwise and sexually the holy spirit will speak to your heart and you'll say I don't want nothing to do with that and there there's a another definition we already know all the definitions of that word but there's one that says to devote yourself to corrupt or unworthy purposes and and sometimes God he will pull us out of the myy clay and we could sing that song he brought me out of the myy clay but it's still in us he says when justification he pulls the cup out of the farmyard but it's still dirty he Hosea took her from a life of worthlessness and brought her into worthiness he saved her from filth and moved her into to a house of blessings and there she was praise God I'm saved there she is in church praise God he he justified me praise God he he did something he pulled me out she was there she didn't have to live a life the way she used to live she made it she's under the care of the Prophet her husband but her mind was somewhere else we can come to church we can praise the Lord participate in church related things but where are you where are we we can be here physically but where are we is it possible that two people can live in us at one time is it possible the Bible says that a double-minded man is unstable in his all of his ways if you look into that scripture in in the Greek it's a two-spirited man it says you're you're here and you're there and you love God but but you can't get just let loose of the things of the world brother brand says that's the most miserable place to be in it is you're we're only hurting ourselves we're only hurting ourselves when we're in that position when when we can't allow God's love to just overflow us but yet yet we don't allow the S Satan to take us all the way we say no no no I'm a Christian but we could be in here but that's not where we really are Hebrews 12:1 it says to lay aside every weight and the sin which do so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us we have to break all of those things and and and sometimes we're stuck on what we were before Jesus took us out like I said we we sing that song he took me out of the my clay but then we romanticize of the of our past we still think of the good old days we still we're still back in those times and we're still linked to those things Hosea took her out of that situation but that situation wasn't out of her and he took her and let's say that they became happy together she was happy with him she began to do what she was supposed to do and she began to be comfortable in that area and maybe the early days of their marriage were beautiful as as his love began to Blossom and and and and her love somewhat she she had an idea of it somewhat she she knew how to love him with a pure heart God blessed them God gave them a son she was a mother she was living the life we were praising the Lord we're coming to church we're doing what we're supposed to do Goomer it means completed that's her name brother she was the most incomplete person there but her name was completed and I know that she thought about herself when she would think about herself even though she had the nice dress she she looked like a a housewife she looked like like hosea's wife now now Hosea wasn't just any normal man he was the man of the hour he was the man probably the most famous man in Israel preaching the word preaching repent repent God is coming she was there following she was there doing what she was supposed to do but yet in within herself she knew she wasn't complete she knew she she wasn't where she supposed to be she was supposed to be but when God sees you I I want you to understand and I I spoke this last time of of God put everything within you already he predestinated you meaning that he put your beginning and your end within you and when God sees you he sees you as a finished work no matter if we feel incomplete Hosea didn't see her as a harlot anymore maybe people would try to remind her of who she was but her own husband his eyes was fixed on his wife that was his wife the mother of his child then they had another child his name was jezel and and it seems like like Hosea begins to notice a change in Gomer she begin to be restless and unhappy this Christian Life is is you know know you you need to be careful before you say yes to the Lord make sure you know what what you're going into but I want you to understand that this is the greatest decision for those that that are are Teeter tottering on on making that decision this is the greatest decision you can ever make it's the only Eternal decision brothers sisters we we make so many decisions of life I always joke around of what kind of Starbucks do we want today what where do we want to go today what what sucks the white or the black ones what tie this one or that one we have so many decisions but the greatest decision you can ever make in your life is Christ she made that decision but she began to see her surroundings and and and within her she began to be restless kind of like a bird in a cage she she she didn't know what to do and he continued on he went preaching he encouraged the Wayward Nation turn from their sin and trust God for deliverance from the threat of surrounding Nations return to the Lord was the theme of his message he preached it repeatedly and repeatedly with power but Goomer seemed less and less interested in his ministry in fact that she may have grown to resent it she probably even accused Hosea of thinking more about preaching than he did of her she began to find other interests to occupy herself and spent more time away from home she only had a shallow understanding of what true love was she was not capable of truly loving him she didn't know how to she maybe lived in in she didn't have no parents she who knows what her life was brother bam says if you always see a wayward woman it's because something happened to her maybe a man led her astray maybe it was her own father who knows what it was but but something changed her to do those things to give up on love and to give up on all all the things that are good that's why a lot of times we'd rather be in the world we'd rather because that's our comfort zone we'd rather smoke we'd rather drink we'd rather cuss and and be just like everybody because it's easier than this narrow way this narrow way is not easy but it has an eternal reward behind it it has somebody that truly loves us not emotionally not something that's going to to fade away tomorrow not an abusive love not not just to to mess us up in the end but a love that's going to take us from our condition all the way to Eternity that's our Hosea that's Jesus Christ she didn't understand and and I begin to remember the story about Peter when when Peter he already denied Jesus Christ he messed up after three times he he he denied him and Jesus he was there crucified and and and he raised up the third day and Peter was there found fishing and finally Jesus goes back to him to a defeated Peter to a defeated man he was the one that says Lord I'll die for you he was the one that says even though they they reject you I won't he was the one that was telling him Lord I I'll go to you and get off of the boat that was Peter that was nobody else he told them he affirmed his love to Jesus but in the end of the day he could not do it he could not love God the way he wanted to even though Peter's love was sincere even though it was with all of his heart in the end of the day we cannot love God the way we want to with this flesh with my own mind it's past my knowledge past my understanding and so he goes and and they finish eating I I love that every time Jesus he's in his glorified body he's eating I love it and then he was it was after fishing they were eating fish I'm like praise God this is this is my heaven right here they just barely finished eating they got the glorified Jesus right next to them and they oh man beautiful but they just finished eating and and he began to ask Peter this question and I'm sure you all know this but he asked him do you love me Peter yes he he actually reverted back to his old name he said Simon see Peter Peter was the man with revelation Peter was the man that who knew Jesus Christ but he reverted back to Simon he says Simon do you love me more than all of these maybe he saw his beautiful fishing boat all of the fish around all of his buddies and said do you love me more than these Peter says yes I love you maybe when Jesus said that he said do you love me more more than these disciples love me he says yes I love you but when Jesus asked him that he used Agape he says Agape do you love me Peter do you love me Simon and when when Peter he turned to him he says yes ailio I love you I said he he he says I love you as much as I can Lord he okay feed my sheep feed my Lambs he says do you love me Peter Peter's like he just asked me this Simon do you love me yes do you love me agapit yes ailio yes I love you he couldn't comprehend God's love he couldn't go up to Jesus's level when Jesus was asking him about a greater love a love that's not going to deny him of love that's not going to cow away when when push comes to shove it's a love that will die and suffer and sacrifice their life for him do you love me Peter I love you as much as I can Lord and Jesus knowing knowing that he was incapable of God's love he went to his level and the third time he says ailio he says do you love me aelio and Peter's like Lord you know all things you know my heart you know everything about me I love you ailio yes he says okay then feed my sheep amen Jesus had to go to the level of Peter even regarding him as Simon knowing that his nature wasn't changed yet and he and that's when he began to tell him you're going to suffer many things for me you're not going to live the way you want to live anymore and Peter as much as he could in his human love did everything he could to show him because he said Lord you know my heart so Peter wasn't a hypocrite Peter Peter wasn't trying to put on he knew who he was standing in front of and a lot of times when when our nature isn't changed we could tell the Lord face to face Lord I love you people might say Well then why do you keep sinning why do you keep cing away when it's time to step up why do you keep reverting back to your old ways and maybe people might see a hypocrite or a backslider but God sees somebody that truly loves him but just is not capable of loving him the way he needs to be loved Peter showed everything he showed all of his colors and says Lord I love you but it took the day of Pentecost he says when you're converted Peter he says there's going to be a day you're going to sacrifice he he was telling him of another Peter he was talking to him of another man that was going to stand for him and finally when they were in the upper room scared scared of reproach scared because their savior just died and he resurrected and now people are are looking because the tomb is empty people are looking for the disciples looking for Jesus they were scared but when the Holy Spirit God's Own love entered into their heart Peter stepped down there Peter wasn't afraid anymore he wasn't afraid of this little girl that says oh you're you're the that man of Galilee even to the point to where he cussed at her he wasn't scared of it no more maybe there was hundreds of people but the Bible says when he stomped out of that Upper Room there was thousands yes and he got up on Top of the Rock saying this is this that Joel preached about this is what he was talking about that in the last days I shall pour my spirit amongst his people man what a difference then he could then whenever they were crucifying him they were going to kill him for the cause of Jesus he says I'm not worthy I'm not worthy to die like my Lord turn me upside down what a love what a love so scripture uh doesn't give us the details of the situation in home so I'm dramatizing goomer's story just have a few more minutes but we don't know what was going on but we it shows that her unfaithfulness begin to unravel that when she had her other child his name was L luru hamama which means unpitied and unloved her third child was loami which means not my people if it was it wasn't his children anymore she went out and as she was occupying herself somewhere else she might have found somebody else and reverted back to her old ways and committed adultery and her own children wasn't his anymore and you could see in Chapter 2 how how God through Hosea begin to blead with Goomer and and and and cry out to them see it's not easy this is a harsh statement but it's not easy to go to hell brother Brown says he says we fight our way to hell we break through every barricade that God has we break through everything God even even we break through the barricade of our our parents' prayers of the pastor's preachings of of the spirit that you feel and and the convictions you feel we break through everything we break and we break and that's what Goomer was doing we see we we see that that um that he begins to prophesy and and he needed her but then he threatened to disher her in verse three but still she ran off with lovers because they promised to Lavish her with material that was verse four verse 5 he he tries to stop her on one of occasions one occasion six Hosea says I'll take her back I'll take you back again and she would come back but her repentance would be shortlived and soon she would run off with somebody again and finally she got to a point where she left for good she left for good and I wonder if if hoseah here with now these children children that weren't even his children that he had to take care of now he has to take care of them and maybe I don't know if it was a sigh of relief I don't know if he cried every night for her I don't know what it was but but God told him he says go back go back and find the woman that is loved of another go back and marry her again all everything that he went through everything that she did all of her unfaithfulness but God was showing his grace and his love for his people sometimes we think that our little action are going to disrupt God's love for us it's impossible brother you don't know how aggressive God's love is it's this it's not this beautiful little heart that we see in Valentine's Day it's not this lovey-dovey thing God's love is aggressive the Bible says that love casts out fear that doesn't mean he come on get out of here please no casting out is just like the same word that Michael did to Satan in the beginning it casts out things in our lives love is aggressive and and and and he said go and find her and he began to look Brothers we are incapable of loving God seeking him believing his word keeping his word we're incapable of it all so God comes down and looks for us just like he did with Adam when Adam sinned he should have been this one that says Lord where are you I messed up no he started to hide that's our nature when we fall we sin we we begin to hide and it's God saying Adam Adam where are you it's God's grace it's the Bible says no man can come to me except the father draws him and I will raise him up in the last day no man can come to me no man can can cry out to the Lord I'm the one that is seeking for you I'm the one that loves you more than you can ever love me and and and he began to go and as she left for good he he went and began to go into the bad places again Jesus went all the way to hell for us he went all the way to the bad places how embarrassing the man of the hour the man that is has been preaching this message the man that that has been showing God through his messages having to go into that place Hosea have you seen my wife have you seen her where is she where's she at I know I know she wants to be out here but but she's my wife amen and finally when when he goes he looked at the grocery store he looked at at this place he looked over here but he went and he went to the slave markets and there she was being auctioned to the highest bidder back to the same condition and when he looked at her he said that's that's my wife that's my bride that's that's them I love them and he went probably to that person he said sir sir that's my wife right there I don't care who she is to you I don't care if whatever she is to you you have to pay this much you have to pay the price and maybe when she saw him she was full of Shame saying like how why did he come back I'm comfortable in my situation I'm comfortable in my sin I know where I'm going to go but I don't know anything else I don't know H H how to be a Christian I don't know how to do these things but he'll come back for you he'll come back and and was she was there wondering why he was there he he says I'll pay whatever it is he says it's 15 shekels it's it's everything that you have and he says take it all take everything that's my wife that's my child that's my people and and he paid everything he could so he can buy her back and whenever he bought her back he renewed his vows back to her the Bible says he says you're going to stay with me many days you're never going to play the Harlot anymore you're going to be my wife I'm going to be your husband no matter what that's God's love to us when we were in sin when we tried to play religious when we tried to do all of these things God's love it's it's aggressive love to where he'll bring us back and he'll say you'll no more do those things you'll no more sin I'm going to put my spirit in you so that you can be in Overcomer amen so that you can love me properly let us stand to our feet that's what I want I want more of God's love I want God's love to be shed not only around me not all of the blessings see she knew all the blessings she knew she she tasted the feeling of being a housewife tasted the feeling of good food and always always having a warm place to stay we know those outward blessings but the Bible says that his love will be shed abroad in our hearts I don't want just outward blessings Brothers I'm tired of of of of feeling a presence and walking out of that presence every single Sunday I'm tired I'm tired of of wanting to love him but not knowing how because I S sin because of my habit because of the little secret sins that that only he knows no this is the time to make that decision this is the time to say Lord I don't want to leave your presence again I don't want to go to those places I I want to love you the way you love me Lord I Want To Know Your immeasurable love there's a way to know his love that passes knowledge just receive him in your heart and you'll see it and maybe in increments he'll show you every single day how much he loves you how much he loves you by by the healings by by by seeing your nature change every single day by seeing you not wanting to do those things and you say God how much you love me his love is unmovable unshakable his love can never be manipulated or provoked it's here to stay and he loves you whether you're out there or you're in here whether you love him back or you don't for God so loved the world Heavenly Father Lord I just ask that this little tiny understanding father of how much you love us can be just revealed in us a little bit more if if not a lot more father so father we can know how to serve you father so that we can keep your commandments so that each and every person can live an overcoming life because the the times are getting darker Lord the times are getting harder even though it might be easier financially it might be easier in the world but yet there's
