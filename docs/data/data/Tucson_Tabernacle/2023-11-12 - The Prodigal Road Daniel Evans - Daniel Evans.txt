people's hearts I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen God bless you all you can take your seats I U I was listening to that song that brother Jordan was singing and uh I'm going to get carried away when I get carried away I thought what what kind of a a strange person would say something like that well it's somebody that it's talking about when we die and Hallelujah by and by we're going to fly away and it's a Christian that looks forward to that day what an odd thing for the world to think everybody's dreading going Beyond this this time and this world but we're looking forward to it that's a Christian walk right there I appreciate the prayer request and and brother Jordan said something that I thought you know that that's right he said each prayer request is important to the Lord and that's the truth every time that we bring something before the Lord it's important to him as brother Jordan said no matter how small how big whatever it is it could be a wayward child or it could be just Lord help me to get through today I'm not feeling good whatever it is it's important to him because he loves us I appreciate he mentioned uh we went through we had our meeting last night with trustees uh mentioned that Stephanie and I are taken off um we're going on a on a trip she's not here so I can talk about her she's up in Sunday school still but uh yeah we uh 25 years ago we got married and uh we went to the island of kaai in our honeymoon and we're going to go back at the Lord's will in tomorrow looking forward to it um looking forward to getting some rest and really praying about some things that that we have in our heart um I think especially Stephanie needs it I I just you know friends I I just appreciate appreciate the Lord so much I appreciate the message that he's given us I've been thinking lately this isn't one I'm going to be ministering on today but I've been thinking lately about about the message and about how to bring the word across to the people and it's the desire of my heart is I want to introduce everyone that I can to a living Jesus Christ that is the purpose that's everything and sometimes we get sidetracked and we we preach about our own Ministry minies or we preach about something that that is supposed to take us to Christ and then we just leave it right at at the very foundation and we need to make sure that we're moving on in the Lord Jesus I appreciate if you know me personally which I think everybody does you know I appreciate brother brandom's message so much the reason the main reason I appreciate it main reason I listen to it every day the main reason I just covet the things that he said is because his message even though I never knew him he died well before I was born but his message introduced me to a living Jesus Christ that is the purpose I could not pay him a greater compliment than to say one day I will meet him and I'll say brother brandom your message inspired me to serve Jesus Jesus Christ and it inspired me to lay hands on the sick and know that that Jesus is there he's the same yesterday today and forever and he can heal the sick and that's what it that's what it means so much to me and it's not trying to place him in the different scriptures and and all that that's good but the main thing is that we find Christ in the message because it's everything no one else that has ever lived can do anything Christ is everything and if we can point people to a living Christ Christ in every sermon Christ in every service Christ every day on my lips talking about Jesus all the time this is what he did for me that's why I can say when I die Hallelujah by and by I will fly away that's why I can say what brother Jordan said I'm going to get carried away when I get carried away is because of the man that died on that cross he means everything everything any Minister preach about Jesus because you can't find Salvation in any other in any denomination in any system in anything else there is no salvation in any other but our Lord Jesus Christ I um this morning I want to talk about this Parable in Luke chapter 15 and it's um it talks about Jesus tell tells three stories and the first story he tells is he tells he's talking to a group of Pharisees and these Pharisees see Jesus there and we know the Pharisees and we know the attitude that the Pharisees had towards him and they say they see Jesus there and Jesus W is with is surrounding himself with Sinners I was talking with somebody I can't remember who it was yesterday and somebody told me that somebody was wanting to come to church but this person had to get a few things right before he comes to church and I said no that's not true that's why you come to church is to get those things right you don't have to get them right before you come just come just get in this place just come in here and then the Lord will work it out you don't have to get right before you come here that's the whole purpose of church is to get in and to get closer with the Lord and to get these things right and Jesus is talking to he's telling the story to these Pharisees and these Pharisees are seeing that he's surrounding himself with Sinners bad people people prostitutes and tax collectors and and Jesus is surrounding himself with them and they're pointing their finger at him look at look at who he's with Jesus turns to these Pharisees and he says he says listen he says there was a Shepherd this man had a hundred sheep and he said one of those sheep got lost and he said this man he goes out and he's looking for his sheep and he wasn't even thinking about the 99 he was thinking about this one sheep that had gone he looked everywhere for it and he finally found the sheep and he took the sheep and he put it up on his shoulders he was so thankful he was so happy and he brings this sheep in and he tells his friends let me read Luke 15: 7 when he brings that sheep back he says this Jesus is talking he says I I say unto you likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over the 99 just persons which need no repentance what a what a statement and there's those Pharisees looking and he's he's saying listen it's important that these people come to the Lord and then tells him another story a second story is about a woman that she was she was going to be married and she and she lost a coin she had 10 coins and she lost a coin and these 10 coins were going to be in a hairpiece that she would wear as a married woman and she had lost one of those coins and she was looking everywhere and she cleaned her house and she was trying to find these coins everywhere and finally she found the coin coin that was missing and she rejoiced and she told all of her friends that that I found my coin that was lost and she wasn't even thinking about these other nine coins they were there they were safe where they should have been but it was the one coin that was lost these two Parables Jesus was laying the foundation for the third Parable and you have to remember again Jesus's audience I'll read Luke 15:1 it says here as I said before then Drew near unto him all the publicans and sinners for to hear him and Jesus and the Pharisees and the scribes murmured saying this man receiveth Sinners and eateth with them now this third story that Jesus tells after he tells about the sheep and after he tells about the coins is about this young man this young man was probably raised we know he was raised in a good home good parents Abraham Lincoln one time said he said that the strength of a country lies in the homes of her people and the strength of this America is in the home is what Abraham Lincoln said and if the home continues the way it's going friends if it continues and the separation of the nuclear family continues to go the way it's going the family doesn't eat dinner together where the word of the Lord is talked about by Mom and Dad the family devotions where we get our families together and we talk about the Lord Jesus and we talk about his word and we read our Bibles where dad reads the Bible to the family and where where they pray together and Mom and Dad pray with the kids when we see those times go and they are going they're almost gone this country is going to be defeated once again it's going to be defeated like Rome was defeated like Greece like Babylon and like Israel Was Defeated so many times it's going to be defeated not by military might but it's going to be defeated by sin that's what's prophesied to be in this last day this country will fall as I said it won't fall because of mil military might that may be the ultimate conclusion but it will fall because of the sin that is in the people and it starts right in this nuclear family and we see it spread we see it spread with a legalizing of drugs towards a censoring of Christianity calling it hate speech towards the promotion of homosexuality which has come because of the the degradation of the morals that are in this country see even the sanctity of marriage is not respected if you look in in the in this book this Bible there's idolatry and there's the sanctity of marriage and those two things are seems to be what has failed throughout history and it's not taught anymore to our children it's not taught that when you are thinking about marrying someone this is a forever thing you are making a vow between between this person and God and you cannot go back it should be taken so carefully this Bond of marriage it shouldn't be entered into haphazardly it's a very very serious thing and it's not taught in our homes anymore it's not taught in our churches anymore it's like oh if you don't like this one you can just go on to the next one and it's something that has contributed to problems that are in the world and it's going to continue to degrade and here we have this young man he was brought up in this in this good family but there was something pulling on this young man outside of the Lord and what it was we see so often that we see and all of us see it we see people fail we see people fall into sin and what the enemy does is there is a pull on each of us and the enemy makes us think that that pull is sin and it's not it's God that's pulling on us it's God that's trying to bring us to him and instead Satan gets in there and he throws in partying he throws in sin sleeping around he throws in these things and and he makes us think that this is what is going to fulfill that desire and it always ends up in sadness for the people there's never anything there this young man about to's story what he did is he put himself first and it's it's one of the saddest stories in the Bible has a n has a good ending but it's a tremendous lesson I pray that I can do it justice what this man did this young man is he took what I'm calling the title of my sermon today he took the prodigal Road rather than taking the road that God and his family had set before him let's turn to chapter 15 of the Book of Luke and start with verse 11 and I'll read the whole story I believe this is the Lord's will I just feel it right now I believe it's the Lord's will to bring this message right now and he said a certain man had two sons and the Young of them said to his father father give me the portion of the goods that falleth to me and he divided unto them his living so he asked for his inheritance and his father gave him his inheritance early and not many days after the young son gathered all together and took his journey into a far country and there wasted his substance with riotous living and when he had spent all there arose a mighty famine in the land and he began to be in want and he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country and he sent him into his fields to feed swine and he would Fain have filled his belly with with the husks that the swine did eat and no man gave unto him and when he came to himself he said how many hired Servants of my fathers have bread enough to spare and I perish with Hunger I will arise and go to my father and I will say to him father I have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to begal thy son make me as one of thy hired servants and he rose and came to his father but he when he was yet a great way off his father saw him and had compassion and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him and the son said unto himf father I have sinned against heaven and in thy sight and am no more worthy to be called thy son but the father said to his servants bring forth the best robe and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and shoes on his feet and bring hither the fatted calf and kill it and let us eat and be merry for this my son was dead and is alive again he was lost lost Amazing Grace and is found and they began to be mared now his Elder son was in the field and as he came and Drew nigh to the house he heard music and dancing and he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant and he said unto him thy brother is come and thy father had killed the fatted calf because he that received him safe and sound because he hath received him safe safe and sound and he was angry and would not go in therefore came his father out and intreated him and he answered and said to his father Lo these many years do I serve thee neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment and yet thou never gavest me a kid which is a goat that I might make Merry with my friends but as soon as this thy son was come which thou deved devoured which hath devoured thy living with harlots thou Hast killed for him a fatted calf he didn't give me a goat but you give him the fatted calf and he said unto him son thou art ever with me and all that I have is thine it was meat that we should make Merry and be glad for this thy brother was dead and and is alive again and was lost and is found what a story we look at this young man that went out he wasn't satisfied with his home life he wanted to experience the world friends so often we're not satisfied with what we've been given and we see something over here we we want something over there and it just it we lose track of what's important and then we go and we take off like this young man did and then we ruin our lives in doing so they're searching for something as I said earlier all of us are searching for something they're searching for something and and they feel this pull and they find it in drugs they find it in drinking they find it in sex they find it in pornography they find it in money they find it in power they find it in success in popularity and they are searching for something as I said there is a deep calling to the deep that Holy Spirit God is calling out to all of us and he is trying to pull us to him but we live in such a sinful world that Satan will get in there and he's far more able than any of us to we we we have the hardest time identifying this but Satan will come in and we will for I'm not satisfied I need something and he will put before us drugs or he'll put before us gossip fighting he'll put before us a a a young man or a young lady that will pull us away from the truth that will drive us into sin and we think that we are enjoy going and we think that this is where we want to be but you'll see that there's just sadness that keeps following and following and following there's never happiness but how can this be over here and then over here we can sing a song like I can't wait until I get out of this body I can't wait till I pass from this world how can someone say that and just that happiness flows from us and there's always hope no matter what bad thing happens we can always turn to the Lord and say Lord you're still there you're still hearing me yes sir we can always turn to him but Satan wants us to turn over here and he says okay well you're not happy now you need more drugs you need more medication you need more of this you need more of that you need more women you need more men you need more internet you need more all of this you need a different job and we we don't see that it's actually God pulling us and Satan trying to confuse us and that's what happened to this young man he's going out and he's as the as it's said he's with prostitutes but I look how did the young man how did the brother know that his other brother was sleeping around and drinking and partying it must have come back to the dad it must have come back to the family that your brother is out doing this squandering everything that you have and he's he's living the high life and time passed and what the young man that one off probably didn't know is he had a father at home and here is this here is this father and he gives his son his inheritance and he watches him walk away from his family he watches him walk away from their life his dad loved this young man and what this man what this young man did as he was out living in the world and he was doing all these things what he didn't know was there was a dad on his knees praying for him and maybe every evening maybe this Dad would come out and he look down the road and he'd see the sun going down the same road that he walked away maybe he'd look down that road and say maybe he's going to come back hearing all these things but the prayers of the father were always there and they went up before the Throne of the almighty God and God heard the prayers of this father this boy was lost but he was not lost forever and there he is out and spending money and living this life and he says he goes out and he makes the mistake that so many of all of us make and I don't care how old you are we all make this mistake we say I have to do what makes me happy I have to do what's best for me and when we start going down that road when we have that attitude there is destruction waiting and that's what this young man did and he had a brother that was there that was continuing doing his job and continuing doing the right thing and staying with his dad but this other brother was out and he was among the world and he was doing every little thing not a care in the world and then the money ran out his friends started to leave him to me it just shows that he was a child of God his friends started to leave him there was no money even to eat and there was a famine in the land he didn't have anything so he goes to a man that he knew before and the man gives him a job to feed the pigs and he was looking at the food that was going to feed these pigs and he was in the pig slop and his he was now in rags and what was just a little while earlier were the nicest clothes that he could have had had the nicest cars living the high life doing really good without God because he was a child of God God let him fall as low as he could be and there he is with these pigs and he's looking at the food that is going to go to the pigs and he says I'm going to eat this this is will sustain me and then the Bible says he came to himself beautiful thing let me read to you something brother brandham said about this young man what he did was he remembered the nature of his father he grown up with his dad he knew his dad and he remembered the nature of his dad brother Braham said this but he know the nature of his father and he said I will arise and go to my father the father never said when he got back the father never said wait a minute son are you bringing my money back no he never charged him for his sins he was glad that he was coming back and he was glad that he had come to himself because he was his son he was his own child he was glad when he was on his road home now he didn't endorse his sin but he was glad when he came to himself and said I have sinned before my God and before my father I will rise and go to him and when he saw him AAR off he ran to him and kissed him and he said kill the fatted calf without money bring the best robe without money bring the ring without money and put his put it on his finger let us let us eat and drink and be merry for this my son was lost and now he was found he was dead and now he is alive again let us be happy about it brother Bram says this may I close with this friends the only thing that satisfies the only real thing there is the only good things there is cannot be bought with money they are free gifts of God by Jesus Christ salvation of the Soul Joy come and eat and be satisfied wherefore do you spend your money for that which is not bread and your labor for that which satisfies not hearken Dil hearken diligent unto me and eat that which is good and let your soul Delight itself in the fatness incline your ears and come to me here and your soul shall live and I'll make an Everlasting Covenant with you even the sure mercies of David brother brandom quotes the scriptures so here is this young man and he is in this pig slop and the world had forsaken him and Satan will always forsake you Satan will take what he wants from you and then he is finished with you and his ultimate goal is your destruction his crowning Glory Satan's crowning Glory was the son of Destruction the son of predition this man named Judas is carot remember I told the story a couple weeks ago I had Daniel stand up here I told the story that brother brandham told about he had he had brother Billy Paul put his hands out and he said here's the Lord and he said as far as you go away from the Lord the that far is how you're going how long you're going to have to travel back so as far as we go we're still going to have to come back that road and here's this this young man and he's out there and he's got to come back this road of predition and here's Judas is carat and he went too far and he was never able to get back even though he tried this man Judas he he went too far and here is this man in this pig pin it's it's going to end up the same place as that and he's there and he's remembering dad I remember his nature if I can just come back and he starts getting this speech together here's what I'm GNA tell him and he's thinking I'm going to tell him that I'm not worthy to be your son but if I could just be a servant in your house if I could just make a living now I see how bad this world is now I see how terrible everything is I see is just for my own destruction if I could just work in your house I don't even have to be your son just let me get back so he gets up out of the slop he's hungry and he starts on this road the same road that he came down he starts back how many times was that father on his knees looking down that road that that son had left praying for his son please return him goes out his father who knows it may have been years probably was years later and he's looking down that road looks down there and he sees a figure walking he looks dressed in rags who is that walking down this road walks like my son doesn't look like my son he's walking like my son Closer Closer could that be my prodigal son that had left that had gone The Prodigal Road could God have answered my prayers gets closer the heath that is his son and he goes running out and he grabs his son and he hugs him and his son had rehearsed the speech and he and he starts the speech and he's like forget it forget it you are my son sir there's nothing that could have changed that he was a son no matter how far that he went no matter how much into sin that he went there was nothing that could change that he was a son he takes him and he kills a fatted calf and he takes a ring drop my ring he takes he takes a ring and he puts it on his son's finger which means this is my son he has every right that my other son has and there is nothing we can do there is nothing that can separate us from the love of God no matter how far down the road we go there is nothing that can separate us we have that ring we are a son or a daughter of God and no matter how bad that you get no matter what you've done there is always a way back but it might be a long way back I'm a Son of God brother Aon I am a son of this Lord no matter what I've done he loves me I know remember he knew his dad's nature I know my father's nature so he comes back and wonderful the father remember the 99 sheep and the one and he the shepherd just rejoiced here is this father my son was dead and now he's back praise God he was everything was so happy but he had another son this other son's looking and he's like what's going on what's Happening Here the servant comes out and he says your brother is home and you know what your dad did he gave him a ring just like your ring he killed a fatted calf there's a big celebration going on he's coming in and it offended this man remember Jesus as Jesus was so awesome is you know the red part it's Jesus talking 2,000 years ago he told the same story I'm telling right now isn't that beautiful I just I just love thinking about it so there is Jesus and Jesus has all these Pharisees and you think maybe they were thinking that Jesus is comparing them to this other son and he's like listen it is a a joy that this brother is coming home and the son says listen I've been here I have served God I have done all of this father I've been with you I've been your loyal son how come he gets a party and I'm just working out in the field his dad says he says son listen he says you are my son you've been with me everything that I have is yours he said but I'm just rejoicing that your brother who was once lost is come back and this young man he should have also been rejoicing when we see people come back it's not looking down at them and saying look at how wrong they are there should be a great Rejoice saying they are coming back if it's going on in heaven and it is I read it why is it not going on here when we see one come back no matter what they looked like he was filth smelled like a pig he was as bad as you can be and you know what he had that that this other young man didn't have by the grace of God I look at these two young men and which one would I rather be I of of course would rather be the one that stayed with the father of course I'd want to be him but he looked and he saw his brother and he saw all the sin that surrounded his brother and these Pharisees look and they they had Jesus there and they saw all the sin that was surrounding him and the father could have looked at the son and said Son listen you don't have the scars that he has you don't have these bad experience experiences that he has put it in modern day you don't have the bad credit that he has you don't have the the track marks or you don't have the the the bad reputation you don't have any of that he has that and he will have to live with that forever but he is still my son I still love him he is as much my son as you are but because you have lived a good life because you have served me your life is better and it will probably always be better you've made it easier on yourself son he has made it hard on himself I think son comes and the father Embraces him and and this happens with the other son and we see the two failures in the Suns and all of us are are we're all failures let me just put it that way all of us are we see the two failures we see the one son that went into the world and he failed and we see the other son that stayed pure but he failed he failed in the self-righteousness the the other one failed in the Sin both failed I I think that all of us friends all of us have sinned against God and all of us have asked for forgiveness many times but let me tell you something our names were written we've we've gone many times before the Lord and said Lord forgive me but my name and your name one time was written in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and it's still there no matter what I've done no matter what mistakes I've made it's there problem that the Lord Jesus was getting to was that if the Pharisees would have just listened Brothers Listen these people Heaven's rejoicing I'm rejoicing that they're coming back you haven't suffered what they've suffered you haven't so give glory to God that you haven't had to go through what they go through what they've gone through look at the this prodigal son and I think look at the nature of a human being the um few years ago we had this Co I just had it again a couple weeks ago um still with us um what happened was the government said stay home don't go to work and we will pay you just to stay home exactly what happened with this prodigal son he said give me my money and I'm going to go out and do my thing and here is all of these United States and they're staying home the government is giving them money and look what happened homelessness exploded why because they took the money and they did exactly what this prodigal son did they spent it on drugs they spent it on rry they spent it on things that they shouldn't have spent it on they squandered it and now look at what's happened I don't think we'll ever come back from what happened a couple years ago look at all the homelessness around five years ago it wasn't nearly this bad 20 years ago it it wasn't even close but now it's everywhere and it's because they gave the people the money and they went out and did what was their nature which was squander it that's exactly what happened with this prodigal son and then they get too far I had a friend um I used to work with uh years ago and he got cancer he he was an older guy and he um he trained me in my job he trained me how to go out and collect the data that we were collecting where I was working and and he got cancer and I would his name is Ken I I I witnessed to him and and I went over to his house one night and he had the chemo bag on him and and uh I said Ken I said you know the Lord Jesus can heal you I said he can save you and he looked at me and he did something that so many people do today a big mistake he said no he says I don't want to be a hypocrite he says I've never believed in Jesus before I'm not going to start now just because I have cancer I said Ken I said now is the time that you need to time is desate desperate and he says no he says I'm not going to do it I said well can I can I pray for you at least he said yeah do whatever you wanted prayed for him and he went into remission and I kept telling him Ken the Lord's given you time you got to you got to start serving the lord you got to know this Lord Jesus Jesus it's simple it's a simple story he says I'm not going to start now he says I not I'm not going to do it because I've never done it before why would I be such a hypocrite to start now because I'm sick and I see our carnality and he died and I think oh God I pray before he died that he met you but it was his choice do you understand for all of us it is our choice it is my choice do I accept Christ or it can't be that easy it is that easy it is that easy to accept Christ but it's not that easy to serve God that I will admit it is a lot easier to serve the devil than it is to serve God and think that the uh brother what's his name brother sofman um old brother sometimes I I give testimonies with him he came in and he had he had another joke he has a lot of jokes and he came in and he said brother Daniel he says I found out that Crime Pays everybody said crime doesn't pay he says Crime Pays I said brother sopan and I'm and okay what's going to happen he says look at this the wages of sin is death so he said it pays and it does pay and that is what we get when when we don't serve God is we get these wages of sin which is death I think as I said before about this man this Dad and seeing his son walking down that same road that how many times did he look down there how many times did he go before the father and say Lord protect my son and he would hear from this far away land he would receive news that your son is doing this your son is doing that your son is in sin your son is running with these prostitutes he's doing all of this and yet this man continued to pray finally God answered his prayer amen and here comes the prodigal son back and the musicians can come and I'll close my point in all of this is there was two mistakes here there was two sons one went the way of sin one made the mistake of self-righteousness but this one that made the mistake of self-righteousness he didn't have to carry the sins and all the problems and all of the burden that this man would have to carry his whole life he didn't have to carry those sins for all of us don't go down that road no matter if you're going to come back and I believe we will come back but if you go down that road you pick up scars from the world that are going to be with us the rest of our lives Mom and Dad kids are coming back but we got to keep them from making the mistakes before they make them because like this young man he's gonna have to carry all of these problems all of these issues and I um back to verse 7 says this our lord Jesus saying I say unto you that likewise Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner that repenteth more than over the 9 and N just persons which need no repentance what a statement what a statement and they're coming back as long as our prayers are sincere like this father as long as we're putting this before the Lord they will come back but the father unlike the son and I love this the father saw the potential in his prodigal son that had come back the father saw that no he's my boy he makes mistakes he's done things wrong but he's still got potential the brother didn't see that in his brother it's a story it's a it's a parable that Jesus told whether it really happened we don't know but it's a lesson for all of us to learn brother Jordan if you could lead us in a song greater than all my sin is the blood that still cleans es me is the grace that still sets me free to praise him I know the Bloods of life I'm walking in [Music] newness of life I can not fall for it's greater than all the blood of the Lamb oh greater than all my is the blood that still cleanses me is the grace that still sets me free oh to praise him I know the blood applied is it applied in your life walking in new of life I cannot fall for it's greater than all the the blood of the Lamb friends think about think about the father this Dad and all of us have a desire in our hearts all of us have needs in our lives but think about this father and how many times he had gone to prayer and God was up there on the throne listening to Dad knowing that he was going to answer that prayer in his appointed time but something had to be accomplished imagine if the young man would have come back before he was in the pig slop he would have been the same person but he had to get so low and so broken that he knew and he then was willing to repent and I can tell you our pray prayers if they are sincere they are going up to the father and he is listening he is hearing and he is waiting to the right time to answer those prayers it may be a day it may be a year it maybe a decade but he will answer those prayers have faith in God brother Jordan mentioned that there's someone that wants to be prayed for for sister Angela was it you with the kids if you could bring them forward friends let me tell you the lord loves us to pray just like the dad and he sees his two sons out there how happy would the dad have been if they would have been embracing each other and loving each other our father is up there looking down at our service right now watching everything that we're doing he knows everything that's in your heart he knows everything that you're thinking he knows everything that's going on and he likes it when we pray for each other if you have a desire friends you're welcome to come and be prayed for do you you want me to turn my microphone off [Music] greater than all my sins is the blood that still cleanses me is the grace that still sets me free to pray prise him I know the blood SP I'm walking in newness of life I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the Lamb oh greater than all my my sins is the blood that still [Music] cleanses me is the grace that still sets me free to praise him I know the blood of I'm walking in newness of life I cannot fall for it's greater than all the blood of the Lambs it's good to be able to pray Jesus told this story 2,000 years ago the same God that heard the Father's prayer 2,000 years ago is the same God that's with us today and the same God that hears prayers amen he's the same God that will have his hands on those children every day of their life until he deems it necessary to take them he will be watching them but he requires us to bring this before the Lord he is able and he's willing let's all stand he has forgiv me my sins have been washed from his meory by the blood of the Lamb of calary oh he has for for me I love that song he has for raise your hand and think about what he has done for you all of us were that prodal son think about what is God has done for all of us by the blood of the Lamb of calary he he has forgiv me oh he has forgiv me my sins have been washed from his meory by the blood of the Lamb of calary he has forgiv me brothers and [Music] sisters you may be that prodigal child that's left people may not even see it but you may be that one that has walked away from the father but the love of the father's never walked away from you he's there he loves you sir and I ask you in the name of Jesus Christ to come back to him how do I do that just repent say Lord I'm sorry to exactly like the young man did in the in the pig Pin said Lord I'm sorry I want to come back to you it's all bow our heads I know know there's a thought of many people in this congregation today that are thinking about a loved one thinking about this [Music] story I say in jesus' name that this Parable
