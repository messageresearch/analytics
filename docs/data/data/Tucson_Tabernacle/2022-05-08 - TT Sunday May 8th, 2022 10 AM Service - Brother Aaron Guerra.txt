only believe it's brother daniel comes this morning oh yes things are possible [Applause] maybe [Music] let's bow our heads [Music] think about it friends that there's an almighty god that's here with us this morning [Music] and he's here to answer our prayers and he cares about us now not as a ritual not as something that we just do every time we ask for prayer but if there would be something that's special upon your heart i pray that you would raise up your hand and hold that request dear to your heart as as we come before the throne of god and know that there's a god here that's with us this morning that's going to hear hold our request dear to your hearts friends that lies below that uplifted hand almighty god we approach you in the name of your son jesus christ with these requests lord that you saw every one and you can look down into the hearts of men and women and boys and girls this morning and you can know the deep desires of our hearts lord we lift up these requests before you ask that you would answer knowing lord that it's maybe not our request but it's the holy spirit within us that brings this up before the throne of god our dear brother that's in prison now and and what a gallant request that he's brought that asked his home church to pray with him on these things lord i believe it was three things that he brought and we pray that each one of them would come before you and each request that it's on a part of our hearts we pray that it would come before you and lord that we might give you glory and that that we can expect these things to be answered and we humbly asked lord that your holy spirit would rest upon this congregation today this morning this mother's day anoint brother aaron and father anoint us as your church as your body that your holy spirit would be welcome and minister to each one of us we pray and lord with all things we lift up the name of jesus christ with our lives with our prayers and with our words and and pray lord that you would be glorified granted lord may every request that comes before you this morning be answered the prophet told us to ask for big things and we ask for every single one in jesus christ's name amen amen let's just turn the service over to brother aaron here maybe a little bit early if you're ready brother and feel free if not we'll just keep singing let's sing this song let's try it i keep listening for a different sound sound of the city the john saw coming down amen [Music] trouble in the east again the whole world is shaking there's no sure place to stand and mournful sounds are heard throughout [Music] oh i keep listening [Music] i remember the preacher saying it shall come to pass there will come a generation that will be the very last i can't believe i'm standing here seeing [Music] and the sound of the city that john saw coming down the sound of the bride being oh united keep listening i keep listening i keep listening let's start with first one again we hear about the wars see famine in the land there are questions in the children's eyes trouble in the east again the whole world is shaking there's no sure place to stand and mournful sounds are heard [Music] for a different sound the sound of the city that shawn saw coming down the sound of the bride being [Music] i keep listening i keep listening i remember the preacher saying son it shall come to pass there will come a generation that will be the very last i can't believe i'm standing here seeing the end of time and the preacher's voice echoing in yes i keep listening for a different sound the sound of the city that sean saw coming down the sound of the bride being united [Music] amen what a good thing to be listening to amen let's sing that song [Music] oh have your way have your way holy spirit fill our hearts and have your way as we and as we pray speak your word into our hearts then just one more time would you ask him there have your way have your way holy spirit fill our hearts and have your way as we wait and as we [Music] [Applause] [Music] wouldn't be anything better this morning than let him have his way lord we we just the only way for you to have your way is for ourselves to get out of the way and let you have your way lord and sometimes we want to hold on to the reigns we want to have the control we we get afraid we get nervous we get worried what could happen lord but you're faithful you never fail you've already walked this pathway you've been through it lord you understand it you know every turn everything coming our way so lord let us just yield to you and let you have your way this morning we ask in jesus christ's day amen thank you while you're standing we'll read one scripture isaiah 55 verse 11 yes so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing whereto i sent it just the reading of the word of god should be enough to say thank you lord amen you may be seated we're going to have a baptism after the end of service today so we're going to get started allow for that and um there's a promise if you'll be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ and give your heart to him he will give you the holy ghost because without it we don't have a chance amen so some things in our heart today and i uh last couple of days just thinking about these things where we should be today we came to tucson in 1976 46 years ago never thought we'd still be here we would have gone home a long time ago went through 1977 thinking that would be the end but we're still here today but i think it's closer than it's ever been there's so many things that hadn't been fulfilled yet in that time but they've come to their place but there's a bride being made ready and she's just about there i believe it's hard to imagine that we could go another 50 years but until then i promised the lord i'll give you my all how many would say that today lord i would surrender all and give you my own that you have your way i didn't give you this quote there um brother matt it was just something that added on after but from the exposition of the seven church ages revelation of jesus christ consider this since it is the blood of god it is perfect blood and if the perfect blood is loosing us from the power and the bondage and defilement of sin then the leucine is perfect and complete there is now therefore no condemnation who shall lay anything to the charge of god's elect it is god that justifieth or declares us righteous who is he that condemneth it is christ that died romans 8 33 and 34. there it is his death gives us the blood the blood has loosed us there is now no condemnation how can there be there is nothing to be condemned for because the blood has loosed us from sin we are free guiltless don't listen to man hang on a second don't listen to yourself that's the one that gives you trouble don't listen to man listen to the word you are loosed by the blood therefore there is no condemnation to them who are in christ jesus you might have brought a little burden with you today you might have come a little heavy you might have maybe had a tough week maybe a hard morning maybe you couldn't control your thoughts put it under the blood as quick as you can brother green used to remind us that all the time he said as quick as you can make it right ask forgiveness and it's cleansed and in god's eyes you never did it maybe in your brother's eye your sister's eye your your husband your wife's life but in god's eye the word counts you never did it oh what a god we serve if i would maybe today is is the thought is becoming the word of god as jesus himself being born in flesh became the living word and that's what we are supposed to be not just people who talk about it not people who can just point there was a prophet in the land and he gave us the word but of people that are living becoming the word of god the very action god chose to do it that way first in john chapter one we'll read verses one to five to start kind of do a little the background for that in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god in the the same was in the beginning with god it's eternal it never fails all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehendeth it not in him was life and the life was the light of man so if that same word is dwelling in you then life is in you and ye are the light of this world that's how god chose to do it sometimes our light can be a little dim maybe we shade it when we put a cover on it we struggle through the thought of how could i be the very word of god expressed especially when you know yourself speaking with brother dan a little bit i asked him if he would come in back meet with me last night he just felt to have them come pray for me before ministering this morning and shared some with it something i felt the lord just spoke to me jesus at 12 years old the family is headed back home and it takes them three days before they realize that he's not with them i hope we never get to that point where did i last leave my daughter you know and they go back looking for him and jesus was found in the temple at 12 years old and here's the the part to understand and sometimes difficult for us to understand he was a 12 year old the scripture tells us he was tempted he was tried in every manner such as us and i was thinking this as i was i went up for a walk and i say lord were you intimidated you were coming before the high priest you were coming for those who knew the law and you were going to stand in the temple with them how did how did you approach how did you go in you hear those that had had the opportunity to to have a meeting or a an interview with brother branham and they would make sure they made everything right they they knew the gift of the of god that was there and and i can imagine how would he approach and then for three days speak with the the what we would call the ministers the the teachers those men that have studied the word of god that's all they did their whole life and yet he stood there and they were marveled they were amazed at what he sold them and what he said because see he was the word of god made flesh and the word of god made flesh reflects the word of god and god's word never fails but he would be touched by the feeling of our infirmities brother joe when you're going through a hard time and you're struggling he went through it too for you so that when you ask him lord he understands to many people in this world they go to a a statue an image a stone something and they try to find mercy and they try to find help on a on a piece of rock and a wood carving and a picture and there is none there because there's no life in that but he was the light and the life of men but it's more than that he wants to dwell in you it in me and then you become the light and the life your very words your very actions the very life you live can impart eternal life to somebody else hope more than a hope a blessed assurance john chapter 5 38-39 and then 46-47 here's jesus speaking to to the priest of course he's not 12 years old anymore you know when he was 12 and and i was talking with brother dan because i was just asking him and some questions there we were just talking when he was 12 and he was in his neighborhood and he was working there were other 12 year olds around him there were other kids just like him same age and excuse me but there were other 12 year old young ladies around him and yet he was without sin but again he can be touched by the filling of your infirmities because he walked through there and sometimes when you get to filling and thinking how could god understand this he's so great he's so marvelous but he says try me he says let me come and walk with you i've been there i've done that he knows the feeling of loss he knows the feeling of hurt he knows uh to how should i say he's been embarrassed by others he's everything that he went through like that so that when you feel that way he says i've been there i can help you now here he's talking to the high priest now and he says then you have not his word abiding in you for whom he has sent you believe him not and he says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are which testify of me and then we'll read 46-47 and of course we know they tell them well we have moses as our prophet for had ye believed moses you would have believed me for he wrote of me but ye believe not his writings how shall ye believe my words he just puts it straight out we have all of his words recorded here and we should read them daily read them continually let me just say it this way without this word brother branham doesn't have a message to deliver understand that the word of god being made real being made alive to us he said you these things are written of me and yet you don't believe the word being made made flesh be coming to a point where you are a living testimony you are a living bible in you dwells god you know he he he told brother branham and we've we've mentioned this many a times they're having that fellowship and brother dan evans gave the testimony because his grandfather was there in that time up and believe us in colorado and and the lord just tell them speak i'm having fellowship with you i'm enjoying my time with you he said speak to the storm hallelujah why why because christ lives in you and it has to it has to everything is subject to him not to me to him the one living in me and the less of me is the more of him psalms david david says here in psalms 119 probably one of the uh if you want to read the psalms encourage your heart a fallen man like david they did things that we would oh my how could how could that ever happen to david same way it happens to us blessed are the undefiled in the way who walk in the law of the lord blessed are they that keep his testimonies he says happy are they that keep his unchanging word that's i really like that translation his unchanged it's faithful it doesn't change you're not too sure is it going to be like this today or like that tomorrow it's right down the middle every time are they that keep his testimony and that seek him with the whole heart if if you fill something up to the top in this whole field there's not room for anything else because if you keep filling and then everything else spills out if you let them fill you completely there's not room for anything else the whole heart let's go on verse 3 they also do no iniquity amen he's a god that forgives all even your iniquity in god's sight there is no iniquity they walk in his ways as hearing brother lawson minister there's only one way and that's god's way every way there's a way that seemeth right to a man but it leads to destruction there's one way and you do god's way verse 4 thou has commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently a diligent person is attending to it all the time watching it maybe sometimes a diligent per a person to you would look he's too concerned he he's more worried about that than anything you're diligent to it it's your responsibility if it's your job to watch the door it's your job to watch the door that's what you're supposed to be doing but you ever seen somebody who's not very diligent at watching the door a lot of things get in a lot of things happen because they're busy doing something else my my son-in-law stephen when he was working for for best buys back in in wichita he stood by the door watching the security cameras now by law they cannot physically touch somebody that's that's doing something they shouldn't be doing they they could follow him around the store but you physically can't do anything to him you call the police you do that but generally if they're being watched they won't do what they're planning to do but i walked in one day and then we were up back there with him and he was standing there and he's watching the five different screens so i began to ask him i said how does this work he says well you have to be watching constantly you can't take your eyes off for a minute and he said some of them do and they get to talking to their friends and other things are going on over here and they don't see it he says but if you're watching all of them you can usually catch somebody that look you learn how they're suspicious you know what what they're doing and you can stop them but he said but i have to stay right here i can't walk away from this i need to look at it i asked them a question because right in the front there right by the door where these 55 75 inch big screen tvs and i said now if somebody grabs one of those and starts running out can you apprehend them he says no i'm not to touch them they can run if they get into car and drive away they take it so i said do you want one because you can't catch me i'll take it to your house he just left but a diligent person and he keeps a precept they watch it constantly that they're aware of it they're they're looking at where their steps go lord am i in your perfect will am i doing what you desire that's what the word diligent means it's verse 5 and he says oh that my ways direct were directed to keep thy statutes then shall i not be ashamed when i have respect unto all thy commandments when i respect a due respect which implies hearty affection diligent study and constant practice to all so not as to allow myself in any known sin or in the in neglect of any known duty that was uh oh the six age messenger forgot his name also but that was his description of that and to all all the known duty the things i know to put to pay pay attention to do it and that's david speaking here then i shall not be ashamed when i have respect unto all thy commandments i will praise you with uprightness of heart when i shall have learned thy righteous judgments i will keep thy statutes oh forsake me not utterly and then he asks in verse 9 wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way by taking heed thereunt to according to thy word even in the old testament there was a reference to the word of god the law of god continually because there is only one way and that's god's way every other way leads to destruction god's way is eternal life then he says in verse 10 with my whole heart have i sought thee oh let me not wander from thy commandments again i say whole if you're doing it with the whole heart there's not room for anything else you've given it all you've given him everything and then in verse 11 this is this one of the scripture thy word have i hid in my heart that i might not sin against thee blessed art thou o lord teach me thy statutes if you want to be taught you should go to the class every day you don't you don't get your degree by skipping most of the classes by borrowing the notes from somebody else the tudor said i'll be with you even in you to the end of the world even in you that way he goes with you everywhere you go brother branham says the first couple of quotes here will read from the mess of the arrow of god's deliverance shot from a bow now you know no matter how mysterious it seems god always keeps his word no matter how unreasonable it may seem to people god keeps his word and if god makes a promise of anything god will keep that promise you and i make a promise and we break it because we don't mean to have to do it but sometimes circumstances cause us to do it but when god being infinite he knows all the future from the beginning he can't and he can't he don't make a promise less he knows what's going to happen and he always keeps his promise and here i like this part sometimes it seems like it's ridiculous the way he would go around about to keep his promise but god always does it he's an unfailing god there is no fail in him jehovah jireh number two he says notice he appeared to him where he was 99 years old and he appeared to him in the name of almighty god the name there in the hebrew is el shaddai now god has seven compound redemptive names we know that and i like this and you cannot separate them from christ you can't separate them christ meant every one of those compound redemptive names you believe that amen he he do you believe he is jehovah jireh the lord's provided sacrifice then what about jehovah rapha the lord heals all thy diseases and if that wasn't applied to christ then he wasn't jehovah jireh you see so you can't separate it the whole thing is wound up and there you are he can't be jehovah rapha without being jehovah right jaira neither can he be jehovah jair without being jehovah rapha he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed there is no argument about that he's everything he's everything he hasn't missed on one from the message faith in action i'm not a speed reader there brother man jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of god that's where his faith was anchored so if his faith was anchored on that then our faith has to be anchored on that he says that's where his faith was anchored there's there's where every man and woman's faith to be anchored tonight is upon the living word of god you believe that and you can put it into action now but but but we we got to be careful we don't put that word that those promises in the pastor just in the prophet or just in this preacher or this just it's you've got to believe it's in you you read the word you hear the word it's why you you ingest the word so it becomes part of you till the point is that you become part of it it has the preeminence in your life does that mean i walk around down the street just quoting scriptures no it's a lived life lived according to the word of god the the scripture tells us this jesus obeyed his parents he humbled himself he respected he learned the bible says by the things he went through when he was helping his dad in the carpenter shop joseph would tell him this is what we do first this is what we do second this is how we do that this is how we prepare that he learned he listened my son-in-law amos and them they're doing addition to their house and he had asher four years old using the driver drill tightening up all the bolts where he'd anchored it to the floor you've never seen a happier bow in your life he was getting to use daddy's tools in helping him there's a peace there's a joy there's a happiness in your life when you let do the things that god has you doing you know to realize that jehovah god almighty god the creators of heaven and earth the all-powerful one wants you to take place in part of it you're not just in an audience you're just not watching him perform you're part of it christianity versus idolatry oh my i'm so glad of that aren't you aren't you glad to be one of them just one of them one of them humble people that just emptied yourself down out come down not be for an idol before a living god not before in an organization to put your name in the book before a living god not to recite a creed but to let the word become flesh in you that was his whole desire when he tell the disciples are disappointed because he's going away and they're trying to tell them don't do it don't do it they're you know we don't want you to leave we expect the rest of our whole life to be with you and he says i've got a better way there's something that i must do because he was looking past those 12 and he was seeing you in there he was looking down through time and he was seeing your name that was written in the book and he said i've got to get to them also i've got to perform i've got to go through what i've got to go through in order for all this to take place and he said i have a better way i'm going to go away but i'm going to come back and i'm going to live in you they didn't understand that sometimes i don't understand it i say why lord what have i done to deserve it but the part of me says even so be it unto me according to thy word imagine mary think about mary an angel comes to visit her and tells her you're going to have a child and this child shall be god how would you how would you feel if you got told that today you're going to have god what me yes you it's christ in you the hope of glory and let me just ask it's christ in you the hope of glory for others too it's not just for you to tabernacle and walk around say he's my god and mine alone it's for you to be an example to other to share this life to others mary had jesus he was born her and then he was he was born of her but it wasn't just for her it was for all of us he says not to recite a creed oh that's catholic oh no that's right in this message if you don't believe it this way if you don't see it this way if you don't understand this way you don't have it that's it's not a creed it's a living word the spoken word is the original seed so believers of the word and spirit so believers of the word and spirit must be one you get it believers the word and the spirit are absolutely one you don't do your own thinking you don't use your own mind isn't that wonderful it is when i can turn this off and let his word speak the mind the mind was in christ is in you see the mind is in christ and you'll take the word just like he did because he was the word and the mind of christ in you you are the word you're god's living word representatives of him here on earth that's right continuing the work the church should be that way and when so the bible is manifested again like in the early days of the disciples just like the disciples the bible is living again in you where is god today where is god today ah some of you come on he's in me he's in you i didn't make those words up i didn't dream him up last night this is something god had a prophet tell us because it's scriptural christ in us the hope of glory the bible says what hope do you have without him none you could study you could work hard you could work on this that the other but what hope do you have it's christ in you the hope of glory and and how do you receive him how do you receive that christ in you is there a magic formula a specific church to intend to a certain ministry to sit under no there's acts 2 38 in the scriptures repent and be baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ for the remission of your sins and ye shall be filled with the holy ghost the holy ghost is god in you and he how do you know because your actions begin to show what you're living who you are i've always said this people tell me i look like my father and i say thank you that's a compliment it's a compliment to my mother also because if i look like somebody else there would be a question i don't mean that to be mean but it would be true you don't look like your family you don't look like the rest of your family then there's a question where are you from but if i have this traits of my father and my mother there is no question you're just like your father you're just like your mother you know when we were part of the pentecostal church people said oh you're an apostolic you're a upc you're a baptist you're whatever you came from nothing wrong with that they're good people wonderful people but what about when they say you're a christian then your life is manifesting who christ you know when we were part of the pentecost church that we went to there were certain things that we did that that pentecostal church said in the the spanish uh because we went to the spanish speaking church and their standard greeting was pas de cristo the peace of god so any minister any brother that stood up behind the pulpit the first thing he said was pas de cristo or peace of god that was the standard greeting you knew you were an apostolic but not all apostolics acted like apostolics but if they said that you were considered an apostolic what are the message words that we say the people oh you must be a message believer sometimes sometimes it's just old tradition well he can quote this message and he can quote that i've been with this church i've been to part of that and and i've been to tucson i've been to sabino i've gone here i've gone there i've done that or you must be a message believer what about the christ in you that speaks louder than anything like that the christ in you that causes you to behave certain ways act certain ways dress yourself in certain manner a reputation that people look and they say oh satan goes hard against it in your job at school and everywhere they'll make fun of you they'll do it but there's something about it that's speaking out at them i tell you about that young lady she was pentecostal that we were in school together and she always wore a long sleeve and even in the summer she had long sleeve sweater and there was five or six of us sitting in the in the school office there in the we were teachers helpers because it was an easy class to get an easy grade on and the office and would send one of you to take this note to this teacher please and we're all sitting there and one a couple of the other girls asked her why do you always wear long sleeve and i said oh boy i'm going to get to hear her testimony because she was always in a dress and always in long sleep i'm going to get to hear her testimony and she kind of went um i'm always cold and it's 110 degrees outside and you're always cold you know and then it says i'm on she goes and i'll just say what she said i have very hairy arms and i'm starting to get embarrassed for her and she finally turns around and says it's because i believe in modesty and then she looks at me he goes you never thought i was going to say it did you i just wanted to hear what were you going to say why would we be embarrassed jesus paid it all he did everything i had needed he went to death in hell for me why would i be embarrassed of him let's go on to the next scriptures there brother matt i'm going to try to hurry up here so we have time for the baptism and psalms 107 here oh give thanks unto the lord for he is good for his mercy and dearth forever let the redeemed of the lord say so let the redeemed of the lord say so amen you know for his mercy and earth whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy he has redeemed he has drawn you back he has called you back because you were his in the first place and gathered them out of the lands from the east and from the west and from the north and from the south they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no city to dwell in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses you ever there oh lord i need your help i've i've tried every way i've gone this way i've gone that way i've tried this i i went through this program my one brother and sister and their best intention told me to drive this way went over to this place and they told me to drink this and i've done everything but turn to you lord yesterday we were out and my wife one of her co-workers her daughter has a like a health shop and we were passing by so she wanted to go go see what they had there and they gave her his drink with aloe in it and stuff and there was just different people in there drinking these different mixtures because they're good for you and there's no question that they are good for you she finally convinced me to start taking better care of myself and you feel a whole lot better and and just to but they're dependent on that if i take good care of my body if i exercise if i do this i'll be okay i'm not saying not to do that but that's not where you're dependent on it you're dependent on this one here he says then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses and he led them forth by the right way again there's one way and it's his way and that that they might go to a city of habitation looking for a city whose builder and maker is god amen oh that man would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men for he satisfieth a longing soul and filleth the hungry soul with goodness he satisfied the longing soul what is your desire what are you longing for seek ye first the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you we've flipped it around too many times i'm going to seek all of this and if i got a little bit of left over time i'll dedicate it to god when he said seek ye first the kingdom of god and all these things shall be added unto you how many times who was it um i might i believe it was moody or one of the messengers that said if i don't get up and pray for four hours in the morning i find i don't have enough time the rest day to get everything done most of us don't do that we get up we go to work and at the end of the day lord i'm sorry i got this five minutes for you and he said if i don't spend four hours of prayer in the morning i don't have enough time the rest day to get what it must get done i find myself with a lot of driving time now and i found myself with a lot of prayer time just talk to the lord keep my eyes open help me stay on the road lord but i talk with him next thing i know i'm at my jack's job site he watched with you he talks with you and he tells you you're his owner let's continue on the scripture there such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death being bound affliction and iron sometimes that's where we felt we are but he delivereth them all this is david's writing you imagine sometimes how david felt about himself sometimes the things that he did a man who's who was after the the heart of god a man who who desired that yet david did some things in the scriptures that he writes about and we say but he was a man after god's own heart and gone honored and respected brother branham said this as quick as you can brother greenwood make it right make it right as quick as you can you know when you when you have a late fine anybody else ever had one of those were you a little bit late on something there's a few of you along with me and then you go back and and you know if you had paid it the day after you knew it was late and you had just yielded another dollar i'll get to it tomorrow i'll get to tomorrow i'll get to it tomorrow and tomorrow never comes and so suddenly that late fine is almost a double payment the burden that you begin to carry the weight of it the heaviness because you won't stop for a moment say i'm sorry lord as quick as you can make it right and the joy that comes from that the peace that comes from i'm sorry brother matt somewhere another i seem to have lost the next page of scriptures here so ah they got stuck in the back here and verses 20 and 21 he sent his word and healed them and delivered them from their destructions he didn't send another angel he didn't send somebody in his place he didn't send mary he sent his word and he healed them and delivered them from their destruction and then david says and o that man would praise the lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of men why where would we be without him the word of god becoming flesh in us as mary said be it unto me according to thy word it had never happened before it had never happened before two great miracles in the bringing forth of a man child abraham and sarah 19 90 and 100 years old a promised son brother branham talks about abraham when he gets a promise making the preparations even sarah making the preparations but a year goes by two years go by three years go by hebrews 11 says they stagger not at the promise of god through unbelief but i wonder if some of those other conversations would have been recorded and abraham his mind is going a little bit and says was that really god or did i imagine that sarah how are you feeling today no different but today is my birthday and i'm another year older i thought maybe it would be last year well i was younger and still could have done it but i'm 80 years old now abraham i know and he says i'm 90. but god said he's going to give us a child what about you and your promises from god i'm the lord god that healeth all thy diseases is there anything impossible for god but i've been waiting 25 years it's been 50 years it's been whatever he's still god and one day he comes to visit them the promise had been given 25 years earlier and he comes to visit him he literally comes himself to visit them he didn't send somebody else he came himself and in your deepest hour of distress he'll come and visit you he knows where you live he knows you by name he's been there before he's walked down that street he's been in that hospital he's been in that sick bed he knows and he says abraham i built this time same time next year you'll be having that promised son and sarah laughed in her heart and god heard it he's laughed in our heart but he heard it he said why did sarah laugh sarah says i did i didn't yes you did he said but you're still going to have that child why because she was part of abraham you and i have laughed a time or two because but because you are part of christ and he took all your blame and he hung at calvary and he took your shame it's not held against you you're still going to produce god you're still going to have that child you're still going to be the word made flesh in this hour can you say amen to that promise let it be accorded unto me according to thy word oh lord now what does that mean we're going to be reciting scripture all day we're going to no it's going to be a lived life such as i have i given to you in the name of jesus christ here's peter here's john now god himself dwelling in them not just walking with them but dwelling in them and they realized he's god in us therefore and brother branham if you follow through on this thing i was looking at you could probably bring a hundred different quotes with this he said what does it become it becomes a spoken word as moses when he told him speak and create the flies when he told moses why cry speak he said it hasn't changed speak to the storm i'm having fellowship with you say to this mountain and it shall be moved that's god's word so here comes john and here comes peter and they're coming over they're headed back to church that day the holy ghost had come upon him and acts 2 38 experience and when they got up that morning they said well now that we got the holy ghost we don't have to go to church no more hey i've got god in me why do i need to be in church no they got up and they were going to go worship in the temple and on their way there was a man deformed or sick and and he asked for money he asked for for some help financial help to help him go through and and john and i've always said john and peter just because they had received the holy ghost didn't mean they had more money in their pocket but they now had the one that owns a cattle in a thousand hills every vein of silver and every ounce of gold are his and they said such as i have i give unto you in the name of lord jesus christ rise up and walk and that man got up and leaped up why because it's christ in them they were becoming the word made flesh the very same things that jesus did now his disciples are doing not because they could do it but because christ is in them oh yeah but but brother you don't know me you don't know my troubles you don't know what i did yesterday you know what i said look at peter look at the record of peter i'll never deny you fact i'll go up on that cross with you and he turned i said you're going to deny me three times but then look at jesus response when he's after he's resurrected and he tells them go tell my disciples to meet me over here and peter too oh for the mercy and the grace of god such as i am i give unto you in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk oh but they were holy men no they were men who god was dwelling in now did it make them perfect no because in acts you remember that peter and paul went at it i mean uh yeah peter and paul went out a little bit out there paul and silas ended up being together because there was such a dispute between them and barnabas they couldn't go together here read that in the scripture there now that the holy ghost is filming me i'll never i'll never suffer i'll never have no you're still human but you have that anchoring power that life in you now and as you surrender your life his life begins to manifest himself brother branham would stand before a congregation of people he would say after many many experiences he had over the years he would say you know what i'm waiting for because without him i'm helpless you would think that after 20 years he could have said well i i don't need him i know how to no he realized that without him he couldn't do it then he would say i take every spirit under my control was that brother branham speaking as a man no that was god in him the same god that's in you you walk into a situation you walk into a place and the spirits have got to become subject to the god that's in you some of you are having a little trouble believing that but it's christ he's never changed and he's living in you he walked this earth and when he would come into a situation he would say peace be still when the storm came and he stood up on the bow of the boat and he said peace be still it's the same one living in you little fishy i give you back your life it was for brother animali no it's for all his children he was the first fruits to show that there would be a ripening there would be a group of people that would take his word and believe it and become it she's going to be like him because it's going to be him and her when adam and eve see eve came out of the sight of adam she was part of adam she was a feminine part of adam their natures were the same they were created of the same allowed that and i'll never understand this but i appreciate it that he allowed a fall so he could demonstrate who he is so that he could be touched by the feeling of our infirmities so that he would understand because he was a savior he was he was a keeper he was a he was strength he was joy he was peace but how could he demonstrate it unless somebody needed peace somebody needed joy somebody needed healing you may be somebody's peace today you may be somebody's joy today you may give somebody their healing today because that's in you to give just the scripture even talks about giving a cup of water a cold cup of water too many times we think becoming the the word becoming flesh that we're going to stand up and we're going to be we're going to be the preachers we're going to be you know it's a daily lived life at your job in your neighborhood wherever you're at with your own family a live life that would make someone stop and say how do i get that what you have how can you be at peace in such a situation i don't understand it because it's a piece of god that passes all understanding i've had that happen people have asked me how can you be calm in a situation like this because i know that within myself i can't control it but i know the one that's in me who has control over that situation and he said if i would let him he would have control my wife is is getting ready to retire i think she's down to a couple more weeks and she's done and they had a retirement party well not a retirement party they had a meeting and they honored those that are retiring this year and they spoke very well of her i'm not surprised i know her i know the kind of lady she is i know the christian she is but they're already asking her if she can come back and sub because they're going to miss her i'm not surprised again i know i know the work god has done in her life and it should be each one of us like that there should be something about it no i understand the jealousy i understand satan coming hard against it but there's something about a lived life that reaches out to others one more quote there the last quote i believe we had one more brother man i wanted to say that one for last faith in action jesus said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that preceded by the mouth of god that's where his faith was anchored that's where every man and woman's faith to be anchored tonight is upon the living word of god you believe that you can put it in action you can put it in action he didn't say the pastor can put in it the preacher he says you can put it in action brother joe when you're by yourself at ups working and there's no minister there with you and there's no pastor there with you but god is with you you can put it into action there's a reason why you're there in that situation have you ever thought of that why am i here in the middle of this because christ is in you going to reach out to somebody else if we'll let him brother ed you're going to be able to do the baptism if if we'll prepare for that and one of the boys brother max if you want to go with him also and the musicians would come christ in us the hope of glory but i want to step just a little further christ in us the hope of glory for others sometimes that's hard to understand and hard to believe but if he could speak life to a little fish how much more would a soul mean how much more a word that you could give to someone that would change their whole life in your work in your school wherever in your neighborhood wherever it might be to someone we come to says how can i have that peace that joy in the situation you just went through but you're still standing how can i have that and you could say like peter and john such as i have i give unto you in the name of the lord jesus christ receive that which you have need of asparagus [Music] lord it's hard for us to believe that we see ourselves and we see our humanity and we know sometimes the thoughts that go through our head and sometimes our actions we can read in the scriptures how david felt at times there in the scripture when isaiah said oh i'm a man of unclean lips think of gideon hiding behind the wall hiding behind his little place in his threshing floor because the enemy kept coming back over and over to take away the the food and all lord we get to looking at those things and wondering how how could this god live in me how could i manifest that part lord we look at ourselves but let us look to you let us look to what the word of god says we've confessed our sin we've made things right we've done everything you've asked us to do lord therefore let your word be born in the manger of our hearts so be it unto me according to thy word lord a people of god a chosen generation a royal priesthood [Music] lord let it be today i pray in jesus name let your word be born in the manger let it [Music] live inside this house [Music] in the main of the first verse [Music] a place [Music] so i know [Music] in [Music] live inside this house [Music] just one more time about your head you have something maybe you're struggling with [Music] maybe uh i don't know what it is but it's something that battles you every time you want to let god have his way something that maybe steps in and interferes there [Music] you're saying lord i want deliverance from that [Music] maybe it's a habit maybe it's a thought pattern maybe something you may need to make right and it doesn't allow god to have that full control of your life and you would say lord i want some help today i want to be able to let go of that be delivered of it set it free make it right whatever it takes lord i don't have my eyes open and i'm not looking out over the congregation but i'm asking the same thing lord help me lord you know every heart here and every person here whatever it is that they're battling with whatever it is that that interferes with a full manifestation manifestation of god in us or whatever it is that we need to do to make it right to do to let it go whatever it is lord would you help us would be we willing to say here i give it all and let the word of god be born in my heart lord you see each heart it sees life here i just pray that each one would have a victory today in the name of the lord jesus christ amen brother jordan god bless you i'll wait here on the baptism just as a reminder there will be no service tonight as well after we have the baptism just see you all wednesday night let's just
