[46:11] thank you
[46:26] good morning God bless you all this
[46:28] morning
[46:32] it's good to be here once again
[46:35] his brother Leo had mentioned
[46:38] wherever two or three are gathered in my
[46:41] name is
[46:45] you can do a we've preached to small
[46:48] congregations
[46:52] we've preached to just a few
[46:56] in the South Pacific Islands
[46:59] we preached in a little cabin
[47:03] made of Bamboo
[47:07] Palm leaves on top
[47:12] everybody walked into the little little
[47:15] assembly barefooted
[47:19] and we shared the gospel
[47:23] there was five people personas but they
[47:28] came to hear the word
[47:30] they were as sincere as anyone could be
[47:34] living on a remote island
[47:37] no cars no real houses we have
[47:43] no air conditioning
[47:45] Caliente
[47:53] you didn't have to go apply for jobs
[47:56] there wasn't any there was no building
[47:59] going on in the island
[48:02] except the little Huts that they already
[48:04] had
[48:07] there was no
[48:09] uh bathrooms of field facilities as we
[48:12] know I'm here
[48:14] it was a remote island
[48:16] and on that little island there had been
[48:20] people personas that had come to
[48:22] recognize
[48:24] and understand that a man called Jesus
[48:28] had given his life for them
[48:31] and they wanted to know what it meant
[48:34] for them
[48:36] they wanted to know this Jesus
[48:40] missionaries over the years since
[48:42] even before World War II World War one
[48:46] had gone in and and and and and and and
[48:50] taken the measure of gospel that they
[48:53] had to them
[48:56] and preach them of Christ
[49:00] and during the time when on these
[49:04] islands there was a cannibals
[49:09] I spoke to one man he was about my age
[49:12] then
[49:14] I said how long have you been on this
[49:16] island
[49:18] he said I was born here he says have you
[49:22] ever left the island
[49:24] he says
[49:26] he didn't know if there was another
[49:28] world beyond the island
[49:30] there was maybe a total of a couple of
[49:33] thousand people on the island
[49:36] he says has it gotten better living here
[49:40] because there was nothing there he said
[49:43] oh yes much better there are no more
[49:47] cannibals
[49:49] it's better now
[49:51] he said when I was a little boy
[49:55] my father took me and my sister
[49:59] and
[50:03] he says never go further than this point
[50:09] because on the other side of the island
[50:11] there's a tribe and they eat children
[50:15] and we'll never see you again
[50:19] now the island was free of cannibals
[50:23] and Jesus was now had come
[50:26] to set them free of the worst of
[50:30] cannibals
[50:31] Lucifer himself like a roaring lion
[50:36] wanted to devour them all
[50:39] and on this little island
[50:41] and the name of the island
[50:45] what's called
[50:50] hmm
[50:52] and we shared the gospel
[50:58] didn't have windows at openings
[51:02] didn't have a door
[51:05] we just walked in
[51:07] Ramos everyone wore some kind of a
[51:10] sandals
[51:12] but to go into church they took their
[51:16] sandals off
[51:17] so they wouldn't carry all the mud in
[51:20] but
[51:24] and as I'm getting ready to walk in
[51:27] the brother stops
[51:31] your shoes
[51:33] I go oh excuse me sorry about that I'm
[51:38] American you know
[51:39] but had I been Mexican president I would
[51:43] have had the same problem
[51:44] you see the culture is different
[51:47] but get in the heart there's a longing
[51:50] you know Jesus as a personal savior
[51:54] something inside us tells us
[51:57] this man is offered eternal life
[52:01] he's given his life
[52:04] and became our sins
[52:08] and died in Rose the third day
[52:12] that we could become his righteousness
[52:15] you could say I'll never be that good
[52:18] brother Daniel
[52:20] it has nothing to do with you being that
[52:24] good
[52:35] we were making a few adjustments this
[52:38] morning
[52:40] for our listeners on uh on the internet
[52:43] YouTube
[52:45] I think we had uh some success
[52:50] I hope we hear good good news from them
[52:53] listening this morning
[52:56] and that the volumes are better
[53:00] and they can hear better the God's word
[53:04] and uh and be blessed
[53:07] we posted this morning there on the
[53:09] little board
[53:13] we received uh letters from invitation
[53:17] from the brother in Congo
[53:19] [Music]
[53:21] those are letters that he had to have
[53:24] notarized in Congo
[53:29] and he sent those to us
[53:32] then we had to send those notarized
[53:35] letters of invitations
[53:38] the Congo Embassy
[53:41] there in Washington DC are you in
[53:44] Washington they say and they would issue
[53:46] the Visas
[53:48] so we've received the the Visa back
[53:52] and we do have our plane tickets
[53:55] purchased
[53:58] I believe we leave on October 2nd
[54:03] and we come back on the 11th
[54:07] I think it's uh in the evening sometime
[54:10] so
[54:13] um I look forward to the trip to be with
[54:15] the Saints in Congo
[54:19] I've always enjoyed going places and
[54:22] being with God's people
[54:25] whether it's three or four on a remote
[54:28] island
[54:30] or 1500 in the Caribbean
[54:34] wherever we might be
[54:36] whether it be amongst the Portuguese
[54:38] Brothers in Brazil
[54:42] the Mayan Brothers in in Yucatan oh Los
[54:46] Hermanos
[54:47] everywhere God has a people
[54:50] and you know the cultures can be very
[54:53] different
[54:54] you go to France and the culture is very
[54:58] different from ourselves
[54:59] can you go to England and the culture is
[55:03] very different
[55:04] the language is different
[55:08] but when you meet Believers
[55:11] from around the world
[55:13] regardless of the language that is
[55:15] spoken
[55:17] if they've caught a revelation
[55:20] and recognize the day and their message
[55:24] recognize the great price that Jesus
[55:27] Christ paid for us
[55:30] then we're all speaking the same
[55:32] language
[55:33] we understand each other clearly we
[55:37] Rejoice together
[55:38] and bless the god of Heaven
[55:41] who descended changing forms to get
[55:45] closer to us until he finally achieved
[55:49] the form he wanted to come to see us
[55:54] the great Holy Spirit
[55:57] moving in the midst
[55:59] of the seven churches
[56:02] which we realize that this prophecy in
[56:05] Revelations
[56:12] it's a vision they were they were actual
[56:16] churches in the days of the Apostles
[56:20] okay it was churches where where the
[56:22] Apostle Paul had gone
[56:31] and he had taken this Gospel of Jesus
[56:34] Christ
[56:35] they were real literal places
[56:39] but but they were also an allegory
[56:41] within themselves
[56:44] they actually ripped they were also
[56:47] actually prophetic churches
[56:49] that were represented
[56:52] the time of the Gentiles just as the
[56:56] Bible speaks of the time of the Jews
[57:02] he had allotted the Jewish people 70
[57:05] weeks
[57:07] [Music]
[57:11] and they were symbolic weeks
[57:15] they were not literal weeks
[57:18] it was a space of time
[57:21] and in the midst of those weeks
[57:24] it said that that Christ would come
[57:28] but he would be cut off in the midst of
[57:31] the last week
[57:33] and that's exactly what happened and the
[57:37] time allotted for Israel paused
[57:41] at the cross
[57:44] when the high priest rejected Jesus
[57:47] Christ
[57:48] and took Caesar as their King
[57:52] then then God moved
[58:12] the very same message that we received
[58:15] of Christ
[58:17] the very same message that was first
[58:19] offered to to Israel
[58:22] by Jesus himself will be given to them
[58:26] again
[58:27] and they'll come to recognize that this
[58:30] Jesus
[58:33] was Messiah he was almighty God
[58:37] he was their lord he was their savior
[58:40] they'll realize that their ancestors
[58:43] crucified
[58:45] ancestors the Bible says that they will
[58:48] go into deep mournings
[58:52] and and out of a Nation
[59:35] but God is using those politicians to
[59:39] hold back the wrath of God
[59:41] to hold back the Nations that want to
[59:44] Destroyer foreign
[59:55] is holding back the Wrath
[59:57] because there is Believers in America
[1:00:01] there is Gentile Believers throughout
[1:00:04] the world
[1:00:06] that are believing in Christ
[1:00:09] that aren't hooked up to any
[1:00:11] denominations
[1:00:13] there are they are looking for Jesus
[1:00:16] Christ
[1:00:17] that see the writings of the prophets
[1:00:21] and the things that the prophets have
[1:00:23] written and they can see by Revelation
[1:00:26] that we're living in the last days that
[1:00:30] once again the world has become a Sodom
[1:00:32] and Gomorrah and judgment is about to
[1:00:36] strike but God is holding the judgment
[1:00:41] to
[1:00:44] increase our faith
[1:00:47] Rapture in faith to be changed in the
[1:00:51] moment in the moment in the twinkling of
[1:00:53] an hour as a pass to Paul taught
[1:00:56] that there will be a people
[1:01:01] in this last Church
[1:01:06] which was the last Church age of these
[1:01:09] seven churches
[1:01:14] God rich in Mercy
[1:01:15] as we stand to our feet
[1:01:19] and read about a book of Revelations
[1:01:22] Revelations chapter one
[1:01:25] and verse
[1:01:39] a prophet taught us that the Book of
[1:01:42] Revelations
[1:01:45] represented the whole book of the Bible
[1:01:48] that had been sealed
[1:01:51] to the hearts and minds of the people
[1:01:55] and when Christ came
[1:01:57] he opened the book he was the first it's
[1:02:02] written in the Bible all you have to do
[1:02:05] is read it
[1:02:07] behold don't weep John
[1:02:09] for the line of the tribe
[1:02:12] the root of David had prevailed
[1:02:17] and loose the Seven Seals
[1:02:20] the book that he was opening
[1:02:23] was the Lamb's Book and the lambest book
[1:02:27] was a book of life
[1:02:29] the Lamb's Book was a book of eternal
[1:02:31] life
[1:02:32] but the lamb and the lion in prophecies
[1:02:37] it was the same man it was Jesus Christ
[1:02:41] Jesus of Nazareth the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:45] that means this man Jesus
[1:02:48] was the Son of God
[1:02:50] the body that God created
[1:02:53] God called that body the Son of God
[1:02:57] not another God no no a body that God
[1:03:03] created was given the title The Son of
[1:03:07] God we believe that and then God that
[1:03:11] body was formed and came forth and grew
[1:03:16] it's true that body had a human Spirit
[1:03:20] it had to have a human Spirit
[1:03:25] human race because the law of redemption
[1:03:30] required a Kinsmen
[1:03:32] to lift up a fallen brother
[1:03:36] it had to be a Kinsmen to redeem a
[1:03:39] Kinsmen
[1:03:43] so God kept his word
[1:03:46] and came as the Kinsman
[1:03:52] um
[1:03:53] and the nature the soul of that man
[1:03:57] Jehovah God
[1:04:01] in flesh
[1:04:03] Emmanuel Emmanuel and he shall be called
[1:04:05] Emmanuel
[1:04:07] Emmanuel God With Us
[1:04:11] and one day India
[1:04:15] after his death burial and Resurrection
[1:04:19] he would be called The Son of God
[1:04:23] once again representing the Holy Spirit
[1:04:27] then it wouldn't be God just in one man
[1:04:33] but now God could come and dwell in the
[1:04:35] hearts of all his children
[1:04:39] he changed forms from the throne to the
[1:04:43] Cross
[1:04:44] resurrected the third day to come back
[1:04:47] is the great Holy Spirit
[1:04:53] from Heart to Heart even this morning
[1:04:57] Revelations 1 verse
[1:05:00] the revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:05:04] gave unto him to show unto his servants
[1:05:07] things which must shortly come to pass
[1:05:09] and he sentence signified it but his
[1:05:12] Angel unto his servant John revelation
[1:05:15] Manifesto
[1:05:17] is
[1:05:23] John was given the revelation of Jesus
[1:05:26] Christ
[1:05:28] is it to show one to his servants things
[1:05:31] which will shortly come to pass
[1:05:37] and he sent and signified it by his
[1:05:39] Angel unto his servant Johnson
[1:05:43] so Jesus didn't appear to to John again
[1:05:48] in a flesh body
[1:05:51] but in a supernatural body in a
[1:05:55] Celestial body
[1:05:56] the Bible in verse 2 says who bear
[1:05:59] record of of the word of God and of the
[1:06:03] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the
[1:06:06] things that he saw
[1:06:10] yeah
[1:06:13] John Juan was an eyewitness
[1:06:17] and and he was chosen
[1:06:20] to see these visions
[1:06:23] and share them he was more than an
[1:06:26] apostle
[1:06:27] he was more than just a prophet
[1:06:30] he was chosen to write this last book of
[1:06:34] the Bible
[1:06:36] a book A book that contained things
[1:06:39] passed
[1:06:41] a book that contained prophecies
[1:06:47] and a book that contained prophecies
[1:06:49] that were yet to come to pass
[1:06:53] so in this book it's not just future
[1:06:56] things that were written
[1:06:59] but when John saw the Visions
[1:07:02] some of the things he was saying they're
[1:07:06] already history it already happened as a
[1:07:10] matter of fact he had been alive and
[1:07:12] watched them with his eyes when they
[1:07:14] happened
[1:07:19] [Music]
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:49] [Music]
[1:07:58] the Holy Spirit speaking to our hearts
[1:08:04] and we can be a happy people
[1:08:07] not a bunch of jokers not just always
[1:08:11] saying jokes
[1:08:13] I probably say too many jokes myself
[1:08:17] it's okay
[1:08:19] be funny
[1:08:21] but not so silly till it walks us out of
[1:08:25] the presence of God
[1:08:27] we must stay in this presence
[1:08:31] and verse 3 basically blessed is he that
[1:08:34] readeth and they that hear the words of
[1:08:36] this prophecy and keep those things
[1:08:39] which are written therein for the time
[1:08:41] is at hand
[1:08:50] blessed is he that readeth
[1:08:55] the words of His prophets
[1:08:58] sounds like a family altar doesn't it
[1:09:02] reading to the kids
[1:09:06] hmm
[1:09:09] well my kids are already older brother
[1:09:14] blessed is he that readeth here
[1:09:20] why if anyone should be able to sit down
[1:09:22] and hear Dad read a few Scriptures
[1:09:27] it should be the older kids in the home
[1:09:32] you might be saying you're saying that
[1:09:34] because of me brother Daniel
[1:09:36] I am I absolutely am I'm targeting you
[1:09:41] this morning
[1:09:44] let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:09:47] we thank you for your word and we ask
[1:09:51] your blessings
[1:09:52] in Jesus name amen you may be seated
[1:09:57] Revelations
[1:10:00] the plan unfolding
[1:10:03] a prophetic plan um
[1:10:06] to take us back into the presence of God
[1:10:10] to return us back to what Adam had had
[1:10:15] been giveness
[1:10:17] and Eve but they fell from it
[1:10:20] the first Adam
[1:10:23] partook of the of the tree of the
[1:10:26] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:10:28] and it brought forth death is
[1:10:31] he he became a part of that
[1:10:33] transgression
[1:10:35] no he was not the transgressor himself
[1:10:39] God was tutoring this first Adam
[1:10:42] to bring forth the family of God
[1:10:46] and just the way he brought Adam into
[1:10:49] existence
[1:10:51] he formed to the body from the dust of
[1:10:54] the earth
[1:10:56] and he called that Spirit man
[1:10:59] that he made in Genesis
[1:11:02] remember it was in Genesis
[1:11:05] then he formed the man from the dust of
[1:11:08] the earth
[1:11:10] it wasn't two separate men
[1:11:12] one was Adam the spirit man
[1:11:18] and then one was the flesh man
[1:11:21] a body of Flesh a vessel of clay he was
[1:11:27] going to put the spirit man
[1:11:30] and when he put Adam spirit in this
[1:11:32] flesh body
[1:11:33] to them
[1:11:36] the Bible says he became a living Soul
[1:11:40] there he was a spirit man living in a
[1:11:44] flesh body
[1:11:49] living in a body of Flesh because the
[1:11:53] Bible said that God needed a man
[1:11:56] to tell the Earth
[1:11:58] and a spirit man didn't have arms and
[1:12:02] legs
[1:12:04] natural ones that could pick and touch
[1:12:07] anything up on this Earth
[1:12:10] are the spirit mans From Another
[1:12:12] Dimension
[1:12:13] so God brought that Spirit man
[1:12:16] wrapped him into a body here on Earth
[1:12:20] now Adam had hands with which he could
[1:12:24] till the Earth
[1:12:25] this Eden that God had given him
[1:12:28] but but the tilling of the earth that
[1:12:31] God wanted Adam to do
[1:12:34] was the telling that God the Father
[1:12:36] himself had done
[1:13:37] you know how Adam's been telling you
[1:13:40] that he'll he'll just speak the word and
[1:13:44] he'll place a germanized seed within you
[1:13:49] and he'll place it in a in a virgin womb
[1:13:53] and it'll bring forth the family your
[1:13:56] family Adams Adams children Adam's Sons
[1:13:59] Adams daughters
[1:14:02] but Adam hasn't been given that
[1:14:04] Authority yet
[1:14:06] Adam hasn't been able to do that yet
[1:14:09] this tutoring of of the of God the
[1:14:12] spirit of God with Adam it's taken a
[1:14:14] long time don't you think Eve
[1:14:18] well it does seem like a long time
[1:14:21] well I've got a shortcut for you that
[1:14:25] will give you the same results
[1:14:28] and you'll bring forth life you'll bring
[1:14:31] forth the family
[1:14:32] but the shortcut turned out to be a a a
[1:14:36] shortcut to death
[1:14:39] and then she offered the shortcut to
[1:14:42] Adam
[1:14:46] was uncomfortable
[1:14:50] but it was his wife
[1:14:54] hmm and when the shortcut was done
[1:14:57] the Bible says they both realized they
[1:15:00] were naked
[1:15:01] and they were ashamed
[1:15:05] and they heard the spirit of God moving
[1:15:08] in the midst of the garden is
[1:15:15] nice he didn't mean
[1:15:18] what part of Eden are you in
[1:15:20] are you on the North Side East Side the
[1:15:24] south side where are you at and he
[1:15:27] didn't mean geographically
[1:15:30] no no
[1:15:33] are you still standing on the word
[1:15:36] are you still believing on the promise
[1:15:40] are you still living by faith
[1:15:46] no no no no no but it's this woman that
[1:15:50] you gave me
[1:15:53] foreign
[1:16:04] the first Adam
[1:16:06] partook of the eve the tree of the
[1:16:09] knowledge of Good and Evil
[1:16:11] and it brought death
[1:16:14] sometimes we're told
[1:16:16] and I've heard people over the ages yes
[1:16:21] well I guess my son and daughter had to
[1:16:24] go out into the world
[1:16:26] so they could better appreciate
[1:16:30] when and if they ever come to Christ
[1:16:34] Christo how much better it is
[1:16:38] but that's not a true statement
[1:16:42] that's a lie of the devil that you have
[1:16:46] to partake of wickedness
[1:16:48] to appreciate the goodness
[1:16:52] those things put baggage and complexes
[1:16:55] on our lives
[1:16:57] and God's able to deliver us
[1:17:02] there is a more excellent way
[1:17:07] the first Adam
[1:17:10] compromise God's word
[1:17:13] the first Adam
[1:17:15] accepted a shortcut
[1:17:17] through the tree of the knowledge of
[1:17:19] Good and Evil
[1:17:21] that tree was Lucifer that tree was
[1:17:24] Satan
[1:17:25] but it's not written that of the second
[1:17:28] Adam
[1:17:29] with me to Isaiah
[1:17:32] yes Isaiah 7 is
[1:17:39] Isaiah chapter 7
[1:17:41] and verse 15. I'm sure you're all
[1:17:45] familiar with the scripture once we
[1:17:47] begin reading it
[1:17:49] families
[1:17:54] speaking to Israel
[1:17:56] and in this as he's speaking to Israel
[1:18:01] the spirit comes upon him
[1:18:04] and he moves into this prophetic word
[1:18:07] and he says therefore the Lord himself
[1:18:10] shall give you a sign
[1:18:14] Behold a virgin shall conceive
[1:18:18] and bear a son and call his name
[1:18:21] Emmanuel a prophecy is coming he's on
[1:18:25] the way
[1:18:26] listen to this is
[1:18:30] eat that he may know to refuse the evil
[1:18:34] and choose the good yes
[1:18:39] butter and
[1:18:43] that he may know to refuse the evil
[1:18:47] and choose the goods all the children
[1:18:51] give them the goodness of God give them
[1:18:55] the word of God
[1:18:58] dress them modestly
[1:19:00] from the time they're little
[1:19:04] oh I see little little girls today two
[1:19:07] and three years old
[1:19:10] even in folks in the message
[1:19:14] and they'll take them swimming and put
[1:19:17] them in a little bikini bikini
[1:19:20] when do we start teaching the modesty
[1:19:26] it's not the child that's having a
[1:19:28] problem with modesty
[1:19:31] the child is unconscious she stood there
[1:19:33] she's too little to know
[1:19:37] they are innocent
[1:19:41] could it be the parents
[1:19:43] still having a problem
[1:19:45] with Mother's Day
[1:19:48] foreign
[1:20:04] could we begin too early
[1:20:08] I don't think we can begin too early
[1:20:12] you might be judged for it but
[1:20:15] we can begin too late
[1:20:19] and when the child Hits 10 11 and 12.
[1:20:23] Mom why can't I wear shorts are shorts
[1:20:28] why can't can I run around in a tank top
[1:20:31] anymore
[1:20:34] I've done it for the last 11 years
[1:20:38] why are the rules
[1:20:41] why are the rules
[1:20:47] it could be too late do you think you
[1:20:50] can change the rules
[1:20:53] it could be by that time the child is
[1:20:55] thinking this is hypocrisy
[1:21:01] because believe me by the time they hit
[1:21:03] 11 and 12.
[1:21:07] they can see the discrepancies
[1:21:10] God help us to set our homes in order
[1:21:20] to hold the standards
[1:21:30] if the children weren't very patient
[1:21:33] maybe the fathers are very patients
[1:21:37] if the children's have an outburst and
[1:21:39] yell back at us
[1:21:44] maybe they learned that from our
[1:21:46] outbursts that we yelled at them
[1:21:55] has offered us something
[1:21:58] Revelations
[1:22:00] chapter one and one Revelation says the
[1:22:04] revelation of Jesus Christ which God
[1:22:07] gave unto him to show unto her serpents
[1:22:11] servants things which was shortly come
[1:22:13] to pass
[1:22:15] and you signified it by his Angel unto
[1:22:18] his service
[1:22:50] it's the tree of knowledge and Good and
[1:22:53] Evil
[1:22:55] Eve
[1:22:59] the serpente it didn't bother him one
[1:23:02] bit
[1:23:05] to search out and take another man's
[1:23:08] wife
[1:23:10] that's the anointing on every man
[1:23:14] and on every woman
[1:23:16] they were cheat
[1:23:18] to that that would be unfaithful
[1:23:21] in their marriage vows
[1:23:24] and take another man and make another
[1:23:27] woman it's the same anointing that was
[1:23:30] in the garden with the serpent is
[1:23:35] Lucifer it destroyed the first family in
[1:23:39] Eden
[1:23:40] and Lucifer will use that tactic to
[1:23:43] destroy every family thereafter
[1:23:48] is this destroying America and the world
[1:23:52] today
[1:23:55] the foundation of a man and a woman in a
[1:24:00] sacred vowel
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:02] marriage one to the other matrimony was
[1:24:06] God's plan from the beginning
[1:24:10] of the backbone of America and every
[1:24:13] nation was broken
[1:24:17] and it's that bro transgenders
[1:24:37] started
[1:24:40] with Eve
[1:24:43] and she fell into an act of adultery
[1:24:48] against her own husband
[1:24:50] and it threw the whole world into chaos
[1:24:54] and Satan has used the plan over and
[1:24:57] over
[1:24:58] and he's always used The Serpent of a
[1:25:01] man is
[1:25:03] a serpent of a woman
[1:25:07] and he gives lessons
[1:25:10] it's called Hollywood Hollywood
[1:25:13] has been Satan's tool
[1:25:17] to prompt by the lust of the flesh
[1:25:23] to destroy the family of God
[1:25:26] to destroy every marriage relationship
[1:25:34] but God rich in Mercy he said he would
[1:25:38] have a bride he said he would have a
[1:25:41] people were called by his name
[1:25:45] the first Steve
[1:25:47] received the seed of the serpenter
[1:25:52] she offered a shortcut
[1:25:57] to the teachings of God the Father
[1:26:01] you see what she part took of
[1:26:06] represented the shortcut
[1:26:09] but God was bringing Adam and Eve too
[1:26:13] Adam and Eve were to bring forth the
[1:26:15] family of God
[1:26:17] by the spoken word
[1:26:21] offered another plan
[1:26:24] telling her it would get her to the same
[1:26:26] place
[1:26:29] but it's God's word or
[1:26:33] only God's word can take you back to God
[1:26:37] that's what we're looking for
[1:26:40] second is Mary
[1:26:42] Maria
[1:26:45] was the first Eve Mary
[1:26:50] was the second Mary Mary was the second
[1:26:53] Eve
[1:26:55] in this picture
[1:26:57] in this prophecy in this allegory of
[1:27:01] back in Genesis
[1:27:04] the first Steve
[1:27:06] by the first Adam should have brought
[1:27:10] forth children
[1:27:12] through an Immaculate birth
[1:27:16] just as they were brought into Creations
[1:27:24] brings forth the second Adam
[1:27:26] and the second Adam
[1:27:29] brings forth a plan all over again
[1:27:35] in the beginning
[1:27:40] plan
[1:27:44] he said you've got
[1:27:48] a perverted birth
[1:27:51] the sex birth is the curse
[1:27:56] it's what the human race fell to is
[1:27:59] when Jesus came born
[1:28:06] is buried
[1:28:08] Rose the third day
[1:28:13] took captivative Captain the Bible says
[1:28:17] he set all the slaves free
[1:28:21] from himself
[1:28:25] Jesus Christ
[1:28:27] the son of God and he offered All God's
[1:28:32] Children
[1:28:33] he offered everyone whosoever will
[1:28:37] but only his children can be
[1:28:41] he offered you an Immaculate birth
[1:28:45] like we should have had from the
[1:28:47] beginning
[1:28:48] like it was his intention for us
[1:28:56] but when no man was found worthy
[1:28:58] he became that man he became the Lamb of
[1:29:02] God he became the lamb that would take
[1:29:05] away our sins
[1:29:07] his blood would wash the curse away
[1:29:12] that we could be born again that was the
[1:29:16] first coming of Christ that was the
[1:29:18] opening of the first seal
[1:29:20] that was part one but at the end time
[1:29:24] today
[1:29:25] at the second coming part seven what's
[1:29:30] he offering to us again that was lost
[1:29:33] through dark ages of a Roman Catholic
[1:29:36] system
[1:29:38] it's available again today
[1:29:44] that we can be born again and be changed
[1:29:51] and mortify the Deeds of the flesh Los
[1:29:55] Angeles
[1:29:56] is
[1:30:13] the second Eve
[1:30:15] brought forth the second Adam
[1:30:18] Jesus Christ
[1:30:20] God made flesh
[1:30:24] that almighty God himself
[1:30:26] could be our Mentor again
[1:30:30] like he was with Adam
[1:30:34] and take you through a personal
[1:30:36] experience
[1:30:38] of being born again
[1:30:41] justified by faith
[1:30:44] we believe what Jesus did for us
[1:30:48] Sanctified by the spirit
[1:30:51] we start changing all our old habits
[1:30:55] we start changing the way we talk
[1:30:58] we start losing our fits of anger
[1:31:05] we we we start rising up above the
[1:31:09] depressions that hold us
[1:31:13] we start being more like Jesus
[1:31:18] not just with visitors but especially at
[1:31:21] home
[1:31:28] that's in John to the seven churches
[1:31:31] which are in Asia
[1:31:34] John John begins his ministry
[1:31:37] John begins to declare what God has
[1:31:40] called him too
[1:31:43] and here's his letter John to the seven
[1:31:46] churches which are in Asia Grace be unto
[1:31:49] you and peace from him which is which
[1:31:51] was and which is to come and from the
[1:31:54] seven spirits which are before his
[1:31:55] throne
[1:32:05] and from Jesus Christ who is the
[1:32:07] faithful witness and the first begotten
[1:32:10] of the dead and the prince of the kings
[1:32:13] of the Earth
[1:32:14] is
[1:32:23] the Bible says here he was the prince of
[1:32:26] the kings of the Earth
[1:32:31] wouldn't he be the king of all the kings
[1:32:36] he will it's a future prophecy
[1:32:40] but here
[1:32:41] it's still Satan's Eden
[1:32:45] you see the prince of all the kings of
[1:32:49] the earth
[1:32:50] a prince is an heir to a king um
[1:32:55] and when that King dies
[1:32:58] the prince Rises up
[1:33:01] and he becomes the king he becomes the
[1:33:04] air
[1:33:07] so God one day
[1:33:09] will inherit
[1:33:12] this Earth because he holds the title
[1:33:15] deed to it
[1:33:16] and Satan is just a squatter on this
[1:33:19] Earth
[1:33:26] but one day the prince will rise up
[1:33:29] and take back all his possession
[1:33:32] and we'll live with the father
[1:33:35] on an earth it's been cleansed
[1:33:38] with the fire of the Holy Spirit
[1:33:41] the same fire that's cleansing us today
[1:33:45] in our daily walk in our daily life
[1:33:50] the same fire
[1:33:52] that stops us from saying certain things
[1:33:56] the same fire that tell that keeps us
[1:33:59] from acting a certain way
[1:34:03] the same fire that's that that's
[1:34:05] changing us from the old man we are to
[1:34:08] to a new man in Christ
[1:34:11] is the same fire that will clean this
[1:34:14] Earth the Bible says of all sins
[1:34:20] he says and
[1:34:22] the prince of the kings of the earth
[1:34:24] unto him that love us and washed us from
[1:34:28] our sins in his own blood
[1:34:31] amen
[1:34:53] he's lifting him up
[1:34:56] Jesus Christ now remember there's been
[1:35:00] prophets since the day of Adam
[1:35:03] Adam himself was a prophet of God
[1:35:09] and you go through the old
[1:35:11] testamento and the prophetic Ministry
[1:35:14] has been a key Ministry that God is
[1:35:18] and even in the new testamento the
[1:35:23] prophetic Ministry was never announced
[1:35:26] turn with me to
[1:35:29] I believe it's
[1:35:32] Luke Chapter 16.
[1:35:36] he says
[1:35:50] hmm
[1:35:53] Jesus speaking to the Pharisees
[1:35:58] and he's speaking to them of course in
[1:36:00] Parables
[1:36:02] for the psalmist had had prophesied that
[1:36:06] the ministry of Jesus
[1:36:09] the ministry of Messiah that he would
[1:36:13] speak in Parables and without a parable
[1:36:16] he would not speak
[1:36:18] but in Parables when he came he would
[1:36:21] speak things that had been hidden since
[1:36:23] the foundation of the world
[1:36:27] and here once again God speaking to
[1:36:30] Pharisees
[1:36:32] and he says no servant can serve two
[1:36:36] masters
[1:36:38] like Adam and Eve they couldn't serve
[1:36:42] two masters
[1:36:43] for either he will hate the one and love
[1:36:46] the other foreign
[1:37:02] and the Pharisees also who were Covetous
[1:37:05] heard all these things and they derided
[1:37:08] him
[1:37:12] and he said unto them ye are they which
[1:37:15] justify yourselves before men but God
[1:37:18] knoweth your hearts for that which is
[1:37:20] highly esteemed among men is abomination
[1:37:23] in the sight of God
[1:37:37] the law and the prophets were until John
[1:37:42] and immediately folks think that means
[1:37:45] there's no more profits from that day
[1:37:50] but that's stopping in the middle of the
[1:37:52] sentence
[1:37:57] was John a prophet Jesus said he was
[1:38:01] since that time the kingdom of God is
[1:38:04] preached and every man presses into it
[1:38:09] God wasn't doing away with the prophetic
[1:38:11] Ministry
[1:38:13] God was changing what they would preach
[1:38:17] they would no longer preach law and
[1:38:19] judgment
[1:38:22] but they were going to be preaching the
[1:38:24] kingdom of God
[1:38:26] like John they were going to be
[1:38:28] preaching repent and be baptized
[1:38:32] that was the new ministry
[1:38:36] of this new testament prophecy prophet
[1:39:23] [Music]
[1:39:33] that you've come to partake of
[1:39:39] an inward work
[1:39:41] of an outward expression
[1:39:45] that you partake
[1:39:47] when you're baptized
[1:39:50] it's then when God has made a promise
[1:39:56] he baptizes you there
[1:39:59] with the Holy Ghost
[1:40:01] and tongues no Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:40:06] I mean once you rise up out of the water
[1:40:10] you know your change
[1:40:15] might you speak in tongues it's a gift
[1:40:18] of God
[1:40:21] might God call you to preach the gospel
[1:40:25] it's a gift of God
[1:40:27] but called to preach the gospel
[1:40:30] isn't what saves you
[1:40:33] might be what condemns you
[1:40:35] but what saves you is the blood of Jesus
[1:40:40] Christ
[1:40:41] my grace are you saved through faith not
[1:40:46] of yourself but the faith to serve them
[1:40:49] is the gift of God
[1:40:53] the law and the prophets were to preach
[1:40:56] this message
[1:40:57] it was the New Covenant it was the New
[1:41:00] Testament you say are you sure
[1:41:04] that the prophetic ministry didn't end
[1:41:07] could you be mistaken
[1:41:12] I I could be mistaken if it was just
[1:41:15] means
[1:41:16] but I'm positive it was a ministerial
[1:41:19] change
[1:41:20] and the prophets of the New Testament
[1:41:24] would preach the kingdom of God
[1:41:29] turn with me to
[1:41:31] Matthew 23.3
[1:41:43] once again in Matthew 23
[1:41:48] Jesus speaking with scribes and
[1:41:50] Pharisees
[1:41:52] in verse 14 to Matthew 23 says woe to
[1:41:55] you scribes and Pharisees
[1:42:02] these were the Ministers of the largest
[1:42:04] denomination in that day
[1:42:08] and he calls them Hypocrites he says for
[1:42:13] ye devour widow's houses
[1:42:16] you know ministers do that yet today
[1:42:20] in the 21st century
[1:42:24] and for a pretense make long prayer
[1:42:28] therefore ye shall receive the greater
[1:42:31] damnation
[1:42:32] and it goes on rebuking the Pharisees
[1:42:40] the pastors of Israel the evangelists of
[1:42:43] Israel
[1:42:45] the Apostles of Israel that day even
[1:42:49] their Prophet she's rebuking them
[1:42:51] blind guides
[1:42:56] and he goes on in in the rebuke
[1:43:00] of the ministry
[1:43:03] that was taking the people the children
[1:43:06] of Israel
[1:43:07] further from God and not closer
[1:43:13] hmm
[1:43:15] in verse 31. he says this he says
[1:43:19] wherefore ye be Witnesses unto
[1:43:21] yourselves
[1:43:22] that ye are the children of them which
[1:43:24] killed the prophets
[1:43:31] of all the prophets that God sent Israel
[1:43:35] probably more than 90 percent of them
[1:43:39] Israel the Israel killed their own
[1:43:41] Prophets
[1:43:46] he said fill you up then the measure of
[1:43:49] your fathers
[1:43:52] and he tells these Pharisees
[1:43:55] these ministers
[1:43:57] these pastors of Israel he says ye
[1:44:01] serpents ye Generation of Vipers
[1:44:05] how can you escape the damnation of
[1:44:08] Health
[1:44:09] this is Jesus speaking and then Jesus
[1:44:13] says remember this is long after John
[1:44:16] had been killed
[1:44:19] this is long after John had been
[1:44:23] beheaded
[1:44:26] John had been dead for a year or more
[1:44:30] and Jesus says wherefore behold I
[1:44:36] jesus long after John is gone
[1:44:40] I send unto you prophets
[1:44:43] and wise men and scribes
[1:44:46] shall kill and crucified and some of
[1:44:50] them you shall Scourge in your
[1:44:51] synagogues
[1:44:52] and persecute them from City to city
[1:44:56] that upon you may come all the righteous
[1:44:59] blood
[1:45:01] shed upon the Earth from the blood of
[1:45:05] the righteous
[1:45:06] unto the blood of Zechariah son of
[1:45:09] barcience
[1:45:15] he says barely I sent you all these
[1:45:18] things shall come on this generation
[1:45:23] then he said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem
[1:45:32] how often would I have gathered I have
[1:45:36] gathered thy children together
[1:45:39] even as a hen gather through chickens
[1:45:43] under her wings
[1:45:49] Jehovah Jesus
[1:45:54] we're always here he types himself onto
[1:45:57] a great Eagle
[1:45:59] but dealing with Israel
[1:46:03] hear Jesus
[1:46:05] God and flesh
[1:46:07] types himself to a hint
[1:46:10] because Israel Israel
[1:46:13] was like chickens in a chicken yard
[1:46:20] it wasn't a rude statement
[1:46:25] it was God revealing to us
[1:46:28] the condition of the church
[1:46:32] at his first coming and
[1:46:35] it will be and is the condition of the
[1:46:38] church
[1:46:43] foreign
[1:46:50] but in verse 34.
[1:46:53] long after John
[1:46:55] had died
[1:46:57] long after Herod had put him to death
[1:47:01] Jesus says he said wherefore behold
[1:47:07] I still have a prophetic Ministry
[1:47:09] I kill Jesus Jesus will send you
[1:47:13] prophets and wise men and scribes yes
[1:47:17] there will be men after my own heart
[1:47:21] there will be men that follow me
[1:48:17] not tell us come join our denomination
[1:48:21] and you'll be saved no come and have a
[1:48:25] personal experience with Jesus Christ
[1:48:28] and his blood will wash away every stain
[1:48:33] and make you a new creature in Christ
[1:48:36] you'll never be the same and he'll be
[1:48:40] changing you daily
[1:48:42] as we live in his presence
[1:48:46] Mercy
[1:48:51] is raising up a bride
[1:48:54] Revelations apocalypses chapter 12.
[1:49:20] and Revelations 12 excuse me
[1:49:29] and verse 1.
[1:49:33] you ever had that problem you just can't
[1:49:35] find that scripture in the Bible you're
[1:49:37] looking for problems
[1:49:42] seems to be happening more often to me
[1:49:45] and I just got to trust him
[1:49:48] Revelations 12 1.
[1:49:52] the Bible's written in a way
[1:49:56] that it's hidden from the wise and
[1:49:58] Prudence
[1:50:00] a little here a little there as we
[1:50:04] shared with you when we read Revelations
[1:50:06] 5.
[1:50:08] everything in Revelations five
[1:50:11] had to happen before there could even be
[1:50:15] a Revelations one
[1:50:17] because it was from Revelations 5.
[1:50:21] when there's now an image of a lamb
[1:50:24] slain before the altars
[1:50:28] that wasn't the place where God stopped
[1:50:30] and couldn't move no more
[1:50:33] no no
[1:50:57] until he changes you completely kill you
[1:51:01] and I Surrender everything
[1:51:03] God is interceding for us there before
[1:51:06] the Father
[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:09] the father looks down she says they
[1:51:12] don't look like they're trying too hard
[1:51:17] just give me a little more time with
[1:51:20] them
[1:51:21] I'll make it work I know they're hard
[1:51:25] they wanna change he's interceding for
[1:51:29] you these are mediators
[1:51:45] to bring forth a woman the bride of
[1:51:49] Christ
[1:51:50] Revelations 12 1 says
[1:51:55] he's looking up into the heavens
[1:51:58] as he's sitting on some rocks
[1:52:00] in an island
[1:52:04] the entire Blue Sky becomes his
[1:52:07] television
[1:52:09] and he's catching these Visions in this
[1:52:12] giant blue sky
[1:52:15] it's a picture scene greater than the
[1:52:18] IMAX that they have today
[1:52:23] they say IMAX is the is the largest
[1:52:26] theater screen that exists in the world
[1:52:29] today
[1:52:33] well the visions that John was seen in
[1:52:36] the heavens
[1:52:37] it was like a super super IMAX
[1:52:41] it was so real to him
[1:52:45] more than real and he saw this here and
[1:52:49] he said and there appeared a great
[1:52:51] Wonder in heaven
[1:52:54] it filled the sky
[1:52:57] he said I saw a woman clothed with the
[1:53:00] sun
[1:53:01] and the moon under her feet
[1:53:15] but in a symbolic sense
[1:53:19] this was the Bride of Jesus Christ a
[1:53:23] gentile people
[1:53:25] she was clothed with the Sun
[1:53:51] and upon her head a crown of twelve
[1:53:54] Stars
[1:53:55] the first 12 Apostles
[1:53:59] to begin preaching the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:54:05] being with child cried yesterday
[1:54:10] and pain to be delivered
[1:54:13] this was a gentile bride because Israel
[1:54:17] never got to this place
[1:54:19] where Christ was birthed in here
[1:54:23] Israel never entered into the pains to
[1:54:25] be delivered
[1:54:28] and bring forth Christ enter the hope of
[1:54:31] glory
[1:54:34] in a natural sense it was little Mary
[1:54:38] but in a supernatural prophetic sense
[1:54:43] it's you and I it's a gentile church and
[1:54:48] then he says and there appeared another
[1:54:49] Wonder in heaven
[1:54:52] and behold a great red dragon it was
[1:54:56] Lucifer Lucifer he had seven heads
[1:55:00] seven crowns upon his head
[1:55:03] representing kings
[1:55:06] crowns represents it represents Kings
[1:55:10] horns represents dictatorships
[1:55:14] Lucifer Lucifer he had in his hands all
[1:55:19] the nations of that day
[1:55:21] and the Bible says and with this tale is
[1:55:25] the third part of the Stars
[1:55:28] now John is reaching back to the
[1:55:31] beginning
[1:55:33] when Michael and Lucifer fought in the
[1:55:36] heavens
[1:55:37] and Lucifer was cast down
[1:55:40] and he convinced the third part of the
[1:55:43] Stars
[1:55:45] representing the celestial beings the
[1:55:47] angels
[1:55:49] and then cast them to the earth
[1:55:52] and the dragon stood before the woman
[1:55:56] which was ready to be delivered
[1:55:59] for to devour her child as soon as it
[1:56:02] was born
[1:56:04] that represents in the days of Jesus
[1:56:08] when Lucifer anointed
[1:56:12] when he heard by the voice of the three
[1:56:15] Magi
[1:56:17] we've been following a star the prophecy
[1:56:21] of the prophets
[1:56:24] and it's it's to take us to him that's
[1:56:26] to be born
[1:56:32] wait a minute I'm King of the Jews we
[1:56:36] can't have two kings
[1:56:39] can't have it I won't have it
[1:56:42] deal wisely
[1:56:47] he tells them where is this King to be
[1:56:51] born
[1:56:52] he says we're not sure
[1:56:56] he says I'll find out
[1:56:58] all the high priests call the Levites
[1:57:01] call the scribes bring them in for a
[1:57:04] meeting
[1:57:07] where is Messiah King of the Jews
[1:57:10] and they begin searching the Prophecies
[1:57:13] of the prophets
[1:57:15] to be born in the city of David
[1:57:24] he
[1:57:37] will anointed of the Dragon
[1:57:43] there was little Mary which was ready to
[1:57:46] be delivered
[1:57:50] he wanted to devour this child as soon
[1:57:54] as it was born but the Bible said the
[1:57:57] Magi were warned of God
[1:58:00] that Herod wanted to just destroy this
[1:58:03] child
[1:58:05] and they went another way
[1:58:08] it was the Shepherds that were first
[1:58:10] there at the birth of Christ
[1:58:14] they celebrated the ministry of the Lamb
[1:58:24] told them where Messiah was being born
[1:58:28] said he will be the savior of the whole
[1:58:31] world
[1:58:33] you see that was the lamb Ministry
[1:58:37] the line of the tribe of Jews the king
[1:58:41] of the Jews was that to be the savior of
[1:58:43] the whole world
[1:58:46] and yet it was the same man but two
[1:58:49] different ministers that when the line
[1:58:52] of the tribes
[1:58:55] we'll take the Lion's Share
[1:58:58] and give this gospel the preaching of
[1:59:01] the Kingdom of Heaven to Israel
[1:59:04] when Israel rejected it
[1:59:07] then the king of the Jews
[1:59:09] went to get 70. there he took off his
[1:59:14] crowns
[1:59:17] he walked in King of the Jews
[1:59:20] and one hour later in deep prayer before
[1:59:24] the father
[1:59:26] he accepted his new ministry
[1:59:30] who will give his life's blood
[1:59:35] to save his children to save his son to
[1:59:40] save his daughter
[1:59:41] heal me come a lamb worthy of the father
[1:59:45] to accept
[1:59:48] for your place
[1:59:59] [Music]
[2:00:04] right I mean
[2:00:08] and his tail do the third part of the
[2:00:10] stars of Heaven
[2:00:12] and it cast them to the Earth
[2:00:16] that happened way back in Genesis
[2:00:20] and the dragon stood before the woman
[2:00:22] which was ready to be delivered
[2:00:27] that was four thousand years later you
[2:00:30] see how this Bible is written
[2:00:33] and how does it matter how smart you are
[2:00:36] you can it takes Revelation
[2:00:39] and the dragon Steward before the woman
[2:00:41] which was ready to be delivered to
[2:00:43] devour her child as soon as it was born
[2:00:49] it was Herod anointed of Lucifer in that
[2:00:52] day
[2:00:54] and verse 5 says and she brought forth A
[2:00:58] Man Child
[2:01:00] Jesus Christ who was to rule all nations
[2:01:03] with a rod of iron
[2:01:07] watch how the scripture now jumps
[2:01:10] this is Christ the Holy Spirit at the
[2:01:16] white Throne judgment
[2:01:18] it's at the white Throne
[2:01:20] where this man child
[2:01:23] will rule All Nations
[2:01:35] it jumps back now to where he's a child
[2:01:38] again
[2:01:39] and her child was caught up unto God and
[2:01:42] to his throne
[2:01:44] foreign
[2:02:25] but it was just going to be 10 more days
[2:02:28] because that would be 50 days from the
[2:02:31] time of his resurrection
[2:02:34] and it would Mark a jubilee time
[2:02:37] in other words Pentecost
[2:02:40] was a jubilee year is
[2:02:58] they would be born again
[2:03:02] and the Bible says
[2:03:04] but you see how the scriptures jumps
[2:03:07] from us from from the word and
[2:03:11] it can be a future prophecy
[2:03:14] it can be a past prophecy
[2:03:16] verse 6 says and the woman fled Into the
[2:03:20] Wilderness
[2:03:22] the church
[2:03:25] the bride of Christ where she had the
[2:03:28] place prepared of God that they should
[2:03:30] feed her there a thousand two hundred
[2:03:33] and three Square days
[2:03:38] and there was war in heaven
[2:03:41] is dropping back and picking up on the
[2:03:45] last verse
[2:03:46] where Satan was cast down now he's
[2:03:50] adding more detail to that verse
[2:03:53] and there was war in heaven Michael and
[2:03:55] his angels fought against the dragon and
[2:03:57] the dragon fought and his angels
[2:04:02] and prevailed not
[2:04:04] neither was there a place found any more
[2:04:07] in heaven
[2:04:10] and the Great Dragon was cast out
[2:04:14] that old serpenter
[2:04:17] you see there was a time
[2:04:21] that Satan was allowed to go before the
[2:04:24] Throne of God
[2:04:26] you can read in the Book of Job well
[2:04:29] that Satan could come before the Throne
[2:04:32] of God
[2:04:33] and begin to accuse job
[2:04:36] and God stood up and said no job's a man
[2:04:39] of God the Son of God no job you've made
[2:04:43] him a rich man he'll give giving him
[2:04:46] everything of course he serves you he
[2:04:50] says no you don't know job like I know
[2:04:53] foreign
[2:05:11] and there was war in heaven Michael and
[2:05:13] his angels fought against the dragon and
[2:05:15] the dragon fought his angels
[2:05:21] they were fighting once again
[2:05:25] to continue to have access Before the
[2:05:27] Throne of God
[2:05:29] but the Bible says they prevailed not
[2:05:32] available
[2:05:37] because God was vacating the place
[2:05:43] the place where he wants to loud Lucifer
[2:05:45] and those Devil's to accuse his people
[2:05:51] he was going to empty that spot in
[2:05:53] heaven
[2:05:55] because that spot was now for someone
[2:05:57] else
[2:05:59] that was the spot where there would be a
[2:06:02] lamb slain
[2:06:04] they would no longer bring accusations
[2:06:09] [Music]
[2:06:17] another negative thing about you
[2:06:20] everything the father hears about you in
[2:06:23] heaven
[2:06:26] no that's my son that's my daughter
[2:06:45] and these Angels were fighting for that
[2:06:48] spot
[2:06:54] the Bible said they prevailed
[2:06:57] either was their place found anymore in
[2:07:00] heaven
[2:07:00] and the Great Dragon was cast out
[2:07:05] call the devil and Satan
[2:07:23] of which you and I are this morning
[2:07:27] it says he was cast out into the Earth
[2:07:31] and his angels were cast out with him
[2:07:34] you know when that happened
[2:07:37] that day on Calvary
[2:07:41] when God ascended
[2:07:44] and John scene and I seen a lamb as
[2:07:46] though it had been slain
[2:07:54] you know where that lamb was sitting now
[2:07:56] don't you
[2:07:58] in the spot that God vacated
[2:08:02] and pushed out Lucifer
[2:08:04] he says I'll never allow you in the spot
[2:08:07] again
[2:08:09] in this spot until my last child comes
[2:08:13] in
[2:08:14] will be a lamb slain
[2:08:18] natural
[2:08:29] and give and cause them to be born again
[2:08:33] that for you is
[2:08:35] immaculate birth
[2:08:37] because that has nothing to do
[2:08:41] the man or a woman
[2:08:43] it's God birth in you
[2:08:46] like he gave to Adam
[2:08:49] in the beginning
[2:08:54] verse 10. and I heard a loud voice
[2:08:57] saying in heaven
[2:08:58] now has come salvation and strength and
[2:09:01] the kingdom of our God
[2:09:03] and the power of His Christ for the
[2:09:06] accuser of our Brethren is cast down do
[2:09:08] you see it which accused them before God
[2:09:11] day and night
[2:09:22] foreign
[2:09:29] and the Brethren they overcame him by
[2:09:32] the blood of the Lamb hello
[2:09:38] and by the word of their testimony
[2:09:41] and they love not their lives unto death
[2:09:46] throughout seven
[2:09:48] this is the body of Christ
[2:09:51] therefore Rejoice see heavens and
[2:09:54] neither dwell in them
[2:09:57] woe to the inhabitants of the earth and
[2:10:01] of the scene
[2:10:03] for the devil has come down unto you
[2:10:06] having great wrath because he knoweth
[2:10:09] that he hath but a short time
[2:10:15] and when the dragon saw that he was cast
[2:10:17] into the Earth
[2:10:18] he persecuted the woman which brought
[2:10:21] forth the man-child Equinox
[2:10:28] not a Jewish Church
[2:10:30] a gentile church this is Christ inner is
[2:10:36] and to the woman were given two wings of
[2:10:39] a great Eagle that she might fly into
[2:10:42] the Wilderness into her place where she
[2:10:45] is nourished for a time and times and a
[2:10:48] half time from the face of the serpent
[2:10:59] this woman is the church
[2:11:03] this woman here is both wise and foolish
[2:11:06] virgin is
[2:11:20] because they're all believers
[2:11:23] they were all believers they were
[2:11:26] virgins they were living a holy
[2:11:29] Sanctified lives but one had the oil and
[2:11:34] one didn't one had the baptism of the
[2:11:37] Holy Ghost
[2:11:38] and was receiving refillings
[2:11:43] one was growing until the very statue of
[2:11:46] Christ
[2:11:48] one her faith was rising up
[2:11:51] to the place where her faith would rise
[2:11:54] up to Rapture in faith
[2:11:59] and the Bible says and the serpent cast
[2:12:01] out of his mouth water as a flood after
[2:12:05] the woman
[2:12:08] the water
[2:12:10] represents the masses of people
[2:12:17] thank you
[2:12:18] that flood your life
[2:12:20] we allowed to flood our lives
[2:12:24] by the movies we watch
[2:12:27] by the little short clips we look at
[2:12:29] foreign
[2:13:07] hmm the high take the high-tech world
[2:13:12] is enchanting
[2:13:15] to the human mind
[2:13:18] until the word of God
[2:13:20] Appears boring
[2:13:27] we can't read it without falling asleep
[2:13:38] we can follow it for hours
[2:13:49] and the serpent cast out of his mouth
[2:13:53] as a flood our after the woman that he
[2:13:58] might cause her to be carried away
[2:14:02] of the flood
[2:14:05] of lost Humanity
[2:14:12] and the Earth helped the woman
[2:14:16] and the Earth opened her mouth
[2:14:19] and swallow up the flood
[2:14:22] which is
[2:14:27] help the woman
[2:14:34] okay
[2:14:35] earthquakes
[2:14:38] tsunamis tsunamis
[2:14:40] hurricanes
[2:14:42] tornadoes and tornadoes and the believer
[2:14:45] looks
[2:14:46] and sees how quick life can be snapped
[2:14:49] away
[2:14:51] and the Earth is helping us to see how
[2:14:55] short this life can be
[2:14:57] and the only safety zone is in Christ
[2:15:04] and the Earth helped the woman
[2:15:07] and the Earth opened her mouth
[2:15:09] and swallowed up the flood which the
[2:15:13] Dragon cast out of us
[2:15:16] and the dragon was Wrath with the woman
[2:15:21] the woman
[2:15:23] was Believers the woman was both wise
[2:15:27] and foolish virgins
[2:15:30] and the dragon was Wrath with the woman
[2:15:35] and went to make war with the remnant of
[2:15:38] her seeds
[2:15:42] listen close again
[2:15:45] and the dragon was Wrath with the woman
[2:15:53] he saw Believers he said I'm going to
[2:15:56] destroy these people
[2:15:59] Satan cannot distinguish between the
[2:16:02] wise virgins and the foolish
[2:16:06] he saw Believers because they all are
[2:16:14] can he says and he went the dragon was
[2:16:16] Wrath with the woman
[2:16:20] but he didn't make war with the woman
[2:16:23] he went to make war with the remnant of
[2:16:26] her seeds
[2:16:29] those that were left
[2:16:32] what happened between the karma
[2:16:35] the wise virgins
[2:16:38] were taken in a Rapture the dead in
[2:16:43] Christ
[2:16:47] will be caught up to meet him
[2:16:51] and when we're taken off the Earth
[2:16:57] the remnant of the seed of God
[2:17:01] the foolish version who are believers
[2:17:06] they just didn't surrender everything to
[2:17:09] God
[2:17:10] they needed another step deeper in their
[2:17:14] Christian world
[2:17:16] but they loved God
[2:17:19] but God wanted to bring them higher into
[2:17:21] his presence
[2:17:23] and they just couldn't take the next
[2:17:25] step
[2:17:27] of surrendering
[2:17:32] somewhere busy
[2:17:34] I just bought a yoke of oxen
[2:17:38] there's nothing wrong with that I just
[2:17:41] married a wife that's a wonderful thing
[2:17:47] I just bought a plot of land
[2:17:51] I want to make a cabin on it
[2:17:55] nothing wrong with that
[2:17:58] but it was these little things
[2:18:00] it became distractions
[2:18:14] Matthew 5 48.
[2:18:16] even as your father which is in heaven
[2:18:23] if you're struggling to see how to get
[2:18:25] to that perfection
[2:18:29] that's spoken of in Matthew 5 48.
[2:18:33] which Jesus is calling you to come to
[2:18:37] then go back and in prayer
[2:18:41] carefully read
[2:18:43] the last 47 verses
[2:18:47] because those 47 steps
[2:18:50] will take you to 48.
[2:18:52] the conclusion the conclusion of Jesus
[2:18:56] preaching on you being perfect
[2:18:59] if God requires it again
[2:19:05] through the blood of Christ
[2:19:23] let's pray
[2:19:24] Heavenly Father
[2:19:27] we thank you for this faithful group of
[2:19:29] people
[2:19:33] I pray that you continue to Open the
[2:19:36] Eyes of our understanding
[2:19:41] maybe maybe we may we be ever so wise
[2:19:45] the wise version
[2:19:49] who are lamps were trimmed
[2:19:52] and our vessels full of oil
[2:19:56] representing not only the baptism of the
[2:19:58] Holy Spirit
[2:20:00] which is the beginning of our Christian
[2:20:03] walk
[2:20:05] but the refilling after refilling of our
