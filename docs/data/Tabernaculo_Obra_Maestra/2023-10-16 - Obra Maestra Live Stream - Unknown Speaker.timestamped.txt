[52:20] everything I realized that someone loved
[52:22] me that much I realized that someone
[52:25] could love me more than anybody on this
[52:26] Earth could cuz they're willing to take
[52:29] all those beatings to get spit on the
[52:31] face to get punched in the face and he

[54:52] may I see this say
[55:23] I see this
[55:54] am
[56:19] [Applause]
[56:23] I see this say say
[56:27] [Music]
[56:33] God bless you all this
[56:36] morning it's good to be back
[56:42] again it was a a long
[56:44] [Music]
[56:46] trip we hadn't taken one that long in a
[56:52] while we had been uh years ago to South
[56:57] Africa you may be seated just for a
[56:59] minute as we speak a little
[57:02] bit and but that's been a
[57:05] while and uh of course it's it's nice
[57:08] that as human beings we do have a way of
[57:10] forgetting
[57:13] sometimes of how long the journeys
[57:18] were I believe when we went to South
[57:23] Africa I think just the flight from New
[57:26] York
[57:29] City to Johannesburg South Africa
[57:33] Johannesburg sou Africa just that part
[57:35] of the trip alone was uh I think 17 or
[57:38] 18 hours of the
[57:43] air so uh the flights were not that long
[57:46] this
[57:49] time overall it was it was depending on
[57:53] where where the planes go it's 24 to 30
[58:03] hours and and so I think the the flights
[58:07] averaged um coming back from
[58:15] brazaville we from there we flew back to
[58:20] kinasa which is another
[58:23] country then from there we flew to
[58:27] Paris so by the time we started the
[58:30] journey to the time we land in
[58:37] Paris it was probably about 12
[58:40] hours so we lay over there for a few
[58:43] hours maybe maybe
[58:47] three maybe a little more than three
[58:50] hours and then we flew from there back
[58:53] to Detroit Michigan
[58:57] again which is about another 8
[59:01] hours so but we were back in the United
[59:04] States of
[59:07] America it felt good to be back on
[59:10] American soil
[59:16] again uh if you had ever had the chance
[59:18] to go to
[59:22] Congo the minute you arrive
[59:28] you you'd say
[59:31] Mexico the the the architecture the
[59:37] buildings uh it's very
[59:41] similar uh as it is in many third world
[59:46] countries even as it is in the the
[59:49] Caribbean
[59:52] islands it's very much the the way they
[59:55] build is just like being in Mexico
[1:00:00] also and so very familiar
[1:00:06] sites when you arrive
[1:00:09] there uh then you don't you don't feel
[1:00:11] too out of
[1:00:14] place except that you're the lightest
[1:00:16] skinned person of about everyone around
[1:00:19] you you
[1:00:23] know
[1:00:25] but there was a brother from Dallas
[1:00:26] there
[1:00:29] also a white
[1:00:32] brother and I told them you've never
[1:00:35] looked more white than right now I
[1:00:39] tell he said I've never felt more
[1:00:44] white it was a brother Cosman
[1:00:47] Stefan Stan he's originally from
[1:00:51] Romania R but he's been living there in
[1:00:54] Dallas for many years
[1:00:57] now attends Brother David mcgary's
[1:01:01] assembly
[1:01:03] M and uh he does he does the work of an
[1:01:06] evangelist and missionary
[1:01:10] work and uh we certainly enjoyed his
[1:01:16] ministry and he and he he blessed the
[1:01:19] people there in brazaville
[1:01:23] greatly
[1:01:25] there was other brothers there a local
[1:01:27] Pastor a Brother
[1:01:30] P who also
[1:01:33] ministered pimber p and who also
[1:01:37] ministered um a brother from
[1:01:40] Belgium Bel Brother pel
[1:01:45] P and and uh also ministered there also
[1:01:49] there was so there was several Brethren
[1:01:52] that
[1:01:53] ministered
[1:01:56] we were given the very first night of
[1:01:58] the
[1:02:02] meetings and uh so I just said how come
[1:02:05] I have to break the
[1:02:10] ice he said you have been chosen for
[1:02:13] this
[1:02:14] purpose so we Minister the first night
[1:02:17] of the
[1:02:19] services then we got a little
[1:02:22] rest and then the Sunday morning we we
[1:02:26] ministered
[1:02:28] again which was the last the last
[1:02:32] service and the the meetings were held
[1:02:34] in in the in the Tabernacle that they
[1:02:37] have
[1:02:40] now it was actually I realized it was
[1:02:42] their anniversary services for brother R
[1:02:48] Rafael Rafael CA the pastor they've been
[1:02:53] there for about 30 3 years now when he
[1:02:55] started the
[1:02:57] work so he pastored and started the work
[1:03:01] in a time when when when
[1:03:07] Congo when Congo there in the capital
[1:03:10] city was in
[1:03:12] a a violent Civil
[1:03:22] War and uh brazille is a city of about 2
[1:03:26] million
[1:03:32] people it's the capital of the
[1:03:35] nation the president lives
[1:03:38] there and uh it it is a city I say of
[1:03:42] two
[1:03:44] million and if you can imagine being
[1:03:48] right in the middle of Mexico
[1:03:53] City the in the poorest part of of of
[1:03:57] Mexico
[1:04:00] City you're getting close you're getting
[1:04:03] close to imagining what brazaville is
[1:04:09] like that's congested very
[1:04:13] congested streets are
[1:04:16] narrow you would think when I arried
[1:04:19] that there's I think there's a lot of
[1:04:20] one-way streets
[1:04:23] there
[1:04:25] but none of them are oneway
[1:04:27] streets they're just very congested and
[1:04:30] narrow
[1:04:33] streets so in this city of two million
[1:04:38] people there are no stop
[1:04:41] signs and there are no traffic
[1:04:45] lights you might think but but there's
[1:04:47] got to be at least one brother
[1:04:51] Daniel zero none
[1:04:55] two million people in a congested
[1:05:00] City the traffic moves Bumper to Bumper
[1:05:03] crawling around each
[1:05:10] other and there's no guidance from
[1:05:14] hardly any police
[1:05:19] anywhere and that's the way the traffic
[1:05:22] all day long is moving
[1:05:28] but not very
[1:05:29] fast too fast to be so
[1:05:35] close but it's not really moving very
[1:05:39] quickly brazaville Congo brazaville
[1:05:42] Congo it's almost a um a country in
[1:05:46] Anarchy in the
[1:05:53] traffic
[1:05:56] anarch and but by the grace of
[1:06:00] God there is people
[1:06:04] there believing the same word that you
[1:06:09] believe outside of being a believer in
[1:06:13] Congo I can't I can't see how the people
[1:06:16] there have any hope at
[1:06:20] all to to ever be able to leave the
[1:06:23] country country and live a better
[1:06:28] life because the nation itself makes no
[1:06:31] opportunity for the people
[1:06:37] whatsoever so it's a difficult place to
[1:06:43] live and even as I share this with
[1:06:47] you I cannot
[1:06:50] emphasize the poverty of this people
[1:06:54] of Congo and how they live on a daily
[1:07:01] basis where as you go down the
[1:07:05] streets like
[1:07:07] Mexico every door you see is somebody's
[1:07:10] little somebody's little
[1:07:13] shop and in front of every shop on the
[1:07:22] sidewalks uh our people sitting down
[1:07:26] with a little pile of things that
[1:07:28] they're
[1:07:32] selling and the brother the Brother
[1:07:36] David Caba as we're traveling in the
[1:07:41] street I tell them there's so many
[1:07:43] Street
[1:07:48] vendors no
[1:07:50] vendor many people Street vendors on the
[1:07:53] the
[1:07:58] streets and the Brother David says if
[1:08:00] you'll
[1:08:03] notice everything they're
[1:08:06] selling is
[1:08:08] used nothing is
[1:08:12] new from the shoes to the
[1:08:16] toys to a blanket to a pillow to
[1:08:20] a everything is used second
[1:08:25] nothing is news nothing is
[1:08:28] new and as I started focusing more and
[1:08:30] watching it I so
[1:08:35] wowow and yet in the city of
[1:08:38] brazaville there shines a
[1:08:41] light and there's great
[1:08:43] hope there's a people to whom this word
[1:08:48] of God has been
[1:08:51] revealed there's a people who have made
[1:08:53] made the Bible their
[1:08:58] book and have received Jesus Christ as
[1:09:00] their personal
[1:09:02] savior so in the midst of all the
[1:09:07] poverty these are the ones whose smile
[1:09:10] is shining the
[1:09:15] brightest these are the ones that when
[1:09:17] you shake their hands they give you a an
[1:09:22] embrace
[1:09:24] these are the ones in Congo who have
[1:09:26] great
[1:09:30] hope because Jesus Christ has given them
[1:09:32] great
[1:09:35] hope they really do live by
[1:09:40] faith and not by
[1:09:43] sight some of us might have older
[1:09:48] cars and we think wow sometime I need a
[1:09:51] better nicer car
[1:09:55] and we say I'm going to believe my
[1:09:57] faith and then circumstances
[1:10:01] unfold and an opportunity comes
[1:10:04] up and we get a nicer
[1:10:09] car most of the brethren in
[1:10:14] Congo they will never have a
[1:10:17] car not even an old
[1:10:20] car not even a broken down car
[1:10:25] they will not be able to ever afford any
[1:10:28] kind of
[1:10:33] car the
[1:10:36] city um is full of the the city moves by
[1:10:43] taxi and uh they're all painted the same
[1:10:47] color by government
[1:10:51] mandate but they're all independently
[1:10:53] owned
[1:10:55] owned there are more taxis on the street
[1:10:59] of
[1:11:01] brazille then there are independent
[1:11:03] vehicles that you see
[1:11:07] driving because that's the
[1:11:10] transportation of the Common
[1:11:14] People one congol Le
[1:11:19] dollar or let me say it takes over 600
[1:11:23] Congo
[1:11:28] dollars to make one American
[1:11:35] dollar so the chances of a average
[1:11:39] congol conges
[1:11:42] citizen so the
[1:11:46] chances to travel outside of
[1:11:51] Congo is almost a miracle for each one
[1:11:54] if they can even get
[1:11:58] out so with all that
[1:12:02] said I invite you to put on your prayer
[1:12:08] list the brother the Brethren of
[1:12:11] Congo they are they are building a new
[1:12:17] church they are
[1:12:22] building
[1:12:24] they are
[1:12:27] building and uh that they hope to finish
[1:12:30] by the end of next
[1:12:34] year so of course they have invited us
[1:12:37] to go
[1:12:39] back and I said I will surely
[1:12:44] pray as you know you've experienced
[1:12:47] yourself once you arrive
[1:12:52] somewhere and you're in the presence of
[1:12:55] God's people and his
[1:12:58] children well it's a wonderful
[1:13:02] experience but the thought of how long
[1:13:04] it'll take me to get
[1:13:09] there is is the part we think
[1:13:13] about so we did meet with uh other
[1:13:15] brothers and

[1:13:51] trip but it's not a three-hour trip trip
[1:13:55] either so the the traveling is is
[1:14:00] heavy but of course arriving and being
[1:14:03] with the Saints and seeing what God is
[1:14:04] doing around the
[1:14:09] world it inspires
[1:14:12] us that there is a Revival taking
[1:14:17] place amongst a little
[1:14:20] flock called The Bride of Jesus Christ

[1:17:14] stature of a perfect man in Jesus
[1:17:18] Christ but I will say
[1:17:21] this for the time being
[1:17:26] for the time
[1:17:28] being you can all
[1:17:32] say it sure is
[1:17:35] good to be in the
[1:17:39] USA troubles will
[1:17:42] come a Great Tribulation will change the
[1:17:44] United States and turn it into uh a a
[1:17:49] country destroyed by
[1:17:52] War
[1:17:57] but
[1:17:58] meanwhile I want to tell
[1:18:00] you it's good to
[1:18:03] be in the
[1:18:06] USA stand to your
[1:18:14] feet we bring greetings from Brother
[1:18:19] Rafel the other ministers and
[1:18:21] pastors
[1:18:23] sending their greetings to all of
[1:18:27] you and uh we invited a couple of them
[1:18:31] to come
[1:18:34] here we we'll see if that if that
[1:18:37] happens in the
[1:18:40] future it's uh it's it's uh difficult
[1:18:44] for them also to
[1:18:47] travel uh even as it is for
[1:18:51] us but should one of the brothers
[1:18:57] come I'm sure it would be a blessing for
[1:18:59] all of us
[1:19:02] here so this
[1:19:04] morning in the light of what we see
[1:19:08] happening I'm sure you've all read the
[1:19:14] news Israel has declared
[1:19:18] war on this group called
[1:19:21] Hamas
[1:19:23] they they're they're within the
[1:19:25] boundaries of the land of
[1:19:29] Israel so you you have you of course you
[1:19:32] know that when Israel goes to
[1:19:37] war All Nations go to war with
[1:19:41] her be because Hamas has allies on the
[1:19:45] Arab
[1:19:48] countries allies and they Supply them
[1:19:51] with bombs and
[1:19:54] and guns and
[1:19:57] weapons and and Israel has allies on the
[1:20:00] other
[1:20:03] side and even the US supplies them with
[1:20:06] bombs and weapons and nuclear
[1:20:13] weapons when Wars like this
[1:20:18] begin everybody begins taking
[1:20:21] sides
[1:20:26] according to what's going to benefit
[1:20:28] them as a
[1:20:31] nation so not everyone who is an ally
[1:20:34] with
[1:20:36] Israel are friends with
[1:20:39] Israel not everyone who is allied with
[1:20:42] Hamas and the
[1:20:46] Palestinians are truly friends of Hamas
[1:20:49] and the
[1:20:51] Palestinians but at the the moment it
[1:20:53] benefits
[1:20:55] them to take sides with one or the
[1:20:59] other and that's what we'd like to speak
[1:21:01] on this
[1:21:04] morning For Whom Shall I
[1:21:08] fight and what shall be the weapons of
[1:21:11] my
[1:21:16] Warfare correct Matthew chapter
[1:21:20] 6 we'll begin reading
[1:21:23] and in verse
[1:21:27] One For Whom Shall I
[1:21:30] fight and what shall be the
[1:21:33] weapons of my
[1:21:37] Warfare Matthew 6
[1:21:40] verse1 it it reads like
[1:21:43] this take heed that you do not your arms
[1:21:46] before men to be seen of
[1:21:51] them
[1:21:53] otherwise you have no reward of your
[1:21:56] father which is in
[1:22:04] heaven verse six we'll go
[1:22:07] to he said but when thou prayest enter
[1:22:10] into thy closet and when thou has shut
[1:22:13] thy door pray to the
[1:22:21] father if you'll
[1:22:24] remember brother brandham had a
[1:22:27] vision of this great tent
[1:22:31] meeting of a
[1:22:33] great tent
[1:22:37] meeting
[1:22:40] tent and uh in in this tent meeting he
[1:22:44] he had told us that the vision had come
[1:22:45] to
[1:22:51] pass
[1:22:54] that that that this Vision came to pass
[1:22:56] in the in in the healing campaigns in
[1:22:59] Mexico
[1:23:04] City but in this
[1:23:06] Vision off to the side he saw this
[1:23:09] little
[1:23:12] room and in this little room he saw a
[1:23:17] woman walk
[1:23:19] in by
[1:23:21] herself
[1:23:23] and she came out on the other
[1:23:25] side completely
[1:23:27] healed then he saw a man go in I believe
[1:23:30] that was in a
[1:23:37] wheelchair and when he came
[1:23:40] out he came out
[1:23:42] walking and in the vision the Holy
[1:23:45] Spirit told him I'll meet you in that
[1:23:51] room
[1:23:54] and and brother Bram in the vision he
[1:23:56] said he asked the angel what was that
[1:23:58] little
[1:24:03] room and the angel took him to the
[1:24:06] scriptures in Matthew 6
[1:24:11] and6 and he says don't you remember this
[1:24:15] verse he says but when thou prayest
[1:24:18] enter into thy closet and when thou H
[1:24:21] has shut thy door pray to the
[1:24:29] father there was coming a
[1:24:32] time and now is that
[1:24:35] time when it'll take a person when it's
[1:24:37] going to be a personal experience with
[1:24:39] Jesus
[1:24:43] Christ we love to gather together as as
[1:24:46] a group and we
[1:24:51] should and I'll share the word with you
[1:24:54] as best as I
[1:24:58] can and you'll realize that maybe
[1:25:01] brother Daniel repeats himself a lot
[1:25:05] sometimes and and that is a true
[1:25:09] statement sometimes it's very much on
[1:25:15] purpose because as I repeat one certain
[1:25:20] point I'm hoping you can take it to the
[1:25:25] scriptures and enter into your prayer
[1:25:30] closet because I know it's
[1:25:33] there that God can even open more to
[1:25:38] you I can try to give you
[1:25:42] more but if you surrender to
[1:25:45] him and
[1:25:47] prayer in your prayer
[1:25:49] closet he won't try if you surrender
[1:25:54] he will do it he will Open the Eyes of
[1:25:57] your
[1:25:58] understanding he will soften your heart
[1:26:01] with
[1:26:03] oil Matthew 6 and verse 9
[1:26:06] now after this manner therefore pray ye
[1:26:11] Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed
[1:26:13] be thy
[1:26:20] name let's pray Heavenly
[1:26:23] Father you're the Lamb of
[1:26:26] God are the only one that can open this
[1:26:30] book for for this new
[1:26:33] testament this New Testament
[1:26:37] is this is the Lamb's Book of
[1:26:40] Life for you the lamb are the one that
[1:26:43] spoke it in
[1:26:46] Parables this is your book and you alone
[1:26:50] Can Open the Eyes of understanding
[1:26:54] go from bench to
[1:26:57] bench go from heart to
[1:27:00] heart and you Open the Eyes of our
[1:27:04] understanding in Jesus name amen am you
[1:27:08] may be
[1:27:11] seated these are the
[1:27:15] weapons of our
[1:27:17] Warfare this is really a battle
[1:27:21] prayer
[1:27:23] at the
[1:27:24] opening of the
[1:27:26] word the first seal
[1:27:31] loosed don't let the term first seal
[1:27:34] trouble
[1:27:40] you it's just the way God HD his Plan of
[1:27:48] Redemption you can also think of this
[1:27:50] first seal
[1:27:54] of Revelation
[1:27:56] 61 as part
[1:27:58] one as part
[1:28:01] one as of a
[1:28:04] plan to restore
[1:28:07] you to bring you a born again
[1:28:10] experience to help you to become
[1:28:13] justified by
[1:28:17] faith to sanctify You by his
[1:28:21] spirit to baptize you with the Holy
[1:28:24] Ghost and
[1:28:26] Fire you realize that's the first
[1:28:29] seal you realize that that was that was
[1:28:33] part
[1:28:35] one you realize that these are the
[1:28:37] Mysteries hidden in the Lamb's Book of
[1:28:42] Life this new
[1:28:44] testament this is the Lamb's
[1:28:47] Book and it's a book of life is it
[1:28:51] not
[1:28:53] in in
[1:28:55] Matthew verse 9 chapter 6
[1:28:58] ver9 it says after this manner therefore
[1:29:01] pray ye Our Father which art in heaven
[1:29:04] Hallowed be thy
[1:29:11] name and the name hadn't been revealed
[1:29:15] yet but but in
[1:29:18] Parables he was already speaking it
[1:29:22] that there would come a new name of
[1:29:25] God it wouldn't be Jehovah no
[1:29:29] more it wouldn't be yahi no
[1:29:32] more it wouldn't be just Adonai no
[1:29:36] more a new name was
[1:29:39] coming you know how offensive that was
[1:29:42] to
[1:29:44] Israel that was
[1:29:47] blasphemy but not to those to whom it
[1:29:50] was being revealed
[1:29:53] they saw the life of the
[1:29:56] man they saw his him as an evangelist
[1:29:59] praying for the
[1:30:02] sick they saw Jesus heal
[1:30:07] thousands they saw Jesus raise the
[1:30:12] dead they saw Jesus open the blinded
[1:30:16] eyes they saw Jesus healed the
[1:30:23] they saw Jesus cleanse the
[1:30:28] lepers and when they saw it and it and
[1:30:30] the Miracles caught their
[1:30:34] attention they said well if this is what
[1:30:37] he's
[1:30:39] doing I want to listen to his message
[1:30:42] what he's
[1:30:45] saying that's why there was a great
[1:30:47] healing
[1:30:49] campaign at the beginning at the first
[1:30:52] coming of Christ in the ministry of
[1:30:55] Jesus of
[1:30:58] Nazareth no man ever spoke like
[1:31:03] him or did the Miracles he
[1:31:09] did
[1:31:11] Matthew verse
[1:31:13] 10 thy kingdom come thy will be done in
[1:31:16] earth as it is in
[1:31:20] heaven
[1:31:22] give us this day our daily
[1:31:27] bread forgive us our depths as we
[1:31:30] forgive our
[1:31:36] deor and lead us not into
[1:31:40] temptation but Deliver Us from
[1:31:43] Evil for thine is the
[1:31:46] kingdom and the power and the glory
[1:31:50] forever
[1:31:52] amen amen verse
[1:31:56] 14 if ye forgive men their
[1:32:01] trespasses your heavenly father will
[1:32:04] also forgive
[1:32:07] you when Jesus came to
[1:32:11] Israel Israel was under the
[1:32:17] law but they were not fulfilling the
[1:32:20] law they were not abiding by the
[1:32:24] law they were not worshippers of Jehovah
[1:32:26] no
[1:32:28] more the synagogue had become a den of
[1:32:34] Thieves it was no longer a house of
[1:32:38] prayer that was the condition of the
[1:32:40] Jewish church when Jesus
[1:32:44] came they were in
[1:32:48] bondage they were in slavery
[1:32:52] the Romans had controlled everything in
[1:32:55] their
[1:32:56] day they were the world
[1:33:01] leaders they they ruled over Israel with
[1:33:03] an iron
[1:33:13] fist it was a it was a great civil
[1:33:20] war
[1:33:22] the world was at
[1:33:25] War and Rome controlled
[1:33:30] everything Rome a pagan Nation Roma ROM
[1:33:35] pagana but the Jewish
[1:33:41] leadership were as Pagan as the Romans
[1:33:46] themselves Rome held Israel in bondage
[1:33:56] and and the high priest and the Jewish
[1:34:03] priesthood held the people of Israel in
[1:34:06] a religious
[1:34:12] slavery
[1:34:18] see so the condition of the world when
[1:34:21] Jesus
[1:34:24] came was a condition of
[1:34:29] war a condition of
[1:34:33] slavery a condition with little
[1:34:40] hope and Jesus came with this
[1:34:47] prayer he said in verse
[1:34:50] 13
[1:34:52] and lead us not into
[1:34:57] temptation but Deliver Us from
[1:35:00] Evil for thine is the kingdom and the
[1:35:03] power and the glory
[1:35:08] forever and then he says to the people
[1:35:10] of
[1:35:12] Israel who are in
[1:35:15] slavery whose families are being killed
[1:35:18] off and young
[1:35:20] men
[1:35:22] whose children are being taken by the
[1:35:25] Romans to be slaves in the homes of
[1:35:27] Roman
[1:35:31] leaders and in the midst of this
[1:35:34] horrible environment that the world is
[1:35:41] in he tells
[1:35:44] Israel if ye for if ye forgive men their
[1:35:50] trespasses
[1:35:53] your heavenly father will also forgive
[1:35:58] you and the Jew and the Jewish people
[1:36:02] say forgive
[1:36:05] Rome Fort taking our
[1:36:08] land for killing our
[1:36:11] fathers for killing our
[1:36:14] grandparents for killing our
[1:36:16] children for you're talking about
[1:36:20] forgiveness then will be
[1:36:23] forgiven we have nothing to forgive them
[1:36:27] for we want their
[1:36:31] death Israel and all the people of that
[1:36:37] time listen to verse
[1:36:41] 15 but if you forgive not men their
[1:36:43] trespasses neither will your father
[1:36:46] forgive your
[1:36:50] trespasses
[1:36:53] and Jesus was saying
[1:36:55] it in a
[1:36:57] time when Israel was in
[1:37:02] bondage to a pagan
[1:37:09] Nation who
[1:37:11] daily abused
[1:37:14] them who daily killed
[1:37:18] them and Jesus presents this
[1:37:23] prayer to the people of
[1:37:28] Israel you think they received
[1:37:32] it you think Israel received
[1:37:36] it they wanted
[1:37:40] Vengeance they wanted
[1:37:44] blood they wanted back their
[1:37:48] land and humanly speaking it all all
[1:37:51] sounds like that's the right
[1:37:58] thing God gave Abraham this land and to
[1:38:02] his people This Is Our
[1:38:06] [Music]
[1:38:08] Land and then Jesus comes and tells
[1:38:12] them you've got the wrong
[1:38:15] attitude in order to get back the
[1:38:20] land
[1:38:22] no the way you you'll get it
[1:38:26] back is when you can forgive men their
[1:38:31] trespasses and then on top of asking
[1:38:34] them to
[1:38:37] forgive he challenges them and tells
[1:38:40] them in verse 15 but if ye forgive not
[1:38:46] men their
[1:38:49] trespasses neither will your father
[1:38:51] forgive your
[1:38:55] trespasses it's a prayer that's with us
[1:38:58] yet
[1:39:00] today it wasn't just for
[1:39:03] Israel it was for you as a husband to
[1:39:07] your
[1:39:10] wife it was for
[1:39:13] you as a wife to her
[1:39:16] husband this is your
[1:39:18] prayer this is how you overcome
[1:39:22] any Civil Wars happening in the
[1:39:27] home the Bible says you're in a civil
[1:39:29] war at
[1:39:32] home father mother son
[1:39:37] daughter how do you handle
[1:39:39] it the human nature tells
[1:39:43] us I know how to handle
[1:39:46] it Fight Fire with Fire have you heard
[1:39:49] that
[1:39:50] one
[1:39:53] if you've never been born
[1:39:56] again that's your
[1:39:59] approach but if you've been born
[1:40:01] again you
[1:40:03] realize how to
[1:40:06] overcome how to win this
[1:40:09] battle and it says if you forgive men
[1:40:12] their
[1:40:17] trespasses if you forgive men their
[1:40:19] trespasses your heavenly father will
[1:40:21] also forgive
[1:40:30] you and if you can dare to
[1:40:33] say I don't need them to forgive
[1:40:37] me you you just proclaimed with your own
[1:40:44] words that you
[1:40:46] need to
[1:40:49] forgive and then you'll will be
[1:40:53] forgiven in
[1:40:56] Wars you do not forgive men their
[1:41:01] trespasses that's why Wars are
[1:41:05] fought Nations declare
[1:41:09] Wars as they have even in our day
[1:41:12] today because a trespass will not be
[1:41:17] forgiven Civil Wars
[1:41:19] arise
[1:41:22] world wars have have
[1:41:27] risen because a
[1:41:32] trass because a trespass would not and
[1:41:35] could not be
[1:41:37] [Music]

[1:42:52] war and civil
[1:42:57] unrest that Jesus said
[1:43:00] this Matthew
[1:43:03] 6:14 for if you forgive men their
[1:43:05] trespasses your heavenly father will
[1:43:08] also forgive
[1:43:18] you if ye forget if ye forgive men their
[1:43:25] trespasses it isn't uh well I didn't
[1:43:29] like what he said I it kind of sounded
[1:43:31] like he was saying something about me
[1:43:33] that wasn't too nice oh
[1:43:40] was no here Jesus is
[1:43:44] saying that man that woman has you has
[1:43:47] absolutely said something terrible about
[1:43:50] you
[1:43:53] then he tells
[1:43:54] us but if you can forgive
[1:43:57] them your heavenly
[1:44:00] father will also forgive
[1:44:03] you because we all cross the line

[1:53:20] don't you think Israel should do this
[1:53:22] and the Palestinians do that
[1:53:26] and when they see that you're not too
[1:53:30] excited don't you even care that people
[1:53:33] are
[1:53:35] dying what they're asking you
[1:53:37] for is to take
[1:53:40] sides and and and say yes it should be
[1:53:43] an eye for an
[1:53:48] eye so who should should

[1:54:04] baby or a Palestinian
[1:54:08] baby

[1:54:14] dying because the world is in a spirit
[1:54:16] of
[1:54:18] War

[1:54:22] of the
[1:54:26] world and Hollywood producers anointed
[1:54:29] from the pits of
[1:54:39] hell and Lucifer leading us all down

[1:56:48] thing an old
[1:56:50] woman somebody's
[1:56:54] Grandma feeding on the most vulgar thing
[1:56:57] you could
[1:57:02] imagine Satan preparing the
[1:57:06] hearts for
[1:57:11] Destruction the spirit of this last
[1:57:14] day you have to be in the spirit of
[1:57:18] War before you can have
[1:57:20] War you have to be in the spirit of
[1:57:24] War to take a definite side with one or
[1:57:27] the
[1:57:30] other you say well shouldn't we take
[1:57:33] sides with Israel brother
[1:57:37] [Music]
[1:57:38] Daniel the government of
[1:57:41] Israel Are pagan ungodly
[1:57:47] leaders just like the leaders of
[1:57:51] America but yes there's a little remnant
[1:57:54] of Jews in
[1:57:58] Israel who are praying waiting for
[1:58:00] messiah to
[1:58:03] return like here in
[1:58:05] America there's a little flock a little
[1:58:08] remnant of
[1:58:11] Believers for Waiting on Jesus to come
[1:58:14] back and take us
[1:58:17] home but the nation
[1:58:20] both anointed of
[1:58:22] Lucifer are at war with each
[1:58:26] other Lucifer Luci can bring two enemies
[1:58:34] together to fulfill his
[1:58:37] purpose he did it in the days of
[1:58:40] Jesus Lucifer anointed the high priest
[1:58:44] of
[1:58:47] Israel Lucifer anointed the leaders of
[1:58:51] [Music]
[1:58:53] Rome to come
[1:58:56] together and
[1:58:58] crucify Jesus Christ they were
[1:59:02] enemies but they worked
[1:59:04] together to put him on the
[1:59:07] cross or they thought they were working
[1:59:12] together we know it was the great plan
[1:59:14] of
[1:59:16] God we know it was the beginning
[1:59:20] of a New
[1:59:21] Covenant we know it was the
[1:59:25] beginning of everlasting
[1:59:32] peace you see in the beginning and
[1:59:38] Eden Mary received the
[1:59:43] seed that Eve should have t
[1:59:48] received right do you see
[1:59:52] it Mary received the spoken word seed of
[2:00:00] God placed in her
[2:00:04] womb had nothing to do with the sexual
[2:00:07] desire of a man or a
[2:00:12] woman she became an incubator for this
[2:00:17] seed she was fertile ground for this
[2:00:21] seed and this seed was the Son of
[2:00:25] God the beginning of a new
[2:00:30] creation that's the seed that Eve
[2:00:40] forfeited instead she said she took the
[2:00:45] shortcut because the devil con convinced
[2:00:48] her
[2:00:50] I have a shortcut for
[2:00:52] you he says how long has God been
[2:00:55] training you and atam
[2:01:00] up and how long will it be till he
[2:01:03] brings his promise to pass in your
[2:01:07] heart she says I don't know he says well
[2:01:11] let me tell you
[2:01:13] something I can make it happen for you
[2:01:16] right now no more waiting
[2:01:23] it was a lie of the devil it brought the
[2:01:26] fall of
[2:01:31] mankind and for 4,000
[2:01:34] years men and women are at
[2:01:38] War children are
[2:01:41] dying of all the
[2:01:45] world and then one day for 4,000 years
[2:01:50] later then Jesus came the Prince of
[2:01:56] Peace who wants to teach you how to
[2:01:58] think
[2:02:01] differently because if you let
[2:02:04] Satan anoint
[2:02:07] you in this Spirit of
[2:02:10] War you're going to have more
[2:02:13] problems with your children you let
[2:02:17] Satan anoints you to take
[2:02:22] sides in the spirit of War you're going
[2:02:25] to have more problems in
[2:02:28] your if you let Satan anoint you with
[2:02:31] the spirit of
[2:02:33] War you're going to have more problems
[2:02:35] in your
[2:02:38] job but if we can be born
[2:02:42] again receive the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:46] G receive the prince of
[2:02:52] peace and not the prince of
[2:02:59] predition the one who is the way the
[2:03:01] truth and the
[2:03:05] life not the one whose name is
[2:03:09] death riding a Pale
[2:03:13] Horse and he is riding
[2:03:17] already the pale horse rider began in
[2:03:20] the Days of
[2:03:24] Elijah this end
[2:03:26] time as the white horse
[2:03:29] rider also began in the Days of
[2:03:33] Elijah that was John the
[2:03:37] Baptist the spirit of this last
[2:03:41] day you have to be in the spirit of
[2:03:44] War before you can have
[2:03:47] War
[2:03:51] why do you
[2:03:52] think the most popular Hollywood
[2:03:59] movies internet video
[2:04:03] games rock and roll rock roll country
[2:04:09] music country you listen to the lyrics
[2:04:13] even of some of it sounds so
[2:04:17] nice
[2:04:21] and as nice as some of them
[2:04:25] sound they're pushing you into the
[2:04:27] spirit of
[2:04:29] War they're pushing you to take sides
[2:04:32] with somebody on this planet
[2:04:38] Earth don't do it take sides with
[2:04:42] Jesus with the Prince of
[2:04:47] Peace
[2:04:50] the music of this
[2:04:52] world all about
[2:04:55] killings it's anointing the
[2:04:58] world for a great
[2:05:01] Destruction for a Great
[2:05:04] Tribulation in the spirit of
[2:05:06] War you will not forgive the nation its

[2:05:21] trespass in the spirit of War you will
[2:05:24] not forgive your
[2:05:27] spouse or or his or her

[2:05:57] individual or their very own
[2:06:01] government that they will say they
[2:06:03] cannot forgive

[2:06:13] sword shall die by the
[2:06:16] sword whether it's a husband and wife in
[2:06:19] the
[2:06:21] home or or two
[2:06:24] Nations we cannot live by the
[2:06:30] sword unless it be the sword of
[2:06:33] God unless it be the word of
[2:06:36] God because that sword is a double-edged
[2:06:42] sword and that sword speaks better
[2:06:46] things that sword say says if you
[2:06:49] forgive I'll forgive

[2:11:44] there I didn't ask to be trained to be a
[2:11:47] killer
[2:11:51] but I got caught up in the spirit of
[2:11:58] War instead of getting caught
[2:12:02] up in the spirit of
[2:12:04] Christ The Prince of
[2:12:06] Peace Matthew 4 and
[2:12:12] ver8 again the devil taketh him up into
[2:12:15] an exceeding high mountain showeth him
[2:12:18] all the kingdoms of the world and the
[2:12:20] glory of
[2:12:29] them that's what the military does to
[2:12:32] our young
[2:12:37] people that's how they recruit
[2:12:40] them to be to be an Army
[2:12:46] Ranger to be in the army
[2:12:49] to be a Navy
[2:12:52] SEAL to be a a secret service Delta
[2:12:57] offensive
[2:12:59] unit all Special Forces of all the Armed
[2:13:04] Forces all Special
[2:13:10] Forces they tell them of the glory what
[2:13:12] it is to be a super warrior in this
[2:13:16] day
[2:13:23] and
[2:13:24] yet they're just training
[2:13:27] you to be an
[2:13:30] assassin for Joe
[2:13:32] Biden to be an
[2:13:35] assassin for Nancy
[2:13:38] Pelosi to be an
[2:13:40] assassin for congressmen and
[2:13:45] Senators so while you're off killing and
[2:13:48] being
[2:13:51] killed they're sitting with a suit
[2:13:53] behind a
[2:13:57] desk doing an interview on NBC or
[2:14:04] ABC all dressed up
[2:14:08] nice saying we're glad to
[2:14:12] say happy to say that America is winning
[2:14:17] this war
[2:14:23] and a little mother somewhere
[2:14:26] says if we're winning this
[2:14:29] war why is it my son's
[2:14:32] dead and we couldn't even recover his
[2:14:39] body to be at
[2:14:42] War you must be in the spirit of
[2:14:46] War to be at peace
[2:14:50] you need the spirit of
[2:14:52] peace that's the Prince of
[2:14:55] Peace that's a born again
[2:14:59] experience why would young men in this
[2:15:04] message why would they sign
[2:15:09] up to get involved in the armed
[2:15:11] forces
[2:15:15] voluntarily because they don't Rel
[2:15:19] what they've been feeding
[2:15:22] on is the spirit of
[2:15:26] War they don't see
[2:15:28] it they need a
[2:15:31] revelation they need a born again
[2:15:36] experience you say but there's such nice
[2:15:38] young
[2:15:41] men but they haven't been born
[2:15:45] again and they've been feeding on the
[2:15:47] wrong
[2:15:52] message verse 9 of Matthew
[2:15:56] 4 and saith unto him all these things
[2:15:59] will I give you young man if thou will
[2:16:01] fall down and worship
[2:16:08] me you relies on Mount
[2:16:13] Temptation that
[2:16:15] Lucifer was trying to entice a young
[2:16:22] man he was just 30 years old
[2:16:27] 29 he's trying to bring this young man
[2:16:33] down but he didn't know who he was
[2:16:35] talking
[2:16:37] to he said and verse n and saith unto
[2:16:40] him all these things will I give you if
[2:16:43] you will fall down and worship
[2:16:46] me
[2:16:50] this is the
[2:16:51] answer when as a young man you're being
[2:16:54] enticed to do
[2:16:59] something and someone's showing you how
[2:17:01] glorious it's going to
[2:17:05] be this is your
[2:17:07] answer then said Jesus unto him get the
[2:17:10] H Satan for it is written Thou shalt
[2:17:13] Worship the Lord thy God and him only
[2:17:16] shalt thou serve and
[2:17:25] so if you fight for your nation
[2:17:29] today any
[2:17:31] Nation who are you really fighting
[2:17:34] for the Devil
[2:17:38] Himself do I
[2:17:41] justify all the lives that are being
[2:17:46] killed no no
[2:17:48] but there won't be peace on
[2:17:52] Earth until sin is is cleansed from the
[2:17:56] face of the
[2:17:58] Earth the question
[2:18:01] today of world
[2:18:04] peace is it coming by
[2:18:07] politics is it going to come by the
[2:18:09] United
[2:18:10] Nations he said I say
[2:18:13] no it's always
[2:18:16] failed and it will again and
[2:18:20] again but there remains a true answer to
[2:18:23] the
[2:18:25] question will there be peace on the
[2:18:30] earth yes When
[2:18:33] sin is ridden off the
[2:18:37] Earth there will be peace but not until
[2:18:41] that
[2:18:43] time there will be no peace Nation will
[2:18:46] rise against na
[2:18:48] Nation Kingdom against
[2:18:51] Kingdom but God gave a remedy for
[2:18:55] sin listen close now God gave the remedy
[2:18:59] to rid sin off the
[2:19:10] Earth but but men of the
[2:19:13] Earth won't accept God's remedy
[2:19:21] you say brother
[2:19:23] Daniel what is the
[2:19:26] remedy he must be born
[2:19:33] again you must be born
[2:19:38] again of the spirit of
[2:19:42] Christ then you will find
[2:19:46] peace
[2:19:47] but it's not for
[2:19:51] all but because you're here this
[2:19:55] morning I want to believe it's for
[2:19:57] you I want to believe it's for
[2:20:00] me I want to believe it's for our
