[50:55] one
[51:06] for we know that if our Earthly House of
[51:08] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[51:10] building of God and house not made with
[51:12] hands Eternal in the
[51:19] heavens for in this we grown earnestly
[51:22] Desiring to be clothed upon with our
[51:24] house which is from heaven
[51:29] if so be that being clothed we shall not
[51:31] be found
[51:33] naked Paul is speaking
[51:37] here he's saying that we're going to be
[51:42] clothed he's speaking of something
[51:46] Supernatural he's speaking of a house

[52:11] four for we that are in this Tabernacle
[52:14] do grown being
[52:19] burdened not not for that we be
[52:23] unclothed but clothed upon
[52:28] that mortality might be swallowed up of
[52:32] Life Paul speaks
[52:36] here distinction between the natural and
[52:39] the
[52:44] superal for we that are in this
[52:46] Tabernacle do grown being
[52:49] burdened not for that we be
[52:52] unclothed he's speaking of a natural man
[52:55] but look what he say
[52:58] but clothed
[53:01] upon that mortality might be swallowed
[53:04] up of
[53:06] life doing the
[53:08] distin in these four
[53:12] verses I'm not speaking of the
[53:19] natural I'm speaking of is what's going
[53:21] to cover the natural is the
[53:25] supernatural a house a house made from
[53:29] God verse
[53:35] five now he that hath wrought us for the
[53:38] selfsame thing is God who also hath
[53:41] given unto us the earnest of the
[53:46] spirit Lord add His blessings this
[53:49] morning let's
[53:51] pray Heavenly Father we give you thanks
[53:55] again bless your uh sons and your
[53:58] daughters this
[54:03] morning each one that would hear by um
[54:07] the
[54:09] recording and the Lord bless all amen
[54:12] amen you can have your
[54:19] seats we're going to be reading some
[54:22] quotes this
[54:25] morning and some we've already read last
[54:27] uh
[54:31] service and some are going to be that we
[54:33] have we haven't
[54:38] read let's begin with the first
[54:45] quote and the teaching of
[54:48] Hebrews
[54:55] Hebrews
[55:02] okay and it says like
[55:06] this and paragraph
[55:10] 128 and now when these great lights went
[55:14] out or great rays of
[55:17] spirit love
[55:19] peace that's all there
[55:22] was there wasn't no suffering
[55:25] there there was no
[55:27] hate No
[55:30] Malice it had to come from this
[55:33] fountain that was
[55:35] Jehovah Jehovah
[55:38] God and now the theologians call
[55:40] it a
[55:43] theop that went from
[55:49] that which was called in the scripture
[55:51] the
[55:53] logos that logos that went out from God
[55:57] it's hard to
[55:58] explain but it was part of
[56:02] God now here's what happened well I'm
[56:07] going to jump forward a little bit okay
[56:08] it is this this great
[56:12] spirit now this great spirit began to
[56:15] form in the
[56:18] creation and the logos that came out
[56:20] from there it was the son of
[56:25] God was the only visible spirit that was
[56:30] seen and that was a
[56:33] theophany which means a
[56:38] body and the body was like a
[56:43] man we can we can listen to a lot of
[56:49] theologians and some say that
[56:54] theophany it was all a manifestation of
[56:58] God the pillar of
[57:03] fire that
[57:07] appeared and all of these things they
[57:09] call a
[57:10] theophany but the
[57:12] prophets and he made it more like
[57:16] singular he said a
[57:18] theophany means a
[57:21] body and the body was like a
[57:25] man speaking of the theophany of
[57:29] God and God has had many distinct
[57:35] manifestations of the valley the L of
[57:37] the
[57:38] valley the rose of
[57:42] Sharon the pillar of
[57:47] fire the cloud that appeared in
[57:53] Israel God has had many distinct
[57:58] and but God also has a body a
[58:03] theophany and he said this
[58:06] Theon it means a
[58:09] body and the and the body was like a
[58:13] man now the theophany of God is like a
[58:18] man it's not like an angel
[58:21] with even though God had that
[58:25] manifestation
[58:27] and even though it has manifested like a
[58:30] like a angel with wings with
[58:34] wings but the the body
[58:37] of the theophany of God the prophet said
[58:42] it was like a
[58:46] man Moses saw it when it passed through
[58:48] the Rock by The
[58:50] Rock and he looked at it and he looked
[58:55] at
[58:58] and he said it looked like the H part of
[58:59] a
[59:01] man and he said that same type of
[59:04] body that we received when we
[59:09] died that's when when us when we
[59:14] die the the type that Moses saw a
[59:20] man it's the same type that every
[59:22] Christian will have every son or
[59:24] daughter of God
[59:27] now the scripture
[59:30] continues and the quote where Paul
[59:38] speaks and when this Tabernacle appears
[59:43] be dissolved I'm sorry be is dissolved

[1:01:23] was the um
[1:01:28] you're reading the quot
[1:01:31] okay 130 about the middle of the
[1:01:34] paragraph Moses saw it when it passed

[1:02:33] here when this same Tabernacle uh
[1:02:37] ends we already have one awaiting us
[1:02:40] that's what it
[1:02:44] is and that was the same theophany that
[1:02:46] was the son of
[1:02:48] God that same son the same
[1:02:52] logos was made
[1:02:54] flesh
[1:02:58] the same way we were made in
[1:03:00] flesh and the theophany the
[1:03:04] logos that was made in
[1:03:11] flesh and simply it was the
[1:03:16] place the location habitation habitation
[1:03:18] I'm
[1:03:23] sorry because the fountain uh the
[1:03:26] complete Fountain was in him can you see
[1:03:36] it and the in the sermon the
[1:03:49] breach
[1:03:52] 64
[1:03:53] 63 okay the brid breach right here 63
[1:03:57] the breach begins with just as
[1:04:02] John it'll say 74 next to it and 42 okay
[1:04:06] I got
[1:04:10] it so just as John was given his
[1:04:15] message the same time that Messiah come
[1:04:18] in the
[1:04:20] days John knew he would see
[1:04:24] him because he was going to to introduce
[1:04:29] him and we realize that in the
[1:04:31] scriptures over in Malachi
[1:04:34] 4 and there's going to be one like
[1:04:37] John an
[1:04:39] Elijah to whom the word of God can come
[1:04:43] to and he's going to reveal by the holy
[1:04:45] spirit all the mysteries of
[1:04:48] God and restore the faith of the
[1:04:51] children back to the faith of the
[1:04:54] apostolic restore back all these
[1:04:58] Mysteries that's been proved
[1:05:02] at through the denominational
[1:05:05] years now that's what the word
[1:05:09] said I'm only responsible for what it
[1:05:12] said and it is written is
[1:05:16] right and in the same way like
[1:05:19] John the first
[1:05:22] Elijah introduced Jesus
[1:05:27] and the second
[1:05:29] Elijah it's his ministry will be the
[1:05:33] same also came to introduce
[1:05:37] Jesus they both had to uh
[1:05:40] decrease so
[1:05:43] has in our
[1:05:46] hearts in the same sermon the
[1:05:49] breach now the uh Prophet
[1:05:54] says now we see that this seven seal
[1:05:58] book it's the mystery of
[1:06:04] redemption now if this uh book is seven
[1:06:09] sealed this book that is sealed with
[1:06:11] Seven
[1:06:14] Seals it's the mystery of
[1:06:21] redemption then why would each believer
[1:06:23] have this revelation of this mystery
[1:06:26] he was going to want to have
[1:06:31] it because it was going to be the
[1:06:33] revelation of his
[1:06:36] Redemption it is the book of redemption
[1:06:39] that comes from
[1:06:41] God now all the Mysteries that in this
[1:06:45] time they'll be
[1:06:48] consumed when this um messenger begins
[1:06:52] to sound we're quoting
[1:06:59] now here is the the messenger Ang the
[1:07:02] angel it's it's it's the quote 744 now
[1:07:09] okay now here is the Angel over the
[1:07:12] Earth on the earth on the
[1:07:14] earth and another
[1:07:18] Angel powerful angel that
[1:07:23] descends this was an angel that was that
[1:07:26] came to the
[1:07:27] Earth is it you're not you're not
[1:07:30] reading
[1:07:31] okay
[1:07:36] 7:44 okay read off the quotes here you
[1:07:40] going to read from here get
[1:07:50] close now here's on the
[1:07:53] earth and another angel
[1:07:57] Mighty messenger came
[1:08:00] down and this Angel was an Earthly Angel
[1:08:05] messenger But Here Comes one down from
[1:08:07] heaven a
[1:08:09] rainbow a covenant
[1:08:12] see chist could it
[1:08:16] be it was in Revelations
[1:08:22] 1 standing in the midst of the seven
[1:08:24] golden candles
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:29] with a rainbow to look upon this Jasper
[1:08:31] and
[1:08:34] Sardis it's
[1:08:36] God this Angel of
[1:08:42] the right
[1:08:45] here
[1:08:50] notice it was to be the seventh Angel's
[1:08:54] message that was to reveal the
[1:08:56] seventh the Seven
[1:08:59] Seals Revelations
[1:09:01] 10:7 now you'll find it
[1:09:05] see you
[1:09:09] see the basis of what many
[1:09:15] sayam that William Bram has to
[1:09:21] return because they say that he's never
[1:09:24] um hold it or the seals have never been
[1:09:27] uh
[1:09:28] opened and for those that say
[1:09:31] it it for them it's true because they
[1:09:34] don't have
[1:09:35] Revelation that what the prophet had
[1:09:39] spoken because what he
[1:09:42] said it wasn't an
[1:09:44] explanation it requires a
[1:09:49] revelation is what the messenger
[1:09:52] said What Will William Brandon preached
[1:09:57] it requires a
[1:09:59] revelation not an
[1:10:04] explanation even in the way that he
[1:10:06] spoke he spoke in
[1:10:09] Parables he also
[1:10:13] said he also said in the way I
[1:10:16] speak it's a parable in the way I
[1:10:21] speak now the prophet
[1:10:24] said
[1:10:26] and he saw this Angel come
[1:10:28] down put his foot on the land and on the
[1:10:32] sea and that was
[1:10:36] Christ and he had a rainbow over his
[1:10:38] head notice
[1:10:41] him you'll find him in Revelations once
[1:10:44] again
[1:10:47] one with the rainbow over his
[1:10:51] head and look upon a Jasper and Sardis
[1:10:55] this
[1:10:56] Stone and then he
[1:10:59] comes he puts one foot upon the
[1:11:03] land and over the water see raised up
[1:11:07] his his
[1:11:09] hand and he had a rainbow over his head
[1:11:12] yet that's a
[1:11:15] covenant and he was a covenant Angel he
[1:11:18] was
[1:11:20] Christ a little lower than the angels to
[1:11:24] suffer there
[1:11:26] comes and he put his hands up to
[1:11:30] heaven and swore by
[1:11:33] him and lives forever and ever the
[1:11:36] Eternal one father
[1:11:39] God this time shall be no more and when
[1:11:42] this takes
[1:11:43] place it runs out it's done it's
[1:11:52] finished this
[1:11:54] angel he was the seventh
[1:11:59] angel in the cloud that
[1:12:02] appeared over the um Sabino
[1:12:07] Canyon the the picture that Life
[1:12:10] Magazine
[1:12:11] took um Revelations 10:
[1:12:16] 7 and Revelations
[1:12:20] 10 it is the
[1:12:23] prophecy that was what was fulfilled in
[1:12:29] Sabo the prophecy of the same angel had
[1:12:32] the angel the
[1:12:35] Covenant in the same message souls are
[1:12:37] imprisoned now the prophet
[1:12:40] says and the scripture
[1:12:45] says and at the message of the seventh
[1:12:47] Earthly
[1:12:49] Angel the messenger on
[1:12:52] Earth the
[1:12:53] seventh and last Church
[1:12:57] age at the beginning of his
[1:12:59] ministry when it starts off into the
[1:13:02] Earth at that
[1:13:04] time the mystery of
[1:13:07] God of these Seven
[1:13:09] Seals should be made known by that
[1:13:14] time now we see
[1:13:17] it now we see where we're
[1:13:20] at could it be friends could it be that
[1:13:26] we've that we here in the the last
[1:13:29] days the prophet
[1:13:32] said in the beginning of his
[1:13:37] ministry of this Messenger on the
[1:13:40] earth when he
[1:13:42] begins at that
[1:13:44] time the mysteries of God of the Seven
[1:13:48] Seals should be made
[1:13:54] known Min so now we see where we're
[1:13:59] at it would be
[1:14:01] important to
[1:14:04] know when his ministry
[1:14:07] began uh
[1:14:11] 1946 the prophet he he had an experience
[1:14:15] it was in a
[1:14:17] cabin an angel appeared to him and
[1:14:22] there he gave unto him a Ministry
[1:14:27] a
[1:14:28] commission to go to all around the
[1:14:31] worldi that's where brother
[1:14:34] brandom that's where he received the
[1:14:40] mantle to to be the angel of the leodan
[1:14:45] age and the
[1:14:47] word and that's where this ministry
[1:14:52] began that's where the opening of the
[1:14:54] seal the the seventh
[1:14:57] seal because the opening of the seventh
[1:15:00] seal it released a
[1:15:03] message it released a
[1:15:05] messenger the prophet said
[1:15:08] it what is the opening of a
[1:15:12] seal we all know
[1:15:14] that the opening of a
[1:15:17] seal it releases a messenger a message
[1:15:21] and a
[1:15:23] messenger in 1946
[1:15:26] God he gave him a
[1:15:28] commission to a
[1:15:31] prophet to take this message around the
[1:15:37] world so if he released a message and a
[1:15:42] messenger how is it that he released it
[1:15:45] how is it that he opened
[1:15:48] it the seventh
[1:15:51] seal
[1:15:53] open
[1:15:55] uh 1933 1963 63 I'm sorry
[1:16:00] no no
[1:16:05] 1946 the seventh angel where did he come
[1:16:08] from for the open from the
[1:16:11] opening from the seventh seal
[1:16:16] Paul Paul the messenger from the um age
[1:16:20] of
[1:16:20] Ephesus where did Paul come from from
[1:16:24] the opening
[1:16:25] from the first
[1:16:33] seal in the message scriptural signs of
[1:16:35] the
[1:16:38] time don't be
[1:16:41] ashamed if you're ashamed of him
[1:16:47] here he said I'll be ashamed of you
[1:16:49] before the
[1:16:51] father and the Holy
[1:16:53] Angels you're in his presence now he is
[1:16:58] here he absolutely is
[1:17:01] here great Holy Spirit the pillar of
[1:17:05] fire that wases is right here
[1:17:10] remember when he was here on
[1:17:12] Earth he said I come from God and I go
[1:17:15] to
[1:17:16] God and they
[1:17:20] said Moses forsook the treasures of
[1:17:23] Egypt
[1:17:26] considering the treasures of Christ
[1:17:28] greater than all the reproach of
[1:17:33] Christ greater than all the treasures of
[1:17:36] Egypt he went in the wilderness with
[1:17:40] Christ and any Bible
[1:17:45] reader knows that the pillar of fire was
[1:17:47] the
[1:17:49] Angel and the L that went out of God
[1:17:52] which was
[1:17:53] Jesus
[1:17:57] it was the same body that God was
[1:18:00] using when Jesus
[1:18:03] died he ascended up to
[1:18:06] heaven and when he was met when he met
[1:18:10] Saul on the road to
[1:18:16] Damascus he had done turned back to the
[1:18:18] pillar of fire
[1:18:20] again and he even put Paul's eyes out
[1:18:23] with brightness
[1:18:26] with the brightness of the light and the
[1:18:29] prophet
[1:18:30] says and now he he's here
[1:18:34] tonight the same yesterday today and
[1:18:38] forever would you like to identify
[1:18:40] yourself before
[1:18:41] him say Lord
[1:18:44] God I haven't had that kind of
[1:18:47] experience but I want to have
[1:18:53] it
[1:18:55] or does God change his mind about his
[1:18:59] word and the prophet
[1:19:04] says and Moses was leading the children
[1:19:06] of
[1:19:08] Israel just as God would tell
[1:19:12] them by the led by the pillar of
[1:19:16] fire and a supernatural
[1:19:20] being that was leading the
[1:19:23] way and Moses was getting his
[1:19:26] information through the
[1:19:29] logos and that went out of
[1:19:31] God that Pillar of
[1:19:34] Fire which was the angel of the which
[1:19:37] was Christ the anointed
[1:19:41] one his message through there and G
[1:19:45] giving
[1:19:48] it on the road to a promised
[1:19:53] land so if that prophet of the first
[1:19:58] Exodus if that was the way he was
[1:20:00] receiving his
[1:20:03] information so how about the one the
[1:20:06] message of the third
[1:20:08] ex if that's the pattern of the
[1:20:12] first then God will do it the same in
[1:20:14] this day the prophet
[1:20:17] says he says this
[1:20:20] man he was
[1:20:22] calm he had his kingdom
[1:20:25] he had his
[1:20:26] churches he had everything in
[1:20:32] order he so he
[1:20:34] sends over to get this
[1:20:37] man he's speaking of
[1:20:40] balam to bring this
[1:20:44] man to come over and to curse this
[1:20:46] people the the people of Israel now
[1:20:51] notice could you
[1:20:53] imagine that one Prophet one man of
[1:20:57] God seeing the works of
[1:21:02] God and tried to challenge The Works of
[1:21:05] God and when he
[1:21:08] knew he he he was he knew better
[1:21:14] now sent him and told
[1:21:17] him come over and curse this people B
[1:21:21] and
[1:21:23] Baal
[1:21:25] bom
[1:21:26] rather he done this thing that was right
[1:21:29] he sought God he sought God
[1:21:33] first now that's what we ought to have
[1:21:36] done and then
[1:21:38] God and gave him his Perfect Clean Cut
[1:21:43] answer don't go with
[1:21:46] him leave them
[1:21:49] alone don't you curse those people they
[1:21:52] are blessed they're
[1:21:58] blessed now that ought to be
[1:22:01] enough When God says
[1:22:03] anything he cannot change
[1:22:06] that
[1:22:09] notice this was his perfect
[1:22:11] will don't you
[1:22:13] go don't attack that people they are my
[1:22:18] people that was his perfect will
[1:22:23] butam he didn't like those
[1:22:26] people you
[1:22:29] see how manys do we have
[1:22:33] today doing the same thing and they know
[1:22:36] better they know
[1:22:41] better remember what the prophet
[1:22:45] says and Moses was getting his
[1:22:48] message through the
[1:22:50] logos and the
[1:22:53] prophet
[1:22:55] and he was also receiving the message
[1:22:56] through a
[1:22:59] people through the
[1:23:01] logos and the Holy Spirit the pillar of
[1:23:05] fire god the same
[1:23:10] God it was the same Angel of the
[1:23:13] Covenant it is Christ the anointed one
[1:23:17] and from
[1:23:18] there and and Moses was receiving this
[1:23:23] message
[1:23:26] Moses was not getting this
[1:23:30] message because he was speaking with his
[1:23:33] own theophany no
[1:23:36] no it was the angel of the
[1:23:39] Covenant the Holy
[1:23:41] Spirit speaking to
[1:23:44] Moses a prophet of the first
[1:23:48] Exodus and the prophet of the Third
[1:23:52] Exodus he also received the message the
[1:23:55] same
[1:23:56] way through the
[1:23:59] Revelation through the angel of
[1:24:02] the through the the Holy Spirit the same
[1:24:06] God once
[1:24:09] more bringing his book of
[1:24:11] redemption his Plan of Redemption for
[1:24:14] his people for you and
[1:24:19] me in the message Christ is the mystery
[1:24:22] of God
[1:24:23] revealed
[1:24:24] Prophet says GL Oh
[1:24:28] Glory that great Angel of the
[1:24:33] Covenant that one was who was with Moses
[1:24:35] in the
[1:24:40] wilderness that one who came to Paul on
[1:24:42] the road to
[1:24:43] Damascus see the same
[1:24:46] one the prophet's giving you the
[1:24:50] pattern because Christ is the same
[1:24:53] yesterday today
[1:24:57] can because he he cannot change and he
[1:24:59] speaks the same way to
[1:25:02] his glory the great Angel of the
[1:25:05] Covenant with Moses in the
[1:25:09] wilderness the one that was with Paul on
[1:25:11] the road to
[1:25:15] Damascus the same one that was permitted
[1:25:17] that his picture be taken with
[1:25:21] us he's talking of the picture that the
[1:25:24] Pillar of Fire was
[1:25:25] over and then he
[1:25:27] says
[1:25:29] notice the same
[1:25:32] one that was in the
[1:25:34] picture in the Life
[1:25:37] Magazine the other
[1:25:40] day the same word by the same God the
[1:25:45] Chanel the way
[1:25:50] the whether two or three are gathered in
[1:25:53] my name I am there in their
[1:25:57] midst then he is here then he is
[1:26:03] here he gave us three
[1:26:06] Witnesses he gave us one
[1:26:09] pattern and he applied to the three
[1:26:11] Witnesses Moses Paul William Bram
[1:26:14] William
[1:26:17] Bram how are you receiving the
[1:26:19] message how were they receiving the
[1:26:22] message by
[1:26:25] by the angel of the Covenant
[1:26:29] Jesus not speaking to their theophanies
[1:26:32] no
[1:26:36] no that is a thought
[1:26:42] Pagan that's an Adoration of a a saint
[1:26:46] of a
[1:26:48] holy the same way it's written in the
[1:26:51] Book of
[1:26:52] Daniel that the king
[1:26:55] he made an
[1:26:58] image and he wanted all the world to
[1:27:02] worship and that same image that he
[1:27:07] made it was the same image
[1:27:11] of he wanted Daniel to do the same
[1:27:17] thing and that the prophet said that's
[1:27:19] going to repeat in this day it's
[1:27:22] repeating in
[1:27:23] this see it with our own
[1:27:28] eyes it is
[1:27:31] repeating but the prophet
[1:27:34] said the great Angel of the
[1:27:37] Covenant the one that appeared with
[1:27:39] Moses in the
[1:27:43] desert the same one that appeared to
[1:27:45] Paul in the road to
[1:27:49] Damascus the same one that permitted his
[1:27:51] picture to be taken with us the same one
[1:27:56] that was in the
[1:27:57] picture Life magazine in Life Magazine
[1:28:00] the other
[1:28:02] day the seventh
[1:28:04] angel those wings
[1:28:08] backed who is it the angel of the
[1:28:11] Covenant Christ the the Lord
[1:28:17] Jesus it can't be any more
[1:28:20] clear what is Prophet say what is a
[1:28:23] theophany
[1:28:25] the prophet
[1:28:26] said Moses saw
[1:28:29] it only the theind part behind behind
[1:28:33] part of a man of a
[1:28:36] man it was a
[1:28:40] man that was the theophany of
[1:28:44] God and the scripture says and when he
[1:28:49] appears and we'll be like he
[1:28:53] is
[1:28:55] the same um kind the same kind same
[1:29:00] seed will produce
[1:29:04] sons and if the theophany of
[1:29:06] God is a
[1:29:11] man then what would be the theophany of
[1:29:14] a a son and daughter of
[1:29:17] God
[1:29:20] huh wouldn't it be the
[1:29:23] same
[1:29:24] wouldn't it be the same as as he appears
[1:29:26] will be like
[1:29:27] him we're going to be reading we're
[1:29:30] going to be reading more
[1:29:31] quotes of the
[1:29:33] testimony of the
[1:29:38] Prophet when he came out of this this
[1:29:42] Earthly body Earthly
[1:29:45] body and he entered
[1:29:47] into and the Lord permitted for one
[1:29:52] moment to leave this dimension
[1:29:54] iion and to go to the sixth
[1:29:58] Dimension and here in the message the
[1:30:01] fifth
[1:30:03] seal he the prophet gives a testimony of
[1:30:07] this not only
[1:30:10] here I I chose this
[1:30:13] portion because of the detail it gives
[1:30:16] us take have
[1:30:18] patience we're going to be reading
[1:30:22] much it says says here U
[1:30:25] notice these
[1:30:28] souls are to wait a little
[1:30:31] season

[1:30:39] martyred now he says my time it's
[1:30:44] [Music]
[1:30:45] finished and if I let you leave a little
[1:30:51] early I have a few more things to
[1:30:55] say I know it's hot and I'm sweating but
[1:31:00] listen I just got something to tell you
[1:31:04] it's just so
[1:31:05] good just burning right up in my
[1:31:08] heart and I hope you haven't forgotten
[1:31:10] it let me say
[1:31:13] this in the presence of him by his
[1:31:17] grace he
[1:31:20] also let he let me
[1:31:22] see my
[1:31:25] people and white
[1:31:29] robes also how he let
[1:31:33] Paul William brand was not the
[1:31:37] first Paul also spoke the he also came
[1:31:42] out
[1:31:43] of and he also was allowed permitted
[1:31:47] to he also was allowed to go into that
[1:31:49] sixth
[1:31:51] Dimension he said the eyes have not seen
[1:31:55] ears have not
[1:31:57] heard what God has in store for
[1:32:01] us and the same experience that they
[1:32:05] had and the same experience I
[1:32:09] have I can't tell you everything I
[1:32:11] saw I can only tell
[1:32:15] you you
[1:32:17] remember you remember the story not long
[1:32:21] ago the gentle Gentile bride
[1:32:26] and they were all in right white robes
[1:32:31] now and now he begins his
[1:32:35] testimony he said I woke
[1:32:38] up I had been on a
[1:32:42] meeting been about a year ago or a
[1:32:44] little
[1:32:45] more and I woke up one morning and I
[1:32:49] raised
[1:32:50] up and I said sweetheart to my wife
[1:32:54] she didn't
[1:32:56] move I had to take the kids to
[1:33:01] school and I was going to get up from
[1:33:03] the
[1:33:05] bed and I I I leaned
[1:33:13] there and you know how you just sit up
[1:33:16] and just lean your
[1:33:17] head you lean your head against the
[1:33:22] headboard
[1:33:26] and I was just laying back like
[1:33:28] that and I
[1:33:30] thought boy
[1:33:33] oh you're already going to be
[1:33:37] 53 if you're going to do anything for
[1:33:40] God you better you better get doing
[1:33:43] it because you're going to be real old
[1:33:46] after a while and I
[1:33:48] thought you know that's right I thought
[1:33:51] I thought yes that's right
[1:33:54] I don't have much time
[1:33:56] left and I have to go
[1:34:04] soon now I'm a year older than my daddy
[1:34:08] when he when he when he
[1:34:11] lived I thought I got to move right
[1:34:14] right
[1:34:15] away and I
[1:34:18] thought I ain't done nothing for
[1:34:22] God and I said
[1:34:25] I always wanted to do something for him
[1:34:28] and I
[1:34:29] thought I got to hurry and do it if I'm
[1:34:32] going to do
[1:34:35] it I don't know how many years I'll have
[1:34:38] now and I begin to
[1:34:44] think man I
[1:34:46] hope to see his
[1:34:50] coming I don't want to be like a spirit
[1:34:54] spook
[1:34:57] see I was always afraid of a
[1:35:00] spirit and and I always
[1:35:05] thought and I thought well like maybe
[1:35:07] I'd be with brother
[1:35:12] Neville White Cloud moving
[1:35:16] around and you know I'd say hello
[1:35:18] brother
[1:35:19] Neville and he'd say hello brother
[1:35:22] brand
[1:35:24] and by some
[1:35:27] sense could he couldn't
[1:35:31] talk but I know that it was just brother
[1:35:34] Neville but even
[1:35:37] though I I want to shake his hand like I
[1:35:41] always
[1:35:43] do because that's how the human beings
[1:35:46] do
[1:35:47] it see I'd want to shake his
[1:35:50] hand but he ain't got no hand
[1:35:55] it's down there in the grave rot it
[1:35:57] away and I
[1:36:00] thought what a
[1:36:03] thing I hope that I don't have to go
[1:36:05] through
[1:36:07] that now I'm going to tell you the
[1:36:11] truth I'm telling you the truth I was
[1:36:14] afraid to
[1:36:16] die not afraid I'd be
[1:36:19] lost but I didn't want to be a
[1:36:22] spirit I wanted just to remain a
[1:36:26] man I wanted to wait for the Rapture
[1:36:31] see I just wanted to stay like
[1:36:34] that I didn't want to be no
[1:36:36] spirit and then the prophet
[1:36:40] says and I was there laying on the
[1:36:47] thinking and in a
[1:36:49] moment something
[1:36:52] happened now you know I
[1:36:59] know you are conscious of the
[1:37:02] visions and if this was a
[1:37:06] vision I've never had one like
[1:37:10] it and I've had Visions since I was a
[1:37:12] little
[1:37:15] boy and all at once something
[1:37:18] happened and and I felt myself
[1:37:21] leaving and I thought
[1:37:24] and I thought oh I'm dead and I've
[1:37:30] gone and then I
[1:37:34] thought and I'm going to look
[1:37:38] back friends this was so
[1:37:41] real as I'm standing right
[1:37:45] here and I turned around to look
[1:37:48] back and
[1:37:50] there lay on the bed
[1:37:54] stretched
[1:37:55] out laying by side of my
[1:37:59] wife the fleshly
[1:38:03] Tabernacle he was already in another
[1:38:06] dimension theophonic
[1:38:09] body the body in the in the bed it was
[1:38:13] moving no
[1:38:15] no was speaking no
[1:38:20] no he was shaking his wife no no
[1:38:25] because that body
[1:38:28] William William brandham was not in that
[1:38:32] house God moved him to another
[1:38:35] dimension to give you to give him that
[1:38:41] experience if God doesn't send that
[1:38:44] body William Bram they would have said
[1:38:47] uh brother brandom
[1:38:49] died in his bed next to his wife
[1:38:55] I thought
[1:38:58] well it probably a heart attack
[1:39:02] see well I say I just died
[1:39:06] instantly well it would be a fine way of
[1:39:10] going so I
[1:39:12] thought that's a heart
[1:39:14] attack I didn't have to
[1:39:17] suffer and then I looked and I thought
[1:39:20] well that's
[1:39:22] strange there I lay right there and
[1:39:25] there I was stretched
[1:39:26] out but now I'm here
[1:39:31] standing looking at the same that body
[1:39:35] my same body in the
[1:39:37] bed but the body in the in the
[1:39:41] bed the body in the bed had 50 was 53
[1:39:44] years
[1:39:46] old William brandom in his his body
[1:39:51] Celestial he was a a body of 20 years
[1:39:55] old it was the same
[1:39:58] man but it was two uh distinct
[1:40:03] bodies one one flly body and one fleshly
[1:40:07] body William brand and William
[1:40:11] brandom in his
[1:40:13] house in in that the one that God
[1:40:19] made in in Corinthians chapter
[1:40:22] 5
[1:40:23] and Paul spoke of these two
[1:40:26] bodies and then the prophet
[1:40:28] says so I
[1:40:33] turned and I looked and I saw a great
[1:40:35] big
[1:40:38] field and over that
[1:40:41] field and there was like blue
[1:40:47] grass and I went to think about
[1:40:50] this and all of a sudden and as I
[1:40:55] looked here come thousands
[1:40:58] thousands of young
[1:41:02] women they're not just women but young
[1:41:08] women all in white
[1:41:10] robes and their
[1:41:13] hair their hair hanging down to their
[1:41:16] waist and their um
[1:41:19] barefooted and they were running right
[1:41:21] towards me and I thought what's
[1:41:26] this and I turned around and and there
[1:41:30] was and there I
[1:41:34] was and I looked up this
[1:41:37] way there they
[1:41:40] came and I bit my
[1:41:43] finger and I
[1:41:45] said and I'm not
[1:41:48] asleep because I could feel that I was
[1:41:50] biting my finger and I said
[1:41:54] there's something funny
[1:41:55] here and these
[1:41:58] women and they came running towards
[1:42:01] me and I've never
[1:42:05] seen I've never seen such pretty
[1:42:09] women and they all came right to me and
[1:42:13] when they ran to
[1:42:15] me and you know how I've
[1:42:20] been and they call me a woman hater
[1:42:23] but I'm
[1:42:25] not but I
[1:42:27] think but a good
[1:42:29] woman is is a
[1:42:33] jewel right the same way that Solomon
[1:42:37] said but a bad
[1:42:42] woman said she was
[1:42:47] watering so I certainly ain't got no use
[1:42:51] for of ill faint
[1:42:56] now he says that these women they all
[1:42:59] came and they they
[1:43:03] started and they put their arms around
[1:43:07] me and that is something
[1:43:10] strange and you
[1:43:12] know I would have never stood for
[1:43:16] that now I will have to say
[1:43:22] something in a mixed
[1:43:25] crowd but these were women they were
[1:43:29] women and they hugged
[1:43:33] me they
[1:43:34] said our precious
[1:43:37] brother and one hugged
[1:43:40] me another one would hug
[1:43:42] me and I was standing there and I
[1:43:45] thought and I said what's
[1:43:48] this see and they were there standing
[1:43:51] and I thought what
[1:43:54] happened and I looked
[1:43:56] back and I was lying right there on the
[1:44:02] bed but even though I was standing
[1:44:05] here and I thought now that's odd and I
[1:44:10] don't understand and them
[1:44:13] women they were saying our precious
[1:44:17] brother and then hugging
[1:44:21] me and they were
[1:44:24] were and they were to feeling me
[1:44:29] feeling 100% they were
[1:44:32] women and the prophet
[1:44:52] said inside and I I begin to
[1:45:01] think for
[1:45:17] me and the prophet
[1:45:21] says now forgive me sister
[1:45:26] and I know that you listen to your
[1:45:30] doctor and if we don't have clean
[1:45:33] Minds then we're not
[1:45:37] Christians always tried to live clean
[1:45:39] morally
[1:45:41] morally God knows
[1:45:44] that and when I was a little
[1:45:47] boy and the angel of the Lord told
[1:45:50] me not to defile my body
[1:45:54] not to smoke no not to
[1:45:56] drink and that's been the truth by the
[1:45:59] of
[1:45:59] God I've kept
[1:46:02] that and when I was a
[1:46:05] sinner I didn't run around with women
[1:46:08] and
[1:46:09] so but any
[1:46:11] man that lets a
[1:46:14] woman that that lets a
[1:46:18] woman hug him in his
[1:46:21] arms being made of cells of a
[1:46:26] man and her of a of a
[1:46:28] woman there's going to be a
[1:46:30] sensation I don't care who you
[1:46:35] are and if you're a person of good
[1:46:51] health I don't I don't care who you
[1:46:58] are don't tell me that you're not if
[1:47:00] you're if you're a healthy
[1:47:04] person but not
[1:47:07] there because you don't
[1:47:12] have now you know that those Sals are
[1:47:16] different you don't have any more
[1:47:18] different
[1:47:20] sales you'll never sin there
[1:47:24] because there was a
[1:47:26] change from a Earthly
[1:47:28] body to a Celestial
[1:47:34] body now the carnal doesn't exist
[1:47:39] there it's only a a brotherly
[1:47:43] love with these
[1:47:48] women and even
[1:47:51] though by the grace
[1:47:55] I believe that a
[1:47:58] woman a pretty
[1:48:02] woman that holds herself
[1:48:04] right and Walks Like a
[1:48:08] Lady an example of a jewel on
[1:48:14] Earth I like anything that's
[1:48:17] graceful and I
[1:48:21] think a woman that holds
[1:48:24] Place tries to be like a
[1:48:27] lady is a statue of
[1:48:30] Honor I do
[1:48:32] believe
[1:48:37] that and I think that one that
[1:48:42] isn't and it's like Christ and anti the
[1:48:46] same
[1:48:49] thing like anything that's
[1:48:51] natural
[1:48:53] now the prophet how he's explaining
[1:48:57] here it's difficult to follow his
[1:49:01] thought but I'm I'm reading it as he
[1:49:03] speak he he he spoke
[1:49:06] it because he's
[1:49:08] speaking and he's here speaking in
[1:49:11] Parables now the prophet
[1:49:15] says uh like a pretty
[1:49:19] horse and he just stands in the Statue
[1:49:22] of a real pretty
[1:49:24] and a pretty
[1:49:27] Mountain a pretty
[1:49:29] Mountain a pretty
[1:49:32] woman and a pretty
[1:49:36] men anything that stands in the making
[1:49:40] of
[1:49:42] God and I've always admire admired
[1:49:46] it and these were perfect these were
[1:49:49] perfect
[1:49:51] sorry
[1:49:55] but no matter how many that would hug me
[1:49:56] into their arms and they were women you
[1:50:02] understand but there there could be
[1:50:04] never no
[1:50:07] sin the male
[1:50:10] glands and the female glands but was
[1:50:13] gone thank the
[1:50:17] Lord they were my sisters
[1:50:20] completely and then the prophet says
[1:50:23] and I seen my
[1:50:29] hands and I seen my
[1:50:32] hands and I seen my hands that they were
[1:50:35] young my
[1:50:36] hands and I was
[1:50:39] young same
[1:50:41] William the six
[1:50:43] dimension in his
[1:50:47] Celestial in his
[1:50:49] theop he was
[1:50:51] young and when you look
[1:50:55] back will that was in the
[1:50:57] bed that man was
[1:51:01] old one was the The Natural
[1:51:04] Body and the other was the celestial
[1:51:09] body I was young
[1:51:13] too and losing my
[1:51:15] hair as a Young
[1:51:21] Man through an accident putting carbic
[1:51:25] acid a barber
[1:51:28] did and it took all they took it all
[1:51:31] when I was a young
[1:51:34] boy and it's always
[1:51:37] been and I've always gotten a cold
[1:51:41] quick you
[1:51:44] know and I I lost the roots
[1:51:48] of was
[1:51:51] carb
[1:51:53] and now my hair couldn't grow back you
[1:51:55] see
[1:51:57] now and I went my
[1:52:02] wife it was years
[1:52:05] ago and she bought me and she bought me
[1:52:08] a hairpiece to put on me to cover my
[1:52:14] head but I've always been ashamed to
[1:52:17] wear
[1:52:18] it because it it looked like it was
[1:52:21] something false and I've never wanted
[1:52:23] something
[1:52:24] false so I
[1:52:27] thought and what if I just put a like a
[1:52:31] stocking but if I put
[1:52:33] that and then they're going to begin to
[1:52:35] say that he is a
[1:52:38] bishop and then I I said I'm not going
[1:52:40] to do
[1:52:43] that and I'll just suffer with the bad
[1:52:46] cold and let
[1:52:48] it and so and the prophet said
[1:52:53] and I went to a
[1:52:54] doctor and I asked him what he
[1:52:57] thought and he
[1:53:00] said and the pores are
[1:53:02] open you're sweating from preaching from
[1:53:06] preaching and then the air
[1:53:10] comes and and it puts a cold germ
[1:53:13] up and it and it runs
[1:53:16] down the next morning your
[1:53:21] horse and you that have
[1:53:25] hair you don't know how thankful you
[1:53:27] should be the
[1:53:32] prophet he goes out of his he leaves his
[1:53:36] testimony and and like he
[1:53:39] always because that's the way
[1:53:43] God how God was going to hide it from
[1:53:46] the and he was going to bring it through
[1:53:50] Revel the ones that want a explanation
[1:53:54] clear they they close the the the
[1:53:59] tape this man can't hold his
[1:54:05] subject that he chose this
[1:54:07] man speak the way he
[1:54:11] spoke um
[1:54:21] listen
[1:54:24] but I looked at my hands and they were
[1:54:29] young and I put my hands over my head
[1:54:32] and I had hair once
[1:54:34] again I was
[1:54:37] young and everybody here was
[1:54:40] young and I begin to think how
[1:54:42] strange they're
[1:54:44] here they're running to
[1:54:49] me and then I saw hope coming coming
[1:54:54] Hope was his first
[1:54:58] wife and when she uh died at 22 years of
[1:55:03] age and she was still very uh
[1:55:07] pretty and many of you remember her she
[1:55:10] had a very big
[1:55:14] eyes she was a
[1:55:18] German her hair was
[1:55:21] uh down to her waist back and I
[1:55:27] thought and when she comes to
[1:55:29] me and she she's going to say
[1:55:32] Bill and how she would always say I know
[1:55:36] that she's going to
[1:55:38] say I know that she'll say she call me
[1:55:41] Bill when she comes here I was seeing
[1:55:45] her and every one of those women
[1:55:48] coming um hugging me saying
[1:55:53] our precious
[1:55:54] brother it's so good to see
[1:55:57] you and I
[1:56:00] thought and they were all clothed the
[1:56:03] same
[1:56:06] way but their hair was different you
[1:56:10] know red hair black hair blond
[1:56:15] hair and as they were coming they were
[1:56:18] all
[1:56:20] young and when she got to me and I
[1:56:26] thought I'm just going to see what she
[1:56:29] says and she looked at me and she
[1:56:33] said her his wife
[1:56:37] Hope Oh Our precious brother she hugged
[1:56:40] me and she just went
[1:56:44] on and some other women
[1:56:46] came and they also hugged
[1:56:50] me and I heard a noise
[1:56:53] it looked like he was coming over this
[1:56:56] way and then there came some men uh
[1:57:01] young and they were all about the same
[1:57:04] age of 20 years
[1:57:05] old and they had dark
[1:57:08] hair some were blonde
[1:57:12] hair and they had white robes
[1:57:14] on to to their
[1:57:17] feet and they ran to
[1:57:20] me and they began to
[1:57:22] me they said our precious brother and I
[1:57:28] thought and then I look behind
[1:57:31] me and then I saw
[1:57:35] myself and I was still stretched out on
[1:57:37] the
[1:57:39] bed and I said this is strange and then
[1:57:43] I said and a voice said it began to
[1:57:46] speak to
[1:57:48] me and I never
[1:57:51] seen only to hear the
[1:57:53] voice and the voice said to
[1:57:57] me
[1:57:59] you you have been reunited
[1:58:03] reunited with your
[1:58:08] people and then a man picked me
[1:58:14] up and he set me way up on
[1:58:17] high and I thought I why did you do that
[1:58:23] said in
[1:58:24] Earth you were a
[1:58:28] leader well I don't understand
[1:58:31] this and the voice that was speaking to
[1:58:35] me the voice I could never see the voice
[1:58:38] and
[1:58:40] now over me talking to me and I
[1:58:45] said and if I have passed
[1:58:50] on if I if I have passed on I want to
[1:58:54] see
[1:58:58] Jesus he is all my life I want to see
[1:59:03] him and he
[1:59:05] said you can't see him
[1:59:08] now he's still
[1:59:10] higher in another
[1:59:12] dimension he was in the sixth
[1:59:15] Dimension and God was in the seventh
[1:59:18] Dimension you
[1:59:21] see
[1:59:22] I was below the
[1:59:24] altar how under the
[1:59:28] altar go read chapter 5 of Revelations
[1:59:33] apal um I'm sorry apocalyps Revelations
[1:59:38] chapter
[1:59:39] 6 when it speaks of the fifth
[1:59:42] seal Souls under the altar
[1:59:47] now we know the souls were the
[1:59:51] Jews
[1:59:53] but we know that they were Souls that
[1:59:54] were
[1:59:55] redeemed and they were under the
[1:59:57] altar in other
[2:00:00] words the altar is in the seventh
[2:00:04] diens the sixth
[2:00:07] Dimension a people that was already
[2:00:12] redeemed uh the sixth
[2:00:14] place where mang
[2:00:17] goes not the seventh where God
[2:00:20] is Dimension the
[2:00:25] sixth they were all
[2:00:28] there and they were passing
[2:00:34] by and I looked and it looked like there
[2:00:36] were millions of
[2:00:38] them and as I was
[2:00:40] there and these women and
[2:00:44] men they were still coming to me and
[2:00:47] hugging
[2:00:49] me saying
[2:00:50] brother
[2:00:52] and there I
[2:00:54] was and I Heard a
[2:00:58] Voice and you have been rited and to
[2:01:00] your people like
[2:01:03] Jacob like Jacob was gathered to his
[2:01:05] people and I
[2:01:07] said all and I said all these are my
[2:01:11] people all these are Brams no he said
[2:01:17] no they are your converts to
[2:01:20] Christ
[2:01:22] and I
[2:01:25] saw and there was a
[2:01:28] woman very beautiful that ran up to
[2:01:34] me and all of them were pretty much the
[2:01:38] same and she um hugged
[2:01:42] me she said oh my precious brother and
[2:01:46] she looked at me and I
[2:01:50] thought and she said he said I my she
[2:01:53] looks like an
[2:01:54] angel and she passed by and the voice
[2:01:59] said didn't you recognize her I said no
[2:02:04] I I didn't
[2:02:11] recognize and he said you led her to
[2:02:13] Christ when she was past 90 years
[2:02:17] old he
[2:02:20] said said you know why she thinks so
[2:02:23] much of you I
[2:02:28] said said that pretty girl was past
[2:02:31] 90 and she said
[2:02:34] yes and she can never change no more
[2:02:38] now and that's the reason she's saying
[2:02:42] my precious brother and I
[2:02:44] thought oh
[2:02:47] my and I was afraid of
[2:02:50] this
[2:02:52] why these people are
[2:02:55] real here they
[2:02:59] are they weren't tired of being there
[2:03:02] and I
[2:03:03] said why why can't I see
[2:03:08] Jesus and he said well he'll come
[2:03:11] someday and he'll come to you
[2:03:14] first and you'll be
[2:03:18] judged and the these people are your
[2:03:21] converts
[2:03:25] and I said you mean by being a
[2:03:28] leader that he will judge me he said
[2:03:35] yes and he said does every leader be
[2:03:37] judged like that he said
[2:03:39] yes I said what about
[2:03:43] Paul he will have to be judged like
[2:03:45] that with yours too as yours as his
[2:03:49] sorry and I said
[2:03:53] and if this group goes
[2:03:56] in so the group of his group goes
[2:03:59] in so will
[2:04:02] mine because I preach the same
[2:04:06] word where it says be baptized in Jesus
[2:04:09] name I did it
[2:04:11] too I also preached
[2:04:13] it and millions
[2:04:18] screamed resting on that and I
[2:04:29] thought if I only knew this before I
[2:04:31] come
[2:04:36] here I would make the people come
[2:04:41] here you can't afford to miss
[2:04:44] this and then he
[2:04:46] said someday he will come
[2:04:50] Jesus
[2:04:53] and in this
[2:04:54] place we don't have to eat
[2:04:58] drink
[2:05:00] sleep we're just all
[2:05:03] one and he
[2:05:07] says why isn't it isn't
[2:05:12] perfect this is beyond
[2:05:14] perfect it's not
[2:05:17] Sublime Beyond
[2:05:20] Sublime no name can put on
[2:05:23] it there's no word
[2:05:25] or to say
[2:05:29] it you just arrived that's
[2:05:32] all and I
[2:05:35] thought well this would be
[2:05:40] perfect then what are we going to do
[2:05:42] next and he
[2:05:45] said and when Jesus
[2:05:48] comes and he judges
[2:05:50] us for for you and for your
[2:05:55] ministry then we'll go back to the
[2:05:58] Earth and take up new
[2:06:01] bodies bodies that are
[2:06:03] glorified our
[2:06:07] theop it our theophany body is not our
[2:06:09] final Dwelling
[2:06:13] Place in the theop that
[2:06:17] we the Lord will clean this
[2:06:20] Earth
[2:06:22] over will step over the ashes
[2:06:25] of glorify these
[2:06:28] bodies and over a
[2:06:32] glorified live over the Earth
[2:06:35] forever Prophet says and I I thought on
[2:06:41] this this is exactly the
[2:06:44] scripture and he
[2:06:46] said then we go back to
[2:06:49] Earth we'll take up those new bodies
[2:06:53] and then we'll
[2:06:54] eat but
[2:06:56] here in this sixth Dimension we won't
[2:06:59] eat here neither neither do we
[2:07:04] sleep now when we go back to the Earth
[2:07:07] we'll eat down
[2:07:09] there there on the
[2:07:10] earth and I
[2:07:13] said this is
[2:07:16] marvelous and I I was scared of
[2:07:19] this and I was scared scared to die to
[2:07:23] to get to come to
[2:07:25] this why this is
[2:07:28] perfection
[2:07:30] per this is
[2:07:32] wonderful
[2:07:34] see see we're right we're right under
[2:07:38] the
[2:07:41] altar right under the
[2:07:44] altar waiting for his
[2:07:50] coming
[2:07:52] when he goes to get those ones that are
[2:07:55] sleeping and the body sleeping in the
[2:07:57] dust to raise them up
[2:08:01] again like
[2:08:03] Jesus he went to the
[2:08:07] paradise Abraham Isaac and all of them
[2:08:11] you
[2:08:13] know and they were waiting
[2:08:16] first and they were waiting in the first
[2:08:19] resurrection and they entered into the
[2:08:20] city
[2:08:22] and appeared to
[2:08:24] many perfectly
[2:08:26] scriptural a vision was there whatever
[2:08:30] it was perfectly
[2:08:31] scriptural and then I
[2:08:33] said well isn't this
[2:08:36] wonderful and then I
[2:08:39] thought and then I
[2:08:41] heard liquor like a
[2:08:43] horse and I
[2:08:45] looked and it was my saddle
[2:08:49] horse that I used to ride
[2:08:53] in this sixth
[2:08:55] Dimension not only
[2:08:57] men not only women a
[2:09:02] horse Prince the the name was Prince of
[2:09:05] the
[2:09:07] horse I thought so much of
[2:09:10] him and here he was standing there by Me
[2:09:14] by he put his head over my
[2:09:17] should to get like hug
[2:09:20] me I I used to give him and I used to
[2:09:24] give him like
[2:09:27] sugar and I would hug
[2:09:30] him and I said
[2:09:32] Prince I knew that you would be
[2:09:36] here and all of a
[2:09:39] sudden and I felt something liing my
[2:09:42] hand oh blessed

[2:09:46] Dimension
[2:09:48] a in a Celestial body

[2:09:55] hand and it was my
[2:09:58] dog and a man named Mr
[2:10:01] short and he had poisoned
[2:10:04] him I swar I would kill

[2:10:10] age he poisoned my
[2:10:15] dog and my
[2:10:17] daddy and he caught me with a
[2:10:20] rifle
[2:10:22] going down there to kill
[2:10:24] him and I
[2:10:28] said and I went to to to theg grave and
[2:10:33] where I buried him and I spoke to him I
[2:10:37] said

[2:10:44] always you've helped me to clothe me and
[2:10:46] sent
[2:10:47] me to go to

[2:10:53] old and I was going to take care of you
[2:10:56] and now they've killed
[2:10:59] youz and I said a promise to
[2:11:02] Fritz the man that killed you is not

[2:11:16] going to kill
[2:11:17] him and I'm going to take Vengeance
[2:11:19] against him because for
[2:11:22] you and then you know what
[2:11:26] happened you know what happened I led
[2:11:28] that man to
[2:11:30] Christ I baptized him in the name of
[2:11:33] Jesus
[2:11:36] name and I buried him also at his
[2:11:39] death you see what had
[2:11:41] happened the uh years
[2:11:45] later before a few years before before
[2:11:48] I'm
[2:11:49] sorry I had I was
[2:11:53] converted then I seen things
[2:11:58] different and now I loved this
[2:12:02] man that poisoned my
[2:12:05] dog instead of hating
[2:12:12] him but even
[2:12:14] though but there was
[2:12:16] Fritz licking my
[2:12:19] hand I couldn't cry
[2:12:22] there nobody can cry it was all
[2:12:26] joy there you can't be sad because it's
[2:12:29] all
[2:12:30] happiness nobody there can die because
[2:12:34] it's all
[2:12:35] life nobody there gets
[2:12:37] old because it's all a
[2:12:40] youth it's something
[2:12:42] perfect and I said this is something
[2:12:46] wonderful and
[2:12:48] millions and I felt at home
[2:12:52] and then I heard a
[2:12:53] voice and it
[2:12:58] said and all that you ever
[2:13:02] loved for my
[2:13:04] service I don't need a reward for but he
[2:13:09] said all that you ever
[2:13:11] loved and all that ever loved you God
[2:13:15] has given to
[2:13:16] you and I said praise the
[2:13:20] Lord
[2:13:22] and I began to feel
[2:13:24] funny what's the matter I feel
[2:13:27] funny and I turned around and
[2:13:32] looked and I looked at at the my body on
[2:13:34] the
[2:13:37] bed and it began
[2:13:40] moving because when he left that
[2:13:43] body it was no longer
[2:13:47] moving and then when he went to look
[2:13:50] back
[2:13:51] that body wasn't
[2:13:53] moving because the life that was in that
[2:13:56] body was in this
[2:14:00] body six
[2:14:03] Dimension that body
[2:14:07] there was
[2:14:11] dead he says glory to
[2:14:14] God I felt a little
[2:14:17] funny and I said what happened I I feel
[2:14:20] funny
[2:14:22] and I turned around and looked and I
[2:14:24] looked my bed on that on that bed my
[2:14:27] body on that
[2:14:28] bed and it was
[2:14:32] moving and I
[2:14:36] said oh certainly I don't have to go
[2:14:42] back he had his
[2:14:45] wife his children young
[2:14:49] still the church
[2:14:52] his
[2:14:53] ministry but being over
[2:14:58] there but knowing that he said oh really
[2:15:01] I don't want to have to go
[2:15:03] back don't let it
[2:15:06] happen but the
[2:15:09] gospel had to be
[2:15:11] preached and in a
[2:15:13] second I was on the bed
[2:15:19] again God
[2:15:22] he permitted the
[2:15:24] prophet to enter into his
[2:15:27] theop how was his theop he was a young
[2:15:34] man did you hear in this
[2:15:37] testimony that
[2:15:40] William that all had
[2:15:43] wings nobody had wings nobody had wings
[2:15:47] he didn't have wings nobody had
[2:15:49] wings the he said that they were men
[2:15:52] they were
[2:15:54] women there
[2:15:58] was the horse or the dog had
[2:16:02] wings all of the
[2:16:05] same how God made them originally were
[2:16:08] the
[2:16:09] same
[2:16:11] am in the
[2:16:13] message Israel and the
[2:16:19] church now we're here who are getting
[2:16:21] along
[2:16:23] past when a man and a woman
[2:16:26] pass 25 years
[2:16:29] old you might as well say face it you're
[2:16:33] not a
[2:16:34] you those days are
[2:16:37] finished and to
[2:16:41] think to think that glorious
[2:16:45] promise and we're
[2:16:49] facing and with the setting of the son
[2:16:52] what is it is life finished no oh
[2:16:56] no life just has
[2:17:00] begun oh if we just had the
[2:17:03] time to uh
[2:17:09] calmly to go over these
[2:17:12] scriptures before the
[2:17:16] people there they are
[2:17:19] friends I can prove by God's
[2:17:22] Bible hope of the holy
[2:17:26] spirit that every one of you that's
[2:17:31] in that one of these
[2:17:33] days those gray hairs will and those
[2:17:37] wrinkles run from your
[2:17:40] face and you'll go
[2:17:43] back a young man at
[2:17:46] one live forever with
[2:17:49] Christ I can show you
[2:17:52] where God proves it in his
[2:17:55] Bible he showed the
[2:17:57] shadows and the promise
[2:18:00] it swore by it that he'd do
[2:18:07] it then he said will I love my wife then
[2:18:12] sure more than I do
[2:18:14] now I don't know how it could be but I
[2:18:18] know it will
[2:18:19] be
[2:18:21] will she be
[2:18:22] mine sure she sure will she will be
[2:18:27] my shall be no children or
[2:18:31] nothing but the children that we have
[2:18:33] here on
[2:18:35] Earth will be there with
[2:18:38] us if they've been born again that's
[2:18:42] right but they're not going to be
[2:18:46] children fathers and
[2:18:49] mothers fathers and
[2:18:51] Sons they're going to
[2:18:54] see they're going to be the same
[2:19:03] age the prophet
[2:19:06] says and the message Israel in the
[2:19:10] church
[2:19:12] 1953 I used to
[2:19:15] think I say well forgive me excuse
[2:19:19] me was before you knew better
[2:19:23] too that we used to have
[2:19:26] wings and we were going to be flying
[2:19:28] around you
[2:19:31] know I like to eat and
[2:19:33] drink sh hands with the people and I
[2:19:38] thought and one that'll finish then oh
[2:19:41] no oh
[2:19:42] no I I I
[2:19:47] noticed and I found that God never did
[2:19:50] make me an angel
[2:19:52] he made me a
[2:19:53] man I will always be a
[2:19:56] man be an
[2:19:58] angel that's an
[2:20:00] error God has angels He made
[2:20:04] angels He made Caribs
[2:20:07] with and he made Angels
[2:20:10] without and when I
[2:20:12] heard these old
[2:20:15] songs when I was a
[2:20:17] sinner and I would go in those
[2:20:19] places and an angel would be waiting for
[2:20:22] me and I thought an
[2:20:27] angel and I'm going to be an angel and I
[2:20:30] noticed and I found out that is a lie of
[2:20:35] the
[2:20:36] devil that never took
[2:20:40] place you
[2:20:42] notice and and
[2:20:44] now in this
[2:20:49] message the the
[2:20:51] teaching is
[2:20:56] shown and the angel of the picture of
[2:20:59] the
[2:21:00] Ang and the
[2:21:02] angels and the angel
[2:21:05] singular in the
[2:21:07] picture of Life
[2:21:12] magazine the angel that you can see with
[2:21:14] his wings
[2:21:16] back that same
[2:21:19] Angel it is the theophany the William
[2:21:21] Bram of William
[2:21:24] brandham and the prophet
[2:21:29] says that is an
[2:21:32] error and he even goes to past that to
[2:21:35] say that it's an
[2:21:38] error he
[2:21:41] says it's a
[2:21:43] lie of the
[2:21:49] devil
[2:21:52] when I used to hear those songs old
[2:21:55] songs when I was a
[2:21:58] sinner and I would go to those
[2:22:00] places and they would play that music
[2:22:03] the
[2:22:06] record and a angel would be waiting for
[2:22:08] me and I
[2:22:11] said and I thought and I'm going to be
[2:22:13] an
[2:22:14] angel and the prophet says and I I I
[2:22:18] found
[2:22:19] out
[2:22:21] that's a lie of the
[2:22:23] devil there's no such thing in the
[2:22:28] message and the
[2:22:30] church that's paragraph 15 and verse
[2:22:38] 16 his
[2:22:43] testimon how that you see the the
[2:22:47] theop William how the theophany of
[2:22:50] William
[2:22:52] brandham that's a young
[2:22:55] man I looked at him and they were
[2:23:00] young and in the in the earth he was a
[2:23:03] man that was
[2:23:04] bald and but there he
[2:23:07] says but I put my hands on my head and I
[2:23:10] had
[2:23:13] hair no no wings
[2:23:16] hair a young man amen
[2:23:23] and the prophet
[2:23:26] said the angel of the
[2:23:28] Covenant that appeared to Moses in the
[2:23:33] desert and the same Angel of the
[2:23:36] Covenant that
[2:23:38] appeared it appeared to Apostle
[2:23:41] Paul and the road of
[2:23:44] Damascus and the same Angel of the
[2:23:47] Covenant and it was in the picture Life
[2:23:51] Magazine Life
[2:23:53] Magazine who that
[2:23:55] angel this the
[2:23:58] seventh the one that was more
[2:24:04] notable the angel of the
[2:24:07] Covenant
[2:24:09] Christ the pillar of
[2:24:12] fire it's one more
[2:24:15] time it's God showing
[2:24:19] us God the same yesterday today and
[2:24:23] forever and he won't break his
[2:24:26] scripture he'll fulfill
[2:24:28] it let's stand
[2:24:37] please the prophet said in his
[2:24:44] testimony and I was scared of
[2:24:48] death because I was going to leave um
[2:24:51] say that one more
[2:24:53] time and I was scared of
[2:24:57] death because I was coming to this
[2:25:00] place in on the in the on the other just
[2:25:03] the contr just the
[2:25:05] contrary to reach when I reach that
[2:25:09] place that sixth
[2:25:11] Dimension that Celestial body that
[2:25:18] theophany when I noticed that I had had
[2:25:20] to go
[2:25:23] back he felt he was
[2:25:27] burdened he said no Lord God certainly I
[2:25:31] don't have to go back to that
[2:25:35] body that old
[2:25:40] body and um filled
[2:25:43] with woes and troubles and
[2:25:47] troubles filled with complex
[2:25:52] human no no I don't want to return in a
[2:25:55] second in a moment he was there once
[2:25:58] more he was
[2:26:00] back and he says now I know why because
[2:26:04] the the the um Evangel the word of God
[2:26:08] the
[2:26:09] gospel had to be
[2:26:11] preached and the
[2:26:13] testimony and this
[2:26:16] experience it had to be had to be Pro
[2:26:19] proclaimed
[2:26:21] to encourage one of each one of
[2:26:23] us don't be scared of the
[2:26:26] death we're not going to be a
[2:26:29] spirit we're not going to be a
[2:26:32] cloud we're going to be men and
[2:26:36] women the same way
[2:26:39] asist like the logos that came from
[2:26:42] God and the theophany of God Moses saw
[2:26:47] it the behind part back of a man it was
[2:26:50] a
[2:26:55] man and William
[2:26:58] Bram and he saw it face to
[2:27:00] face you remember in that
[2:27:08] Fieldy he looked
[2:27:11] above and not much more than this
[2:27:14] ceiling I seen Jesus in a white
[2:27:18] Rob the wind was blowing it his
[2:27:26] rope he made a noise with his
[2:27:31] throat and Jesus didn't see him didn't
[2:27:35] look
[2:27:36] at when he said
[2:27:38] Jesus he
[2:27:40] turned he saw he looked at me eye to eye
[2:27:44] face to
[2:27:46] face
[2:27:49] signifying
[2:27:50] this book of
[2:27:51] redemption these Seven
[2:27:53] Seals they're
[2:27:56] open Moses could only see the hind pack
[2:27:59] part of the back because the book was
[2:28:04] closed because when the
[2:28:08] reation of This Book of redemption comes
[2:28:11] you are seeing Jesus face to
[2:28:16] face as you see the picture here
[2:28:20] of
[2:28:22] Christ and the prophet
[2:28:25] said when he first saw the painting of
[2:28:28] this of this
[2:28:30] artist of 300 years

[2:28:36] him and that's the one I
