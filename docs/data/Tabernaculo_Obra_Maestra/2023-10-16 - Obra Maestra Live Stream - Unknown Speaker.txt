am [Applause] I see this say say [Music] God bless you all this morning it's good to be back again it was a a long [Music] trip we hadn't taken one that long in a while we had been uh years ago to South Africa you may be seated just for a minute as we speak a little bit and but that's been a while and uh of course it's it's nice that as human beings we do have a way of forgetting sometimes of how long the journeys were I believe when we went to South Africa I think just the flight from New York City to Johannesburg South Africa Johannesburg sou Africa just that part of the trip alone was uh I think 17 or 18 hours of the air so uh the flights were not that long this time overall it was it was depending on where where the planes go it's 24 to 30 hours and and so I think the the flights averaged um coming back from brazaville we from there we flew back to kinasa which is another country then from there we flew to Paris so by the time we started the journey to the time we land in Paris it was probably about 12 hours so we lay over there for a few hours maybe maybe three maybe a little more than three hours and then we flew from there back to Detroit Michigan again which is about another 8 hours so but we were back in the United States of America it felt good to be back on American soil again uh if you had ever had the chance to go to Congo the minute you arrive you you'd say Mexico the the the architecture the buildings uh it's very similar uh as it is in many third world countries even as it is in the the Caribbean islands it's very much the the way they build is just like being in Mexico also and so very familiar sites when you arrive there uh then you don't you don't feel too out of place except that you're the lightest skinned person of about everyone around you you know but there was a brother from Dallas there also a white brother and I told them you've never looked more white than right now I tell he said I've never felt more white it was a brother Cosman Stefan Stan he's originally from Romania R but he's been living there in Dallas for many years now attends Brother David mcgary's assembly M and uh he does he does the work of an evangelist and missionary work and uh we certainly enjoyed his ministry and he and he he blessed the people there in brazaville greatly there was other brothers there a local Pastor a Brother P who also ministered pimber p and who also ministered um a brother from Belgium Bel Brother pel P and and uh also ministered there also there was so there was several Brethren that ministered we were given the very first night of the meetings and uh so I just said how come I have to break the ice he said you have been chosen for this purpose so we Minister the first night of the services then we got a little rest and then the Sunday morning we we ministered again which was the last the last service and the the meetings were held in in the in the Tabernacle that they have now it was actually I realized it was their anniversary services for brother R Rafael Rafael CA the pastor they've been there for about 30 3 years now when he started the work so he pastored and started the work in a time when when when Congo when Congo there in the capital city was in a a violent Civil War and uh brazille is a city of about 2 million people it's the capital of the nation the president lives there and uh it it is a city I say of two million and if you can imagine being right in the middle of Mexico City the in the poorest part of of of Mexico City you're getting close you're getting close to imagining what brazaville is like that's congested very congested streets are narrow you would think when I arried that there's I think there's a lot of one-way streets there but none of them are oneway streets they're just very congested and narrow streets so in this city of two million people there are no stop signs and there are no traffic lights you might think but but there's got to be at least one brother Daniel zero none two million people in a congested City the traffic moves Bumper to Bumper crawling around each other and there's no guidance from hardly any police anywhere and that's the way the traffic all day long is moving but not very fast too fast to be so close but it's not really moving very quickly brazaville Congo brazaville Congo it's almost a um a country in Anarchy in the traffic anarch and but by the grace of God there is people there believing the same word that you believe outside of being a believer in Congo I can't I can't see how the people there have any hope at all to to ever be able to leave the country country and live a better life because the nation itself makes no opportunity for the people whatsoever so it's a difficult place to live and even as I share this with you I cannot emphasize the poverty of this people of Congo and how they live on a daily basis where as you go down the streets like Mexico every door you see is somebody's little somebody's little shop and in front of every shop on the sidewalks uh our people sitting down with a little pile of things that they're selling and the brother the Brother David Caba as we're traveling in the street I tell them there's so many Street vendors no vendor many people Street vendors on the the streets and the Brother David says if you'll notice everything they're selling is used nothing is new from the shoes to the toys to a blanket to a pillow to a everything is used second nothing is news nothing is new and as I started focusing more and watching it I so wowow and yet in the city of brazaville there shines a light and there's great hope there's a people to whom this word of God has been revealed there's a people who have made made the Bible their book and have received Jesus Christ as their personal savior so in the midst of all the poverty these are the ones whose smile is shining the brightest these are the ones that when you shake their hands they give you a an embrace these are the ones in Congo who have great hope because Jesus Christ has given them great hope they really do live by faith and not by sight some of us might have older cars and we think wow sometime I need a better nicer car and we say I'm going to believe my faith and then circumstances unfold and an opportunity comes up and we get a nicer car most of the brethren in Congo they will never have a car not even an old car not even a broken down car they will not be able to ever afford any kind of car the city um is full of the the city moves by taxi and uh they're all painted the same color by government mandate but they're all independently owned owned there are more taxis on the street of brazille then there are independent vehicles that you see driving because that's the transportation of the Common People one congol Le dollar or let me say it takes over 600 Congo dollars to make one American dollar so the chances of a average congol conges citizen so the chances to travel outside of Congo is almost a miracle for each one if they can even get out so with all that said I invite you to put on your prayer list the brother the Brethren of Congo they are they are building a new church they are building they are building and uh that they hope to finish by the end of next year so of course they have invited us to go back and I said I will surely pray as you know you've experienced yourself once you arrive somewhere and you're in the presence of God's people and his children well it's a wonderful experience but the thought of how long it'll take me to get there is is the part we think about so we did meet with uh other brothers and pastors brother rapael has a son who lives in Parish France brother Sal and brother pH is a brother from a pastor in Belgium so of course they have invited us to come and Minister for them it's a little shorter trip but it's not a three-hour trip trip either so the the traveling is is heavy but of course arriving and being with the Saints and seeing what God is doing around the world it inspires us that there is a Revival taking place amongst a little flock called The Bride of Jesus Christ there are people that despite the wickedness in this world there are people the wickedness in this world are giving themselves to the Holiness of God and we've had an opportunity to meet them all around the world from South Africa AF to Congo to the islands of Canada Newland to Venezuela Venezuela to Brazil Brazil to the South Pacific Islands all over this world in Europe in France and belgi God has a little flock uh members of the Bride of Jesus Christ who who are who Whose desire is to serve the Lord Jesus with hearts full of Thanksgiving and anointed of the Holy Spirit to every to overcome every strong Temptation the things we there are things here that that that you go through troubles and trials of life and there are things in Congo that you will never go through that the people there go through but nonetheless when you overcome here by the word and when they overcome over there by the word makes all of you from Congo to Phoenix Pho Overcomers of The Temptations of this world we're not better or worse cuz we're in America as far as persons and the brother the people in Congo are not a better or worse people we're all human beings upon the the face of the Earth and God has made a way for us that we can all regardless of what country we're in that we can be born again of the spirit of God and grow into the stature of a perfect man in Jesus Christ but I will say this for the time being for the time being you can all say it sure is good to be in the USA troubles will come a Great Tribulation will change the United States and turn it into uh a a country destroyed by War but meanwhile I want to tell you it's good to be in the USA stand to your feet we bring greetings from Brother Rafel the other ministers and pastors sending their greetings to all of you and uh we invited a couple of them to come here we we'll see if that if that happens in the future it's uh it's it's uh difficult for them also to travel uh even as it is for us but should one of the brothers come I'm sure it would be a blessing for all of us here so this morning in the light of what we see happening I'm sure you've all read the news Israel has declared war on this group called Hamas they they're they're within the boundaries of the land of Israel so you you have you of course you know that when Israel goes to war All Nations go to war with her be because Hamas has allies on the Arab countries allies and they Supply them with bombs and and guns and weapons and and Israel has allies on the other side and even the US supplies them with bombs and weapons and nuclear weapons when Wars like this begin everybody begins taking sides according to what's going to benefit them as a nation so not everyone who is an ally with Israel are friends with Israel not everyone who is allied with Hamas and the Palestinians are truly friends of Hamas and the Palestinians but at the the moment it benefits them to take sides with one or the other and that's what we'd like to speak on this morning For Whom Shall I fight and what shall be the weapons of my Warfare correct Matthew chapter 6 we'll begin reading and in verse One For Whom Shall I fight and what shall be the weapons of my Warfare Matthew 6 verse1 it it reads like this take heed that you do not your arms before men to be seen of them otherwise you have no reward of your father which is in heaven verse six we'll go to he said but when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou has shut thy door pray to the father if you'll remember brother brandham had a vision of this great tent meeting of a great tent meeting tent and uh in in this tent meeting he he had told us that the vision had come to pass that that that this Vision came to pass in the in in the healing campaigns in Mexico City but in this Vision off to the side he saw this little room and in this little room he saw a woman walk in by herself and she came out on the other side completely healed then he saw a man go in I believe that was in a wheelchair and when he came out he came out walking and in the vision the Holy Spirit told him I'll meet you in that room and and brother Bram in the vision he said he asked the angel what was that little room and the angel took him to the scriptures in Matthew 6 and6 and he says don't you remember this verse he says but when thou prayest enter into thy closet and when thou H has shut thy door pray to the father there was coming a time and now is that time when it'll take a person when it's going to be a personal experience with Jesus Christ we love to gather together as as a group and we should and I'll share the word with you as best as I can and you'll realize that maybe brother Daniel repeats himself a lot sometimes and and that is a true statement sometimes it's very much on purpose because as I repeat one certain point I'm hoping you can take it to the scriptures and enter into your prayer closet because I know it's there that God can even open more to you I can try to give you more but if you surrender to him and prayer in your prayer closet he won't try if you surrender he will do it he will Open the Eyes of your understanding he will soften your heart with oil Matthew 6 and verse 9 now after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name let's pray Heavenly Father you're the Lamb of God are the only one that can open this book for for this new testament this New Testament is this is the Lamb's Book of Life for you the lamb are the one that spoke it in Parables this is your book and you alone Can Open the Eyes of understanding go from bench to bench go from heart to heart and you Open the Eyes of our understanding in Jesus name amen am you may be seated these are the weapons of our Warfare this is really a battle prayer at the opening of the word the first seal loosed don't let the term first seal trouble you it's just the way God HD his Plan of Redemption you can also think of this first seal of Revelation 61 as part one as part one as of a plan to restore you to bring you a born again experience to help you to become justified by faith to sanctify You by his spirit to baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire you realize that's the first seal you realize that that was that was part one you realize that these are the Mysteries hidden in the Lamb's Book of Life this new testament this is the Lamb's Book and it's a book of life is it not in in Matthew verse 9 chapter 6 ver9 it says after this manner therefore pray ye Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name and the name hadn't been revealed yet but but in Parables he was already speaking it that there would come a new name of God it wouldn't be Jehovah no more it wouldn't be yahi no more it wouldn't be just Adonai no more a new name was coming you know how offensive that was to Israel that was blasphemy but not to those to whom it was being revealed they saw the life of the man they saw his him as an evangelist praying for the sick they saw Jesus heal thousands they saw Jesus raise the dead they saw Jesus open the blinded eyes they saw Jesus healed the they saw Jesus cleanse the lepers and when they saw it and it and the Miracles caught their attention they said well if this is what he's doing I want to listen to his message what he's saying that's why there was a great healing campaign at the beginning at the first coming of Christ in the ministry of Jesus of Nazareth no man ever spoke like him or did the Miracles he did Matthew verse 10 thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread forgive us our depths as we forgive our deor and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen verse 14 if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you when Jesus came to Israel Israel was under the law but they were not fulfilling the law they were not abiding by the law they were not worshippers of Jehovah no more the synagogue had become a den of Thieves it was no longer a house of prayer that was the condition of the Jewish church when Jesus came they were in bondage they were in slavery the Romans had controlled everything in their day they were the world leaders they they ruled over Israel with an iron fist it was a it was a great civil war the world was at War and Rome controlled everything Rome a pagan Nation Roma ROM pagana but the Jewish leadership were as Pagan as the Romans themselves Rome held Israel in bondage and and the high priest and the Jewish priesthood held the people of Israel in a religious slavery see so the condition of the world when Jesus came was a condition of war a condition of slavery a condition with little hope and Jesus came with this prayer he said in verse 13 and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever and then he says to the people of Israel who are in slavery whose families are being killed off and young men whose children are being taken by the Romans to be slaves in the homes of Roman leaders and in the midst of this horrible environment that the world is in he tells Israel if ye for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you and the Jew and the Jewish people say forgive Rome Fort taking our land for killing our fathers for killing our grandparents for killing our children for you're talking about forgiveness then will be forgiven we have nothing to forgive them for we want their death Israel and all the people of that time listen to verse 15 but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses and Jesus was saying it in a time when Israel was in bondage to a pagan Nation who daily abused them who daily killed them and Jesus presents this prayer to the people of Israel you think they received it you think Israel received it they wanted Vengeance they wanted blood they wanted back their land and humanly speaking it all all sounds like that's the right thing God gave Abraham this land and to his people This Is Our [Music] Land and then Jesus comes and tells them you've got the wrong attitude in order to get back the land no the way you you'll get it back is when you can forgive men their trespasses and then on top of asking them to forgive he challenges them and tells them in verse 15 but if ye forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses it's a prayer that's with us yet today it wasn't just for Israel it was for you as a husband to your wife it was for you as a wife to her husband this is your prayer this is how you overcome any Civil Wars happening in the home the Bible says you're in a civil war at home father mother son daughter how do you handle it the human nature tells us I know how to handle it Fight Fire with Fire have you heard that one if you've never been born again that's your approach but if you've been born again you realize how to overcome how to win this battle and it says if you forgive men their trespasses if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you and if you can dare to say I don't need them to forgive me you you just proclaimed with your own words that you need to forgive and then you'll will be forgiven in Wars you do not forgive men their trespasses that's why Wars are fought Nations declare Wars as they have even in our day today because a trespass will not be forgiven Civil Wars arise world wars have have risen because a trass because a trespass would not and could not be [Music] forgiven couples divorce because a trespass cannot or will not be forgiven friends cease to be friends because one or both feel that there's a trespass that cannot be forgiven why the wars amongst Nation why the wars amongst Brothers why the wars amongst husbands and [Music] wives because they won't take the trespass before God In Prayer in that in that little prayer closet and seek his wisdom and his consel here is the consel of God in a time of war and it was a time of of war and civil unrest that Jesus said this Matthew 6:14 for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you if ye forget if ye forgive men their trespasses it isn't uh well I didn't like what he said I it kind of sounded like he was saying something about me that wasn't too nice oh was no here Jesus is saying that man that woman has you has absolutely said something terrible about you then he tells us but if you can forgive them your heavenly father will also forgive you because we all cross the line somewhere they say when you point a finger at someone there's three pointing back verse 15 but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses and a man that's been forgiven and and and a maniv and has forgiven others that man that woman woman can do it because they've been born again it takes a born again experience to accept this prayer spoken in a parable For Whom Shall I fight because the world is taking sides people you work with are taking sides relatives that you love are taking sides everyone is taking sides right now you open up you open up any news station right now and people are screaming in the streets whose side they're taking I'd like to read a a quote from a from a message called show us the father and it will satisfy us the prophet said this he said Lord our hearts tonight as we look out across the world and see great signs of scriptures being fulfilled and see the worlds as it was staggering with with a headache ban a headache band around it not Crown not a crown one wondering what's next great Atomic weapons hydrogen bombs and everything in the hands of sinful men and he said this in 1953 you would think this was just said for today he says with one relay of that could blow the Earth to bits and knowing this that the Bible has spoke so definitely of the last days how these things would be he says looking around at the nature of the people seeing that we're in the spirit of the last day he said in the anti- deluvian time he says they had to get in the spirit of the anti lovian world before they could be destroyed they have to be in the spirit of War before they can have War do you know Lucifer has prare been putting the people in the spirit of War since before I was born do you know in this Modern Age every movie every video everything that comes out of Hollywood even the even Disney World that the children that watch and sit for hours it's full of death it's full of vulgarity it's full of sexual abuse it's full of sexual Slavery full of murder it's full of killing it's full of brutality oh Lucifer preparing the hearts of people today for war they're the world is ready for this war Lucifer's been preparing them Lu because he's wanting to destroy everyone on the face of the earth and the people follow him like dogs on a leash she's taking the whole world and unless you're born again he'll tie the leash around your neck too that's why we've got to feed on the word of God and live in his presence because then we're preparing for life not death then we're preparing for peace not war he says they have to be in the spirit of War you have to be in the spirit of War before you can have war God let let us be in the spirit of Christ so we can have Christ let us be in the spirit of repentance a spirit of Faith give it us give it to us today father of these great Treasures of life in these great Treasures of Life they're free just for the asking and realizing that the greatest things of life and the only real lasting things are the Unseen and may thy Spirit come tonight and fill every heart reclaim every backslider and save every sinner and those who are seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit may he come today and fill every heart May the sick be healed and God receive glory for we ask it in the name of his beloved Son Jesus our lord the spirit of this last day you have to be in the spirit of War before you can have War you've got to be in the spirit of of adultery before you can commit adultery you say did you know so and so ran off with another man's wife he's been in the spirit of adultery long before he ran off with another man's wife he's been feeding on that for a long time it didn't just happen the spirit of the last day you have to be in the spirit of War before you can have War someone might ask you don't you think Israel should do this and the Palestinians do that and when they see that you're not too excited don't you even care that people are dying what they're asking you for is to take sides and and and say yes it should be an eye for an eye so who should should die so that leaders of the world can feel Justified an Israeli baby an Israeli baby or a Palestinian baby neither but why are they dying because the world is in a spirit of War and Lucifer has been preparing the minds of the world and Hollywood producers anointed from the pits of hell and Lucifer leading us all down that road like sheeps to a Slaughter and we can't get our eyes off these videos and games I'm sitting in the airplane uh in the airplane the lights all go off they turn off the lights and we're going to be in the air for eight hours and everybody's movie screens start turning on all over and someone next to me is watching a film i' never seen it I had heard the title I heard the title it was called um Fast and Furious it is a fast moving action film it's all about murder and killing it's all about destruction it's all about the masses dying and I turn to the right and an elderly woman I say Elder maybe five or six years older than me mid 70s her in a husband she puts on a movie it couldn't have been more vulgar I can't hear it she's got her little earbuds on but it's a movie about trans vites transgender people glorifying them and she watches the entire thing an old woman somebody's Grandma feeding on the most vulgar thing you could imagine Satan preparing the hearts for Destruction the spirit of this last day you have to be in the spirit of War before you can have War you have to be in the spirit of War to take a definite side with one or the other you say well shouldn't we take sides with Israel brother [Music] Daniel the government of Israel Are pagan ungodly leaders just like the leaders of America but yes there's a little remnant of Jews in Israel who are praying waiting for messiah to return like here in America there's a little flock a little remnant of Believers for Waiting on Jesus to come back and take us home but the nation both anointed of Lucifer are at war with each other Lucifer Luci can bring two enemies together to fulfill his purpose he did it in the days of Jesus Lucifer anointed the high priest of Israel Lucifer anointed the leaders of [Music] Rome to come together and crucify Jesus Christ they were enemies but they worked together to put him on the cross or they thought they were working together we know it was the great plan of God we know it was the beginning of a New Covenant we know it was the beginning of everlasting peace you see in the beginning and Eden Mary received the seed that Eve should have t received right do you see it Mary received the spoken word seed of God placed in her womb had nothing to do with the sexual desire of a man or a woman she became an incubator for this seed she was fertile ground for this seed and this seed was the Son of God the beginning of a new creation that's the seed that Eve forfeited instead she said she took the shortcut because the devil con convinced her I have a shortcut for you he says how long has God been training you and atam up and how long will it be till he brings his promise to pass in your heart she says I don't know he says well let me tell you something I can make it happen for you right now no more waiting it was a lie of the devil it brought the fall of mankind and for 4,000 years men and women are at War children are dying of all the world and then one day for 4,000 years later then Jesus came the Prince of Peace who wants to teach you how to think differently because if you let Satan anoint you in this Spirit of War you're going to have more problems with your children you let Satan anoints you to take sides in the spirit of War you're going to have more problems in your if you let Satan anoint you with the spirit of War you're going to have more problems in your job but if we can be born again receive the baptism of the Holy G receive the prince of peace and not the prince of predition the one who is the way the truth and the life not the one whose name is death riding a Pale Horse and he is riding already the pale horse rider began in the Days of Elijah this end time as the white horse rider also began in the Days of Elijah that was John the Baptist the spirit of this last day you have to be in the spirit of War before you can have War why do you think the most popular Hollywood movies internet video games rock and roll rock roll country music country you listen to the lyrics even of some of it sounds so nice and as nice as some of them sound they're pushing you into the spirit of War they're pushing you to take sides with somebody on this planet Earth don't do it take sides with Jesus with the Prince of Peace the music of this world all about killings it's anointing the world for a great Destruction for a Great Tribulation in the spirit of War you will not forgive the nation its trespasses in the spirit of War you will not forgive your brother or sister there trespass in the spirit of War you will not forgive your spouse or or his or her trespass in the spirit of War Americans are arming themselves with pistols rifles automatic semi-automatic weapons they're preparing for a trespass by an individual by an individual or their very own government that they will say they cannot forgive it Jesus said he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword whether it's a husband and wife in the home or or two Nations we cannot live by the sword unless it be the sword of God unless it be the word of God because that sword is a double-edged sword and that sword speaks better things that sword say says if you forgive I'll forgive you Jesus said he who lives by the sword shall die by the sword you're considered a hero you are considered a hero and a Patriot if you'll kill or die for your nation but the question is for whom will I fight and what shall be the weapons of my Warfare the year was 1974 I was 18 years old I got a letter in the mail it the Army was a draft you didn't join the Army it was mandatory no we did we we we didn't join the Army then we we it was a it was a mandate you had to sign up for the draft and if and they had a certain numbering system and if they called that number you were going to Vietnam there was no question I had some friends that said I won't wait I the The Waiting makes me nervous I'm just going to sign up and go to Vietnam two went one his name was David one was name was George they were about five years older than me they survived they came back blind in one eye shrapnel in all their hips areas that couldn't be removed from explosions metal in in their bodies and they both made it back home wounded uh twisted up and I remember the day I went to sign up for the draft at the federal building and my neighbor David saw me coming home my neighbor M and he says dan where did you go I had to I said I just signed up for the draff and he was smiling when he saw me he wasn't smiling no more he said don't go he said they're just sending you there to get you killed he said there ain't no heroes in Vietnam just casualties we're not fighting for America we're fighting because politicians want us to fight he says pick a spot he said Mexico or Canada I will take you to the Border he said I'll give you some money and while we're at war with Vietnam don't never come back I said it can't be that bad David he says I can't tell you how bad it is I don't have the words all I can tell you is almost every night in nightmares I wake up screaming of the things I've saw of the things I did I feel like if there's someone worthy of going to hell it's me now he says and yet I didn't ask to go there I didn't ask to be trained to be a killer but I got caught up in the spirit of War instead of getting caught up in the spirit of Christ The Prince of Peace Matthew 4 and ver8 again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them that's what the military does to our young people that's how they recruit them to be to be an Army Ranger to be in the army to be a Navy SEAL to be a a secret service Delta offensive unit all Special Forces of all the Armed Forces all Special Forces they tell them of the glory what it is to be a super warrior in this day and yet they're just training you to be an assassin for Joe Biden to be an assassin for Nancy Pelosi to be an assassin for congressmen and Senators so while you're off killing and being killed they're sitting with a suit behind a desk doing an interview on NBC or ABC all dressed up nice saying we're glad to say happy to say that America is winning this war and a little mother somewhere says if we're winning this war why is it my son's dead and we couldn't even recover his body to be at War you must be in the spirit of War to be at peace you need the spirit of peace that's the Prince of Peace that's a born again experience why would young men in this message why would they sign up to get involved in the armed forces voluntarily because they don't Rel what they've been feeding on is the spirit of War they don't see it they need a revelation they need a born again experience you say but there's such nice young men but they haven't been born again and they've been feeding on the wrong message verse 9 of Matthew 4 and saith unto him all these things will I give you young man if thou will fall down and worship me you relies on Mount Temptation that Lucifer was trying to entice a young man he was just 30 years old 29 he's trying to bring this young man down but he didn't know who he was talking to he said and verse n and saith unto him all these things will I give you if you will fall down and worship me this is the answer when as a young man you're being enticed to do something and someone's showing you how glorious it's going to be this is your answer then said Jesus unto him get the H Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve and so if you fight for your nation today any Nation who are you really fighting for the Devil Himself do I justify all the lives that are being killed no no but there won't be peace on Earth until sin is is cleansed from the face of the Earth the question today of world peace is it coming by politics is it going to come by the United Nations he said I say no it's always failed and it will again and again but there remains a true answer to the question will there be peace on the earth yes When sin is ridden off the Earth there will be peace but not until that time there will be no peace Nation will rise against na Nation Kingdom against Kingdom but God gave a remedy for sin listen close now God gave the remedy to rid sin off the Earth but but men of the Earth won't accept God's remedy you say brother Daniel what is the remedy he must be born again you must be born again of the spirit of Christ then you will find peace but it's not for all but because you're here this morning I want to believe it's for you I want to believe it's for me I want to believe it's for our children you cannot go to war unless you've entered into the spirit of War whether it's in your home in the city of Phoenix in the state of Arizona in the nation of the United States of you cannot go to war unless you've been getting into things that are putting you in the spirit of War so leaving Israel and Hamas and all the wars that are taking place you know they're not the only nation at War as we speak we have the Russia Ukraine war as I speak there's a nation called Mayar in Civil War right now thousands are dying the nation of Ethiopia is in a civil war thousands are dying right now the nation of Afghanistan is in a civil war thousands are dying right now China is looking at Taiwan they want to take it and by force they want to take it but America America is floating its battleships around Taiwan America is flying F35 fighter jets around Taiwan tell China if you take if you take Taiwan by force there will be war between us oh we're living 1 minute till midnight right now Iran Israel the USA are this far from nuclear war the country of Yemen is in a civil war the country of Haiti is in a civil war violent gangs controlling most of the capital the nation Mexico is in a drug war that's been going on and thousands are dying daily Colombia another drug war and it spreads to all the countries around them as I told you for right now say Lord Jesus I thank you that I'm living in the USA if you could travel abroad and see the poverty see the killings see the abuse see women and children and Men dying but it will come to America it will come how do you escape in closing let's read it one more time Matthew 6 m and verse one verse n we'll start after this manner therefore pray ye remember this was a time of war and civil and and and Civil War and slavery for Israel they were a people being slaughtered by the Romans they wanted Vengeance they wanted someone to rise up they wanted Messiah to come and destroy and put the Romans out of their land and their desire came because Messiah did and when he came he said this is how we're going to do it folks I know you've been praying for vengeance to get the Romans these Roman dogs out of your land this is how you'll do it after this manner I want you to pray differently from this day on I want you to say it like this Our Father which are in heaven Hallowed be thy name verse n thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven Lord don't fix this Kingdom don't make America great again bring your kingdom down lord Jesus thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven and while we are in this terrible world that's war and while we are in this terrible world of War then to your children give us our this day our daily Our Daily Bread verse 11 and in this time of War forgive us our debts verse 12 as we forgive our debors and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom the power and the glory forever amen amen this was the prayer that God gave to Israel in a time when they were in a spirit of War he was wanting to bring them into a spirit of peace the holy spirit because that way while the world is at War you can be at peace your home can be at peace your wife can be at peace your husband can be at peace with you your sons and daughters can be at peace with you because we're not getting wrapped up in the spirit of War of this world and the spirit and the bride say as we stand to our feet come quickly Lord Jesus as we bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you once again we pray pray that something was said to help
