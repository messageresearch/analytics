[1:06:32] pray come and lay hands on her and she
[1:06:35] may be healed and she shall
[1:06:43] live it says and Jesus went with him
[1:06:46] much people followed him and thronged
[1:06:52] him amen amen and then we can go down to
[1:06:56] verse
[1:06:58] 35 it says well yet he spake there came
[1:07:01] rulers of the synagogue's house certain
[1:07:04] which said thy daughter is dead why
[1:07:07] troubles thou Master any
[1:07:16] further so someone's daughter was in
[1:07:20] need amen and he went to Jesus asking
[1:07:23] him to come and touch his
[1:07:26] daughter and while they're on the
[1:07:29] way other people
[1:07:31] come they go to that the the girl's
[1:07:35] dad and say your daughter's
[1:07:38] dead amen how hard that could have been
[1:07:41] to
[1:07:43] hear how tough that could have been to
[1:07:45] take
[1:07:47] in but the Bible
[1:07:50] says on 36 he says as soon as Jesus
[1:07:53] heard heard the word that was spoken
[1:07:56] from those
[1:08:01] men he said to the rulers of the
[1:08:03] synagogue 36 be not afraid but only
[1:08:10] believe amen because they gave him tough
[1:08:15] news but the Bible says that Jesus heard
[1:08:18] what they were
[1:08:20] saying and he said be not afraid but
[1:08:23] only
[1:08:25] Bel amen amen 37 says and he suffered no
[1:08:29] man to follow him sa Peter James and
[1:08:31] John and the brother of
[1:08:36] James and he come to the house of the
[1:08:39] rulers of the synagogue and they seen
[1:08:41] the tomal and them that wept and welled
[1:08:44] greatly
[1:08:49] 38 in verse 39 it says and when he come
[1:08:52] in he says unto him why make it she Aldo
[1:08:55] and Weep the damsel is not dead but
[1:09:02] sleepeth amen you may have your
[1:09:05] seats but after he had told him that she
[1:09:08] wasn't dead but she's that she's
[1:09:13] sleeping the Bible says in verse
[1:09:15] 40 that they laughed at
[1:09:20] him because they couldn't
[1:09:22] believe that she could have just been
[1:09:25] sleeping amen amen the Bible says in
[1:09:28] first
[1:09:31] Thessalonians in chapter
[1:09:34] 4 and verse
[1:09:40] 13 says but I would not have you to be
[1:09:43] ignorant Brethren concerning them which
[1:09:46] are asleep that ye sorrow not even as
[1:09:49] others which have no
[1:09:52] hope
[1:09:57] says for if we believe that Jesus died
[1:09:59] and rose again even so them also which
[1:10:01] sleep in Jesus will God bring with
[1:10:08] him for this we say unto you by the word
[1:10:11] of the Lord that that which that we
[1:10:14] which are alive remain unto the coming
[1:10:16] of the Lord shall not prevent them which
[1:10:18] are
[1:10:19] asleep
[1:10:22] 15
[1:10:30] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[1:10:32] heaven with the shout and with the voice
[1:10:33] of the Archangel with the Trump of God
[1:10:36] and the dead in Christ shall rise
[1:10:45] first amen that sounds like a
[1:10:47] resurrection to
[1:10:49] me amen amen that sounds like a
[1:10:51] resurrection to me
[1:10:54] if you could turn with me to
[1:10:57] John in chapter
[1:11:01] 11 again at verse
[1:11:08] one it says now a certain man was sick
[1:11:11] named Lazarus of Bethany the town of
[1:11:13] Mary and her sister and
[1:11:19] Martha and it was that Mary which was
[1:11:21] anointed of the Lord with that aned the
[1:11:24] Lord with anointment and wiped his feet
[1:11:27] with her hair whose brother Lazarus was
[1:11:38] sick therefore his sister said unto him
[1:11:41] saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest
[1:11:43] is
[1:11:49] sick and when Jesus heard that he said
[1:11:51] the sickness is not unto death but for
[1:11:54] the glory of God that the Son of God may
[1:11:56] be glorified
[1:12:04] thereby he said now Jesus loved Martha
[1:12:06] and her sister and
[1:12:10] Lazarus when he had heard therefore that
[1:12:12] she was sick he bought it two days still
[1:12:14] in the same place where he
[1:12:20] was Amen brother Brown says in the
[1:12:22] resurrection
[1:12:24] the message the resurrection of La
[1:12:28] Lazarus he says then when these things
[1:12:30] began to take place Mary and
[1:12:34] Martha they sent and said have Jesus
[1:12:37] come back and pray for
[1:12:43] him pray for Lazarus amen and Jesus just
[1:12:48] ignored their
[1:12:51] call Jesus just ignored their
[1:12:54] call and he went to another city further
[1:12:59] away and well then they sent again and
[1:13:01] he still ignored their
[1:13:05] call and they sent again and he kept
[1:13:11] going he turned around and said our
[1:13:13] friend Lazarus is
[1:13:18] sleepest and he said what he really was
[1:13:20] he said he said if he sleep that his
[1:13:22] discipl said if he sleepeth he doeth
[1:13:27] well but then Jesus tell his
[1:13:30] disciples he had a Time
[1:13:33] plainly he had a time in the regular
[1:13:37] language he said that Lazarus was
[1:13:40] dead and he said for your sake I'm glad
[1:13:42] I wasn't
[1:13:47] there but I go awake
[1:13:49] him he said watch at the grave
[1:13:53] see God had already showed
[1:13:55] him he says I'll go wake
[1:13:58] him amen you see now the first day
[1:14:03] passed previous things had had come
[1:14:06] in and got
[1:14:10] Lazarus they took
[1:14:12] him say they embalmed his
[1:14:15] body took him and buried
[1:14:18] him they put him in the
[1:14:21] grave all hope was gone
[1:14:25] but the second day
[1:14:26] passed it was still dark the third day
[1:14:31] passed corruption sat in his
[1:14:34] body the fourth day had
[1:14:37] come and and had done it was
[1:14:41] gone then the first thing you
[1:14:45] know somebody come that little Martha
[1:14:48] and Mary sitting at
[1:14:52] home there
[1:14:54] crying the bread bread winners was
[1:15:00] gone and they had
[1:15:02] left look look everything was
[1:15:04] gone they gave it says now that man that
[1:15:08] had had their confidence which was
[1:15:12] Jesus seemly have betrayed
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:17] them he said all hope was gone their
[1:15:20] brother was
[1:15:22] dead they they they turned out their
[1:15:25] church this man was teaching Divine
[1:15:29] Healing and their Pastor he was gone
[1:15:33] said all hope was
[1:15:35] gone see but about that
[1:15:38] time when they felt like all hope was
[1:15:42] gone about that time is when Jesus
[1:15:47] came that usually what
[1:15:50] happens he comes in the darkest hour
[1:15:54] it was the darkest hours but then Jesus
[1:15:57] came
[1:15:58] along when they started to feel like all
[1:16:00] hope was
[1:16:04] gone many people were there talking to
[1:16:07] them saying your brother is
[1:16:10] dead he's gone he ain't coming
[1:16:14] back so they maybe they're listening to
[1:16:16] that negative
[1:16:19] stuff amen but you see Jesus was coming
[1:16:21] to the house
[1:16:24] and where there is no
[1:16:25] hope hope was walking in their
[1:16:29] way amen if we can just realize
[1:16:33] that we get put in
[1:16:36] situations where it seems like there's
[1:16:38] no
[1:16:39] hope but yet watch when Jesus comes
[1:16:43] along just as Jesus came along
[1:16:46] there they came and called
[1:16:49] Jesus he didn't come he didn't come
[1:16:52] again he didn't come again but the Bible
[1:16:55] says everything works works good for
[1:16:58] those that were called according to his
[1:17:02] purpose he was working it for their
[1:17:05] good just like when we go through
[1:17:08] something he's working it for our
[1:17:11] good oh we can
[1:17:14] complain we can say why is this
[1:17:16] happening why is is
[1:17:18] happening we know why is it
[1:17:21] happening because you're called
[1:17:24] you're called to be Sons and
[1:17:26] Daughters of the Living
[1:17:28] God so we should
[1:17:30] rejoice when we're going through
[1:17:32] something so
[1:17:34] tough we're going through something so
[1:17:37] hard they we're going through a tough
[1:17:41] time imagine a person that you
[1:17:44] love God
[1:17:46] forbid my daughter one of your sons
[1:17:49] brother Kenny imagine you're out you're
[1:17:53] you're away imagine that you you're
[1:17:55] calling for someone to come and touch
[1:17:58] them and they had not come for a few
[1:18:01] days but then something ends up
[1:18:04] happening and the child
[1:18:07] dies amen amen then it's like oh the way
[1:18:11] you
[1:18:12] feel but I'll tell you what that's how
[1:18:15] they were
[1:18:15] feeling amen but when Jesus came in the
[1:18:19] picture everything changed right it
[1:18:23] wasn't the same way
[1:18:25] anymore in John
[1:18:28] 11:19 amen it says that many of the Jews
[1:18:31] came to Martha and Mary to comfort them
[1:18:34] concerning their
[1:18:38] brother then Martha as soon as she heard
[1:18:40] that Jesus was
[1:18:43] coming amen as soon as she heard Jesus
[1:18:46] was coming to that
[1:18:49] house amen she went and met him and Mary
[1:18:53] sat still in the
[1:18:56] house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord
[1:18:58] if thou had been here my brother had not
[1:19:04] died amen but I like the attitude of
[1:19:08] her look in the next
[1:19:11] verse she says but I know that even
[1:19:16] now amen amen oh God help us to to be
[1:19:20] just like
[1:19:21] her that when the situation seemed so
[1:19:26] hard oh man when she seen Jesus
[1:19:29] coming she said
[1:19:31] Lord even if my brother is the way he
[1:19:35] is even if everybody's telling me all
[1:19:38] these
[1:19:39] things but I know even
[1:19:43] now amen I know even
[1:19:46] now she believed in
[1:19:49] Jesus she believed that what he can do
[1:19:53] she said I know even
[1:19:55] now whatsoever thou will ask of
[1:19:58] God God will give it to
[1:20:01] thee and Jesus said unto her thy brother
[1:20:04] shall rise
[1:20:06] again Martha said unto him oh I know he
[1:20:10] he will rise but again in the
[1:20:12] resurrection at the last
[1:20:16] day oh I like that amen she said I I
[1:20:19] know even right
[1:20:21] now and Jesus says uh he'll Rise
[1:20:26] Again amen she didn't doubt she said I
[1:20:30] know he
[1:20:31] will but in the
[1:20:33] resurrection in the last
[1:20:36] day but God saying she'll rise right
[1:20:41] now because when he responded to
[1:20:44] her Jesus looks at
[1:20:47] her and said I am the
[1:20:51] resurrection amen and I and the life and
[1:20:55] he that believeth in
[1:20:56] me though were he were dead yet shall he
[1:21:01] live and whosoever and whosoever
[1:21:05] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[1:21:09] die he says believest Thou
[1:21:12] this she said to she said unto
[1:21:17] him she said unto him yes Lord I believe
[1:21:21] that thou are the Christ of son of Son
[1:21:22] of
[1:21:24] God which should come into the world and
[1:21:28] when she had said she went her way and
[1:21:30] called Mary her sister secretly saying
[1:21:32] the master is
[1:21:38] come amen I like that amen all that
[1:21:43] stuff they were going
[1:21:45] through everything that was happening
[1:21:47] before Jesus got
[1:21:50] there amen but when Jesus got there
[1:21:54] she said the master has
[1:21:56] come we can say that this
[1:21:59] morning to any trouble that we
[1:22:01] have we could just look at this
[1:22:04] devil look at the
[1:22:07] sicknesses look at all the things going
[1:22:09] around said I'm not
[1:22:12] afraid the the master has
[1:22:14] come the master is com in their
[1:22:18] midst look what happens when the master
[1:22:20] has
[1:22:21] come
[1:22:23] the master has come to
[1:22:25] Martha the master came to that little
[1:22:28] girl and as he was with
[1:22:31] them the master has come to us in this
[1:22:34] day to heal us of our
[1:22:38] sicknesses to give us a new life a new
[1:22:43] meaning amen amen I like when she says
[1:22:47] that
[1:22:49] amen the Bible says in verse 29 says as
[1:22:52] soon as she heard that she Rose quickly
[1:22:55] and came unto
[1:22:58] him now Jesus was not yet come into the
[1:23:01] town but was in a place where Martha met
[1:23:07] him and the Jews then which were with
[1:23:10] her in the
[1:23:12] house and comfort her when they saw
[1:23:17] Mary that she rose up hastily and went
[1:23:19] out and followed her saying she goeth up
[1:23:21] to the Grave we in
[1:23:25] there and then when Mary was come where
[1:23:28] Jesus
[1:23:30] was and saw him she fell down at his
[1:23:34] feet and said unto him Lord if thou had
[1:23:36] been
[1:23:38] here my brother had not
[1:23:41] died and when Jesus therefore saw her
[1:23:44] weeping and the Jews were also
[1:23:48] weeping which came with
[1:23:50] her which came with with her he groaned
[1:23:54] in the
[1:23:55] spirit and was
[1:23:58] troubled amen he felt their
[1:24:04] concerned he cared about their
[1:24:09] need he came into that that same feeling
[1:24:12] that she was
[1:24:15] feeling and Jesus still feels that
[1:24:18] way when he sees you in your kns that
[1:24:21] you have
[1:24:24] when he sees you crying
[1:24:28] out this scripture here when he heard
[1:24:32] their
[1:24:34] weeping is causing him to
[1:24:39] groan amen amen that's why the Bible
[1:24:43] says cast your cares upon
[1:24:46] Him for he cares upon
[1:24:50] you that says right there
[1:24:53] that Jesus cared for
[1:24:55] them he was coming to the same feeling
[1:24:58] that she was
[1:25:02] feeling and Jesus went he was feeling
[1:25:04] that
[1:25:05] way verse
[1:25:07] 34 he says Where Have ye laid
[1:25:12] him they said Lord come and
[1:25:15] see Jesus wept the Bible
[1:25:19] says then said the Jews behold how he
[1:25:22] loved
[1:25:25] him and someone said could not this man
[1:25:28] which opened the eyes of a blind have
[1:25:30] caused that even this man should not
[1:25:32] have
[1:25:38] died Jesus therefore again groaning in
[1:25:41] himself come to the grave and it was a
[1:25:44] cave and a stone laid upon
[1:25:51] it and Jesus said take away the
[1:25:55] stone Martha and the sister of him that
[1:25:57] was dead dead said unto
[1:26:02] him Lord by this time he
[1:26:06] stinketh I'm just so happy he's not
[1:26:08] going to sneak no
[1:26:10] more why because a master came
[1:26:13] there he was in the
[1:26:15] house for he he says for he had been
[1:26:18] dead four
[1:26:19] days and Jesus said unto her
[1:26:23] said I not unto
[1:26:25] thee if thou wouldest would wouldest
[1:26:29] believe thou shall see the glory of
[1:26:33] God then they took away the Stone from
[1:26:36] the
[1:26:39] place where the dead was
[1:26:41] laid and Jesus lifted up his
[1:26:44] eyes and said father I thank thee that
[1:26:47] thou has heard
[1:26:49] me and I know that thou hears me
[1:26:54] always but because of the people which
[1:26:57] stand
[1:26:59] by that they may
[1:27:01] believe that thou has sent
[1:27:04] me and when he thus has
[1:27:07] spoken amen now look what happens when
[1:27:11] he's in the
[1:27:13] house many people were
[1:27:15] there amen that probably told them a
[1:27:18] negative
[1:27:20] report that told them that your brother
[1:27:22] is
[1:27:23] gone amen amen but see Jesus came things
[1:27:28] when Jesus comes in the
[1:27:30] picture the Bible says that With God all
[1:27:33] things are
[1:27:35] possible amen amen and what happened
[1:27:39] they told him look your brother's
[1:27:41] gone he ain't coming
[1:27:43] back amen amen a lot of unbelief going
[1:27:48] on but here is Jesus now he comes to the
[1:27:51] tomb
[1:27:53] said take away that
[1:27:55] stone and the Bible says that when he
[1:27:58] had
[1:28:00] spoken he cried with the he cried with a
[1:28:03] loud
[1:28:04] voice and said Lazarus come
[1:28:07] forth amen
[1:28:10] amen 44 it says and he that was dead
[1:28:14] came
[1:28:16] forth and bound in hand and foot with
[1:28:20] Graven clothes and his face was bound
[1:28:23] with the napkin Jesus said unto him
[1:28:26] loose him and let him
[1:28:33] go am man he wasn't dead no
[1:28:36] more but Jesus said that he was
[1:28:39] sleeping you see he was in
[1:28:41] Christ amen and Jesus went and called

[1:32:38] Darkness became a house that was full of
[1:32:42] light amen and light came back to that
[1:32:45] dark that

[1:33:45] parents

[1:33:50] child
[1:33:52] but then you see the master
[1:33:54] come and life comes back into your
[1:33:59] child if I had been that Dad and
[1:34:03] Mom I don't know I think I would have
[1:34:05] just ran everywhere in that
[1:34:08] house saying praise the
[1:34:10] Lord I tell you Life came back into
[1:34:15] me amen when I was out there full of
[1:34:18] Darkness amen amen the Bible says that
[1:34:21] the devil cometh not but to steal kill
[1:34:23] and
[1:34:26] destroy he tried to take me
[1:34:29] out well brother Bram says what's the
[1:34:33] strongest part of a man's
[1:34:37] body he said it's his back and his legs
[1:34:42] amen amen the Bible talks about when the
[1:34:45] Sheep got
[1:34:47] lost that he went from those 0 from the
[1:34:50] 99
[1:34:52] and went from that
[1:34:53] one but when he found that sheep he
[1:34:57] stuck it on his
[1:34:58] back which was the strongest part of his
[1:35:02] body and went back
[1:35:05] rejoicing amen amen and that's what God
[1:35:07] has done with
[1:35:09] us once we were
[1:35:11] lost but he put us on his
[1:35:13] shoulders took us back to the
[1:35:17] Sheepfold why because we are his
[1:35:20] children amen man we are his
[1:35:23] children you know was something else you
[1:35:26] know before Jesus he came to that little
[1:35:31] girl while he was on the way coming to
[1:35:34] her he ran into that womb with the blood
[1:35:38] issue amen
[1:35:42] amen the Bible says that in Mark
[1:35:48] 525 it said a certain woman which had a
[1:35:51] blooded issue for 12
[1:35:55] years and has suffered many things of
[1:35:58] many Physicians and had spent all that
[1:36:01] she had it was
[1:36:03] nothing and and nothing better but
[1:36:06] rather grew
[1:36:10] [Music]
[1:36:13] worse
[1:36:15] amen I'm sure those same Physicians she
[1:36:17] she
[1:36:20] visited were probably the same
[1:36:22] Physicians that came to that little
[1:36:25] girl amen amen man those Physicians I
[1:36:29] don't know them but they must have a
[1:36:33] testimony going to visit sick people
[1:36:36] then going to visit a gam and they're
[1:36:37] not
[1:36:40] sick amen amen but she spent all of her
[1:36:45] living all of her money the Bible says
[1:36:49] that it just got worse
[1:36:53] and her situation got
[1:36:55] worse but it says that when she heard of
[1:36:59] Jesus Amen she heard that he came
[1:37:05] near man let me just okay she heard that
[1:37:08] he came in and pressed behind him she
[1:37:10] heard that he you see she heard that he
[1:37:13] was in the
[1:37:15] house she heard that he came
[1:37:18] near and while she was sitting there
[1:37:20] where
[1:37:22] at she touched His
[1:37:25] Garment and the Bible says for she said
[1:37:28] if I may just touch His Garment I shall
[1:37:30] be
[1:37:34] whole amen and straight away the
[1:37:37] Fountain of her blood was dried up and
[1:37:40] she felt in her body that she was healed
[1:37:43] of that
[1:37:48] plague and Jesus was wondering who
[1:37:50] touched me
[1:37:54] amen she came she came to him and fell
[1:37:57] on her
[1:37:59] knees and Jesus looks at her said that
[1:38:03] thy faith has made thee
[1:38:06] whole amen amen but see that that
[1:38:11] lady she recognized when God was in the
[1:38:15] house and when she recognized God was in
[1:38:17] the
[1:38:18] house she got determined
[1:38:22] that she was going to receive her
[1:38:24] healing she said that even if he can't
[1:38:26] lay hands on
[1:38:28] me I'm going to lay my hands on
[1:38:31] him just His Garment if I touch
[1:38:35] it this Blood
[1:38:37] issue I had for 12
[1:38:40] years that's getting
[1:38:42] worse will be
[1:38:45] gone why because Jesus was in the
[1:38:49] house amen amen amen and she touched it
[1:38:52] and all that problem that she had went
[1:38:55] away so that we can get determined like
[1:38:58] that
[1:38:59] lady get determin like that
[1:39:02] sister amen and
[1:39:05] recognize that God is in this
[1:39:07] house you know that's what the devil
[1:39:10] battles us
[1:39:12] with he wants us to fill soul so so
[1:39:16] asleep in the
[1:39:18] spirit that we can't even recognize when
[1:39:20] we're in the presence of
[1:39:23] God amen amen he wants us to be numb to
[1:39:26] the
[1:39:29] spirit but see God loves his
[1:39:33] children amen amen devil ain't stronger
[1:39:35] than
[1:39:37] God why because the Bible said greater
[1:39:40] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:39:41] the
[1:39:44] world Amen that's what we we have to
[1:39:47] recognize is when we're in the presence
[1:39:50] of God
[1:39:52] and when we're in the presence of
[1:39:54] God ask him what you
[1:39:57] will just like Jesus
[1:40:00] said when he said Don't Fear he told him
[1:40:03] don't fear after they gave him that
[1:40:08] report he said only
[1:40:11] believe amen amen that all things are
[1:40:15] possible only
[1:40:17] believe amen amen look at the Hebrew
[1:40:20] children
[1:40:25] you could turn to uh Daniel
[1:40:30] 3:14 you know right here Nebuchadnezzar
[1:40:33] he was a
[1:40:35] king and he said up a gold
[1:40:39] image and we know that brother brandom
[1:40:42] he teaches
[1:40:44] us that that gold image was their own
[1:40:49] brother
[1:40:52] was
[1:40:52] Daniel and this Nebuchadnezzar wanted
[1:40:55] him them to worship this gold
[1:41:00] image and he gave a Commandment that
[1:41:02] when they hear start hearing this
[1:41:05] music that they should Bow
[1:41:08] Down and Worship this
[1:41:11] image but you see in this very
[1:41:14] moment the sad the sad scene that we
[1:41:18] see is that when the music sound
[1:41:22] many Hebrews many people bowed
[1:41:25] down they began to worship this
[1:41:29] image but see there was three there that
[1:41:31] weren't going to worship this
[1:41:34] image amen it didn't matter if it was
[1:41:36] their own
[1:41:38] brother and they had a good relationship
[1:41:40] with
[1:41:41] Daniel but see they knew that they only
[1:41:44] worshiped
[1:41:46] God they only they know that God was the
[1:41:48] only one that answers the prayers
[1:41:53] why because they had an experience with
[1:41:55] God they seen God In
[1:41:58] Action amen amen and after after the
[1:42:03] music
[1:42:05] sounds and all these Hebrew children bow
[1:42:11] down yet there is Shakra mesach and
[1:42:16] abedo they didn't bow
[1:42:18] down and the King's servant see
[1:42:22] that oh they go by they go they went
[1:42:25] crying to their
[1:42:27] King oh King
[1:42:30] Nebuchadnezzar you gave a
[1:42:33] commandment and these guys didn't
[1:42:36] listen you see
[1:42:39] Nebuchadnezzar he uh everybody was
[1:42:42] afraid most people majority people were
[1:42:44] afraid of
[1:42:47] him see Nebuchadnezzar he felt
[1:42:51] now see when he went
[1:42:54] places maybe people fell straight to
[1:42:56] their
[1:42:59] feet because he knew that people feared
[1:43:03] him and so then he goes take me to
[1:43:07] them and the Bible
[1:43:09] says in verse
[1:43:11] 14 that Nebuchadnezzar spake and said
[1:43:14] unto them is this true oh Shakra mhach
[1:43:17] and
[1:43:19] Abednego Daniel
[1:43:24] 3:14 do not ye serve my gods nor worship
[1:43:28] the golden image which I have set
[1:43:33] up now if if you be
[1:43:36] ready that the time when you hear the
[1:43:42] sounds all the
[1:43:45] music ye Fall Down and Worship this
[1:43:48] image which I have made
[1:43:52] but if you don't
[1:43:53] worship you shall be cast into the same
[1:43:56] hour into the midst of a burning fire
[1:44:01] furnace a man watch this he says and who
[1:44:05] is that God that shall deliver you out
[1:44:08] of my
[1:44:11] hands he was questioning
[1:44:15] God he said who is that
[1:44:18] God that should deliver you out of my
[1:44:20] hands
[1:44:22] because he believed he was so
[1:44:24] powerful that no one could beat
[1:44:27] him amen and look at what Shak M and
[1:44:31] Abednego
[1:44:33] said they answered and said to this king
[1:44:36] oh
[1:44:38] Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to
[1:44:40] answer this
[1:44:44] matter we don't got to think what to
[1:44:47] say they had wisdom don't get me wrong
[1:44:52] but in a way they're not having to be
[1:44:53] careful and pick words what they need to
[1:44:55] say to him so they don't get
[1:45:03] punished we said if it be
[1:45:06] so our God whom we serve is able to
[1:45:10] Deliver Us From The Burning Fury fiery
[1:45:14] furnace Fury
[1:45:16] furnace
[1:45:19] 17
[1:45:21] and he will and he will deliver us out
[1:45:24] of thy hand oh
[1:45:27] King oh I like I like these
[1:45:30] brothers I'm telling you when I when I
[1:45:32] get to that
[1:45:34] side I like to meet
[1:45:36] them oh talk with them it's going to be
[1:45:40] a nice day it says but if if but if let
[1:45:45] me just read that again he
[1:45:47] says if it be so our God whom we serve
[1:45:49] is able to Deliver Us From The
[1:45:52] Burning fiery furnace and he will
[1:45:55] deliver us out of the hand O
[1:46:02] King but if it not be be it known unto
[1:46:05] thee Oh King that we will not serve th
[1:46:08] thy Gods nor worship the gold image
[1:46:10] which thou Hast set
[1:46:17] up after what he just said
[1:46:21] I'll burn your
[1:46:22] bodies I will burn your
[1:46:25] bodies and they had such a
[1:46:28] faith that they're like we're not going
[1:46:30] to answer you careful just letting you
[1:46:34] know we're going to tell you how it
[1:46:37] is and this is how we're going to tell
[1:46:40] you we're not going to worship your
[1:46:42] image and our God's going to deliver
[1:46:45] us but it be so that that that that say
[1:46:49] he doesn't
[1:46:51] we're not going to serve your
[1:46:53] Gods regardless of what you
[1:46:56] think you may scare everybody
[1:46:59] else but you ain't scaring
[1:47:02] us amen
[1:47:04] amen amen the Nebuchadnezzar he was
[1:47:08] mad Bible says in
[1:47:11] 19 he was full of
[1:47:15] Fury amen and from the form of his uh
[1:47:19] Visage was was changed against Shakra
[1:47:22] mesak and
[1:47:26] abedo therefore he spake and commanded
[1:47:28] that they should heat the furnace one
[1:47:31] seven times more than it than it won't
[1:47:36] that was to be
[1:47:40] heated you see and he commanded the most
[1:47:43] Mighty
[1:47:45] Men let me tell you they they must have
[1:47:47] been mighty men to
[1:47:49] them
[1:47:52] strong men men that the king had
[1:47:55] confidence
[1:47:57] in men that he sent on the front
[1:48:02] battles men that he said no one no one
[1:48:04] can touch these
[1:48:07] men I have confidence in these
[1:48:10] men he so he commanded these these most
[1:48:13] mighty men that were in his
[1:48:18] army to bind
[1:48:20] M and
[1:48:23] abendego and to cast them into the
