takes us from this world great is his faithfulness God bless you all this evening it's good to be back home again we we had a a good time with the Saints up in Albuquerque our brother uh Raul Gonzalez brother Gonzalez and all the saints they all send their greetings and um wishing that you could have all been there also so maybe sometime the Lord will permit that but uh we had a we had a wonderful time I believe God spoke to the hearts of his children Friday night we we he actually the brother has a white board and um so was more of a a bible study on Friday so we were uh not behind the pulpit but standing in front and and um making a few diagrams for the Brethren but because for most of them it was something very new The Book of Revelations is a book of mystery for most but we realize now by the grace of God God God sent a prophet and This Book of Revelation we realize now is more of a it's a book of history and the first three chapters of This Book of Revelations the first chapter is lifting up Jesus Christ that he's the alpha he's the Omega he's the beginning he's the he's the end he's our everything and and he's he's one he's likened unto one walking in the midst of these seven Church ages these seven candlesticks and it just represents Jesus Christ the Holy Spirit from the time of his death burial and resurrection that when he resurrected now the spirit of God was going to be moving from the days of Jesus to our day here until a Rapture takes place so seven Church ages is just the this Gentile dispensations because in the days of Jesus Israel rejected him so so he he was given now to to a gentile people us and Israel was blinded so that we our eyes could be open so we so that we as a gentile people would have the opportunity to receive Jesus Christ as our personal savior as as as our as the bridegroom as our husband as our Lord as our savior as our healer so chapter one of Revelations is lifting Jesus up to this position Lord of lords and King of Kings walking in the midst of his people these seven Church ages and then chapter two of Revelations goes on to to give the names of these seven churches and these seven churches they actually existed in the days of the disciples in the days of Jesus the Apostle Paul visited all these churches and he took the gospel to them these were Gentile churches and each each one had a characteristic to it but but but Revelations 2 wasn't just talking telling us about the history of churches because this is a prophetic book so that so this was prophecy so these churches were a symbol and each one had a certain characteristic that would be reflected throughout the time from the days of Jesus to right now and there's curses in the book and there's blings for the Overcomers so there were seven Church ages and the first church age the Church of Ephesus represented the days of Jesus it began in the days of of of John the Baptist Elijah and then we come to the last Church age which is called the age of and that's the day that we're living in today we're living in the day of leoda and the leodan church age there begins in Revelations 3 and verse4 and Revelations 3:14 says this and unto the angel of the Church of the leodan write so so the holy spirit is writing to an angel an angel is a messenger in the Bible whether you look in the Greek or you look in the Hebrew the word angel in the Bible it simply means a messenger so that messenger could be a Celestial being or that that angel could be a terrestrial being in other words a preacher of the Gospel a prophet of God an apostle the angel to the the church in Ephesus that that angel was the Apostle Paul because he said he said he told Peter just as you have been given the commission to go to the Jews and take this message of eternal life to them so I have been given a commission and I'm to take this message of Christ to the Gentiles and that's what he did so Paul was the first Messenger to the Ephesian Church age there in Revelations 2 verse one he was that angel and every age had an angel this is all symbolic here so that means every age had a messenger a man that God would raise up in that day and call the people out of dark denominationalism call them out of the world and call them back to to the word and leoda was was was no different and unto the angel of the Church of the leodan right these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God he says he's telling this church of leoda which these are the characteristics of the churches today I Know Thy works that that thou art neither cold nor hot he's saying today the churches the denominations they're neither cold nor hot they're just church members they're just there for programs they're just there for the bread and the fishes they're not really there to see to to look for a word that will change them he said and here the Holy Spirit speaks and says I would that thou w't cold or hot he said I'd rather you tell me you're an unbeliever or tell me you're a Believer and not be a make believer in the church so then because Thou Art lukewarm in the middle can neither cold nor hot I will peew the out of my mouth he's talking to the Church of leoda who is the Church of leoda from the Catholic denomination to the Pentecostal denomination is the Church of laa and the Holy Spirit is calling out come out of her my people and don't be partakers of their be a real believer Christ in Jesus he said so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth verse 16 because thou sayest I am rich and increased with Goods this is the spirit in the churches today and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked they're rich they're living the American dream but they don't know that they that they are wretched miserable poor blind and naked before God then the Holy Spirit speaks to this Leo desine Church we're living in this lean age I said I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white rment this isn't literal this is spiritual that thou mayest be closed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear remember what happened in Genesis Adam and Eve partook of the tree of the of the knowledge of Good and Evil and then something happened to them something terrible they'd never experienced before and they were filled with great shame because the holy Veil had been torn off their eyes and now they both realized that they were naked but here at Lea they are blind they're naked and they don't know it spiritually speaking but not only spiritually speaking speaking naturally because natural sometimes it's a shadow of the of the spiritual condition we're in Albuquerque and the and the the brother Raul a man had come and visited and he was a Catholic man and he enjoyed the services and he told brother rul he wasn't a young man he was a man already maybe 70 years old and he said you know in the Catholic church today he says I go but the women he said and I've gone all my life and the way they dress today to go to church is the way women dressed years ago but only the prostitutes this is a Catholic man who's lived long enough to see the change taking place and both their priest and the women and the men are what in this lean time they're wretched miserable they're poor blind and naked verse 19 says can as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent God speaks of their horrible condition and he says because I love you I will rebuke and chasen you he said be zealous therefore and repent don't get lifted up with pride don't say you can't talk to me that way preacher God is saying be zealous and repent and then baptize in the name of Jesus Christ verse 20 says behold I stand at the door and knock a prophet brother brandom told us he says watch verse 20 notice it says behold I stand at the door and knock he says it's the only church age as you read all seven of them from ver from chapter two where Jesus is on the outside of the church knocking asking them to let him back into their churches that's where we're at today behold I stand at the door and knock but the churches will not open up the door to Jesus so then he says if the churches won't if any man if if any woman if any young lady if any young man will hear my voice and open the door of your heart I'll come into to him I'll come into to her we'll up together we'll be one in an invisible Union with baptism of the Holy Ghost then he says to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with thee in my throne in other words this is the last opportunity for individuals because the churches have rejected him you know there was a time this here is the second coming of Christ there was a time at the first coming of Christ when the church had rejected him when the high priest had publicly said we have no King but Caesar and that was the high priest of Israel what happened to Jehovah Israel was in a condition but they were wretched miserable blind naked rejected the Son of God the the people were lost but on the cross of Calvary there was two thieves and one of them despite his condition was an overcomer you say a thief on the cross just minutes from Death you would call him an overcomer he said to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with my the thief on the cross said Lord remember me when you go into your kingdom Jesus said done as a matter of fact this day we're both walking off of this cross standing up out of the Grave we're going to go and the gospel that are in prison and we're going to bring forth a resurrection you and me are going to do this two seconds before he was a thief two seconds before he was a man condemned to death one second later hand in hand with Jesus great Holy Spirit preaching to the Lost bring for a resurrection pulling them out of Satan hand that was an overcomer that's what Jesus is doing today calling people come out of L come out of the every system come out of every bar out of every Wicked attitude no matter how low you are from that low point you can put your hands in the hands of Jesus will lift you up to him that overcometh like the thief on the cross will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in his throne where was he sitting at this time with his father there is an image as a lamb that is slain a bloody lamb that's where he sits now interceding for you stay standing in a place where Lucifer once accused us but now the lamb has taken that place and there are no accusations against you in that seventh dimension Before the Throne of God in the eyes of the father because of what the son did you are redeemed you are cleansed you are washed you are whole God looks down and he sees you you're overcoming and we might say he must have not saw me where I was today no he didn't he saw the blood that covers you and washes you quite as snow and gives you a chance da to repent every day every let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you ask your blessings upon your word upon your children in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated that really wasn't our message per se that's just extra and then as and as we all say many ministers no charge that was extra Matthew 11:13 we were there in Albuquerque and a brother asked me brother Daniel what do you say when someone tells you for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John and then they tell you that proves that there's no more prophets to come no more that was his question and I said well that's a good question I say first of all you ask them why they only read you half of a scripture and stopped in the middle because it's a great teaching and scripture connects with scripture in the Book of Luke it it reads like this Luke chapter 1 and verse 68 it says blessed be the Lord God of Israel for he had visited and redeemed his people this is Zachariah the father of John the Baptist can the holy spirit is coming down upon him the father of John the Baptist and the Holy Spirit is is blessing his heart and from his heart is Flowing forth prophetic word blessed be the the Lord God of Israel for he had visited and redeemed his people and has raised up and Horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David as he spake by the mouth of his holy prophets which have been since the world beun so now we start getting an idea how long the prophetic Ministry has been around here here hear the Bible the Holy Spirit speaking through Zechariah tells us it has been since the world began Adam not only a Son of God a spoken word Son of God not born of a woman or have nothing to do with with with a man and a woman he he was a spoken word son God formed his body from the dust of the earth and he took that Spirit man that he created in Genesis 126 and there in Genesis 2 about verse 6 or S God makes a body of of of of the Dust of the earth and he takes that Spirit man and places him into this body and now Adam becomes a living soul for the soul that was once spoken into existence in the mind of God now had been placed in a body of Flesh and it was alive it was living it was it's what was making that flesh body move so the holy prophets have been since the world began the Reason God rose up prophetic Ministries because he uses the prophets to reveal his Secrets unto unto his children so these prophets God's servants are revealers of the secrets of God's word it's not enough that I tell you that that's what it is but you should require me to tell you in the scripture where it's at are you requiring me to do that yes Jonathan said yes here it is Amos 3: 1 to8 it said hear this word that the Lord has spoken against you oh children of Israel against the whole family which I brought up from the land of Egypt saying you only have I known of all the families of the earth therefore will I punish you for all your iniquities and if and and if you're wondering how the world is treating the Jews right now and can of and they're asking why do they think they're so special it says because God said you only have I known of all the families of the earth I'm sorry but God said they are special in my eyes just as the bride is special in his eyes verse two says can two walk together except they be agreed will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey will a young lion cry out of his den if he have taken nothing listen what the word saying can a bird fall in a snare upon the Earth where no Jin is for him shall one take up a snare from the earth and have and have taken nothing at all question after question after question God's wanted the the holy spirit is wanting you to get in the spirit and catch how the spirit's moving and by the time you answer all these questions the last question will be easy do you see what the spirit's doing how how it's lining things up and lining up your thoughts of your heart verse three can two walk together except they be agreed no no will a lion roar in the forest when he has no prey no no will a young lion cry out of his den he have taken nothing no can a bird fall in a snare upon the Earth where no Jin is for him no no shall one take up a snare from the earth and have taken nothing at all no shall a trumpet be B blown in the city and the people be not afraid no no no they will be afraid that was the purpose of the trumpet to warn them that something was coming and shall there be evil in the city and the Lord ha not done it now the Lord doesn't do evil but he allows evil to come to test his children to turn them around to turn the hearts of the children to the father verse seven all of those questions you answer we just we answered then ver then verse seven God speaking through this Prophet Amos surely the Lord will do nothing but he revealeth his secret unto his servants the prophets the lion hath roared representing Jehovah God who will not fear and he actually answered that that that same question when it says the lion hath roared who will not fear your question is who is that well you keep reading and it says the Lord has spoken that's who has roared who can but prophesy but no longer would the law be preached now the prophets will preach the kingdom of God there was to be a change in the prophetic Ministry from Old Testament to new Luke 16 and verse 16 it reads like this the law and the prophets were until John my Bible doesn't have a period there no this the word goes on the law and the prophets were until John since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it the law and the prophets were until John they're connected together the law and the prophets of the old test until John and yet John was a prophet Jesus called him Elijah Malachi said that he came in the spirit and power of Elijah so John was a prophet after the law and the prophets it says since that time since the time of the law and the prophets the kingdom of God is preached so now the prophetic Ministry had completely changed the prophets under the law brought judgment brought chastening brought brought curses upon Israel brought judgment upon Israel every time they walked away to pagan gods a prophet would come out of the mountains screaming thus sayith the Lord you've left Jehovah you left his holy altar walk away from Jehovah's law and bring judgment upon them and they and they'd go into judgment for years and years and all the Pagan nations would beat them down until they would finally repent and then God would send another Prophet to tell them your iniquities are forgiven your Warfare time is over I'm I'm forgiving you of that to the law and the prophets until John and yet John was a prophet but this Prophet John the ministry was going to change he was no longer going to preach the law he was no longer bringing judgment now the prophetic Ministry would preach the kingdom of God is at hand now the prophetic Ministry would say Behold the Lamb of God is with is with us Matthew 11 verse 7 and as they departed Jesus began to say unto M the multitudes concerning John what went you out to the Wilderness to see a reed shaken With the Wind you see how God writes once again like he did in Amos he's giving us questions to answer and by the time you answer these questions in your heart guess what you've got you've got the answer to your questions see but what when you out to see a man clothed in soft rment behold they that wear soft clothing are in King's houses but what when y out to see a prophet yay I thought the law the prophets were until John Jesus is saying John is also a prophet and he's come after the law he said yay I say unto you and more than a prophet what could be more than a prophet a man with more than one Ministry Not only was he a prophet but he was a messenger he was Elijah that was prophesied that would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children for this verse 10 for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which will which shall prepare thy way before thee he was a forerunner to the first coming of Christ you know during the Vietnam war they had soldiers and and they called them forerunners they also called them tunnel rats they were the ones that would go out alone and and and they would and they were trained for to search for the Trap and and explosives laying in the jungles they would go first and they would clear a path and they didn't just go looking everywhere no they wanted to get the soldiers from point A and to get them to point B so these forerunners would go through the jungles and and and look for a path so wide and they would walk that path to make sure that every danger every explosive that it was clear and clean so that when the soldiers so that when the Squadron of soldiers would come behind they could pass safely they could full fulfill their mission that was a forerunner John was a forerunner spiritually speaking you know who else was a forerunner my uncle Zeke innam Vietnam he was stained to do just that he told us one time that he's walking through the jungle trying to clear a path for the rest to come behind and as he's walking he said I felt a hand grab my foot grabb my ankle and I couldn't move it I didn't I didn't think it was a hand that had grabbed my leg and when I looked down down in the grass lay a little trigger that the Viet had placed full of explosives one more inch I would have stepped on it that'd be the end a forerunner John the Baptist was a forerunner but one day he did step on a trigger and they cut off his head but he did it for the cause of Christ he he he did it to raise up the standard of marriage and divorce before the Jewish people he told Herod it's not right for you to take your brother's wife know that's wrong you know God hates that you know he hates adultery and fornication you know he hates you men messing around and being un faithful he was clearing the path for you and I to follow and stay true and faithful in in our marriages it's God's way this verse 10 this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee if you rejected John's Ministry you probably were going to reject Jesus Christ because John Was preparing the way and John was going to introduce Jesus of Nazareth and tell us Behold the Lamb of God who taketh away the sins of the world Amen verse 11 verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there had not risen a greater than John the Baptist no man greater than John amongst all the men born in the world Jesus says there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist but he also said But now that I've said that let me tell you he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he so was he the greatest or was he the least oh amongst the world he was the greatest but amongst the children of God who have repented and been baptized he was the least because those are the ones that the ministry is sent to serve and you that are the head of your house amongst all the husbands in the world you're the greatest but in your home you're the least for you've been sent to serve your family your wife and your children that was extra too verse 12 and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by for it takes a revelation to catch this one because this one here is the Fulfillment or the beginning and the opening of part one the first seal Revelations 61 and2 this is where it it opened up and and started coming to pass this is when the first seal opened this is where the white horse rider began his ride violence and the violence taken taken by force was was was the Church of of of Judaism and the p and Pagan Rome who were persecuting the Believers in Christ were persecuting those who were following John the Baptist they're persecuting those that were following Jesus great violence was was coming to the believer not the believer who believing in the law of Moses but the believer who was recognizing all the Prophecies of the prophets had now fallen on one man their name was Jesus Christ and that Jesus of Nazareth was mess that he was King of the Jews he was their lord he was their salvation and it's these people who are being persecuted and suffering violence and this was Lucifer the white horse rider of Revelation 62 persecuting the Church of God for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John period but what comes next well we just have to read the next verse to know it and the next vers say and if you will receive this answer this is Elijah which was to come so the word goes on so if this was Elias then it's another Prophet so the prophetic Ministry is continuing but God is changing it changing what it's going to preach it's now preaching the Kingdom of Heaven it's now preaching repent and be baptized because repentance and baptism and water was a shadow a type it represented the washing of the blood of Jesus Christ that washes all your sins away be baptized in water is an outward expression an inward work of the spirit baptism of the baptism of the Holy Ghost in fire god rich in Mercy for all the prophets and the laws prophesied until John and if you will receive it this is Elijah which was to come he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear he that ha an ear to hear what what did you hear what did I hear when we as we read Matthew 11 here to 15 I heard that there was coming a drastic change to how God wanted the people to worship how go how God wanted the fathers to treat their children how God wanted the mothers to be in the home I heard that there was great changes coming even the prophetic Ministry if you thought you understood it well and you were you were a Jewish rabbi guess what Jehovah just changed everything about it change isn't easy Israel couldn't receive the change but that didn't stop God he went on with those with those who said change me Lord and those that said change me you know where they wound up 20 wound up in an upper room and receiv received the promise of God but it wasn't easy because violence had been taken up against them Matthew 23 and verse 34 this is Jesus go back and read the whole chapter Matthew 23 Matthew 23 Jesus is speaking to scribes he's speaking to the high priest he's speaking to lawyers he's speaking to a multitude and his disciples he's creeping he's speaking to Pharisees and and he's talking to them and rebuking them he's telling them how how they like to get be lifted up and be called Master then he rebukes them and he says but be ye but be not ye called Rabbi verse 237 but 238 for one is your master even Christ and all ye are brethren in another scripture the Apostle Paul says call no man father you only one father father which is in heaven and millions called their ministers father and even Holy Father Holy Father Dominic how are you God said don't do that he's your brother you want to call him brother call him brother call her sister call her sister so Jesus is here having these conversations in verse 13 he begins saying unto them woe unto you scribes and Pharisees he said Hypocrites for you shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against verse 13 for ye neither go in yourselves neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in in other words you're not hot you're not cold you're lukewarm I'm I'm going to spew you out of my mouth and he goes on whoo and whoo and whoo and whoo in those verses in 17 verse 17 he said he called them he fools and blind he goes on speaking to them and in verse 23 he says W one to you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you pay tithe for you pay tithe of mint and anest and [Music] coming in other words you're paying tithe of these little tiny things and have omitted the weier matters of the law judgment mercy and Faith these ought ye to have done and not to leave the other undone he tells them ye blind guides would strain at a net and swallow a camel and he goes on rebuking them over and over again Jesus it was we we call the second pool of his ministry part two Discerning the hearts of these religious leaders and prophesying over them judgment that would come upon them for blinding the people of Israel verse 31 wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets ye are the children you Jews are the children of them that killed the prophets who killed God's prophets throughout the Old Testament the Jews killed the prophets of God that were sent to them if there's ever a Ministry that you want to ask the Lord not to give you it's a prophetic one you go through history and the prophets always went down as Martyrs their own people killed them because the message of the prophet in the Old Testament was always a chasing hand of God so every time a prophet came into their midst they knew judgment was coming but the law and the prophets were until John now the prophetic Ministry would change the prophetic Ministry was to in introduce the Lamb of God the people and to call the people to repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus CH and you shall receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire Jesus in verse 33 he discerned the hearts of these religious leaders he tells them ye serpents ye Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of hell they cannot because they're a generation they are the seed of the serpent just as sure as you and I are the seed of God remember the parable of the sewer Matthew 13 it spoke of how many seeds two one was the wheat and one was the tears how do these two seeds grow the same water the same Earth the same the the the same vitamins in the earth it causes them both to grow but it doesn't change who they are it just manifests who they are that's why the Bible says book of Hebrews the rain falls on the just and the unjust there are two seeds there are two generations one is the generation of Jesus Christ children of God were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world the other is a Generation of Vipers see of the serpent children Cain's children and the Bible says in in the third Epistle of John Cain was of the evil one what does that mean a son of the devil but we are Sons and Daughters of God by his Amazing Grace after Jesus has done rebuking these ministers these pastors these evangelists these these these these prophets these Apostles he says this in verse 34 Jesus says and remember John has been dead now for more than a year he's been off the scene the law and the prophets were until John that doesn't have a a period no that wasn't the end of the prophetic Ministry that was the prophecy of the changing of the prophetic God would will continue to send us prophets he said so in verse 34 Jesus said wherefore behold I jesus send unto you prophets long after John is dead I'm going to keep sending you prophets I'm not going to change my program will the world love them no the world will hate them they always hated God's Prophet God has a purpose in sending them for they are a revealer of the word they help put the loose ends together so that we can see Jesus Christ in every verse wherefore behold I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes and some of them you shall kill and crucify and some of them you shall scorge in your synagogues and persecute them from City to City the prophetic Ministry it was always a difficult Ministry a hard one verse 35 he says that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the Earth from the blood of righteous Abel unto the blood of Zacharias son of barachias whom ye slew between the temple and the altar the Holy Spirit mentions these two men they lived thousands of years apart because both of them were prophets verely I say to you all these things shall come upon this generation then Jesus says verse 37 oh Jerusalem Jerusalem thou that killest the prophets and stonest them which are sent unto thee how often would I have gathered thy children together how did God begin the Gathering of his children using a prophetic Ministry how often would I have gathered thy children together even as a h gathers her chickens under her wings and you would not here he is Jehovah God creator of heavens and earth typing himself to a hen Jehovah hen he's declaring the condition of the Church of Israel when he came to them they were a chicken yard pecking on the dirt trying to get the little they could that's all the religion they had when Jesus came and he says and I came to you to gather you to take you where eagles fly and you would not so then he turned at the cross of Calvary he gave the inheritance that was for Israel to a gentile people starting with 120 on the day of Pentecost acts 13 and verse one long after John is gone at Antioch in anti it says this now there were in the church that was at Antioch certain prophets and teachers John had been dead for years now as Barnabas and Simeon that was called Niger and Lucius of serene and man and man which had been brought up with Herod the Tetro and Saul and as they minister to the to the Lord and fasted the Holy Ghost said separate me Barnabas and Saul for the workto I have called them who were these men long after John the Baptist had died prophets and teachers of the Gospel preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand repent and be baptized and I'll fill you with the Holy Ghost to cleanse you from all unbelief in Acts chapter 15 again long after John had died and passed away acts 15:30 so when they were dismissed they came to Antioch and when they had gathered the multitude together they delivered the epistle which when they had read they Rejoice for the consolation and Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the Brethren with many words and confirmed them the law and the prophets were until John but that didn't mean that the God was ending the prophetic Ministry the law and the prophets were until John now John a prophet and all the prophets after him the ministry will change they will no longer be bringing judgment they will no longer be the chastening hand of God on the people no they will now preach repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ they will now preach you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they will be preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand because here they are years after Jesus had died on the cross was buried was resurrected was risen on high the day of Pentecost had already happened the church was being persecuted and Judas and Silas being prophets also themselves exhorted the Brethren with many words and confirmed them Acts chapter 21 and verse 8 he says and it reads like this and the next day we that were of Paul's company departed and came unto cesaria and we entered into the house of Philip the Evangelist which was one of the seven and Abode with him and the same man had four daughters virgins which did prophesy they were not propheus but they had a gift of Prophecy there's a difference and as we carried there many days there came down from Judea a certain Prophet named named agabus the Bible is full of prophets long after John has gone off the scene because the prophetic ministry didn't end God was going to change the way he was going to use these men verse 11 and when he was come unto us he took Paul's girdle and bound his own hands and feet and said this is what God gives his prophets whether it's a minor Prophet or a or major prophet it's this thus sayth the Holy Ghost prophets have thus saith the Lord in other words it's not them talking it's God using them and saying thus sayith the Lord he says so shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that ownest this girdle and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles this man agabus he didn't know who that girlle belonged to the Holy Spirit just told him pick up that girdle and tie your hands and feet with it and say thus sayith the Lord that the man that onth this girdle is going to be delivered into the hands of the into the hands of the Romans into the hands of Caesar himself thus sayith the Lord even Paul being a prophet himself couldn't change that because it wasn't agabus that said it was God that spoke through his Prophet agabus Ephesians chapter 3 verse 4 and six the prophetic Ministry never ended it changed by necessity it changed because now we had entered into a new covenant and Jesus Christ is a God Prophet he's the prophet of the prophets he is the voice of the prophets he is the one that spoke through the prophets Ephesians 3 verse 4 whereby when ye read May me understand my knowledge and the mystery of Christ which in other Ages was not made known Unto the Sons of men in other words the prophets as it is now revealed unto His Holy Apostles and Prophets by the Holy Spirit did you catch it that the Gentiles should be fellow Hees and of the same body and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel in the days of the Apostle Paul the the ministerial change of the Prophet was this to teach the Gentiles that they were fellow Hees and of the same body and partakers of his promise that's how God is using His prophets today 2023 how will you know the prophetic Ministry because of the message they bring introducing you to the Lamb of God how do you know he's a false prophet because he introduces you to himself because you see him chasing the money because you see him chasing popularity because you see that he wants a big television show because he's got to have a Lear jet that cost $25 million God's prophets are teaching that the Gentiles should be fellars because of the Cross of Calvary and the blood that was shed for us and of the same body and partakers of his promis in Christ by the gospel which is the good news Malachi 4 verse6 let's let's read verse five of Malachi 4 behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord so this is an end time Prophet this is a prophet that's coming not in the Old Testament time but he's coming under a new testament time and his ministry will be this and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children remember we've read it in the Book of Luke chapter 1 about verse 14 and on where the angel Gabriel who stands in the very presence of God brought a message to Zechariah and he told him Zechariah your son John he says he'll come in the spirit and power of Elijah and his ministry will be to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the angel Gabriel stopped right there only read half the scripture because the first half was to John the Baptist the Forerunner to the first coming of Christ and the second part is the second coming of Christ and there's to come an Elijah like John came to once again preach the kingdom of heav bring us the word of God sayth the Lord because the denomination have only produced Creeds produ dogas produce progams Holiness is not in the churches anymore from the Catholic Church to the Pentecostal Holiness is not required anymore and yet God is a god of holiness and he wants his people to be holy he hasn't changed his mind about who he is and who he wants you and I to be luke now I want to read a quote in closing I've kept you long but Karen said I kept the brothers in Albuquerque way too long too and um so let's I want to read this quote on the message standing on the Gap 1963 brother Bram says this he said I want to do something different but I was told that I'd been called to be a prophet he said and I wanted to go live in the wilderness like the prophets but I was using my own excuse so I could go hunt and do my own good and God told me but that was the prophets of the Old Testament you've been called to be there in a much higher office than that he said if you have more gifts besides that you was called to pray for the sick and to preach the gospel in the apostolic form you see the prophetic Ministry had changed never the same again God now was bringing us salvation and not judgment forgiveness for all our sins for every iniquity for all our shortcomings what would they be preaching Jesus answered verely verily I say unto you except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God and that which is is born of the flesh is flesh but that which is born of the spirit is Spirit first John 5 and 7 it says this for there are three that bear record in heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and these three are one and there are three that bear witness in Earth the spirit and the water and the blood and these three agree in one water baptism Spirit baptism represents that all our sins have been washed in the blood of Jesus and he's washed us white as snow what follows this water baptism what follows this Holy Ghost and Fire baptism is that all we need and we're good for the rest of our lives no no that's just the beginning then comes refilling after refilling of this blessed Holy Spirit what are the refilling refilling are a rescue it's God's holy spirit coming from the throne to give you strength to overcome tomorrow Thursday morning and the things you'll go through refilling
