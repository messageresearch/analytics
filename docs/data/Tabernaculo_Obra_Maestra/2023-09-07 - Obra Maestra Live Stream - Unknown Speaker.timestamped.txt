[33:04] [Music]
[33:06] that's our desire need

[33:10] [Music]
[33:13] they work in Anchor in our hearts

[33:50] [Music]
[34:27] [Music]
[34:31] foreign
[34:31] [Music]
[34:43] [Music]
[34:49] [Music]
[35:00] [Music]
[35:08] [Music]
[35:23] [Music]
[35:27] can I please
[35:35] foreign
[35:53] [Music]
[36:08] people that
[36:10] [Music]
[36:12] are
[36:13] strong
[36:14] [Music]
[36:42] oh God
[36:45] come on
[36:48] [Applause]
[36:51] come here
[37:00] [Music]
[37:16] [Music]
[37:25] foreign
[37:26] [Music]
[37:40] [Music]
[37:47] [Music]
[37:53] [Music]
[37:57] foreign
[38:03] [Music]
[38:29] [Music]
[38:39] God bless you all this evening
[38:43] it's good to be here once again
[38:46] some place where we can come
[38:51] give
[39:05] us rest in our bodies
[39:08] healing for our bodies and
[39:12] and a family you're not familiar a
[39:14] family that loves God
[39:15] and a place where we can apply the token
[39:18] in our homes
[39:21] and and place our own homes in order
[39:26] an order that God's pleased with
[39:29] because we don't come here just to see
[39:33] this place put in order
[39:36] but it's just uh it should be just a
[39:39] small example
[39:40] of the same order that should follow
[39:42] into our own homes
[39:44] [Music]
[39:46] because your house is the house of God
[39:50] it's like I said your house is a house
[39:52] of prayers
[39:56] when Jesus came
[39:58] and you saw the Great temple in
[40:01] Jerusalem
[40:02] that Herod that a great ruler there had
[40:06] built
[40:09] and he looked at it
[40:12] saw they were selling sheep and doves
[40:19] and he said you've turned my house
[40:23] a house of prayers
[40:30] but there was to be a great change that
[40:32] was coming
[40:34] because the house of God would no longer
[40:37] be a building
[40:39] but the house of God would be the
[40:43] children of God you are the Temple of
[40:46] the Holy Spirit
[40:48] the body that God prepares
[40:52] that man called Jesus
[40:55] was really God
[40:57] Jesus never came Jesus
[41:00] to to glorify the synagogue that was
[41:04] built in that day
[41:07] he went and he looked at it and he said
[41:11] they told them this this this Temple was
[41:14] 40 years in the building
[41:18] and he's looking at the synagogue
[41:22] and as he's looking at the synagogue
[41:26] he said destroy this Temple
[41:30] and in three days yes
[41:35] they said didn't you hear me
[41:39] just took 40 years
[41:41] this took hundreds and hundreds of men
[41:44] hombres
[41:47] you said yes because see but didn't you
[41:49] hear me
[41:52] and in three days
[42:00] so when we read this glorious Bible
[42:05] we've got to get into the mind of God
[42:08] and once you see how God speaks
[42:12] then you can take scriptures
[42:16] there's no longer fight in our minds
[42:20] but God Can Open the Eyes of our
[42:23] understandings
[42:24] and scriptures now come together
[42:28] wow
[42:31] what a book that only a God the author
[42:34] because
[42:36] no one else writes a book like he writes
[42:40] for his book is a Book of Life
[42:43] all other books will eventually bring
[43:05] but none of those books as much as we
[43:09] could like to learn from them
[43:13] none of them are books of life
[43:16] there's just one that's the word of God
[43:19] is the only Book of Life
[43:22] I want to also
[43:24] ask you all to remember in prayer
[43:30] my uncle and my aunt Zeke and Jesse
[43:34] Zeke and Jesse some of you met them on a
[43:39] Sunday morning last Sunday he had a
[43:41] stroke and
[43:46] um it was very serious
[43:50] he was in the hospital
[43:53] and it was yesterday
[43:55] morning
[43:58] that the doctor said that the bleeding
[44:00] in the brain was more severe now
[44:08] and that there was nothing more they
[44:11] could do
[44:13] this last night they moved him to a
[44:17] hospice
[44:19] they feel it's just a matter of time
[44:21] hours days and Lord will take them home
[44:27] but he loved the Lord Jesus
[44:30] as to all that he knew and understand
[44:35] he gave his life to God
[44:38] so a Believer doesn't die
[44:42] a Believer changes dimensions
[44:48] [Music]
[45:07] and we won't see them as the old people
[45:10] that they were you know
[45:13] five hours to die tomorrow
[45:16] God give me a new body
[45:18] none of you would recognize me
[45:21] I'd be young again
[45:23] Karen might remember maybe
[45:26] but God is give us a promise
[45:30] and that is when this terrestrial body
[45:32] be dissolved yes
[45:35] he has another one waiting for him so if
[45:39] you remember the family in prayers
[45:43] they were married for 50 some years so
[45:50] um she'll certainly be missing him
[45:53] of course right now she's surrounded by
[45:56] family
[45:58] that support her
[46:00] but as you know when the family's all
[46:04] gone
[46:06] everyone's living the life their lives
[46:09] busy in the daily things
[46:13] then when then uh sometimes as as we as
[46:18] as we find ourselves alone at home
[46:23] then that's when the battle begins
[46:26] that's when folks really began missing
[46:29] their loved ones
[46:32] that's when we need to reach out by
[46:34] faith
[46:40] one day I'll see him again one day very
[46:44] soon very soon as we see this world
[46:48] falling apart
[46:51] then we know one day we'll see all our
[46:53] loved ones very soon
[46:56] as we turn in our Bibles here tonight
[47:01] we're speaking on a white horse rider
[47:07] and the pale horse riders in the Days of
[47:11] Elijah one speaks of the
[47:26] and today it's a very controversial
[47:28] subject
[47:30] even to believe that God sent a prophet
[47:34] it's very controversial but many of you
[47:38] testified
[47:39] and yeah they ask you what you believe
[47:42] because I believe God sent a prophet I
[47:45] believe it's a fulfillment of the
[47:47] scriptures
[47:50] and the minute they hear the word
[47:51] Prophet
[47:54] they've already turned you off
[47:57] and yet it's the truth and yet when you
[48:00] say it
[48:03] when you say it you're planting of seeds
[48:06] maybe somewhere down the road someone
[48:09] else will tell them
[48:10] maybe in that heart really is the seed
[48:13] of God foreign
[49:46] and the Fig Tree rejected
[49:49] what God had been teaching Adam
[49:53] that was the book that was opened
[49:55] that was the Lamb's Book of Life
[49:59] and as we spoke the other day
[50:05] about about a person person about my
[50:09] grandchildren why they begin with the
[50:11] day they're born
[50:23] I began speaking of a baby
[50:27] because this was the baby's book
[50:30] because this was a lamb you know a lamb
[50:33] is is a young sheep
[50:38] considered two years and younger
[50:40] concertos
[50:43] that's what a lamb is yes
[50:47] but it's a lamb because it's a yam sheep
[50:52] so this book the Lamb's Book of Life
[50:57] very birth of Christ
[51:01] the lamb himself
[51:04] we read through the scriptures
[51:07] in Isaiah 40. and they say yes
[51:12] Luke chapter one Lucas
[51:17] all of these scriptures are speaking of
[51:21] the ministry of John the Baptist
[51:22] who was to introduce
[51:25] and these were not all compiled to
[51:28] confuse you know foreign
[52:21] he would send Elijah to to open that
[52:25] first coming
[52:28] and because God is the same yesterday
[52:32] then it gives us it gives us some
[52:34] insights
[52:37] that that just as the first coming
[52:41] was introduced by Elijah foreign
[53:11] and we found that each one had a certain
[53:15] ingredient to it
[53:18] and that was each one contained a great
[53:21] change
[53:23] is what John was bringing to Israel yes
[53:28] by the grace of God foreign
[54:04] because Israel didn't know the name of
[54:06] God
[54:07] Israel didn't even pronounce the name is
[54:14] even to try to pronounce it was
[54:16] considered blasphemy
[54:20] but that was the old Covenant
[54:26] Uno
[54:55] okay
[54:59] Malachi 3 and verse one
[55:04] behold I will send my messenger
[55:06] and he shall prepare the way before me
[55:09] and the Lord whom you seek shall
[55:12] suddenly come to his Temple yeah
[55:20] even the messenger of the Covenant whom
[55:22] you Delight in behold he shall come
[55:25] saith the Lord of hosts
[55:54] not just comparing scripture with
[55:57] scripture
[55:58] your Holy Spirit going from Heart to
[56:01] Heart
[56:03] opening the eyes
[56:08] in Jesus name amen amen you may be
[56:12] seated
[56:20] behold I will send my messenger
[56:35] he'll begin with a foundational truth
[56:40] to this new testament
[56:42] to this to this new Plan of Redemption
[56:46] and that is repent and be baptized
[56:49] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:56] John said of Christ I hear I baptize you
[57:00] with water
[57:01] but there comes one after me who will
[57:05] baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[57:09] he said I'll send my messenger he said
[57:11] he'll make the way before me
[57:14] and the Lord whom you seek
[57:18] because it was it it was Israel who
[57:21] always sought the Lord Jehovah
[57:23] foreign
[57:28] he said
[57:31] the and the Lord whom ye seek almighty
[57:35] God creator of heavens and earth
[57:39] shall certainly come to his Temple
[57:42] they thought it was literal
[57:45] they thought it would be a the temple
[57:47] that Herod made
[57:50] they thought it would be a great a great
[57:52] Cathedral temple in the wilderness
[57:57] no but it was spoken it was spoken in a
[58:01] mystery
[58:02] it was spoken in a metaphor it was
[58:06] spoken even here in a prophetic Parable
[58:10] so Jesus speaking in Parables
[58:13] it wasn't the wasn't the first time
[58:16] God creator of heavens and earth
[58:20] since the Book of Genesis
[58:23] Jesus in the beginning when he said let
[58:26] there be lies
[58:29] was speaking of a Time
[58:37] El Mundo here Malachi is speaking he
[58:42] says and he shall suddenly come to his
[58:44] Temple even
[58:47] the messenger of the Covenant
[58:50] now it's taken the Lord
[58:53] and the messenger of the covenants and
[58:57] as declaring their one and the same
[58:58] yesterday
[59:00] but he said when the Lord descends
[59:04] changing forms
[59:06] he took on the form as the messenger of
[59:09] the cup
[59:10] he took on the form of that strong angel
[59:15] and from that and from that and from
[59:18] that position
[59:19] when he was looking for a man who was
[59:22] worthy foreign
[59:55] and verse 19.
[1:00:05] Jesus was standing
[1:00:08] before the
[1:00:10] before a Congregation of people Jesus
[1:00:20] the Passover was at hand in Jerusalem
[1:00:23] and he went into the temple the internal
[1:00:26] Temple and he found them he was in
[1:00:28] control selling oxen
[1:00:32] selling dogs
[1:00:35] men
[1:00:36] who were there exchange of money
[1:00:41] and then Jesus made of whip it says
[1:00:44] Jesus
[1:00:52] and the sheep and The Oxen
[1:00:56] broke open their carried their their
[1:00:59] cages
[1:01:01] Cut the Ropes and held them ties
[1:01:05] he let the animals loose and chase them
[1:01:07] out
[1:01:10] took the money's Changers the tables and
[1:01:12] he threw them on the ground
[1:01:17] and then that sold doves Palomas well
[1:01:21] you would think any man who sold the dub
[1:01:23] was probably a pretty nice fella
[1:01:25] Pennsylvania
[1:01:37] disciples saw him
[1:01:40] turn into synagogue upside down
[1:01:44] they remembered
[1:01:46] because the Holy Spirit brought it to
[1:01:49] their memories
[1:02:03] seeing that thou doest these things
[1:02:07] tell us why you did this tell us what
[1:02:10] gives you a right to turn our church
[1:02:12] upside down
[1:02:16] and Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:02:19] destroy this Temple destroy is the
[1:02:21] temple and in three days
[1:02:24] that'll be your sign
[1:02:26] of course they didn't understand it
[1:02:29] people read the Bible today
[1:02:33] how much more there in the day that that
[1:02:36] it happened
[1:02:39] when they were looking at the man with a
[1:02:41] whip in his hand
[1:02:45] then said the Jews 40 and six years was
[1:02:49] this temple in the building and well
[1:02:52] that will thou rear it up in three days
[1:02:54] foreign
[1:03:19] but who may abide the day of his coming
[1:03:22] and who shall stand when he appeareth
[1:03:24] before he's like a Refiner's Fire and
[1:03:27] like Fuller soap
[1:03:37] so he's coming in his Temple to bring a
[1:03:40] cleansing
[1:03:42] to bring up pureness to bring Holiness
[1:03:45] back to his church
[1:03:48] and he shall sit as a refiner and
[1:03:51] purifier of silver
[1:03:53] and he shall purify the sons of Levi and
[1:03:56] purge them as gold and silver that they
[1:03:59] may offer unto the Lord an offering in
[1:04:01] righteousness
[1:04:15] the sons of Levi were the ministry
[1:04:18] the first thing he would do
[1:04:21] I'm going to clean up the ministry
[1:04:25] I'm going to clean up the minutes
[1:04:28] they're not going to live the way they
[1:04:30] used to learn
[1:04:33] they're going to be an example to the
[1:04:35] people
[1:04:36] that's the new ministry of a New
[1:04:40] Testaments the ministry he was speaking
[1:04:42] of for today
[1:04:44] oh he's bringing a change to the
[1:04:46] ministers
[1:04:51] the new birth and the baptism of the
[1:04:55] Holy Ghost before before you ever get in
[1:04:58] the Pulpit
[1:04:59] before you ever stand before God's
[1:05:01] people
[1:05:05] the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be
[1:05:08] pleasant unto the Lord
[1:05:10] as in the days of old as in former years
[1:05:17] and it will come near to you to judgment
[1:05:22] and I will be a swift witness against
[1:05:24] the sorcerers against the adulterers
[1:05:26] against the false swearers against those
[1:05:29] that oppress the hireling and his wages
[1:05:32] the Widow and the fatherless and that
[1:05:34] turn aside the stranger from his right
[1:05:36] and fear not me saith the Lord
[1:05:41] is
[1:05:54] looking back
[1:05:58] at the condition of the priests
[1:06:02] looking back three four thousand years
[1:06:05] and he's speaking out against him
[1:06:09] and he's speaking out about the
[1:06:11] condition they had come to yeah
[1:06:14] and he calls them Sorcerers
[1:06:17] adulterers
[1:06:31] that was the ministry that's what it had
[1:06:35] come to you guys
[1:06:38] and that's what God had come to change
[1:06:40] because if you change the ministry
[1:06:43] you can change the church
[1:06:51] if you take the adulterers out of the
[1:06:54] pulpitas
[1:06:55] then you can preach marriage and divorce
[1:07:00] God wants us to live
[1:07:06] God yours was changing the ministry
[1:07:09] so we could bring the changes to God's
[1:07:13] people
[1:07:18] it was the second part of this new
[1:07:21] ministry of no more under the law
[1:07:25] we read in Luke chapter one Lucas Begin
[1:07:29] Again verse 13.
[1:07:31] it's the story of Zechariah and
[1:07:34] Elizabeth
[1:07:35] they were great they were great in age
[1:07:42] performing the duties of a priest
[1:07:46] in the burning of incense
[1:07:49] they're clearing that behind the curtain
[1:07:53] something takes place verse 13 of Luke
[1:07:56] 1. the angel said unto him fear not
[1:07:59] Zacharias for thy prayer is heard and
[1:08:02] the wife Elizabeth shall bear their son
[1:08:05] and El shall call his name John Cena
[1:08:14] we'd later found out that this John Was
[1:08:17] Elijah
[1:08:20] not the literal Elijah
[1:08:22] but he was coming in the spirit and
[1:08:25] power of Elijah
[1:08:27] verse 14 and thou shalt have joy and
[1:08:29] gladness and many shall rejoice at his
[1:08:31] birth
[1:08:35] where he shall be great in the sight of
[1:08:37] the Lord and shall drink neither wine
[1:08:39] nor strong drink
[1:08:41] foreign
[1:08:45] the angel Gabriel Gabriel is reinforcing
[1:08:48] what the prophet Malachi said
[1:08:52] he's purifying the sons of leaves
[1:08:55] it's going to change the ministry first
[1:08:58] so he can change God's people
[1:09:05] and it shall be filled with the Holy
[1:09:08] ghosts
[1:09:16] the ministry must be changed first
[1:09:20] stand before God's people must be
[1:09:22] changed first
[1:09:25] they must be born again they must have
[1:09:28] the Holy ghosts
[1:09:29] they must experience refillings
[1:09:36] see the order of the new ministry so
[1:09:40] they can take the head of every home
[1:09:43] into the same meaning
[1:09:51] for too long in this message foreign
[1:10:09] and they work 60 80 hours a week
[1:10:13] don't read their Bible till they come to
[1:10:15] church
[1:10:16] and then they only read the scriptures
[1:10:18] that the pastor reads
[1:10:21] if the pastor's even reading the words
[1:10:26] because they're falling into the same
[1:10:29] as the pastors that lead themes
[1:10:34] wants to bring change to each and every
[1:10:37] one of us
[1:10:44] and many of the children of Israel shall
[1:10:47] he turn to the Lord their God
[1:10:51] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[1:10:54] and power of Elias to turn the hearts of
[1:10:57] the fathers to the children
[1:11:03] it's here that Gabriel
[1:11:05] stands in the seventh dimension in the
[1:11:08] presence of God
[1:11:10] it's here where he connects John is
[1:11:19] that he will turn the hearts of the
[1:11:21] fathers to the children
[1:11:25] he doesn't read the other hand and then
[1:11:29] he says obedient the wisdom of the
[1:11:32] Justice
[1:11:37] Angel Gabriel was quoting
[1:11:40] the spoken word of God that Israel knew
[1:11:44] as the writings of the Prophet Malachi
[1:11:45] Israel
[1:11:49] then he says this Mighty Angel he then
[1:11:54] had ears to hear
[1:11:55] let him here
[1:11:58] that had never been said that way
[1:12:01] and when you read the seven churches
[1:12:05] there in Revelations
[1:12:09] every age ends
[1:12:11] with that declaration
[1:12:18] because a New Covenant was being ushered
[1:12:26] this was this this was the the words
[1:12:29] of a new book called the Lamb's Book of
[1:12:33] Life
[1:12:37] declaring the birth of them
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:13:02] basically he says
[1:13:05] Matthew 11 16. but we're unto shall I
[1:13:09] like in this generation
[1:13:12] it is like unto children sitting in the
[1:13:15] markets and calling them to their fellas
[1:13:17] [Music]
[1:13:21] listen close now is
[1:13:26] unto you and you have not dancedocamos
[1:13:30] flautas we have more than to you and you
[1:13:33] have not lamented us
[1:13:37] for John came neither eating nor
[1:13:39] drinking and they say he hath the devil
[1:13:44] the son of man came eating and drinking
[1:13:47] and they say Behold a gluttonous man and
[1:13:49] a wine River
[1:13:56] the same ones that accused John
[1:13:59] um
[1:14:01] the same ones that shouted out to him
[1:14:05] saying we've piped until you have not
[1:14:08] danced this is
[1:14:13] where John came neither eating or
[1:14:15] drinking is
[1:14:45] he says but wisdom is Justified of her
[1:14:48] children is
[1:14:52] at the end of these Jewish ages
[1:14:55] Forerunner
[1:15:01] videos
[1:15:06] John the Baptist came on the scene it
[1:15:10] was the beginning of the ride of the
[1:15:11] white horse
[1:15:14] in other words the first seals
[1:15:18] what is the first seal yes I've always
[1:15:22] told you before it's part one is
[1:15:34] so at the end of these Jewish ages
[1:15:37] it was going to be ushering Gentile
[1:15:40] churches
[1:15:43] it was here where the promise of a new
[1:15:46] ministry had risen up
[1:15:49] ministry who would forerun the coming of
[1:15:52] Christ
[1:15:54] we share the scriptures of John the
[1:15:56] Baptist
[1:15:58] this Forerunner
[1:16:02] who would introduce the Lamb of God
[1:16:06] but in Isaiah 7 and 4.
[1:16:10] then Isaiah is is here introducing this
[1:16:14] lamb
[1:16:16] and it starts
[1:16:22] verse Isaiah 7 and 14.
[1:16:25] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:16:28] you a sign Behold a virgin shall
[1:16:30] conceive and bear a son and shall call
[1:16:33] his name Emmanuel
[1:16:35] yeah
[1:16:41] the Jewish people knew what Emmanuel
[1:16:43] meant
[1:16:46] it meant God With Us
[1:16:49] it meant that this child
[1:16:53] would be God this would be Jehovah
[1:16:59] they weren't thinking two Gods
[1:17:02] thinking three three persons of the tree
[1:17:06] no they were seeing God changing forms
[1:17:12] to get closer to them but they didn't
[1:17:16] know how he would get closer
[1:17:18] John was going to tell them how Juan
[1:17:21] John gonna tell them
[1:17:26] Isaiah 14.
[1:17:28] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:17:31] you a sign behold of Isaiah 7 14 Behold
[1:17:35] a virgin shall conceive and bear a son
[1:17:37] and call his name Emmanuel he says
[1:17:47] butter and honey shall he eat that he
[1:17:50] may know how to refuse the evil and
[1:17:52] choose the goods
[1:17:56] did you see it love you it's how to
[1:17:58] raise your children
[1:18:02] you know our sons are daughters
[1:18:05] sometimes they got to go out in the
[1:18:07] world
[1:18:08] so they can appreciate God later
[1:18:13] you know what that is that's allowing
[1:18:16] them to do what he did
[1:18:19] the tree of knowledge
[1:18:24] it's destruction
[1:19:23] that will fill our hearts in mind is
[1:19:34] aiah 7. was a child being born
[1:19:39] Isaiah 9 6 the child is born
[1:19:43] to us a child is born unto us a son is
[1:19:47] given and the government shall be upon
[1:19:49] his shoulder and his name Shall be

[1:20:43] peace there shall be no end
[1:20:48] upon the throne of David and upon his
[1:20:50] kingdom to order it
[1:20:53] and to establish it with judgment and
[1:20:56] with Justice
[1:20:58] from henceforth even forever
[1:21:01] the Zeal of the Lord of hosts will
[1:21:04] perform
[1:21:09] as the angel of the Covenant
[1:21:11] looking for a man who was Worthy
[1:21:49] a child was born
[1:21:53] that you would be the Lamb of God
[1:21:57] both of these scriptures we're speaking
[1:21:59] of Jesus Christ and yet his name was
[1:22:02] never mentioned
[1:22:05] you know you share with his with people
[1:22:08] today God sent a prophet
[1:22:11] let's say where does it say his name
[1:22:13] there is
[1:22:21] aiah 7 Isaiah 9.
[1:22:23] where does it call this baby Jesus
[1:22:30] you'll never find the name of Jesus in
[1:22:33] there
[1:22:35] it took a revelation
[1:22:39] and if you lived in the days of this
[1:22:42] little married
[1:22:44] and she said an angel appeared to me
[1:22:48] and said this would be the son of God
[1:22:53] that this is Emmanuel
[1:22:55] and you know what his name is Jesus
[1:23:00] and in that day people will tell her
[1:23:02] where is that written in the Old
[1:23:04] Testament
[1:23:06] God's name is
[1:23:10] they were offended foreign
[1:23:53] [Music]
[1:24:05] he's the author
[1:24:07] he's the finisher of our faith
[1:24:10] he's the only one that can open them
[1:24:12] it's
[1:24:14] his book and when it speaks
[1:24:19] it just doesn't mean this it means a
[1:24:23] revelation you don't understand
[1:24:32] showing you your name
[1:24:36] and people can say
[1:24:38] can you think your name's in here
[1:24:41] I know it's in there show it to me
[1:24:45] no no you'll never see it it's just for
[1:24:48] me yes
[1:24:58] and it says who have believed our report
[1:25:02] and two and to whom is the arm of the
[1:25:05] Lord reveals
[1:25:07] watch Isaiah 40.
[1:25:11] speaking of the forerunners
[1:25:14] remember in verse 5. and it said and the
[1:25:18] glory of the Lord shall be revealed
[1:25:22] and in Isaiah 53
[1:25:25] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[1:25:27] reveals
[1:25:30] for speaking of the same time
[1:25:33] a time of revealing Revelation a time of
[1:25:37] change
[1:25:38] a time of when God would be the would be
[1:25:41] the Lamb of God
[1:25:44] and Revelations
[1:25:47] is the same time
[1:25:51] it's the time of the book
[1:25:54] by Jesus Christ the Lamb of God now
[1:25:59] scriptures
[1:26:07] Revelations
[1:26:08] all of this is the same time all these
[1:26:12] scriptures come together
[1:26:14] oh go back and read it Roberto
[1:26:24] Isaiah 53 and verse 2.
[1:26:27] he's a 12 year old boy now
[1:26:30] for he shall grow up before him as a
[1:26:33] tender plant
[1:26:35] and there's a root out of dry ground
[1:26:38] he has no form no comliness
[1:26:42] and when we shall see him
[1:26:45] there is no beauty that we should desire
[1:26:47] here
[1:26:50] he looked like you're common
[1:26:53] every day
[1:26:55] 12 year old Jewish boys
[1:26:59] brown skin Morena
[1:27:08] we're in the same kind of clothing 12
[1:27:11] year old boys
[1:27:14] and yet that was God in that boy

[1:27:26] and once again

[1:28:21] que sera senior in Israel whose going
[1:28:24] forth have been from from of old from
[1:28:27] Everlasting is
[1:28:32] another detail um
[1:28:35] about this child that would be born
[1:28:37] through a virgin
[1:28:39] about this child that would grow up
[1:28:42] now he adds and tells us where this
[1:28:45] child will be born
[1:28:56] [Music]
[1:28:59] because this Lamb of God
[1:29:05] and he would now be the king of Judah
[1:29:08] said he would now be the king of the
[1:29:11] Kings
[1:29:14] but the scripture
[1:29:26] the lion of the tribe of Jews
[1:29:29] the scriptures are coming together
[1:29:32] the way God wrote his Bible
[1:29:35] he says you bring the prophecies
[1:29:37] together
[1:29:39] they add more details but without
[1:29:43] Revelations
[1:29:45] even the things that William Branham
[1:29:49] they don't fit together not without
[1:29:52] Revelations without Revelation
[1:29:55] Revelation it looks like he's saying two
[1:29:57] different things
[1:29:59] without Revelations the Old Testament
[1:30:02] prophecies
[1:30:04] they don't seem to merge together
[1:30:07] God begins to Open the Eyes
[1:30:31] and his father Zachariah
[1:30:35] was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:30:37] this was long before the day of
[1:30:40] Pentecost
[1:30:41] this was years before the day of
[1:30:43] Pentacles
[1:30:45] God had introduced a New Covenant
[1:30:48] and God was bringing change in the lives
[1:31:00] God was bringing them and they were they
[1:31:04] were receiving this Holy Spirit
[1:31:07] and his father Zechariah
[1:31:14] blessed be the Lord God of Israel
[1:31:17] he has visited and redeemed his people
[1:31:22] the time of revealing
[1:31:24] was the time of the opening of the book
[1:31:28] it's also the time of redemption
[1:31:35] and hath raised up an Horn of salvation
[1:31:37] for us in the house of his servantages
[1:31:48] as he spake by the mouth of his holy
[1:31:51] Prophets
[1:31:52] which have been since the world began
[1:31:57] it's a divinely revealed mystery truth
[1:32:05] God ordained the prophetic Ministries
[1:32:15] that's that's where God is brought forth
[1:32:19] the prophetic Ministry
[1:32:21] in Luke 1 71
[1:32:24] he did it for a purpose that we should
[1:32:27] be saved from our enemies
[1:32:30] and from the hand of all that haters
[1:32:35] to our fathers
[1:32:37] [Music]
[1:32:39] and to bring and to bring remembrance of
[1:32:42] his holy cows
[1:32:48] who is a man who lived by faith
[1:32:51] not under the law
[1:33:40] and the people not be afraid shall there
[1:33:43] be evil in the city and the Lord has not
[1:33:45] done it
[1:33:52] surely the Lord God will do nothing
[1:33:57] his servants is secret unto his servants
[1:34:01] the promise
[1:34:03] and then the prophets are to give it to
[1:34:05] the people

[1:35:00] Seven Seals
[1:35:02] that's what Israel rejected
[1:35:05] and when they reject
[1:35:07] that's what was given to us so that's
[1:35:10] what was given to a Gentiles on the day
[1:35:13] of Pentacles

[1:40:05] those are the refills
[1:40:27] and
[1:40:30] delivers you
[1:40:34] angels in Camp about you
[1:40:38] you are loose from all that vexes
[1:40:45] when the stress is all gone
[1:40:47] you say wow wow I didn't think I was
[1:40:51] going to make it for them
[1:40:52] you know what it was it was a refilling
[1:40:58] of the Holy Spirit
[1:41:01] you just pour it in a little more
[1:41:06] songwriter said yes
[1:41:20] Isaiah Luke 167.
[1:41:24] and his father Zachariah was filled with
[1:41:26] the Holy Ghost and prophesied saying
[1:41:31] blessed be the Lord God of Israel
[1:41:33] has visited and redeemed his people
[1:41:36] and raised up an Horn of Salvation
[1:41:42] as he spake by the mouth of his holy
[1:41:45] prophet
[1:41:46] which have been since
[1:41:49] and the prophets
[1:41:51] came for a reason
[1:41:53] from Genesis the Genesis
[1:41:56] 21st century
[1:41:59] that he would grant them to us
[1:42:03] verse 74. that we would that we've been
[1:42:06] delivered that he would Grant unto us
[1:42:09] that we've been delivered out of the
[1:42:11] hands of our enemies might serve him
[1:42:14] without fear
[1:42:16] properties
[1:42:28] in Holiness and righteousness before him
[1:42:31] all the days
[1:42:34] you will still bring back Holiness
[1:42:37] to bring back righteousness he will be a
[1:42:41] man that could enter into a house
[1:42:45] [Music]
[1:42:51] this how this house is a house
[1:43:05] change is not easy
[1:43:08] but change is needed
[1:43:16] John was the prophet prophet Elijah
[1:43:20] Elias the Forerunner The only voice of
[1:43:23] God at that time
[1:43:26] ushering in a new age
[1:43:29] a New Testament no Testament if you
[1:43:31] rejected John
[1:43:33] you probably rejected
[1:43:35] Jesus
[1:43:40] when you reject the prophetic Ministry
[1:43:43] you reject all the benefits
[1:43:46] that it's designed to give questions
[1:43:49] John was the beginning
[1:43:51] of a new ministry no longer after the
[1:43:55] law
[1:43:57] and the prophets but the order of a new
[1:44:00] ministry was to present the way of
[1:44:03] perfection
[1:44:04] as Jesus said in Matthew 5 48.
[1:44:09] as Jesus said in Matthew 5.
[1:44:17] even as my father
[1:44:21] a prophet said if Jesus said it
[1:44:25] requires it in your life
[1:44:27] he must make a way for you to get there
[1:44:37] because Perfection
[1:44:39] as God wants it for us
[1:44:41] is different
[1:44:43] than what people think perfectionism
[1:44:54] then where do we go
[1:44:56] back to the world or Bible questions
[1:45:04] Hebrews 7 11 everyone
[1:45:08] if therefore Perfection
[1:45:11] or by the levitical pries
[1:45:18] what further need was there that another
[1:45:21] priest should rise up after the order of
[1:45:24] Melchizedek
[1:45:28] and not be called after the order of
[1:45:31] Errors
[1:45:32] for the priesthood
[1:45:37] he was coming first to change the
[1:45:39] priesthood
[1:45:41] people would have no hope
[1:45:45] nine prophets that dragged Israel down
[1:45:57] into his presence
[1:46:01] for the priesthood
[1:46:03] there is made a necessity a change also
[1:46:10] for three of whom these things are
[1:46:12] spoken pertaineth to another tribe
[1:46:16] of which no man gave attendance
[1:46:20] in other words Jesus
[1:46:27] nowhere was it written
[1:46:30] that man of the tribe of Judah
[1:46:33] would give attendance at the altars as
[1:46:36] priests immaculous
[1:47:38] and it is yet far more evident for that
[1:47:40] after the similitude of Melchizedek
[1:47:43] there arises another priests
[1:47:50] who was made not after the law of a
[1:47:52] carnal commandment but after the power
[1:47:54] of an endless life
[1:48:09] this is
[1:48:21] Verse 18 for there is verily a distance
[1:48:24] of the Commandment going before for the
[1:48:27] weakness and unprofitableness
[1:48:34] for the law made nothing perfect well
[1:48:36] it's not a Perfection only but the
[1:48:38] bringing in of a better hope
[1:48:41] that's Christ this is Crystal that's
[1:48:43] this is
[1:48:45] by which we draw now
[1:48:49] man could never get close to God Alone
[1:48:55] he could never draw close to God
[1:49:02] but the revealed word
[1:49:06] the preaching Perfection
[1:49:13] it was a change in Ministry
[1:49:20] Luke 16 and 16. look as he says we read
[1:49:24] it and we'll read it once again
[1:49:26] on the prophets were until John
[1:49:29] and then people say you see
[1:49:32] no more profit professor
[1:49:50] who would continue now
[1:49:52] the law and the prophets
[1:49:56] the kingdom of God
[1:49:59] so the prophetic Ministry of prophetica
[1:50:02] wasn't being done away
[1:50:04] but the prophetic Ministry was being
[1:50:07] changed
[1:50:10] they had a new message
[1:50:16] now the grace of God
[1:50:18] ushering in a new kingdom
[1:50:22] Australian life
[1:50:26] John was a prophetic ministry
[1:50:29] under the order of melchized
[1:50:32] a priesthood that spoke Perfection
[1:50:36] and a relationship restored universe
[1:50:45] foreign
[1:51:04] and the love that was being expressed to
[1:51:07] him
[1:51:08] and the things that the father was
[1:51:11] teaching us
[1:51:19] then that's what the prophetic Ministry
[1:51:21] has come again
[1:51:31] but the things Jesus spoke
[1:51:35] things that have been hid since the
[1:51:37] foundation of the world
[1:51:52] but you've got to go read it
[1:51:56] and when you find it
[1:51:59] feel like you have found a pearl of
[1:52:01] great prices
[1:52:03] and you'll pay any price has to be paid
[1:52:06] to hold it
[1:52:10] so keep it in your house to keep it in
[1:52:14] your thoughts
[1:52:23] it's the price it's a pleasure of a
[1:52:26] dedicated life
[1:52:31] John what
[1:52:34] a prophetic Ministry
[1:52:38] a priesthood that spoke Perfection
[1:52:43] a relationship restored
[1:52:45] like it wasn't even
[1:52:48] tutorship begins
[1:52:53] Fellowship begins
[1:52:57] you're a son and a daughter
[1:53:02] what does that mean
[1:53:04] in a single word
[1:53:08] perfect
[1:53:15] and the first thing people say
[1:53:18] you don't understand
[1:53:24] but remember Matthew 5 48.
[1:53:27] was a closing statement
[1:53:32] that Jesus was preaching and had
[1:53:35] preached some Perfection yeah
[1:53:42] because for 47 verses
[1:53:45] you've been telling you how to get there
[1:53:55] and if it's and if you go back and read
[1:53:57] those 47 verses
[1:53:59] you say this is too simple
[1:54:02] I'll say it's Garden simply see that
[1:54:09] revealing himself
[1:54:14] but Jesus said your Perfection begins
[1:54:17] like this foreign
[1:54:31] start letting go
[1:54:33] a very complex
[1:54:36] say Jesus I can't deal with this Jesus
[1:54:39] you
[1:54:45] you wash me
[1:54:47] like a Refiner's
[1:54:50] fireworks
[1:54:56] from this first two verses
[1:55:01] so if you've read
[1:55:04] 48.48
[1:55:09] no I can't do it it's simple yeah simply
[1:55:13] go back start at verse one again
[1:55:16] because those are the little steps
[1:55:25] thank you
[1:55:27] you're a son and daughter
[1:55:29] in the process of adoption god is
[1:55:33] perfect
[1:55:35] a prophet of God was thrown off a ship
[1:55:39] one time
[1:55:42] because he was headed the wrong
[1:55:44] direction
[1:55:51] himself going in the wrong direction
[1:55:55] but he wasn't the first Adam was the
[1:55:59] first to be thrown out of a ship
[1:56:03] you see Adam lost his Fellowship
[1:56:06] Adam lost his tutorship
[1:56:10] Adam lost his mentorship
[1:56:12] Adam was tossed off The Old Ship of Zion
[1:56:19] but what we're promised today is
[1:56:27] Stadium
[1:56:32] brother Brandon
[1:56:34] an old preacher once asked brother
[1:56:36] Branham um
[1:56:40] you know what Fellowship is
[1:56:43] and he was a he was a man who preached
[1:56:46] the gospel all his life
[1:56:49] goes well I think so I think so brother
[1:56:53] yeah
[1:56:58] for sure
[1:57:03] there's two fellows
[1:57:05] Muchachos
[1:57:09] he said and one you know if you if you
[1:57:13] did it right
[1:57:18] who would like to be there
[1:57:22] change
[1:57:50] there is made a necessity a change also
[1:57:53] of the
[1:57:54] laws
[1:57:57] what was the change of this new
[1:57:59] priesthood Prophets
[1:58:03] pastors teachers maestros evangelists
[1:58:06] and they must have the Holy Ghost
[1:58:10] they must be born again or they don't
[1:58:13] qualify to be part of this is
[1:58:27] perfection Perfection the born-again
[1:58:30] experience
[1:58:35] because they can't place before you
[1:58:38] what they've never experiences
[1:58:48] and their teachers and some say their
[1:58:51] prophets and
[1:58:54] is
[1:59:00] placed the promises
[1:59:03] sorry too much place the promises
[1:59:08] at the reach of the people
[1:59:10] we must Place Madison
[1:59:13] and Holiness at the reach of our sons
[1:59:18] we must Place Fidelity
[1:59:23] we must Place forgiveness
[1:59:27] who have been torn by sins
[1:59:37] no Creed but Christ
[1:59:42] and that's an open book yes
[1:59:49] since the opening of The Seven series
[1:59:56] has become a new book
[1:59:59] and he'd been preaching from it for 30
[2:00:01] years
[2:00:02] and after 30 years
[2:00:05] he said the Bible
[2:01:14] they're going to preach Christ
[2:01:39] long after John had been beheaded
[2:01:42] foreign
[2:02:38] long after John is dead
[2:02:41] Jesus Jesus
[2:02:44] confirms
[2:02:51] but not under the law prophets that will
[2:02:54] preach the Kingdom of Heaven
[2:02:57] prophets like Peter Prophet is
[2:03:05] and apostles
[2:03:08] that worked with Paul
[2:03:10] while he was in prison
[2:03:13] there was many prophets
[2:03:17] you know what they were preaching is
[2:03:22] the Kingdom of Heaven is
[2:03:28] a new cabinet a New Testament no
[2:03:31] testamental
[2:03:33] the first coming of Christ
[2:03:36] it was the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:03:39] bringing life to us
[2:03:44] when Jesus came
[2:03:47] at the end of his ministry
[2:03:50] he speaks out to Israel Israel
[2:03:54] the king of the Jews
[2:03:57] he says unto them in Matthew 23 30.
[2:04:01] Jerusalem
[2:04:05] thou that killeth the prophets
[2:04:09] and stone is them which are sent unto
[2:04:12] them
[2:04:14] prophets are still treated that way
[2:04:17] how often would I have gathered thy
[2:04:20] children together
[2:04:21] even as a hen gathereth her chickens
[2:04:24] under her wings and you would not
[2:04:29] again
[2:04:32] this speaks of the condition
[2:04:35] of Israel Israel when Jesus came and
[2:04:39] Jesus lowered himself in a parable
[2:04:42] and he said here I am
[2:04:45] Jehovah
[2:04:48] almighty god holds himself
