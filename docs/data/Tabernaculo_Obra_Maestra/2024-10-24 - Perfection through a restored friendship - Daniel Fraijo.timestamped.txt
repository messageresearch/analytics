[46:23] tonight it's good to be back
[46:27] it's good to be back in the main
[46:32] sanctuary and uh they've been having
[46:34] problems as brother Kenny
[46:37] mentioned with the air
[46:40] conditioning of course you can feel
[46:43] that uh and they told us it's going to
[46:45] be yet several more
[46:49] weeks so we'll have to be in contact
[46:52] with the property owner
[46:58] to see what the what the long delay has
[47:01] been
[47:03] here but Lord willing we will have
[47:06] service here on
[47:09] Sunday and uh We've lined up to have
[47:11] some uh portable portable air
[47:18] conditioner and we'll probably set it up
[47:20] in one of the back Corners over
[47:23] here and it should be enough to cool the
[47:26] building for us
[47:32] because it's it appears to be it's going
[47:33] to be a longer delay
[47:36] yet and we can continue having the our
[47:39] services now in the main
[47:43] sanctuary uh some of the brothers that
[47:45] listen online have been
[47:51] calling so we wanted to get back into
[47:54] the building
[47:55] here to be able to broadcast the
[48:01] services uh and uh let the folks uh the
[48:05] brothers that listen in be able to be
[48:07] blessed
[48:11] also uh we we we we we were speaking on
[48:15] uh the three steps of
[48:19] Grace and uh we want to continue on on
[48:22] that same
[48:24] subject and tonight it's a it's a
[48:27] message we've shared with the church
[48:31] before but it's a continuation of what
[48:34] we spoke on on
[48:37] Sunday and entitled it Perfection
[48:40] through a restored
[48:46] friendship and and and the
[48:49] subject is
[48:52] adoption adoption the
[48:55] process and Perfection is the
[48:59] Capstone and God has made it all
[49:02] possible through the blood of
[49:05] Jesus if you'll stand with me to your
[49:07] feet this
[49:09] evening and we'll be reading from Psalms
[49:13] 51 verses 1-
[49:18] 10 Psalms 51 and verse
[49:22] one it says have mercy upon me oh God
[49:26] according according to thy loving
[49:31] kindness according unto the multitude of
[49:33] thy Tender
[49:38] Mercies Blood Out My
[49:41] transgressions Wash Me thoroughly from
[49:44] my iniquity and cleanse me from my
[49:50] sin if you remember this
[49:53] Psalm that that David that David wrote
[49:58] it's when Nathan the prophet had come to
[50:01] him after he had
[50:04] gone and taken the wife of of
[50:08] Uriah a great mighty man in his
[50:12] army and he actually planned his
[50:19] murder he had planned his
[50:22] murder uh so because he had already
[50:25] committed adultery with the man's
[50:30] wife and this is David crying out to
[50:33] God after Nathan went to
[50:37] him and the prophet and called out his
[50:41] sins he said Wash Me thoroughly from my
[50:44] iniquity verse two and cleanse me from
[50:47] my
[50:50] sin for I acknowledge my transgressions
[50:53] and my sin is ever before me
[50:59] behold I was shapen in iniquity and in
[51:02] sin did not did my mother conceive
[51:10] me that's each and every one of us
[51:13] that's how we came into this
[51:15] world we were shaped in
[51:17] iniquity and in sin did our mother
[51:20] conceive
[51:22] us because what happened in the
[51:25] garden was the curse That Came Upon This
[51:28] human
[51:30] race it's the way we're born that's the
[51:34] problem God wanted us to come by the
[51:37] spoken
[51:39] word he wanted Adam Adam and Eve to
[51:41] bring a forth the family of
[51:45] God according to the pattern he
[51:48] set and the pattern he said was he took
[51:52] 16 elements from the ground
[51:56] and from the clay he made a
[51:59] man and then he called the life of that
[52:01] man
[52:03] Adam that Spirit man to come into that
[52:06] body he
[52:09] made and then he said then the word say
[52:11] and Man became a living
[52:15] Soul it was it was now man living in a
[52:19] flesh
[52:21] body verse six says behold thou desirest
[52:26] truth in the inward parts and in the
[52:29] hidden part Thou shalt make me to know
[52:36] wisdom Purge me with
[52:40] hisop hisop was a common
[52:44] plant you could find it anywhere in
[52:46] those in those
[52:49] areas they even used it to put the blood
[52:52] of the
[52:54] Lamb on on on on on on the on the
[52:58] door of the homes of the
[53:02] Israelites there there there in
[53:05] Egypt they use
[53:08] hop a common
[53:10] plant to apply blood of the
[53:14] Lamb on the on on on their
[53:17] doors so that when the death angel would
[53:20] walk would come through through the
[53:23] land they would see the blood
[53:26] innocent
[53:27] lamb it would see that you've been OB
[53:30] you've been obedient to God's
[53:34] word and death would pass it it wouldn't
[53:37] strike your home it wouldn't strike your
[53:40] family your firstborn son or daughter
[53:43] could
[53:46] live and it was a simple
[53:49] process David said Purge me with hisop
[53:52] and I shall be clean wash me and I shall
[53:55] be whiter than
[54:02] snow make me to hear joy and gladness
[54:06] and the and that the bones which thou
[54:08] has broken May
[54:14] Rejoice hide thy face from my sins and
[54:18] blot out all my
[54:23] iniquities and is you know what
[54:25] iniquities are
[54:28] it's when you know the right thing to
[54:32] do and yet you didn't do the right
[54:35] thing that's
[54:38] iniquity David said hide thy face from
[54:42] my sins and blot out all my
[54:46] iniquities verse
[54:50] n then he said create in me a clean
[54:55] heart knew he didn't have a clean
[54:58] heart he had a heart that was vexed and
[55:04] corrupt he said oh God and renew a right
[55:07] Spirit within
[55:15] me because he knew his
[55:19] Spirit had been
[55:23] polluted in other words without even no
[55:26] understanding he was asking to be born
[55:31] again though he didn't know about a new
[55:34] birth but he knew he needed something
[55:37] that he didn't have at the
[55:39] time we now know what that something is
[55:42] that the heart cries
[55:46] for and that's a born again
[55:50] experience let's pray Heavenly Father we
[55:54] thank you once again tonight
[55:57] and may your Holy
[55:59] Spirit help us to concentrate on your
[56:04] word bless us now in Jesus
[56:08] name amen amen you may be
[56:24] seated in Matthew chapter
[56:27] 5 the scripture we' shared with you
[56:32] often because it's it's an important
[56:35] scripture as really is every
[56:38] scripture because the Bible all ties
[56:43] together there is no there is no
[56:45] scripture in the
[56:47] Bible that stands
[56:50] alone no this book all every word it's
[56:55] designed to be read line upon
[57:00] line here a little there a little and
[57:05] that's how the word is designed to be
[57:09] read not to take just one
[57:12] thing one scripture and put a period on
[57:16] it but but but to put a
[57:18] comma because God will add more to
[57:22] that a prophet said that the end time
[57:25] messenger
[57:27] was going to bring all the loose ends
[57:30] together that means he was going to tie
[57:32] scripture with
[57:34] scripture the book The Bible is a
[57:37] complete
[57:38] book so what's what's lacking for this
[57:43] book is we us having
[57:47] revelation of this word of God in
[57:50] Matthew
[57:52] 548 Jesus he was speaking in a parable
[57:57] because in Parables is how he always
[58:01] spoke it was the prophecy of the Old
[58:05] Testament and Matthew brought that test
[58:08] that that prophecy back to
[58:12] us there in Matthew
[58:14] 13 so Matthew
[58:17] 5:48 is is is a statement that Jesus
[58:22] made be ye therefore perfect
[58:26] even as your father which is in heaven
[58:29] is
[58:31] perfect it sounds like it's a one-time
[58:36] statement it sounds like it's a a an
[58:38] only
[58:41] statement but but it's but it's really a
[58:44] closing
[58:47] statement and it was closing off a
[58:51] thought that Jesus had he said be ye
[58:55] therefore perfect
[58:57] even as your father which is in heaven
[58:59] is
[59:01] perfect and the first thing that most
[59:04] people will
[59:06] respond now you know that we can't be
[59:13] perfect and yet a prophet said if Jesus
[59:16] said
[59:18] it then he's got to make a way for us to
[59:21] get
[59:22] there it was a
[59:24] conclusion to what he was speaking
[59:27] on so when it says be ye
[59:32] therefore there's a
[59:34] reason to be
[59:36] perfect and the reason was the other 47
[59:41] verses that Jesus was speaking
[59:44] on it was in those 47
[59:47] verses that he that he unfolded a
[59:51] plan and at the end of these 47 verses
[59:56] in the mind of God he says I've told you
[1:00:00] enough that you can aspire to be
[1:00:04] perfect even as perfect as your father
[1:00:07] which is in heaven is
[1:00:11] perfect because of the 47
[1:00:14] verses of teaching that I've brought to
[1:00:18] you so what was his teaching
[1:00:21] on on the first 47 verses
[1:00:27] Perfection the statement told us it was
[1:00:30] a closing
[1:00:32] statement 47
[1:00:35] verses was Jesus Christ preaching on how
[1:00:39] we could arrive at
[1:00:42] Perfection do you remember how the
[1:00:44] teaching
[1:00:46] started
[1:00:48] blessed are the poor in
[1:00:51] spirit remember what the psalmist David
[1:00:54] told us
[1:00:56] hide thy face from my
[1:00:59] sins blot out all my
[1:01:03] iniquities and create in me a clean
[1:01:07] heart that's what the 47 verses were
[1:01:11] about oh God and renew a right spirit in
[1:01:15] me that's what the 47 verses were
[1:01:19] about that's why when Jesus got to the
[1:01:21] 48th
[1:01:23] verse he was able to tell you
[1:01:27] with
[1:01:28] confidence You Walk This Way follow my
[1:01:32] plan and you'll be perfect even as your
[1:01:36] father which is in heaven is
[1:01:38] perfect the conclusion of
[1:01:42] perfection was speaking of a restored
[1:01:44] friendship with the
[1:01:46] [Music]
[1:01:47] father in Hebrews chapter
[1:01:50] 6 and verse one the Apostle Paul said
[1:01:54] this
[1:01:57] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:02:00] doctrine of
[1:02:05] Christ let us go on to
[1:02:09] Perfection not laying again the
[1:02:12] foundation of repentance from dead
[1:02:18] Works in other words we're no longer
[1:02:21] under the
[1:02:24] law then he says
[1:02:27] not laying again the foundation of of
[1:02:30] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[1:02:32] toward
[1:02:37] God the word
[1:02:39] perfect just from the
[1:02:42] dictionary it means it means to to make
[1:02:45] something
[1:02:47] complete to bring something to an
[1:02:50] end uh or to add to what is yet wanting
[1:02:58] in order to to render a full
[1:03:02] thing to bring to an end like a goal
[1:03:06] that you
[1:03:09] have and the last one says to bring to a
[1:03:13] close or F or fulfillment by
[1:03:20] event the Prophecies of the
[1:03:23] scriptures perfection
[1:03:26] is really only found in the word of
[1:03:30] God and what the word can do for
[1:03:33] you in this exposition of the seven
[1:03:36] Church
[1:03:38] ages brother brandom said this
[1:03:41] statement tribulation worketh
[1:03:46] patience that's a how highly regards how
[1:03:49] highly God regards this outworking of
[1:03:52] our patience
[1:03:57] is seen in James
[1:04:00] 1:4 it says but let patience have her
[1:04:03] perfect
[1:04:06] work that ye may be perfect and entire
[1:04:09] lacking
[1:04:13] nothing then he says God's will for us
[1:04:15] is
[1:04:18] perfection because that's what Jesus
[1:04:20] said be ye therefore
[1:04:23] perfect even as your father which is is
[1:04:25] in heaven is
[1:04:27] perfect then a prophet tells us and that
[1:04:30] Perfection is
[1:04:33] patience waiting on God and waiting for
[1:04:38] God this is the
[1:04:40] process of character
[1:04:46] development so for so
[1:04:49] Perfection has a
[1:04:51] process and the Lord
[1:04:53] Jesus was the first to ever bring us
[1:04:56] bring us a
[1:04:59] teaching of all the
[1:05:02] components that take us to
[1:05:05] Perfection and the process is called the
[1:05:07] adoption of Sons and Daughters of
[1:05:13] God but there's a process to even to
[1:05:15] arrive to our
[1:05:18] adoption it's called the three steps of
[1:05:22] Grace if you'll turn with me to
[1:05:24] Galatians chapter 4
[1:05:27] and verse
[1:05:29] 5 Galatians 4 and verse
[1:05:39] 5 the Apostle Paul says to the
[1:05:43] Galatians to redeem them that were under
[1:05:46] the law that we might receive the
[1:05:48] adoption of sons
[1:06:00] and because ye are
[1:06:02] Sons God has sent forth the spirit of
[1:06:05] his son into your
[1:06:08] hearts crying ABA
[1:06:11] Father which means my father my
[1:06:15] father like when Jesus cried on the
[1:06:18] cross of
[1:06:21] Calvary verse S says wherefore Thou Art
[1:06:24] no more a servant
[1:06:28] you see the relationship
[1:06:30] changes when you're born again when
[1:06:33] you're repent when you're baptized in
[1:06:35] the name of Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ the relationship
[1:06:40] changes you're no longer a
[1:06:43] servant but a
[1:06:45] son and if a son then an heir of God
[1:06:49] through
[1:06:53] Christ a friendship with the father has
[1:06:56] been
[1:06:59] renewed the same kind of friendship that
[1:07:02] Adam had with the father in the
[1:07:06] beginning and God was taking him unto
[1:07:10] Perfection to be just like the
[1:07:13] father a son who knew how to
[1:07:17] use the spoken
[1:07:20] word The Original
[1:07:22] Seed by faith in his heart
[1:07:27] Ephesians chapter
[1:07:28] 1 and verse
[1:07:30] four the Apostle Paul speaking toian
[1:07:36] Church Paul founded this Ephesian
[1:07:39] Church Paul was the pastor of this
[1:07:41] Ephesian
[1:07:44] church until he passed
[1:07:47] away and verse four of Ephesians 1
[1:07:51] says according as he has chosen Us in
[1:07:55] him
[1:07:56] before the foundation of the
[1:08:00] world how could he choose us before the
[1:08:02] foundation of the
[1:08:05] world because he's God he knew all
[1:08:08] things and because he knew all
[1:08:11] things the Bible tells us that he slew
[1:08:15] the lamb before the foundation of the
[1:08:21] world he that we should be holy and
[1:08:24] Without Blame before him in
[1:08:29] love having predestinated us unto the
[1:08:32] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:08:40] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:08:42] of his
[1:08:44] will in Romans 8 and verse
[1:08:51] 15 Paul speaking to the Romans
[1:08:56] he says for ye have not received the
[1:08:58] spirit of bondage again to
[1:09:06] fear when you give your heart to the
[1:09:08] Lord
[1:09:10] Jesus when you're baptized in his
[1:09:14] name then he takes away all
[1:09:17] fear and he tells you now that you've
[1:09:21] done this made this
[1:09:23] decision and it's the right
[1:09:26] decision he says for ye have not
[1:09:28] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:09:34] fear no not when you've re not when
[1:09:36] you've surrendered your life to Jesus
[1:09:40] Christ but you have received the spirit
[1:09:42] of
[1:09:44] adoption whereby we cry ABA
[1:09:49] father when do you receive this Spirit
[1:09:52] of
[1:09:53] adoption when you make a
[1:09:57] decision and you're baptized in the name
[1:09:59] of Jesus
[1:10:01] Christ you have nothing to fear
[1:10:05] anymore because the Holy Spirit has come
[1:10:07] to your
[1:10:09] house this house this house made of
[1:10:13] Flesh Galatians 5 and
[1:10:19] 19 Paul is going to tell
[1:10:22] us the things that we should look to
[1:10:27] and by these we'll know if if a person
[1:10:29] has given their life to the Lord
[1:10:34] Jesus or if they're just church
[1:10:38] members still living in
[1:10:40] sin hav't surrendered their
[1:10:43] lives now the works of the flesh are
[1:10:46] manifest which are
[1:10:50] these and we see them in
[1:10:53] unbelievers and we see it and make
[1:10:57] Believers and we see it in church
[1:11:01] members but the man in the woman that
[1:11:03] surrendered their
[1:11:06] life you won't see these attributes in
[1:11:09] their
[1:11:10] lives but the church member you
[1:11:13] will you mean even in the message
[1:11:16] brother
[1:11:17] Daniel Oh Yeah from the Catholic Church
[1:11:21] to this message
[1:11:23] movement if you haven't been born
[1:11:26] again these are the attributes that you
[1:11:28] will
[1:11:30] manifest it takes a
[1:11:33] humility
[1:11:35] surrendering like our little brother Eli
[1:11:39] did he surrendered his life he's free
[1:11:43] tonight like you and
[1:11:44] I now the works of the flesh are
[1:11:49] manifest which are these adultery
[1:11:54] fornication
[1:11:55] cleanness
[1:11:57] lusious
[1:11:59] idolatry
[1:12:01] witchcraft hatred variance
[1:12:05] demolitions wrath Strife seditions
[1:12:10] heresies
[1:12:12] envs murders drunkenness
[1:12:16] reings and such like of which I tell you
[1:12:22] before as I have also told you in the
[1:12:25] past
[1:12:27] ask that they that do these
[1:12:30] things shall not enter into the kingdom
[1:12:33] of
[1:12:34] God you see unless you be born
[1:12:37] again you cannot see this kingdom of
[1:12:41] God you cannot you have not entered into
[1:12:44] this kingdom of
[1:12:45] God you might be in a
[1:12:48] church but you're not in Christ no no
[1:12:52] I'm in a message
[1:12:53] Church no no but you're not in
[1:12:56] Christ until you've been born
[1:13:00] again but when you're in
[1:13:03] Christ here's the
[1:13:05] fruit of that Holy Spirit but the fruit
[1:13:08] of the spirit is
[1:13:11] love joy long peace
[1:13:16] longsuffering
[1:13:17] gentleness goodness Faith
[1:13:23] meekness temperance
[1:13:29] against such there is no
[1:13:31] law and they that are in
[1:13:34] Christ have crucified the
[1:13:37] flesh with the affections and
[1:13:41] lust Paul is saying those that are in
[1:13:45] Christ The Works of the flesh don't
[1:13:47] manifest through
[1:13:50] them they they're not
[1:13:53] adulterers they don't live in for
[1:13:56] they don't live in
[1:13:59] uncleanness no for they that are are
[1:14:02] Christ have crucified the flesh with the
[1:14:05] affections and lust verse
[1:14:12] 24 and if we live in the
[1:14:16] spirit that's the Unseen
[1:14:20] realm that's what God is doing on the
[1:14:23] inside of
[1:14:25] for if we live in the
[1:14:29] spirit let us also walk in the
[1:14:33] spirit in other words the inward work
[1:14:35] that Christ is doing in your
[1:14:40] life it will show on the
[1:14:45] outside the Holy Spirit on the
[1:14:48] inside will be
[1:14:50] declared because people will see your
[1:14:54] life they'll say you live
[1:14:57] different there's something about you
[1:15:00] you're not like the other people that
[1:15:02] work
[1:15:03] here no you're not cuz you've been born
[1:15:08] again before we come to this
[1:15:13] relationship as sons being
[1:15:17] adopted this relationship of
[1:15:20] adoption there are three steps to arrive
[1:15:25] to be sons and daughters being
[1:15:29] adopted with this incredible restored
[1:15:32] friendship with the
[1:15:34] father these three steps is
[1:15:38] justification by
[1:15:40] faith it's sanctification by the
[1:15:48] spirit it makes us dress
[1:15:51] different it makes us talk different
[1:15:55] it makes us walk
[1:15:57] different it makes a husband treat his
[1:16:00] wife
[1:16:02] differently it makes his wife the wife
[1:16:05] treat the husband
[1:16:10] differently it makes the
[1:16:12] husband even if the wife ain't acting so
[1:16:15] good that
[1:16:19] day it causes the
[1:16:22] husband to still treat her right
[1:16:26] because that's the power of the Holy
[1:16:34] Ghost justification by
[1:16:37] faith sanctification by the
[1:16:42] spirit the great Holy
[1:16:45] Spirit can change
[1:16:47] you so your own mother wouldn't even
[1:16:50] recognize
[1:16:53] you she say you ain't the same
[1:16:57] boy Something's Happened to
[1:17:00] you and the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:17:04] fire these
[1:17:06] three bring us to a restored
[1:17:10] friendship with the father called
[1:17:14] adoption unto
[1:17:16] perfection in Hebrews chapter
[1:17:19] 7 Paul told the
[1:17:22] Hebrews listen close
[1:17:25] in verse
[1:17:27] 18 for there is verely a disannulling of
[1:17:30] the Commandment going before for the
[1:17:34] weakness and unprofitableness
[1:17:42] thereof in other words Paul's saying you
[1:17:44] remember those Ten
[1:17:48] Commandments that no one could
[1:17:50] live you know why no one could live
[1:17:53] them because of the weakness of our
[1:17:56] flesh as human
[1:17:59] beings in verse 19 he tells
[1:18:02] us for the
[1:18:05] law for the law made nothing
[1:18:09] perfect those 10
[1:18:11] commandments didn't bring
[1:18:13] Perfection they weren't designed to
[1:18:15] bring
[1:18:16] Perfection they were designed to let you
[1:18:19] know that what you did is
[1:18:23] wrong but they couldn't stop you from
[1:18:26] doing
[1:18:27] it they couldn't help you to live a
[1:18:29] better
[1:18:31] life no no it was a
[1:18:35] proverb of what you shouldn't
[1:18:38] do but how can you stop
[1:18:42] doing what your flesh is pulling you to
[1:18:47] do for the law made nothing
[1:18:51] perfect but the bringing in of a better
[1:18:54] hope did
[1:18:57] by the which we draw nigh unto
[1:19:01] God so yes Paul was speaking of all Ten
[1:19:06] Commandments and he and Jesus in his
[1:19:09] Parable on adoption and
[1:19:13] Perfection also mentions
[1:19:15] them there in chapter five of
[1:19:18] Matthew and tells us how they're being
[1:19:21] disowned
[1:19:27] here is the admonition of
[1:19:32] God I just mentioned that we'll be
[1:19:34] turning to
[1:19:36] 13 and here's the admonition of
[1:19:40] God when he was opening the
[1:19:43] book that Adam lost and telling us
[1:19:47] things that had been
[1:19:50] hid since the foundation of the
[1:19:53] world Matthew
[1:19:55] 34 we might have read it last
[1:19:59] Sunday we'll read it again Matthew
[1:20:04] 13:34 all these things spoke Jesus unto
[1:20:07] the multitude and
[1:20:11] Parables and without a parable spoke he
[1:20:14] not unto
[1:20:17] them that it might be
[1:20:20] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:20:22] prophet
[1:20:26] saying I will open my mouth in
[1:20:29] Parables I will utter things which have
[1:20:31] been kept secret from the foundation of
[1:20:33] the
[1:20:38] world then Jesus sent the multitudes
[1:20:43] away and went into the house and his
[1:20:46] disciples came unto him saying declare
[1:20:49] unto us the parable of the tears of the
[1:20:51] field
[1:20:57] in parables in the style of ministry
[1:21:00] that Jesus
[1:21:02] spoke no one understood
[1:21:05] him that was the reason God chose to do
[1:21:09] it that way so we could hide it from the
[1:21:13] eyes of the wise and
[1:21:15] prudent so we can hide it from from the
[1:21:17] seed of the
[1:21:20] serpent so he can hide it from the Devil
[1:21:22] Himself
[1:21:25] and just reveal it to his
[1:21:28] children Jesus said Jesus said reveal it
[1:21:30] unto babes such as would
[1:21:34] learn he wasn't talking about babies
[1:21:38] natural he was talking about babies
[1:21:42] Supernatural children who had been born
[1:21:45] again Sons and Daughters of
[1:21:49] God and the disciples
[1:21:52] said when Jesus sent the multitude
[1:21:57] away he they said declare unto us the
[1:22:00] parable of the tears of the
[1:22:03] field in other words we need a
[1:22:07] revelation and Jesus answered them and
[1:22:11] said unto them he that sth the good
[1:22:15] seed is the son of
[1:22:17] man for the first
[1:22:20] time since he spoke it to
[1:22:23] Adam once again
[1:22:25] again the Holy Spirit lip to
[1:22:31] ear Adam's Fallen
[1:22:35] race you and
[1:22:38] I God is speaking to our
[1:22:41] hearts and opening his word to
[1:22:44] us and this is what Adam heard that day
[1:22:48] in
[1:22:50] Eden just before the
[1:22:52] fall you are privileged tonight to hear
[1:22:56] it but you're more privileged to
[1:22:59] understand when it was first
[1:23:02] spoken what I'm going to read you now
[1:23:05] was first
[1:23:07] spoken to Adam back in
[1:23:13] Eden and it says this the words of
[1:23:17] Jesus be ye therefore
[1:23:20] perfect verse 48 Matthew 5:48
[1:23:31] be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:23:35] father which is in heaven is
[1:23:42] perfect the first time it was
[1:23:46] spoken was in the Garden of
[1:23:48] Eden the first one that ever heard
[1:23:52] it was Adam and
[1:23:55] tonight you're hearing
[1:23:57] it you've heard it before you've read it
[1:24:01] before but you never but you thought it
[1:24:04] was something
[1:24:06] new you thought it was a new testament
[1:24:10] saying none of it's
[1:24:12] new this was all in the mind of God
[1:24:16] before the foundation of the
[1:24:18] world if it's thus saith the Lord if
[1:24:22] it's the spoken word
[1:24:25] if if God said it then it was in his
[1:24:28] mind in his plan wait back and eeden
[1:24:32] even before Adam but he spoke it to Adam
[1:24:37] said Adam be ye therefore
[1:24:40] perfect as I am he
[1:24:43] said it was first spoken to
[1:24:47] Adam but Adam didn't keep
[1:24:50] it but tonight God has confidence in you
[1:24:55] to share it with you to Open the Eyes of
[1:24:58] your understanding so you can see the
[1:25:01] Promise he has for
[1:25:03] you so the answer to the devil's
[1:25:07] question can we be perfect the answer is
[1:25:11] yes can we will be because
[1:25:16] Perfection is the
[1:25:18] Capstone of these three steps of
[1:25:21] Grace
[1:25:23] perfection the
[1:25:28] Capstone Perfection is the
[1:25:32] Capstone of this Born Again
[1:25:36] experience be ye therefore
[1:25:40] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:25:42] heaven is
[1:25:46] perfect what is this
[1:25:49] Perfection how is the P the the father
[1:25:52] perfect
[1:25:55] he's an eternal
[1:26:02] being remember how Jesus started his
[1:26:05] teaching on
[1:26:10] Perfection how did it
[1:26:13] begin
[1:26:17] blessed blessed are the poor in
[1:26:22] spirit that's where perfection
[1:26:25] begins if you're a seed of God if you're
[1:26:29] a son and daughter of
[1:26:31] God Perfection
[1:26:34] starts in this Fallen
[1:26:37] condition in this in this old past
[1:26:42] house God made you a
[1:26:44] promise he's going to change
[1:26:47] you if you surrender your
[1:26:52] life he'll bring bring it to
[1:26:55] Perfection if you won't surrender your
[1:26:58] life then you and I will die in our
[1:27:03] sin but if we
[1:27:05] surrender we
[1:27:07] repent and are baptized in the name of
[1:27:09] Jesus
[1:27:11] Christ The Promise is you will be
[1:27:16] perfect even as your
[1:27:18] father which is in
[1:27:20] heaven is perfect we put a common
