there's no doubt about that but he wants to give you more he wants to he wants you to testify he wants you to share your testimony he wants you to encourage others we're here we're here for one another we all need one another there's no big eyes we're all in the same boat there's only one great one Jesus and so I just want to say one more thing before we sing this song brother Jonathan read that scripture the Lord is our light you know I heard somebody said before I heard it but it really hurts my heart was it doesn't matter how dark it gets because the light is gonna push through that Darkness is greater than that Darkness how many are thankful tonight that he brought you out when I first I remember I first heard this song it blessed me so much I was just in tears because you know I know where he brought me from and I wish I could say it wasn't from the world but it was I wish I could say that I never went into because that's a greater testimony but I still thank God that he brought me out because no matter where he brought me from he still brought me up and I know I'm not married foreign my heart was distressed [Music] he brought me down [Music] [Applause] [Music]

[Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] no more it is [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] they would be repeating the lives of the human race it has repeated in our day in this 20th and 21st century let's read once again in Genesis go read the first three verses in the beginning God created the heavens okay [Music] but watched verse 2. verse 1 in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth and the next statement is so strange to me that this God of creation made the heavens the universe but then verse 2 says and the Earth as opposed to Jupiter and Pluto and Saturn the Earth in particular was without form foreign so so I say between verse 1 and verse 2. there's something between the lines that the heavens and the Earth that God created there was something in between verse one and two that brought it to this Fallen condition and darkness was upon him and God came back and visited and he said this is not how I made it so what I'm going to do now I'm going to go back to my original plan original and the Bible says and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep can the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters and God said let there be light and there was light this this Earth was a Fallen Earth it had fallen apart again verse 4 says and God saw the light that it was good because when he saw it in this dark conditions that's it this isn't good because he said I'm going to bring the light and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness he still does that today is [Applause] and when he sees that you surrender to the light he says Hey listen that's good it says let's pray heavenly father thank you gracias give you honor and glory glory in Jesus name add your blessings to your word go from bench to bench from heart to heart we went through foreign the Book of Genesis the first chapter into the second Premiere and this is really a pre-figure this is a this is a shadow a type yes it's a pattern that would repeat throughout the history of the human race we saw that the first chapter of Genesis included six days of creation first God brought to life and separated from the darkness then he separated the water because the Earth was covered in water there was no oxygen that could be that could be breathedral he divided the ferment from the waters which were under the ferments [Music] that means that the hurricane Earth was covered in a water that it wasn't livable for a human being called The Firm in heaven and then he begins to tell us and mark the time that they started and when he made the light he said in the evening and the morning were the first things when he cleaned up the Earth and all the water separated he said as and God called The Firm in heaven and the evening in the morning were the second day then the Bible says once she cleaned up the Earth of that atmosphere he said then he began to bring forth the grass and Herb building seeds and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind yeah and he said in the evening in the morning were the third days then he went on to creating the lights the Stars signs and Seasons lights in the ferment I mean stars and meteorites and everything else in the heavens this is all every light no matter how small it was designed to give light upon the Earth the greatest like the sun lit up the entire world and people could walk in the days God also created another light it created what's called what we call the moon and the Moon in itself has no life but the moon has a characteristics it reflects the light of the flowers it's a perfect reflector something about the moon the way God made it to reflect light to the Earth with the fullness of the sun wasn't present [Music] the sentences spirit prophetica [Music] [Music] [Music] is because all of these prophets all of these signs we're going to follow us and all of this book of Genesis represents a great Plan of Redemption Genesis 1. with six days of creation the last day God makes man but God made the man a spirit man this woman was in the man so all of this prophecies he plays his son on this Earth that had been redeemed that had been cleansed with the light of God which is the pillar of fires and this was the prophetic word yes it hadn't come on Earth yet this one on the earth Adam wasn't on the Earth but that's what it was all waiting foreign [Music] first we bring you back to ask him who said and these times shall follow them who was the line of the tribe of Judah who was the Lamb of God who was Jehovah in other words the one in Genesis that's who this Jesus was the old town is his is the things that he says are some of them Old Testaments for is all of it saith Allah isn't everything he says an eternal thought um so God is waiting he's going to keep his own words because he's Hebrews 3 30. Jesus Christ [Music] in Glendale and and in the future the God is yours that's increasing our faith so he's waiting up and he's going to bring forth his son he's going to have a personal relationship with his son that's on the seventh day yes because the seventh day represents the seventh Church represents the seventh seal representation represents that those angels are pouring out okay God doesn't bring Darkness God is but sometimes he'll allow it to come by giving the human race free moral agency is so Genesis 1. in Genesis 2. Genesis 2 is all about our relationships so what would the seventh sea will be about the seven churches it would be about God wanting to have a personal relationship with you that's what he wants to take us back that's the promise that's our hope for today we read this so in the beginning Darkness was upon the face of the deep yes and the first thing God does he brings the life turn with me to Saint John Juan chapter one Saint John 1 and verse 1. and it reads yes in the beginning and the principia was the word a new beginning and the Word was with God and the Word was gone oh John was catching a revelation of what happened in Genesis is it the same was in the beginning with God that was when God said let there be lie that light was the pillar of fires clean up because it's in the next day God makes the sun it makes the Moon God makes meteorites that makes all kinds of celestial beings that will reflect light to the Earth God does that because God is not about darkness in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was gone the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him foreign nombre and then he called for that spirit that he had created and placed that Spirit man in this flesh body that God had created with his own hands that was the first Adam God does it again God creates a body but it must come through the woman so that that body can be Kinsmen to you and I but like I said because the law of redemption it had to be someone who had the means the money to to redeem maybe you had lost everything you had lost your land but there was a year that was called a jubilee year and after seven after 49 years the law of redemption to make his that was the de Cristo and what kind of condition is the world in yeah it's broken it's Darkness it's full of it's full of plagues it's full of murder it's full of Assassins it's full of men making other men and women they're slaves does that sound like America today does that sound like the world a world full of slaves when did you think such a modern times the most modern computer technology one of the biggest one of the biggest talking points in the news today human race on the increase all over the world women slaves children slaves God is here through Jesus Christ for All My Children here it is condos because he's the same yesterday today and forever all things were made by him foreign [Music] in him was life what do you mean and the life was the light and light lus evida completely one in the same and the light in China Square la Luz in darkness and the Darkness the darkness doesn't understand why in marriage light is life what kind of life God's life lose but they didn't go on to be partakers the first coming of Christ and the first thing he said what he said in Genesis to open our eyes and men who were faithful followers of the Jewish religions never miss the day in synagogue we're good friends with with the priests but when the light struck their hearts and the life changed their lives you know they changed their religion you know they changed the church you know everything they were doing was being changed it was the mystery of who are the first coming of Christ was a tremendous Ministry this ministry with complexes that it was a blessing God to come home was ordained to bring to Israel Israel remember what it was the five characteristics cambium how would you like to be the Prophet come on that goes to your family says God has called me he said um I'm gonna change how you think about the scripture scriptures I'm ordained to change how you treat mom I'm going to bring change so that Mom treats you better yeah so that the teenagers in the house will all be in in in in a better conditions I'm going to bring change as a matter of fact I'm going to speak about marriage and divorce here and I'm going to start talk to the highest leaders in the countries and he went up to Heritage who was called King of the Jews a great Roman Governor um it's not right for you to have your brother's wife he still lives and God says that this woman is his wife and foreign [Music] but not his wife who was a total unbeliever and she asked for the head of John yeah John gave his life who would desire that kind of ministry or we'd almost have to be crazy it wouldn't be easy but it would be John's Ministry there's things that God has called you yeah that haven't been easy but you know why God has let you go through it God wants you and I yes things have been practicing things I've been saying tomorrow I'll do it use this that thing you've been struggling with tonight this complex troubled me so much [Music] at the feet of Jesus a pattern of seven trumpets all a pattern of things to come and laying between the lines and if you can't see the oil so I say Lord Open the Eyes in Saint John 1. it was again A New Beginning the second Adam is to a darkened world and he would do it he would do it through a seventh fall plan called The Seven Seals it was just seven parts heal your body um if you get to study them it's the greatest love story is gifted value and God is the lover of your soul and you're the one that he wants to draw you closer with Islam or you want to draw someone closer who said Amazing Grace they were speaking of things we weren't born right the first time but God was going to have a family God was going to have sons and daughters that would be worthy of a god to take that is being cast forward to our days cannot see how God is Santa no no no no no no it's one guy yes many gods muchos is a pagan belief Israel the Lord thy God yes John said I saw one Central masuno but God changing foreign he's the same way you see the mind of God how is unchanging in all his ways oh once you see it becomes a newborn a book of life a book of life Revelations apocalypsies Revelations chapter one excuse me Revelations Revelations chapter 5 as we Minister on it many times because it's another it's a vision and between the lines is some great incredible truths and details what God did for us Revelations of one sitting on a throne that's a king and it speaks of a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice and it speaks of a kind of one who's called The Lion of the tribe of Judas and it speaks of a lamb that had been slain and you see all these different characters but as you know by now all these different characters back in Genesis that's the same God who sat on the throne and John in his right hand saw him there was a book and it was a book that was written within yeah a plan to take Adam like it would have foreign [Music] and he's got that purpose here tonight because he wanted to get closer it's God on the throne no one could approach so God said I'll change foreign is but it wasn't close enough to save you um cuerto he creates a Jesus Maria [Music] that's it is history would call him Jesus foreign is your career yeah and yeah yeah when I see the healing campaigns that Jesus had last uh groups of five thousands yes for everyone to touch him so God changed forms again he wanted to change forms and foreign because is the savior of the whole world you know that there is no book sorry can I leave United the Lion's Book of Life there's only a book called the Lamb's books because hello the Lamb's Book of Life God walked out of the garden to go to the Cross to be the same del Mundo foreign for everyone who could believe Jesus Jesus Christ he went to the cross shed his blood he died for one purpose take away the curse it's upon each and every one of us because we're born in Portland we come into this world I can almost remember the first lie I ever said my mom says who broke that lamp s that was Ruth my sister okay thank you okay no problem that's what I'm here foreign because I've been because God has been descended in Revelations John is telling us what he's saying and I be held and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts in the midst of the elders to the lamb as it had been slain this is a vision representative he knew Jesus of Nazareth very well he leaned his head is so when he's seen this here he didn't say I seen Jesus because you realize when he's seen this Vision this is about 40 or 50 years later after Christ's death burial and resurrection [Music] and that most of what John is seeing in Revelations already history foreign [Music] [Music] from all Darkness which are the seven spirits of God sent forth unto all the Earth he came and took the book out of the right hand of him remember Revelations it said that the line of the tribe of Jesus foreign so what is this now the lamb has taken the book see Revelations and Revelations as a matter of facto it's history it's historia we've already seen yes for most of us someone was weren't even born yet interest Revelations 5 and 5. the lamb being slain El Cordero in verse 6. that's the end of Jesus ministry on the cross from Revelations three and a half years who can read the Bible the way we read it today but God sent us his words now he came and took the book first the lion of Christ is because Jesus Christ foreign kindred people Revelations for the Redemption this is worship service for our foreign God change forms he went from the throne to the cross to the Grave is that all he did he rise again the third day where do you go I asked Josh I thought he would tell me but he just repeated what I said I get it that's his job where did he go turn with me to Revelations from chapter one Revelations one and we'll go to we'll start at verse 12. we'll pick up the other verses on our next service in closing tonight John is in this Vision it's Revelations but I want you to understand that Revelations and everything that happened in Revelations happened before Revelations see how God most of the time they're talking about things that happened after what he said in chapter one symbolo so where did Jesus go after Jesus because remember that body was glorified and when he went to Thomas Thomas saw Jesus Jesus he didn't have all the stripes on his back burial and Resurrection the body was glorified the only smart as Thomas had said that Jesus unless I can touch the scars and when Jesus Jesus I can see that but maybe you're just a twin you already knew what John was thinking yes John look at my hands is Thomas that's the only marks that were left so this bloody land here is a symbol it still lays Before the Throne of God interceding for you and I know but where's the man Jesus Where's God what form did he change he's now the great Holy Spirit now he's descended to a foreign he could touch everyone and everyone can catch him tonight God has taken a foreign what he says and in the midst of the seven candidates like Jesus El Ravi a friend mi amigo it had to be him it looked like him because he said and he was clothed with a garment to the footage no reason John said the reason Johnson there was there was one like unto the sun because he'd never seen him dress this way before he'd never seen him all with white hair like wolves never seen his eye is like a flame of fire he'd never seen his feet like until fine brass that burned in a furnace but the voice this is the form that he changed it's a symbol ism Jesus wants you Jesus when he preached on Perfection therefore okay because if God is asking him you know what he's prepared the way El Camino the truth remember that and the lies hmm what a book in this Bible as a prophet folders since almighty God has revealed these Seven Seals this book is because suvida it changes no surrender no Serene no change but surrender there are reindeers and he'll bring change yes until finally that have been allowing God to change um whatever and the price he paid and because he rose again he didn't fall and fail like the first and he wants to offer to you in suvida to be like Jesus Heavenly Father Celestial we thank you gracias from Earth's humble Shores and we ask one
