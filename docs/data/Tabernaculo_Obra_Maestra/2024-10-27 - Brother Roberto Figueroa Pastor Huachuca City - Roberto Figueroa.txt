brother praise the Lord presence already I just want to read a scripture and um if you want to turn to it because that way we can save some time that we don't have to read it in Spanish or say it in Spanish but it's going to be in the book of Hebrews chapter 10 and uh it's starting at verse 12 and I believe this will encourage you and uh I just believe that the word of God is everything we have need of so it' be uh Hebrews 10 verse 12 and we're going to read a few a few uh verses but I think it's to uh to help us so it says uh verse 12 but this this man after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever sat down on the right hand right hand of God verse 13 from henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his footstone for by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are Sanctified verse 15 whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us for after that he had said before this is the Covenant that I will make with them that after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more yeah now where remission of these is there is no more offering for sin verse 19 having therefore Brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus and we'll go skip down to 22 and 23 and it says let us draw near with a true heart and full Assurance of Faith having our hearts sprinkle from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water us profession of without did his mic just quit can he by his word this is what we're reading this is what we read is his word and that's what we're singing about this morning his word I have no fear in Me by his word death cannot swallow Me by his word I have Prosperity by his word sickness can't dwell in me and by his

night uh it surely blessed my heart and and I know it touched each and every one of you and some way because that's the way God's word it works um a minister gets up anointed of God to share the gospel and people come with burdens in their hearts and perhaps you won't catch everything that was said maybe you won't be able to follow everything that the man of God was saying but everything that he said there was something in it for each and every one of you and if and if you're sincere and and you wait on God God has something for you for am [Music] God bless you all this morning you may be seated for a few moments I I wanted to give a testimony this morning and I I labeled it the figeroa testimony and it's uh healings that took place in our family through through the ministry of brother brother Branham and this testimony begins back in the end of World War I my father went to war against the Germans and in Europe and an uncle of mine a brother of my dad's his name was Julio J and he went to war against the Japanese uh in the in the uh in the uh Pacific pacif and when they came back from the war this was 1945 uh my Uncle Julio came back very very sick uh mentally for all the things he had seen in war you know the movies they they they paint it up make it look nice but War is ugly you can when you're standing there and and someone next to you is blown to pieces you pick them up and put them in a bag covered in blood it's not a pretty thing and that war in the Pacific was an awful awful War and about the time that he came back from war my dad was was searching for God uh he was a Catholic but he KN he knew there was more and he began to look and he was living with his mother at that time my grandmother and and they began to have a uh Bible studies with the Jehovah's Witnesses and also there was uh some uh Apostolic ministers that were also giving them Bible studies and they saw there were two different gospels and and it was my dad and another brother of his my uncle Fred Fred Fred Figo he's still I think you might know brother Fred and uh so they were they were having these Bible studies there in the home and the apostolic one of the apostolic Brothers uh came to them one day and he says we know we're going to Phoenix Phoenix this was about 1948 47 48 and he said there's a brother who's coming to Phoenix he's got a gift of healing and would you like to go with us and they said yeah so they went to Phoenix and my dad told me he said I've never seen such a thing and he says there were people laying in CS dying of cancer raised up the blind would see the deaf would hear it was back in the day when not a single person went went through the platform without being healed they saw people come off of wheelchairs and Miracle after Miracle when they came back from Phoenix saido they were completely changed they knew God was alive brother Brandon brought a a historical God many churches and denominations had him painted on the wall he took this word and made it live and so they said goodbye to the Jehovah's Witnesses and they began to attend the apostolic church and uh and about that time my father was married and so they uh began to uh build a home and so in 1953 I was born my father at that time was working at the mines of s Manuel and he would work uh morning shifts day shifts night shifts they called a swing shift and that grandmother of mine my dad's mother they were they came to Phoenix because brother bam was going to be be preaching again and I was it was probably about 1955 sometime I was about two years old I was born very sick I had problems with my intestines and I couldn't have a normal bowel movement because of that and so they had to take me to the clinics and wash me out and doctors wanted to operate on me back in 1955 and back in 55 it it probably wouldn't have been very good and so uh they they took me and my mother was born in Mexico and she didn't know English she understood it but she didn't speak it and I don't know what servant brother brand preached we don't know but at the end of the service he began to pray for the sick and my mother understood he said put your hand upon anyone is near you that sick I'm going to pray over the audience and U my mother put her hand over my stomach as brother BR prayed and he prayed and the next day I was completely healed never had to go back to a doctor ever again my mother was in the backyard those old washing machines with the rollers they they would they would uh rinse out the clothes and she was washing clothes in the backyard and we lived outside in the outskirts of the city in the desert and there were snakes obviously and my my older brother he was about about about seven or eight uh came running to my mom he said come see Bobby they call me Bobby and she got scared she comes running and there was a faucet that was sticking out of the ground and I and I had a hold of that faucet and that was a complete mess completely healed and that was the first miracle took place in our life through brother br's Ministry in 1957 my parents went to Phoenix again phoen and there was a place called Madison Square Garden Madison Square Gardens it had been a a a a a place for for fighting and uh and brother Bram said that this place had balconies and I was giving this testimony inalis one day and brother Billy Paul was present afterwards we went to eat somewhere and brother Billy Paul told me that brother BR had told him that was the hardest place for him to preach it took three days to get all the evil spirits out of that building he said he said he could see them hanging like bats hanging from the balcony and uh and so that was the place that they that they went and there were three things that were going on in the family at that time my mother had a a growth on her left breast and she it was very painful and my dad working in the minds H he used to use use those rubber boots all the way up to the knees because water and it caused a skin disease and he would scratch in in in his sleep and he would end up with scabs and bleeding and my oldest brother my older brother his name was Julio like my uncle uh he was about eight nine years old every night he would get up and his sleep and they had to be watching him every night because he might go outside he would turn on the stoves and things and we lived in a small house it was a living room and it was a kitchen and between the kitchen and and and and there was a doorway to a bedroom and my brother would lay out a c a folding C and right there in the doorway so my parents could be watching him during the night so so they went to to Madison Square Garden that night Madison Square Garden and brother bran preached the message what think he of Christ and I've heard this many times and I and I got it memorized and and brother Ram is as they playing only believe in the organ they they they come to the platform and he first thing he says a lady uh I thought she was deaf but she can't speak English and you are her husband and you come to speak for her he says speak to her as I speak he said you're coming here asking prayer for yourself for a growth on your left breast if that is true raise up your hand and she raised up her hand before thousands of giving testimony that was the truth and and and then he said and you're asking prayer for your husband my dad standing there didn't know she was praying for him and this total stranger it tells him you're you're praying for your husband because he's got a skin disease and then he about a moment goes by and when oh I forgot to say that when they when they began to call out their number my brother was laying asleep at their feet way in the back and and they were trying to wake him up and when he was asleep they couldn't wake him up and finally my dad stood up he said let's leave him here God knows our need so they went and then brother Bram says and you have a son that gets up in his sleep with his eyes open my mother understood that there's 1100 tapes there's not a scream like the scream that she screams a wailing scream and even even in the computer it says the editor says the lady screams and when she screams You Hear the People pring God and and brother Bram says he says receive it in the name of the Lord Jesus as my father passed before them as they going to the other side my dad said brother BR patted him on the on the shoulder and he said just believe everything's going to be all right they came home instantly healed my dad was instantly healed and they came home telling all the apostolic people the testimony they were so happy but you know Satan all always try to come and try you he'll try to steal your faith my my brother had not been prayed for and I and I believe he had an evil spirit in him and it had to had to be had to be cast out but brother Bram told my dad everything's going to be all right and so they came home and the next night my dad was asleep he was a light sleeper and he hurt a noise and he immediately woke up like 2:00 in the morning and he was wide awake you know how sometimes you wake up you're going like this completely away and he lay there for a moment maybe a Prowler or someone was outside and he waited nothing happened so he went to put his feet on the floor and as he was putting his feet on the floor my brother is is right there in that c and he's getting up he's getting up and his sleep again my dad said he he told me this he says I didn't even I didn't even think of what I was going to say but I pointed my finger and I said Satan I rebuke you in the name of Jesus my brother stopped in midair fell back on that bed never got up again God took care of it care he takes care of all the details we don't have to worry about whether God's going to do this God's going to do that he takes care of the details hallelujah hallelujah and now we fast forward from 57 to 1965 brother 1965 brother green had moved from bont Texas in November of 1965 started the Tucson Tabernacle and and my and brother brother Angel had already talked to my dad about the about the sermons that's brother Daniel's father and my dad was already hearing the sermons and we heard we heard a rumor there was a brother coming to start a church the very first service we were there and we were there in other services as well Bram was still there remember this was in November 65 Bram went to the L went to be with the Lord in December of the 24th of SE December the following month dur during that time one of those times brother bam was was coming down the aisle at the end of one of the services and we had the short benches over on the side next to the windows my sister was here I was 12 years old I standing here and my mother and then my dad against wall and brother started just greeting everybody as he as he came when he came to our bench he greeted my my my my sister he shook my hand I didn't know a lot about prophets I was just 12 years old but I heard a lot of things about this man and and I remember looking into his eyes when he shook my hand these deep set eyes and I thought he just looked right into my soul I I thought he saw every sin I ever committed I feared him but it was a respect I remember he reached over and he shook my mother's hand and my dad was so excited he's clear over he's reaching shook his and one of those Services it was a it was a Sunday morning that grandmother the one that my dad's mother she was a Believer and and she was dying time she her heart was giving out the doctors had given her up she had another son he was not a figuro but a DTE and he never married Ju and and he uh he took care of his mom and brother green told the church let brother brandham come and don't be bothering him for interviews I want him to feel comfortable here in the church so my dad obeyed the pastor he didn't bother brother brown but I I remember that Sunday morning service was over it was the old synagogue on Stone Avenue and on Stone Avenue Stone and they're in Tucson and uh we were all standing in front of the church after the service and there were two entres in the church there were seven steps and seven steps to The Landing and brother Bram we knew always came out this side so everybody was kind of talking but they were looking and brother Brandon stepped out of the church he had his Bible under his under his arm and he had a hat when he stepped when he stepped out of the church he put his head on he was on the landing and he was about to come down the steps when my uncle John ran up the steps to meet to speak to brother brandham and I remember thinking oh oh brother green is going to get mad because he's not supposed to be bothering brother but I knew he was going to ask prayer for my grandmother and I was too far away to hear but I could see him moving his hands as he spoke to brother BR I seen brother Bram take off his hat his his Bible under his arm he put his head over his heart and they both bowed their heads and he said a little prayer God extended her life 12 more years she went to be with the Lord in 1977 when these things that I saw I never thought that I'd be telling people and giving this testimony it was it was in my heart all this time when my uncle John died the pastor that he was that was over him didn't want to preach his funeral something that he was not paying his ties or whatever so we call Brother green brother green would you pre preach his funeral brother green said sure I will and his burial too so he did that on a Saturday I was already we had already we we were already with brother green it was 19 uh uh around 19 I would say 89 or 90 when this happened already back we were already back with brother green and brother green on Sunday morning got up in the pool pit and he gave that testimony that I had in my heart all that time he said brother brother John run up the steps to talk to brother Bram and how God healed his mother and to hear Brother green say that from the pull pit it really blessed me I told my mother that wherever I would preach I'm going to give this testimony in your honor she's already gone to be with the Lord but the testimony lives I realized we can't live there on anymore testimonies are good to give it testifies of God's word being true but we can't live there anymore I I need a move of God in my life today we need the god of today we need the I Am the I am to come on the scene brother BR says our experiences from yester year they got wiggle worms in them we need a fresh experience of God we need to find that somehow church with an expectation in our heart hungering for God oh God I need a I need a touch from you this Lord I need I need the your hand to be placed upon my life how we need the presence of God in our lives and I give this testimony this morning in honor of my mother who who who was a good mother and she took care of us a real Christian a real child of God Amen I thank God for this ability to have this this to tell something I've given this everywhere from Brazil austral all over the United States all through Mexico INX wherever God has sent me I've

is a flower of grass the grass withth and the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever can you say Amen this morning and th and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you I normally use this scripture in funerals showing how that our life is fleeting it's here today and gone tomorrow our youth is here [Music] today and and and then our youth is gone is gone in job Chapter 14 verse one 14 of job verse one man that is born of a woman is a few days and full of trouble amen amen he cometh forth like a flower and is cut down he fleeth also as a shadow

this morning and we invite you oh God Have Your Way amongst us this morning we pray amen and we ask it in Jesus name and the church said amen you may be seated you know we are born when we are born again we receive a new existence from a new life that comes from a seed there is life in the seed as I said last night there's nothing wrong with the seed it's the ground that's got to be prepared so that seed can take hold and bring fruit amen amen it's not a hybrid seed it's a seed that is pure it must be the pure unadulterated word of God amen amen that's exactly what the word is as it says being born again not of corruptible seed this is a corruptible seed right here this is a corruption Paul said this corruption must take on incorruption this Mortal must put on immortality amen amen there's got to be a change there's got to be a change in here that will bring a change out here and this Mortal will become immortal in 2 Corinthians 3 verse 2 speaking about this word that's unadulterated in second Corinthians 3:2 it says ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men you are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men what does that mean let me clarify this and in the message we will see Jesus brother says he say the reason Christians I think it's so real tonight that we should live the right kind of life because you see there's many people won't take the time to read the Bible but they'll read you think of it they don't read the Bible but they're looking at you he says they'll read you see you are a written Epistle of God a real real true born again Christian is the word expressed again because your written Epistles of God read of all men what type of person should we be if we know that our lives is an open Living Bible to the unbeliever to express God in our own life how beautiful when a child of God is surrendered to to God and they're living their life they're living this word I want to encourage you this morning that you're just not anybody but you've been called to become the very word of God all we can look back and say praise God Jesus was the word all on Jesus some people put it all on brother Brandon but but brother Bron said we're gonna have th thus say the Lord we are that word today there's a song that says we are the word made flesh today that is what the scripture say hallelujah hallelujah amen amen glory to God where are we the word of God we're being manifested we're expressing the thoughts of God in our lives Day by dayu living this word in our failures when we're not able to we can't take another step we're still the word made flesh today when he called you he knew all your inadequacies when he called you he knew all the weaknesses you but he knew you he said that's my child that child is going to express me I'm going to express myself my children hallelujah hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever to God say what type of person should we be in the unveiling of God in 64 brother BR says as it is written see written you are written Epistles he says the Bible said now what is an epistle it's a written word you are the written in other words you you you'll read it like this you it said you are written Epistles or you are the word how many are the word this morning amen by faith Hallelujah glory to God that's why I said even with our failures he called us with what we are because he knew he could take a vessel and express himself through that vessel no matter how imp perfect how imperfect she was oh my what a miracle it's Christ in me oh oh what a miracle is Christ in me hallelujah hallelujah he says you are the word that has been written made manifest me the word blessed be his name nothing can be added to it you can't say I'm a written epistle and living some other kind of something about what this has already wrote brother BR pass a Bible when he does that he passs the Bible nothing because nothing can be added taken away hallelujah hallelujah glory to God Amen we talked about yes last night about second Corinthians and there in second Corinthians 10 it says there in verse 5 it says we are casting down imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God this is the knowledge of God right this is the word of God I'm bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ my my my when we to live this word as we should I believe we could we living even now when we fail we can come to God and say Lord forgive me and brother said just as if You' never done itation who can lay a charge of God's elect your failures you look at what what you are but you can't you got to stop looking at this circumstance for I hear and you got to start looking to what the word says about you amen hallelujah hallelujah that you will bring every every thought into captivity amen be Obedience of Christ every thought hallelujah hallelujah in the message confirmation of the commission he said that's what God's word says see heavens and earth will pass away but my word shall not pass away he said this The Living Word spoken by a living God hallelujah hallelujah must be in a living [Music] being this word needs to manifest itself if we to it this word will not manifest God is called a people God has called children they're going to live that wordu a Living Word spoken by a living God must be in a living being it's got to manifest itself Hallelujah hallelujah how can a man or a woman that claims that they have the baptism of Holy Spirit deny what God has said in his word because it's a it's a very holy spirit that wrote the word it is a very Holy Spirit that's speaking through the person right got to be amen amen that's why we believe this message brought To Us by Brother William brandham it is the word of God it is a revealing or the opening up of the Bible and what we call the spoken word it came to bring light upon this Bible you know that the without the Bible the message brother Bram has would have no Foundation it has to lay upon this word ration come back to the word hallelujah hallelujah not so manmade Theory some manade do IDE ored it's got to come back to the word brother say Genesis to Revelations it's got to make make this make this word live glory to God hallelujah this is this is what we call the spoken word and it came to bring light to this word right here let me read you something here from the poers god power of God to transform 65 paragraph 77 now it's hard to say this it's very hard because speaking to people who feel the same way I do and the way I've been for years but since the opening of those Seven Seals of them Angels just behind the mountain Yonder this has become a new book he didn't pick up a spoken word book friends because they didn't exist then he didn't pick up anything he he picked up his Bible since seven seal the opening of the word s the revealing of the words this book Hallelujah has become a new book glory to God it's the things has been hid is being revealed as God promised in Revelations 10 hallelujah hallelujah he would do it and we are the privileged people that God has chosen hallelujah hallelujah oh he chose me brother I wasn't looking for him but he came looking for me he came looking for you hallelujah hallelujah we are a privileged people brother [Music] say that God has chosen of the earth why did he choose us because he knew that this word was going to live in us that we were going to be the Living Word people manif the word of God in this hallelujah hallelujah am that we might see and understand these things which is not some mythical fleshly Mind of a person trying to make it up it's a word of God made manifest where brother BR sure was manifested in him but that was not the purpose that there would be a people that would hear the Cry of the eagle amen something was stir by the inside Hallelujah when the Bible begins to say things start saying he's talking about me that word is talking about me I'm stepping into that by faith that I am a child of God there is a Pur for me in this life in this world to manifest the word of God in this hour hallelujah hallelujah amen it's the word of God made manifest and proven that it's right proven not by science but by God that's right God as I have said before in the message God doesn't need anyone to interpret his word hallelujah hallelujah he is his own interpreter he says it'll happen and it happens he confirms it and that interprets it right there when Christ comes you know he's coming for his word let me tell you something he's not coming for a spoken word book he's not coming for a tape he's not even coming for this Bible he's sitting here the Bible says that every everything in this world is going to burn but he's coming for his word hallelujah I said he's coming for his word where is his word where is the word of God is living in his bride we've been set upon this Earth for a purpose manifest every bride failed but this bride this this day will not fail she will manifest his word hallelujah hallelujah glory to God God doesn't need anyone he to interpret his word that's where we get into trouble when they start making up things start putting out things that are lies and then their life becomes a lie I was telling the brother last night I read somewhere where there was a pastor he was not a message pastor but but he he started preaching in his home to about 10 people and it began to grow and in 10 years he ended up with a Congregation of over 8,000 people and everybody was happy it seemed like everything was going really well so one day he stood behind the pulpit and he said today this morning I resign as pastor of this church nobody expected it and they asked him Pastor why why you haven't done anything why are you why were you doing he says let me tell you something I got so busy with a with the with the with the people and the church and the business did I forgot about my he says and he says I'm running an empty I've been running un empty for a long time and I can't do this anymore you see what happens when we we begin to leave the word of God spirit of God will step away oh we can still walk into a church with a Bible under our hand but inside how are we hallelujah hallelujah is there a cry inside of us for more of God Is there is there a desire to serve him is there a desire there when God comes into your life one true evidence of the Holy Ghost brother BR said your desire changes your tastes become different the taste you had in the world is gone and you desire begins to rise inside of you you want to know more of him begin to read the word of God because you begin to Hunger for More of him what happens with many pastors they get so busy and they're doing good things but we have to feed ourselves too brother Daniel many times where we're studying for the people this is going to be good for this family brother needs to hear this excited about the us we all need to be fed we all need to to to to eat this word like John when he told him eat the book John and John is the Tope of the Bride is that right he ate the book Hallelujah we need to take the book and eat it till it becomes part of us we become part of it Hallelujah to where we are inseparable we cannot be separated from the word of God when they see you they see the word of God when they see you they see God being manifested amen he's not coming for a spoken word book he's not coming for a Bible he's coming for the word that's inside of us we are the word we are the manifestation of the word he's coming for those that are born again by The Incorruptible word of God Amen everything in this earth going to burn friends hallelujah hallelujah even the Bible said that that we will walk upon the ashes of the wicked even Satan will be turned to ashes Hallelujah in second Peter 3:10 just to give you a scripture on that glory to God 310 but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night in the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise and the elements shall melt with fervent Heat and the Earth also and the works that are therein shall be burned up there's going to be nothing left God's going to brother BR says God's going to renovate this Earth he's gonna burn every Thistle and every Thorn every sin that was ever committed every filth is ever done world is going to be Sanctified by the fire of God and we we are just like the world God wants to sanctify us Let the Fire of the Holy Spirit begin to move in our hearts in our lives in our daily living can we become Sanctified cleansed by the blood of the Lamb then that word can come and live then the Holy Spirit could come and abide plain vessel living for God 1 Corinthians 3:9 to1 for we are laborers together with God God's husbandry you are God's Building according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another build is there on but let every man take heed how he builth thereupon for other Foundation can no man lay that is laid Jesus Christ brother Brandon said when he went beyond the time they told him that Paul was going to be judged right that he every every Church AG messenger would be judged you remember what brother BR said he said well I preach what Paul preach hallelujah hallelujah I preached what Paul PR I never divied he said I never de one way or the other preached that amen for no other Foundation can no man lay but what has already been laid Hallelujah glory to God we know this word that we receiv received in this end time on the foundation of the word of God he he placed it right there it will not sink it will not fail it will not fall back he said my words shall never turn to be voided but it shall prosper in the thing which iory to God how important it is we stay that word in Ephesians church church age brother Daniel we been talking about this last night there paragraph 83-1 he says thou has tried them to say they are Apostles and are not and has found them Liars anybody that Dev from the word of God the Bible says they're a liar they're they're lying they're bringing untruths he said thou has found them Liars my that is a blunt statement thou has tried them who call themselves Apostles they call themselves apost isn't that presumptuous what right has a man to try those who call themselves Apostles you would say who am I to to question the apostles we're not talking about the Apostles of the Bible we talking about self-made apostles he says how do they try them he asks the question how do you try them he says oh I love this here it is in Galatians 18 but though we are an angel from heaven though we are an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you that which we have already preached unto you let him be a cursed it was the apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change Daniel it does change it remains ever the same the same yesterday today and forever God doesn't do one thing and change it tomorrow wouldn't be God but once he does something he does it right amen and we comes to the same uh uh circumstances again he'll do the same thing again oh my it does not change not even a d daughter or dash of it Paul knew it was God who has spoken to through him so he said even if I come and try if I come and try to give a second Revelation try to make one little chain in what I gave originally I gave originally let me be a cursed you see Paul knew that first revelation was correct I like that Paul knew and we as children of God this morning it was 100% correct hallelujah hallelujah amen amen God can't give a first revelation and then a second Revelation if he did he would be changing his mind he could give a revelation he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed to the woman then later designated that seed had to come through Abraham the same seed change that just offered more information amen am and then later said it would come by the same Bloodlines in David it but it was the same revelation it never changed that Revelation cannot change it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand brother BR says but God's word can't change the seed came exactly as revealed remember the seed there's nothing wrong with the seed perfect every time and see what those false prophets were doing they came with their own word amen how many have done it in our day all kinds of Revelation two Souls seven Thunders running here no more pastors no preachers and just tape only they see what those false apostles were doing they came with their own words those Ephesians knew that word as Paul had taught it oh my they knew the word they were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands praise be to God they looked those false Apostles in the eye and said you're not saying what Paul said hallelujah hallelujah amen we need courageous men to stand today be courageous and say you're not saying what Paul said you're not saying what William BR said you're not saying what the seventh angel said oh my look up in the eye glory to God we got the word why should we be ashamed why should we fall back why should we hide ourselves we we're like that black man a slave he knew who he was walking around with his chest up he didn't have to whip him he knew who he was that back there somewhere in Africa he was a son of a king Hallelujah this we know who we are we know who shows us stand upon the rock hallelujah nothing can move a child of God cause a child of God to quit a child of God doesn't quit he never quits he moves on for Glory to God Amen Hallelujah Hallelujah this morning brother I didn't think I was going to have any strength for anything just pray for me afterwards be like a dish rag that's me afterwards blessed be his but his word excites me it makes it makes me become emotional it moves my heart does it move your heart does it cause you to say praise God he's talking about me that little boy came down from the mountains one day with his to VIs his grandma I think it was never seen a mirror before and he saw this full length mirror and he saw a little boy standing there so he hit behind the wall and he peeed around and little boy peeking back at him watching the whole thing

if he is the real one sent from God or not how many how many can say I know hallelujah hallelujah brother green gave a testimony one day his father didn't yet understand who brother Bram was and they listen to a tape and brother BR would talking the second person like he is right here but he's talking about about himself look at me here I am Elijah you had to catch the Revelation and brother brandom's talking and he's describing this seventh angel messenger brother green is looking at his dad his dad starts getting a little excited he CAU the Revelation that moment he reached over he turned out the all real to real tape he turned it off he said Perry he's Perry Perry he's talking about himself he's talking about himself catch the Revelation amen amen Open Your Eyes Open My Eyes Lord I Want to See Jesus to reach out and touch him hallelujah amen glory to to God he says yes you will if you if he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iot in the last age when there will be many false prophets appearing watch and see how they keep telling you that you don't believe in them that if you don't believe in them what they say you will be lost but when the last day Prophet comes on the scene if he is truly that Prophet you'll be crying out Hallelujah get back to the word or you're lost come back to the word be the partakers of our sins Hallelujah he won't build on our private Revelation or interpretation but on the word amen amen and amen amen amen hallelujah hallelujah first John 4 closing this morning pray for me thank you Lord hereby know ye the spirit of God hereby you know the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of the Antichrist whereof ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world ye are of God little children and you have overc come them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world close with this thought we can always look back and say well Jesus Christ prais God that he was the word made flesh we can take the scripture in the beginning with the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word became flesh we can say praise God the word became flesh what about today what about you and I can you believe this morning and you take a step of faith and say praise God the word has become flesh again it's living in me that word is in me a living God with a spoken Living Word in a living being and he says if you don't believe that that is Antichrist we must believe that Christ the word is becoming flesh again praise be to God I'm going to finish with this quote this morning spoken word is the Original Seed so Believers of the word and spirit must be one you get it Believers the word and the spirit are absolutely one you don't do your own thinking did you hear that bringing every thought to The Obedience of Christ you don't do your own thinking you don't use your own mind that wonderful the mind was in Christ is in you the mind is in Christ and you'll take the word just like he did like Jesus yes you must believe just like he believed you take the word when you believe he says he says because he because he was the word in the mind of Christ you you are the word can't be any planer than that you are God's Living Word can you say Amen this morning representatives of him representes here on Earth that's right correct continuing the work amen what is Jesus Christ continuing the work where right here he's in me he's in you Christ in me the hope of glory the church should be on that way when so the Bible is manifested again like in the early days of the disciples just like the disciple the Bible is living living again where is it living brother Robert where is the word where is the word living where is the word hallelujah me hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah I I can't stop I got to keep going he says the word takes flesh there you are the word takes flesh there you are God is going to have a church it's going to be born of the word of God because it is a Living Word of God do you see it hallelujah hallelujah glory to God glor indictment 63 there it is the sign of the time what did it what did it class him where did CL where did it class him a fanatic a crazy man yeah they found fault with a man who was the word don't think they're gonna find fault with you my I he was the word St John first chapter proves it in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us he was the Living Word of God because he was expressing God through himself so what are we when we become the Living Word of God expressing the same thing Jesus Christ did he was so completely surrendered to the word of God till he and the Word was the same that's exactly what the church TR to be today that the word of God is the same Christ is the the mystery of God [Music] revealed think by the living presence of the living Christ by The Living Word oh living Christ Living presence Living Word watch by his own personal personal Vindication proves his church not members he never done it in the days of Moses he never done in the days of anybody else the end of the world when it come to the place where it was the destruction the days of lot it wasn't membership me it was personal Vindication God in flesh see personal Vindication amen remember think of it that people born of his spirit in a day like this oh my in this great denominational age that we live and the Living God takes his living word and vindicates it personally this life that's in the word The Germ that's in the seed and the word is a seed that sorrow went forth to sow and the life is Christ in the world personally in you can you say amen hallelujah hallelujah vindicating something to you that you cannot do proving himself that it's not you it's by him the burden is on him all I got to do is surrender here am I Lord here am I Lord where where is the house that you built unto me and where is the place of my rest even to this man will I look or we can stand this morning say Lord where's a where is a where is a house that I can live in Here I Am Lord here I am come to me Lord me Lord word upon me let your word be manifested to this world of this last day hallelujah hallelujah GL there's so much more find that once one more quote I'm trying to find per Church age notice the harmony of the father and the son and this I'll be finishing with this Jesus never did anything until it was first showed him by the father 5 John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he shows her his word of life she receives it she never doubts it Hallelujah therefore nothing can harm her not even death for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up again this is what I want to focus in here is the secret of this the word is in the bride as it was in Mary be it done unto me Lord as I will she surrendered herself she surrendered her body and the word came and formed in her and brother Brandon says the word is in the bride as it was in Mary the bride has a mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done the word she knows what he wants done with the word she perform the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that is planted in water it comes to full Harvest serving his purpose if you could bring this with what I spoke last night of breaking up the fellow ground get this ground ready for the receiving of that word the word in the spirit brother we become one with word Spirit blessed be his name father this morning Lord as we finish this this morning take all these broken words Lord father and deposit it in every heart to receive this Lord the importance of what our mission is here upon the Earth today you didn't call us to be another church Lord you didn't call us just to be another member to be a Pew warmer oh Lord you called us father because there's a word that you want us to manifest the burden is upon you it's upon you Lord you will do this all you're looking for is a house that will say here am I here am I Lord take me Lord nobody else will come if if the preacher don't come Lord if the Deacon doesn't come Lord let here am I Lord take this vessel take this vessel un worthy as it is Lord fill it with your word father

of Heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven then charged his disciples that they should tell no man that he was Jesus the Christ why why would he tell you don't tell no man that I'm Jesus the Christ because he just told you it's going to take a revelation for them to get it and if you won't receive Revelation you'll never get it but if you can receive Revelation this morning open this book The Bible to you and this book to you will also become a new book Prophet said I can't be the same man
