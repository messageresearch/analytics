[40:45] Earth so we're thankful for
[40:48] that uh we've been speaking on the on a
[40:52] subject we started last
[40:56] Sunday what does Jesus really look
[41:01] like so we'd like to
[41:05] continue and we want to begin reading in
[41:09] in Ephesians
[41:16] 4:11 the Apostle
[41:19] Paul speaking to the Ephesian
[41:24] Church brother brandham said the
[41:26] Ephesian church was was a was a very
[41:28] dedicated
[41:33] church thean
[41:35] church was a very dedicated
[41:39] Church they were a spiritual
[41:42] church they had
[41:45] Revelation so that that's why Paul spoke
[41:48] to them the way he did in this
[41:53] epist and verse 11
[41:55] says and he gave some
[41:58] Apostles and some
[42:00] prophets and some evangelists and some
[42:04] pastors and
[42:12] teachers let's pray Heavenly Father we
[42:16] thank you once again this
[42:18] even we pray that something will be
[42:22] said for each and everyone that's
[42:26] here
[42:28] for not everyone is is needing the same
[42:33] thing but each and every one of us needs
[42:36] something from you
[42:38] tonight so you alone the great discerner
[42:41] of our
[42:43] hearts you can meet that need in our
[42:49] lives you can touch us so we won't go
[42:52] out the way we came
[42:55] in we'll go out
[42:58] better we we'll we'll go out
[43:01] Victorious we'll go out with more
[43:06] courage we'll go out with Greater
[43:11] Hope we'll go out with our faith being
[43:17] increased we thank you now in Jesus name
[43:22] amen amen you may be
[43:26] seated
[43:27] what does Jesus really look
[43:32] like we we began on
[43:36] Sunday Sunday was Palm
[43:41] Sunday and Palm Sunday was the day that
[43:45] Jesus rode into
[43:51] Jerusalem and and by the end of the week
[43:54] on Friday uh
[44:01] uh would would begin the the Passover
[44:06] feast and and he would be arrested on
[44:09] that
[44:12] Friday he would be he would be
[44:15] taken before Pontius
[44:19] pilot
[44:20] now even even what they had done on that
[44:26] Friday
[44:28] the the the the
[44:29] Pharisees taken him
[44:32] captive into the
[44:36] night uh and then and then they took him
[44:39] before Pontius
[44:42] pilot but by that
[44:45] Sunday by by by the end of the
[44:51] Sabbath which I believe was was for us
[44:54] would be like Sunday morning
[45:01] J Jesus was on a
[45:03] cross he had given up his
[45:07] Spirit he had ascended on
[45:11] high he had paid the
[45:13] price that I
[45:16] owed but I couldn't pay
[45:19] it he died for me that
[45:22] day he shed his
[45:24] blood and by his stripes I am healed
[45:31] and he gave me a
[45:32] promise that because he unsent because
[45:35] he ascended on
[45:38] high that I could be born
[45:41] again because the natural be
[45:45] birth that's the curse on
[45:51] Mankind and the New
[45:53] Birth the Born Again experience
[45:58] that's the supernatural
[46:01] blessing that puts you back in
[46:03] fellowship with the
[46:07] father and what begins that new birth
[46:12] experience and what begins that
[46:17] experience is what the is what John the
[46:20] Baptist spoke to the people
[46:23] of without them knowing
[46:28] John was teaching them the very first
[46:34] step to get back into fellowship with
[46:39] God and he said
[46:43] repent and be
[46:45] baptized and but he gave them no
[46:49] name it was a
[46:51] detail that would come
[46:54] later that would complete
[46:58] this this beginning this first
[47:03] step it was it was prophecy being
[47:08] fulfilled but John didn't hold all the
[47:14] details he only had a
[47:17] portion and when he gave his
[47:20] portion his ministry was
[47:23] done but Revelation wasn't over
[47:28] though though Elijah would go off the
[47:32] scene Jesus would
[47:36] remain the Holy
[47:39] Spirit and add more
[47:41] detail to the
[47:43] prophecy repent and be baptized John
[47:48] said and under a great
[47:52] anointing Jesus one
[47:54] day in a parable
[47:57] added more
[47:59] detail to this Supernatural
[48:04] experience that takes us back into the
[48:06] presence of
[48:09] God where we can talk with him daily
[48:13] then and know that he hears
[48:17] us and Jesus
[48:19] said before he ascended on
[48:23] high he gave a Great Commission to the
[48:26] church
[48:28] he said go ye into all the
[48:31] world and preach the
[48:34] gospel teaching them to be
[48:39] baptized in John's in John's
[48:42] baptism yes but more Jesus was going to
[48:47] add more
[48:49] detail to the prophecy that's how every
[48:52] Prophecy in the Bible
[48:55] is
[48:57] there was always more detail
[49:01] coming sometimes it would come a few
[49:03] months
[49:06] later sometimes it comes a few years
[49:10] later sometimes it comes hundreds of
[49:13] years
[49:15] later like Isaiah
[49:17] spoke a virgin shall
[49:20] conceive there was going to be more
[49:22] detail to
[49:24] that but it wouldn't come for another
[49:26] seven 00
[49:30] years oh are we prepared to wait on God
[49:33] by faith
[49:37] tonight knowing he'll keep his
[49:42] word appointed
[49:45] season he'll add the details that we
[49:50] need so Jesus wasn't doing away with
[49:53] what John
[49:55] said
[49:57] he was going to add more detail to
[50:00] it so so what he said in Matthew
[50:05] 28 Jesus was speaking in a
[50:09] parable and in a parable he
[50:12] said teaching
[50:14] them to be
[50:17] baptized in the name of the father and
[50:20] of the son and of the Holy
[50:23] Spirit it was a prophecy it was a
[50:28] parable and it was 100% the
[50:33] truth but in the parable was hidden the
[50:39] name or does anyone think that Jesus
[50:42] told a lie for the first
[50:47] time careful watch
[50:52] out because once a man tells One Lie
[50:59] when will you know if he won't tell it
[51:00] the next
[51:06] time unless he's been born
[51:11] again but Jesus
[51:13] said teaching them to be
[51:17] baptized in the name of the father of
[51:21] the son and of the Holy Spirit and it
[51:24] was 100% the truth
[51:29] but he spoke it in a
[51:31] parable he spoke it in
[51:36] symbols so laying in this
[51:40] prophecy so laying so in this
[51:43] prophy was yet a
[51:46] revelation a supernatural
[51:50] understanding so we needed more
[51:54] detail and three years later
[51:57] in the day of
[51:59] Pentecost another Prophet rose
[52:02] up another one rose
[52:10] up the Apostle Peter both Apostle and
[52:15] prophet and on the day of
[52:18] Pentecost God gave him the
[52:22] revelation of what John was
[52:25] doing and what Jesus had added to
[52:29] it now Peter comes before
[52:33] them and Men ask
[52:35] him Peter what shall we do to be
[52:41] saved you see Peter was preaching to the
[52:49] masses and many of those had been at the
[52:52] crucifixion of
[52:55] Jesus
[52:57] some of them that were there had shouted
[52:59] crucify him at pilate's
[53:05] tribunal and and and and Peter's message
[53:08] convicted
[53:16] them and they said oh my goodness what
[53:19] have we
[53:22] done we've cried out to crucify our
[53:25] Messiah
[53:30] our
[53:31] Lord our King then they rose up and said
[53:37] Peter what what could we men and women
[53:40] like us what could we do to be
[53:46] saved Peter said nothing no hope for
[53:51] you no he didn't say
[53:55] that
[53:57] we might have said
[53:59] it but Peter even Peter before he was
[54:03] converted might have said
[54:08] it but under the
[54:11] anointing to the prophetic
[54:16] anointing to those who had cried crucify
[54:22] him he told
[54:24] them repent
[54:27] and be
[54:28] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[54:32] Christ and you shall be
[54:34] saved and you'll receive the gift of the
[54:38] Holy
[54:40] Spirit the first
[54:42] step to many
[54:44] steps the first
[54:47] filling to many
[54:50] refilling oh hallelujah hallelujah
[54:54] feeling after feeling after
[54:58] that means trial after trial after
[55:01] trial that's why the refilling
[55:06] come the refilling of his spirit is not
[55:08] a
[55:14] reward no no no it's to help you
[55:19] overcome
[55:22] trials it's to help increase your
[55:25] faith
[55:29] it's to help you get closer to
[55:33] him it's not a
[55:36] reward for being
[55:38] good there's not one of us good no not
[55:42] one only him it's his
[55:47] goodness that we
[55:50] want we have none but when we have
[55:54] him we have
[55:56] everything we have peace we have joy we
[56:01] have
[56:01] longsuffering we have the love of God in
[56:04] our
[56:05] heart we have
[56:08] light instead of
[56:11] Darkness that's what
[56:13] Jesus really looks
[56:16] like who is he this
[56:19] Jesus he's a king he's the lion of the
[56:23] tribe of
[56:24] Judah he's the lamb of God he's a
[56:28] Prophet evangelist Apostle he was a
[56:33] teacher he is the chief pastor of this
[56:44] flock the fful
[56:47] ministry of
[56:49] Jesus is what he gave to to us it's what
[56:53] he gave to the
[56:55] church what he gave to this mystical
[56:58] body of Jesus
[57:01] Christ Ephesians 4 and verse
[57:04] one let's read
[57:08] that Ephesians 4 and
[57:12] 1 I therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[57:16] beseech you that ye walk worthy of the
[57:18] vocation wherewith you are
[57:25] called
[57:30] how do we walk
[57:37] worthy how with all loneliness and
[57:40] meekness verse
[57:44] two with long
[57:47] suffering forbearing one another in
[57:55] love
[57:57] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[57:59] spirit in the bond of
[58:05] Peace that's why Jesus
[58:08] said blessed are the
[58:12] peacemakers Paul was just saying amen
[58:15] and teaching the same thing Jesus
[58:21] taught what the Apostle Paul
[58:24] taught what pet
[58:27] taught what James
[58:29] taught joh taught Jesus said it
[58:34] all Jesus taught it
[58:37] all they just came behind
[58:41] him saying the same
[58:44] thing maybe in their own
[58:49] words Paul said it as a man with a great
[58:55] education Peter said it as a man with no
[59:00] education John said it as a man that
[59:03] would put his head on his
[59:10] bosom verse four there is one body and
[59:13] one Spirit even as you are called in one
[59:16] hope of your
[59:23] calling one Lord One Faith one b
[59:28] baptism one
[59:30] message then the message is
[59:33] Christ William
[59:36] brandham the only message he
[59:41] hadam was
[59:45] Christ there's no such a thing as
[59:48] William bram's
[59:52] message if he was a prophet of God and
[59:54] he was
[59:57] then he brought to
[59:59] us
[1:00:01] God
[1:00:06] Christ he brought to us one
[1:00:10] Lord One Faith one baptism verse six he
[1:00:16] brought to us one God and Father of
[1:00:19] all who is above all and through all and
[1:00:22] in you
[1:00:25] all
[1:00:26] then Paul says but unto every one of us
[1:00:29] is given
[1:00:33] Grace according to the measure of the
[1:00:35] gift of
[1:00:38] Christ to everyone he says he extends
[1:00:42] the grace of
[1:00:44] God no matter how low we have
[1:00:49] fallen right no matter if we spent a few
[1:00:52] nights in jail or a few
[1:00:55] years
[1:01:01] he extends
[1:01:03] Grace wherefore he saith when he
[1:01:06] ascended up on high he led captivity
[1:01:14] captive what that
[1:01:17] means is the
[1:01:19] testimony of when Jesus died on the CR
[1:01:22] Cross of
[1:01:23] calv his body lay in a tomb on a stone
[1:01:32] slab but the
[1:01:34] spirit went in down to
[1:01:40] Hell to that Fifth
[1:01:43] Dimension but he took a friend with
[1:01:48] him the thief on the
[1:01:52] cross and both of them together
[1:01:57] descended and there in that Fifth
[1:02:01] Dimension half of that Dimension is
[1:02:06] hell it's a prison
[1:02:09] house where the Lost go to
[1:02:13] wait waiting for Judgment
[1:02:16] Day waiting for a great white Throne
[1:02:23] judgment but the other half of that
[1:02:27] Dimension was called
[1:02:31] Paradise you remember it's where Samuel
[1:02:36] was when when Saul went to the witch of
[1:02:43] Endor and and tried to summon up the
[1:02:46] spirit of
[1:02:50] Samuel it was there in that Fifth
[1:02:53] Dimension where Samuel was waiting
[1:02:58] but he wasn't waiting in
[1:03:01] torment they were the Old Testament
[1:03:04] Saints the
[1:03:13] righteous God gave him a place to
[1:03:17] wait until that day on
[1:03:20] Calvary when he would go down to this
[1:03:23] Fifth
[1:03:24] Dimension
[1:03:27] and take these that were in
[1:03:31] captivity the Old Testament
[1:03:34] Saints he would take them captive to
[1:03:39] himself and take them to a higher
[1:03:44] Dimension the sixth
[1:03:46] Dimension where they then would be
[1:03:48] called Souls under the
[1:03:54] altar what altar
[1:03:57] the altar where the Lamb of God is there
[1:04:01] interceding for you and
[1:04:06] I remember Revelations
[1:04:10] 5 verse 5 67 and
[1:04:14] 8 where John said and I saw a lamb as
[1:04:17] though it was
[1:04:20] slain with seven horns and seven
[1:04:24] eyes there interceding for you and
[1:04:29] I they're interceding for every son and
[1:04:32] daughter of
[1:04:34] God with the grace of God being extended
[1:04:37] from the Throne of
[1:04:40] God there there the Lamb of God
[1:04:46] sits John saw a
[1:04:49] lamb he didn't see
[1:04:52] Jesus he knew what Jesus looked like
[1:04:57] he saw a
[1:04:59] symbol on the altar of
[1:05:01] God that represented what Jesus did for
[1:05:06] us on the cross of Calvary when he said
[1:05:10] it is
[1:05:13] finished it is
[1:05:15] finished and
[1:05:17] whoever would like to stand up tonight
[1:05:20] he
[1:05:21] said and come before
[1:05:24] me I'll receive
[1:05:26] you I'll cleanse you I'll baptize you
[1:05:31] I'll change you I'll make you a new
[1:05:34] creation in
[1:05:38] Christ oh tonight's the
[1:05:41] night for a change for each and
[1:05:46] everyone I came tonight I came
[1:05:52] tonight to be
[1:05:54] changed once again
[1:05:56] I hope you did
[1:06:00] too verse S but unto every one of us is
[1:06:04] given Grace according to the measure of
[1:06:06] the gift of
[1:06:10] Christ wherefore he saith when he
[1:06:13] ascended up on high he led captivity
[1:06:20] captive that means he went to
[1:06:24] Paradise that means he descended to The
[1:06:27] Fifth
[1:06:30] Dimension that means there he gave the
[1:06:32] Old Testament Saints the baptism of the
[1:06:35] Holy
[1:06:37] Ghost he that means
[1:06:40] there it's where he gave the Old
[1:06:42] Testament
[1:06:45] Saints the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[1:06:49] that he could take them to a higher
[1:06:52] Dimension that's what was holding them
[1:06:55] back
[1:06:57] the holy spirit in their
[1:06:59] hearts the Born Again experience in
[1:07:01] their
[1:07:03] lives a new mind the mind of Christ to
[1:07:07] go up higher from a lower Dimension to a
[1:07:11] higher
[1:07:13] Dimension oh and if you and I are ever
[1:07:15] going to go from this low
[1:07:20] Dimension if you and I are ever going to
[1:07:23] go to a higher dimension
[1:07:28] it's going to
[1:07:29] take more of
[1:07:32] Jesus Remember the little song
[1:07:37] mentioned and the songwriter said I want
[1:07:40] more of
[1:07:44] Jesus more and more and
[1:07:47] more I want more of
[1:07:50] Jesus so I'll give him more of
[1:07:54] me that's
[1:07:57] all if you leave
[1:08:00] tonight with that thought and go out
[1:08:02] that
[1:08:05] door then his grace will give you
[1:08:09] more because you have made a you will
[1:08:11] make a promise that I will give you more
[1:08:14] Lord because you've given me
[1:08:22] everything verse eight verse wherefore
[1:08:26] he saith when he ascended up on high he
[1:08:28] led captivity
[1:08:33] captive and gave gifts unto
[1:08:38] men what kind of
[1:08:40] gifts a Tesla
[1:08:44] Tesla a Mercedes Mercedes a 3,000 4,000
[1:08:49] square foot
[1:08:54] home what kind of gifts it was none of
[1:08:59] those the Bible
[1:09:02] says now that he ascended verse n what
[1:09:05] is it but that he also descended first
[1:09:07] into the lower parts of the
[1:09:15] earth so he said before before he went
[1:09:19] and ascended on
[1:09:22] high he first went down to Hell
[1:09:26] he first went down to The Fifth
[1:09:31] Dimension he says because where these
[1:09:34] people are
[1:09:37] at where these children of mine are at
[1:09:40] in this
[1:09:43] Dimension they're in a state of
[1:09:47] emergency I got to go where my kids are
[1:09:49] having the most
[1:09:52] problems I've got to fix that first
[1:09:57] and he descended down into
[1:09:59] hell and he took his
[1:10:02] children who couldn't get out of that
[1:10:06] Dimension he went down and took them in
[1:10:09] his
[1:10:10] arms and caused them to be born again
[1:10:14] and gave them the Holy
[1:10:16] Ghost and took him up to a higher
[1:10:21] Dimension that's why in The Book of
[1:10:24] Revelations
[1:10:26] under the fifth
[1:10:28] seal he said there was some people
[1:10:30] crying
[1:10:35] out and they were crying how Lord Lord
[1:10:38] how long till you avenge
[1:10:47] us how long till you avenge
[1:10:53] us and God said just a little
[1:10:57] while but your brethren will have to
[1:10:59] suffer and die just like
[1:11:04] you the Bible said these were the
[1:11:08] souls under the
[1:11:10] altar the altars in the seventh
[1:11:17] Dimension and they were under that
[1:11:19] altar in a sixth
[1:11:23] Dimension but they had been taken up
[1:11:26] up Jesus
[1:11:29] himself took
[1:11:32] responsibility to move them into the
[1:11:35] next
[1:11:38] Dimension oh how do you think you and I
[1:11:41] are going to make
[1:11:44] it to a Rapture to eternal
[1:11:48] life because Jesus is taking
[1:11:51] responsibility for your soul
[1:11:54] tonight
[1:11:57] he's going to assure you you're going to
[1:12:00] make
[1:12:02] it because on the cross of
[1:12:05] Calvary I've extended
[1:12:08] Grace all you got to do is take me by
[1:12:11] the
[1:12:13] hand and I'll walk you into
[1:12:17] eternity just like I did those millions
[1:12:20] of Old Testament
[1:12:24] Saints
[1:12:26] as a prophet would
[1:12:27] say my that ought to make a Baptist
[1:12:34] shout and if you've ever been in a
[1:12:36] Baptist
[1:12:38] Church you know what he means by that it
[1:12:42] ain't easy to make them
[1:12:45] shout the Bible says in verse
[1:12:51] 11 Ephesians
[1:12:54] 4:11
[1:12:57] these are the gifts
[1:12:58] that and he gave some Apostles and some
[1:13:01] prophets some evangelist some pastors
[1:13:04] and
[1:13:11] teachers the reason he gave
[1:13:15] some because some of them he didn't
[1:13:21] give some are
[1:13:24] imposters
[1:13:26] some are unjust
[1:13:29] stewards some the Bible says are
[1:13:36] liars it's not easy to
[1:13:39] say unless the Bible says
[1:13:42] it and it still isn't
[1:13:46] easy but but God requires us to say
[1:13:51] it in Revelations chapter 2
[1:13:56] and verse
[1:13:57] two the first church
[1:14:00] age the first church
[1:14:05] age the Apostle Paul being the messenger
[1:14:08] the angel to that
[1:14:13] age in verse two of chapter
[1:14:17] two John writes
[1:14:20] this he writes what the spirit is
[1:14:24] saying
[1:14:26] I Know Thy works and thy
[1:14:30] labor those who were working and
[1:14:36] laboring in the days of the Apostle
[1:14:39] Paul that's who he speaking to
[1:14:44] specifically but it but it's still for
[1:14:46] good for us
[1:14:49] today I Know Thy works and thy labor and
[1:14:52] thy
[1:14:54] patience
[1:14:56] and how thou can not bear them which are
[1:15:00] evil and thou has tried them which say
[1:15:03] they are
[1:15:06] Apostles why did they say they were
[1:15:08] Apostles these
[1:15:11] men because they
[1:15:14] were let's turn with me to Luke chapter
[1:15:24] 10
[1:15:26] Luke chapter
[1:15:28] 10 beginning at verse
[1:15:31] one we'll see here why they said they
[1:15:34] were
[1:15:36] Apostles because these are the apostles
[1:15:39] that were found to be
[1:15:43] Liars after these things the Lord
[1:15:45] appointed other 70
[1:15:51] also 70 more
[1:15:54] apostles being ordained by Jesus
[1:15:58] himself and he sent them two and two
[1:16:01] before his face into every city and
[1:16:08] place whether he himself would come
[1:16:12] verse two therefore said he unto
[1:16:16] them the Harvest truly is great but the
[1:16:19] laborers are
[1:16:22] few pray ye therefore the lord of the
[1:16:25] Harvest that he would send forth labors
[1:16:28] into his
[1:16:31] Harvest he's ordaining 70 more
[1:16:35] men anointing them as
[1:16:39] Apostles he said go your ways verse
[1:16:41] three behold I send you forth as Lambs
[1:16:44] amongst
[1:16:48] wolves it was the same message of
[1:16:53] ordination
[1:16:55] the same message of
[1:16:57] ordination that he gave to the first
[1:17:01] 12 he said in verse four he says carry
[1:17:03] neither purse nor script nor shoes and
[1:17:07] salute no man by the
[1:17:13] way in other words if you're going to be
[1:17:15] my
[1:17:17] Apostle you're going to have to be
[1:17:21] focused and where I send you you have to
[1:17:23] go
[1:17:26] then he says in verse five and unto who
[1:17:29] whatsoever house he enter in first say
[1:17:32] peace be to this
[1:17:38] house and if the son of peace be
[1:17:43] there in other words if it turns out
[1:17:45] these are believers
[1:17:48] already where else would the son of
[1:17:50] peace
[1:17:52] be in a pagan home
[1:17:56] no he said when I send you
[1:17:58] out I'll send you to the homes of
[1:18:02] Believers you just keep
[1:18:05] walking remember the
[1:18:07] testimony of brother
[1:18:09] Bram when his when the flight he was
[1:18:12] taken had to have an emergency
[1:18:16] [Music]
[1:18:19] landing I believe it was in Memphis
[1:18:21] Tennessee Memphis Tennessee and they had
[1:18:25] to get everyone off the
[1:18:28] plane so he gets off the
[1:18:30] plane he goes walking
[1:18:33] around he got himself some
[1:18:37] postcards writing some letters to people
[1:18:39] he had to write
[1:18:42] to and then as he's walking down the
[1:18:46] street the holy spirit said keep
[1:18:51] walk and he
[1:18:52] says Lord is that true
[1:18:57] and the voice told him keep
[1:19:00] walking and he keep walking down the
[1:19:03] street and he realizes he's walking into
[1:19:06] some very poor
[1:19:17] neighborhoods and he's realizing the
[1:19:19] Holy Spirit tells him keep
[1:19:23] walking now he realizes he's in
[1:19:26] neighborhoods where all the people are
[1:19:28] black
[1:19:32] [Music]
[1:19:33] people and he's a white
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:37] man down in the
[1:19:40] South it wasn't a comfortable feeling
[1:19:43] for
[1:19:46] him but the holy spirit said keep
[1:19:51] walking you see he was doing the work of
[1:19:54] an apostle
[1:19:57] he was
[1:19:58] focused God told him keep
[1:20:01] walking he he he didn't dare
[1:20:05] say unless you tell me where I'm going
[1:20:08] I'm not going another
[1:20:11] step no he had learned obedience through
[1:20:14] the things that he
[1:20:17] suffered we ought to be learning
[1:20:20] obedience through the things that we
[1:20:22] have
[1:20:23] suffered obedience to him obedience to
[1:20:27] the leading of the Holy
[1:20:31] Spirit obedience when we feeling pulling
[1:20:33] at our
[1:20:36] hearts and the Holy Spirit tells them
[1:20:38] keep
[1:20:40] walking now he's deep into these old
[1:20:47] neighborhoods now he's gone real far
[1:20:50] into these
[1:20:53] neighborhood he doesn't know where he's
[1:20:57] at and as he's passing by a little
[1:21:02] house there's a little black
[1:21:06] lady she's got a handkerchief wrapped
[1:21:09] around her
[1:21:14] head there probably hadn't been a white
[1:21:16] man in that neighborhood for 20
[1:21:19] [Music]
[1:21:21] years and she looks up at him and she
[1:21:25] says good morning
[1:21:30] Parson you see what
[1:21:32] happened God led him to a
[1:21:36] place where the son of Peace
[1:21:40] was God the son of
[1:21:43] Peace God led him to a
[1:21:46] place where the Prince of Peace was in
[1:21:48] the heart of this little
[1:21:53] lady he said how' you know I was a
[1:22:01] Parson how' you know I was a
[1:22:06] Parson he says uh he told me you'd be
[1:22:10] coming she knew he was
[1:22:14] coming but he didn't know where he was
[1:22:17] going but he was going where there was a
[1:22:20] a daughter of
[1:22:22] God who by faith had reached out to the
[1:22:28] father and she said
[1:22:31] father send me
[1:22:34] Elijah because I got a dying
[1:22:38] son and I have faith like that shite
[1:22:44] woman and God said you do have the
[1:22:49] faith and there's a plane flying over
[1:22:52] right
[1:22:53] now
[1:22:56] and I'm going to stop that
[1:22:58] plane cause it to land in
[1:23:01] Memphis because on that plane is the
[1:23:05] Elijah you're asking
[1:23:08] for on that plane is a prophet with thus
[1:23:12] sayith the
[1:23:13] Lord on that plane is a man fulfilling
[1:23:18] the role of an
[1:23:21] apostle and you're going to get what
[1:23:23] you're asking for by
[1:23:27] Faith oh
[1:23:29] tonight hold in your heart by faith your
[1:23:34] petition holding your heart by
[1:23:41] faith and God will give
[1:23:43] you
[1:23:45] tonight the desire of your
[1:23:50] hearts the Bible
[1:23:53] says
[1:23:56] verse
[1:23:57] six and if the son of peace be there
[1:24:00] your peace shall rest upon it if not it
[1:24:03] shall turn to you
[1:24:10] again in other words Jesus was
[1:24:14] saying when you go to strange
[1:24:17] cities when you go to strange
[1:24:20] countries if I send
[1:24:22] you I will be I I will be
[1:24:26] sure to
[1:24:29] prepare a Godly home for you to
[1:24:33] stay where the Prince of Peace
[1:24:38] abides the Bible says verse seven in the
[1:24:42] same house
[1:24:45] remain eating and
[1:24:48] drinking such
[1:24:52] things as you demand of of those
[1:24:58] people no it do say
[1:25:00] that no that's what ministers like to
[1:25:04] do unjust
[1:25:08] stewards but that's not what Jesus told
[1:25:11] the fful
[1:25:14] Ministry Jesus told them these
[1:25:18] Apostles and in the same house
[1:25:23] remain eating and
[1:25:25] drinking such
[1:25:28] things as they
[1:25:32] give whatever they give
[1:25:35] you eat that whatever they give you be
[1:25:40] happy with
[1:25:43] that this is another
[1:25:48] truth concerning tithing and
[1:25:53] offering
[1:25:54] and how the
[1:25:57] minister should receive
[1:26:00] it not
[1:26:04] demanding the best all the
[1:26:07] time but whatever God puts in the
[1:26:10] people's
[1:26:16] hearts that
[1:26:19] receive that's what's
[1:26:22] yours that's what's yours
[1:26:25] and nothing else to the ministers I
[1:26:31] say we got two young ones here in our
[1:26:36] midst I'm very proud
[1:26:39] of and I'll be even more
[1:26:42] proud to see them dig these nuggets out
[1:26:45] and hold to
[1:26:48] them
[1:26:53] uh
[1:26:55] it's a sign of a true Holy Ghost filled
[1:27:03] Minister it's a sign of a true of a true
[1:27:09] Holy Ghost filled
[1:27:15] Minister that keeps all these little
[1:27:19] things in their
[1:27:23] hearts you say but what if I go to
[1:27:26] preach brother
[1:27:30] Daniel and I travel hundreds of miles
[1:27:33] maybe into
[1:27:38] Mexico mexo and I preach in a little
[1:27:41] town in
[1:27:43] Mexico and they pick up an offering for
[1:27:47] me and it's 100
[1:27:53] pesos and the pastor gives it to
[1:27:57] you
[1:27:59] crying because your ministry blessed
[1:28:05] them what do you
[1:28:07] do you take
[1:28:09] it and you say
[1:28:12] Lord reward
[1:28:15] them a million times
[1:28:19] more for they gave of the little they
[1:28:23] had they didn't give from their
[1:28:25] abundance they have no
[1:28:28] abundance but they gave from their
[1:28:31] hearts and Jesus tells the
[1:28:35] ministry accept it bless
[1:28:40] them honor them respect the children of
[1:28:45] God don't you dare ask for
[1:28:50] more ask for more
[1:28:53] revelation
[1:28:55] don't ask for more
[1:28:58] money to the
[1:29:00] ministers that's extra that's free not
[1:29:04] charging anything
[1:29:06] El verse
[1:29:10] seven and in the same house remain
[1:29:13] eating and drinking such things as they
[1:29:14] give for the labor is worthy of his hire
[1:29:17] go not from house to
[1:29:23] house
[1:29:27] go not from house to
[1:29:30] house they're not giving me a lot in
[1:29:33] this
[1:29:34] house they are
[1:29:40] not so I think I'll see if if there's
[1:29:43] any more Brothers in this city and and
[1:29:45] see who has more
[1:29:50] money Jesus said don't you dare do that
[1:29:56] you better
[1:29:57] not because if you
[1:30:00] do that's why there's a lake of fire for
[1:30:08] that verse 8 and into whatsoever City
[1:30:12] enter and they receive you eat such
[1:30:14] things as are set before you again he
[1:30:17] says
[1:30:23] it
[1:30:28] because if you
[1:30:30] don't because if you
[1:30:33] don't you won't be able to fulfill the
[1:30:36] second
[1:30:37] part you won't be you won't be a
[1:30:39] partaker of verse
[1:30:42] n but if you do as Jesus
[1:30:46] said in verse n God will give
[1:30:50] you the healing for the sick
[1:30:57] he said and heal the sick and that are
[1:31:03] therein and say unto them the kingdom of
[1:31:06] God is come nigh unto
[1:31:11] you but into whatsoever city you
[1:31:14] enter and they receive you not go your
[1:31:18] way out of the
[1:31:21] streets and say streets of the same and
[1:31:28] say even the very dust of your city
[1:31:31] which cleaveth on
[1:31:35] us we wipe off against
[1:31:39] you not withstanding be ye sure of
[1:31:44] this that the kingdom of God has come
[1:31:47] nigh unto
[1:31:51] you verse 12 Jesus told them
[1:31:55] remember these are the instructions to
[1:31:58] the
[1:32:01] ministry to 70 more
[1:32:05] men that Jesus was ordaining as
[1:32:09] Apostles for the rest of their
[1:32:13] lives these 70
[1:32:16] men would be privileged to
[1:32:21] say you know who ordained me in the
[1:32:23] ministry
[1:32:25] well have you ever heard of Jesus of
[1:32:35] Nazareth he said but I say unto you that
[1:32:38] it'll be more tolerable in that day for
[1:32:41] Sodom than for that
[1:32:44] City Jesus sent out the
[1:32:50] 70 but you know where the 70 wound up
[1:32:55] in Revelations 2 and
[1:33:00] 2 where the Holy
[1:33:02] Spirit speaking through John this
[1:33:05] Apostle and
[1:33:07] Prophet where the Holy
[1:33:09] Spirit speaking through
[1:33:12] John his Apostle and
[1:33:15] prophet and he says
[1:33:17] This I Know Thy works and thy labor and
[1:33:21] thy
[1:33:22] patience
[1:33:26] and how thou can not bear them which are
[1:33:30] evil he's talking to the
[1:33:32] church that was in the days of the
[1:33:34] Apostle
[1:33:36] Paul he's talking to the
[1:33:38] church for those first years of the
[1:33:42] Ephesian Church
[1:33:46] age he says and and thou has tried them
[1:33:49] which say they
[1:33:52] apostles
[1:33:56] you have tried those that said wait a
[1:33:58] minute I'm one of those
[1:34:03] 70 that Jesus
[1:34:06] ordained I am an
[1:34:09] apostle Jesus of Nazareth ordained
[1:34:13] me William Bram ordained me
[1:34:17] William I knew several
[1:34:20] men most have passed on now
[1:34:24] that were ordained by William
[1:34:28] brand well these
[1:34:30] 70 were ordained by Jesus of
[1:34:36] Nazareth the same one that ordained the
[1:34:38] first
[1:34:41] 12 but if we keep reading our
[1:34:45] Bibles when Jesus began to
[1:34:50] preach the revealed word out of the
[1:34:54] Lamb's Book of
[1:34:58] Life when Jesus opened up the Seven
[1:35:03] Seals when Jesus opened up this new
[1:35:06] testament
[1:35:08] book he said if you don't eat my
[1:35:12] flesh and drink my
[1:35:14] blood you have no part with
[1:35:17] me those 70
[1:35:20] Apostles they said that's too much for
[1:35:23] for
[1:35:24] us why can't you just stay an evangelist
[1:35:27] praying for the
[1:35:30] sick why can't we just keep having a
[1:35:32] healing campaign for the people's
[1:35:38] bodies because he wanted to give us
[1:35:41] healing for our
[1:35:44] souls and the healing for the
[1:35:48] body as a prophet told us was just the
[1:35:52] bait on the hook
[1:35:55] in in the
[1:35:59] hook to get your
[1:36:02] attention to to to to give you words of
[1:36:06] eternal
[1:36:08] life that will cause you to be born
[1:36:12] again that'll cause you to be changing
[1:36:17] daily and receive the very mind of
[1:36:21] Christ receive the very character of
[1:36:24] Jesus
[1:36:26] Christ of Jesus
[1:36:29] Christ and John here in if in
[1:36:32] Revelations 2 and
[1:36:35] 2 the Ephesian Church age he said I Know
[1:36:39] Thy works and thy labor and thy patience
[1:36:41] and how thou can not bear them which are
[1:36:50] evil and thou has tried them which say
[1:36:53] we are Apostles Jesus ordained
[1:37:01] us and we are
[1:37:03] Apostles because Jesus ordained
[1:37:06] us and the Bible says and are not and
[1:37:09] has found them
[1:37:14] Liars you don't have to worry about
[1:37:17] taking away their
[1:37:21] title if they say they're
[1:37:25] Apostle let them be an
[1:37:27] apostle if they say I'm a
[1:37:30] prophet let them be a
[1:37:32] prophet they say I'm an evangelist a
[1:37:35] pastor or
[1:37:39] teacher don't try and take away their
[1:37:43] titles no find out what they're
[1:37:45] preaching and
[1:37:49] saying are they preaching
[1:37:52] Christ or are they lying
[1:37:56] Apostles are they lying
[1:37:59] pastors are they lying

[1:38:23] less than
[1:38:27] $1,000 now you know what kind of apostle

[1:39:22] apostles
[1:39:24] prophets teachers evangelists pastors he
[1:39:29] gave
[1:39:30] some because most of them he didn't
