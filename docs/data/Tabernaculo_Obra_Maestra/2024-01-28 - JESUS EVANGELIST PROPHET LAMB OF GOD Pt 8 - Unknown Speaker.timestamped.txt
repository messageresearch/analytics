[41:28] [Music]
[41:53] God bless you all this
[41:55] morning
[41:57] it's good to be here once
[42:00] again and just as a
[42:03] reminder to continue
[42:07] praying for uh our brother Glenn
[42:11] tamlins Glen
[42:13] Tomlinson um God's will be
[42:17] done the the
[42:19] Physicians the
[42:22] doctors have pretty much told there's
[42:24] nothing more that they can do
[42:28] he still says he was believing for a
[42:32] miracle and uh he had one
[42:35] already they they were about to move him
[42:38] from One hospital to the
[42:41] next and he had a u internal aneurism
[42:48] [Music]
[42:50] bleeding and um they had to rush him
[42:54] into the emergency services
[43:01] but the hospital they were moving him
[43:03] to had they move had it been an hour
[43:07] sooner and they would have moved
[43:11] him that hospital wasn't prepared to
[43:13] deal with his
[43:16] emergency but because it happened there
[43:20] the Thunderbird Banner a yeah and
[43:21] Thunderbird Banner they were they had
[43:24] the they were a trauma 2 or trauma One
[43:31] hospital so they carry large supplies of
[43:34] of blood for
[43:38] surgery and that's what he was needing
[43:41] at the
[43:42] moment so they were able to stop the
[43:46] bleeding and pretty much give them an
[43:48] entire blood transfusion that was
[43:54] necessary but but because of
[43:57] the problems that that he's
[44:01] having the doctors have pretty much said
[44:03] they will not touch him for any kind of
[44:08] surgery he said some of the tumors or
[44:11] the cyst are too
[44:16] large it's amongst too many blood
[44:21] vessels and so they basically have let
[44:23] him know that there's nothing more that
[44:25] they can do
[44:28] so keep pray for the
[44:31] family remember to pray for our brother
[44:36] Glenn one thing we
[44:38] know that until that's our time to
[44:42] go God will keep us
[44:44] here but when it's our time to
[44:48] go the world and all its
[44:51] armies cannot keep you
[44:54] here we are in God's
[44:57] hands uh I thought it was my time to go
[45:00] just a few years
[45:03] ago one of the doctors felt that way
[45:07] too but it wasn't my time God still
[45:11] wanted me
[45:12] here and um he has a purpose he's got a
[45:16] purpose for each and every one of
[45:18] us but we do want to pray for the
[45:22] family um death is never an un death is
[45:26] always an unwelcome
[45:33] guess and so so there's always many
[45:37] human
[45:39] emotions that that are involved with
[45:44] sickness accidents and and everything
[45:48] else but then that's why Jesus told
[45:51] us it's it's it's for all those many
[45:54] reasons
[45:57] that we must be born
[45:59] again because that's what gives us the
[46:02] victory in every human
[46:06] situation work fun play or War we must
[46:10] be born
[46:13] again that's the key that's the secret
[46:17] of the mystery in Christ in us the hope
[46:21] of
[46:22] glory if you'll turn with me this
[46:25] morning
[46:27] to the Book of
[46:31] Matthew Matthew chapter chapter
[46:39] 2 and verse
[46:41] one contining here this morning part
[46:46] eight
[46:47] Jesus evangelist Prophet also
[46:52] teacher Lamb of God so in Matthew chap 2
[46:57] and verse
[46:59] one now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem
[47:02] of
[47:04] Judea in the days of Herod the
[47:07] king behold there came wise
[47:11] men from the East to
[47:14] Jerusalem saying where is he that is
[47:17] born King of the
[47:21] Jews for we have seen his star in the
[47:23] east and are come to worship Him
[47:28] when Herod the
[47:32] King Herod was the
[47:36] [Music]
[47:38] self-proclaimed King of the Jews so for
[47:41] him to
[47:42] hear that some Supernatural thing was
[47:47] happening and bringing in a new king of
[47:49] the
[47:51] Jews the Bible says when Herod the king
[47:54] heard these things
[47:57] he was troubled he wasn't happy he
[48:01] wasn't
[48:03] excited he wasn't in great
[48:06] expectation great this load can be taken
[48:08] away from me of of of dealing with all
[48:11] these
[48:14] people he was
[48:16] troubled he said oh no no they're not
[48:19] taking my kingship
[48:21] away I don't care what the scripture say
[48:26] he says and all Jerusalem with him was
[48:30] troubled everyone was
[48:32] troubled the the Levites were
[48:35] troubled the high priest was
[48:38] trouble because this was going to change
[48:40] their
[48:42] religion this was going to take away
[48:44] their power and
[48:47] authority because in the old
[48:50] world when a new king came
[48:53] in he put to death the family of the Old
[48:59] King he put to death all the soldiers
[49:02] that weren't behind him
[49:05] 100% the new king would would clean the
[49:09] house and start all over
[49:12] again this was the mentality of the
[49:15] people
[49:16] then so when the Magi came and
[49:19] said where is he that's born King of the
[49:23] Jews we have come to worship
[49:26] the whole world Pagan and Rel and
[49:31] religious they said what in their mind
[49:35] that triggered
[49:38] something if this is
[49:41] true great change is
[49:43] coming and we're not ready for
[49:46] change the human beings are never ready
[49:48] for
[49:49] change but when God comes on the scene
[49:53] to keep his word to his people
[49:56] he's bringing
[49:57] change great
[49:59] change let's pray Heavenly Father we
[50:03] thank you now we give you honor and
[50:06] Glory ask your blessings upon the
[50:09] word in Jesus name amen
[50:14] amen turn with me to the book of
[50:20] Samuel 1
[50:22] Samuel chapter
[50:24] 8
[50:27] and as many of you might
[50:30] remember here in chapter 8 of 1
[50:34] Samuel the prophet had two
[50:37] sons Samuel is is is an old man
[50:41] now and he's foreseeing the the the
[50:44] truth that one day soon he'll go
[50:49] home that death is knocking at his
[50:54] door but but he doesn't want to leave
[50:57] Israel without a
[51:00] leadership so in in math in Samuel
[51:06] 81 you may be
[51:08] seated in Samuel
[51:11] 81 it says and it came to pass when
[51:15] Samuel was
[51:17] old that he made his sons judges over
[51:22] Israel it tells us the name of his ser
[51:25] first son and his second
[51:27] son Joel and
[51:30] abah the scripture goes on to tell us
[51:32] that his sons didn't walk in a Godly
[51:36] way as a matter of fact they walked in a
[51:39] very ungodly
[51:42] way they chased the
[51:45] money they took bribes the Bible says
[51:48] they perverted
[51:51] judgment he says and all the Elders of
[51:53] Israel in verse four
[51:57] they gathered themselves together and
[52:00] came to
[52:02] Samuel unto Rama to
[52:07] complain verse five says and said unto
[52:10] him behold Thou Art old and thy Sons
[52:13] walk not in thy ways now make us a king
[52:16] to judge us like all the
[52:24] nations
[52:26] but the king but the thing displeased
[52:30] Samuel when they said give us a king to
[52:32] judge
[52:35] us just like when the wise men
[52:40] came they said where is he that's born
[52:42] King of the
[52:44] Jews we followed a supernatural
[52:48] light for thousands of miles to get
[52:52] here to worship this King
[52:56] was going to be born somewhere in this
[52:59] land the Bible says they were troubled
[53:01] at
[53:03] it and here the people of Israel tell
[53:08] Samuel you're getting old you'll die
[53:12] soon so give us a king to judge
[53:15] us and Samuel prayed unto the
[53:19] Lord and the Lord said unto Samuel verse
[53:24] 7 hearken unto the voice of the
[53:28] people in all that they say unto
[53:34] thee was it something
[53:37] good no no and yet God said to
[53:41] Samuel hearken to the voice of the
[53:47] people
[53:49] and for they have not rejected thee but
[53:53] they have rejected me
[53:57] that I should not Reign Over
[54:01] them so the principle being laid here in
[54:04] the
[54:06] scriptures the people thought God's
[54:09] Prophet is going
[54:13] home what will we do when he
[54:16] goes what are we going to do when he
[54:18] dies in that car
[54:21] accident we have nothing we can't trust
[54:25] in his
[54:27] sons we need a
[54:29] king or maybe we need for him to
[54:33] return but God said to
[54:35] Samuel Samuel they haven't rejected you
[54:40] they rejected me because when you leave
[54:43] the
[54:44] scene I was coming on the scene for
[54:48] them and instead they said give us a
[54:52] king they've rejected not you
[54:56] because you're leaving they've rejected
[54:59] me because as soon as you leave I was
[55:03] coming to them I would descend amongst
[55:07] them I would keep my word to them I'll
[55:10] be I'll be with you even in you to the
[55:13] ends of the
[55:15] Earth and instead they chose they wanted
[55:19] to go from a god- sent
[55:22] Prophet to a King and skip the moving of
[55:26] the Holy Ghost in their
[55:31] life because you God
[55:34] people in
[55:36] prayer in your little prayer
[55:39] closet you can be
[55:43] led of the Holy Spirit you can be
[55:46] changed by the power of
[55:50] God we don't have to live
[55:54] carnally
[55:56] and when a prophet leaves a
[55:58] scene it's your opportunity and
[56:01] mine to be
[56:03] sure that we've received a born again
[56:07] experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[56:11] God With Us God in
[56:17] us not a
[56:18] king the prophet's
[56:23] gone he said Sam give them the
[56:28] king but they jumped over
[56:32] something they skipped the
[56:35] step of what God was wanting to
[56:38] do the plan was Samuel when you go off
[56:42] the
[56:45] scene I'll be with the
[56:47] people I'll never leave them I'll be
[56:50] with them I'll be in them the ends of
[56:53] the world when the prophets leave the
[56:56] scene you know what you've got left
[57:00] church the Holy Ghost the King of Kings
[57:04] the king of the Jews the Bride of the
[57:09] bridegroom the
[57:11] husband and you're the wife when the
[57:14] prophet
[57:15] leaves
[57:17] listen verse seven again and the Lord
[57:20] said unto Samuel hearken unto the voice
[57:22] of the people and all that they say unto
[57:25] thee for they have not rejected thee but
[57:28] they have rejected me that I should
[57:30] Reign Over
[57:39] them they had a prophet
[57:42] Samuel they loved him they respected him
[57:46] they saw him getting old they knew he'd
[57:48] be leaving the scene
[57:51] soon what was to follow when he left the
[57:53] scene
[57:55] is the king would Reign Over
[57:58] Israel but before he could do
[58:01] that they told the prophet give us a
[58:06] king and the prophet Samuel's
[58:10] thinking well that's what I've been
[58:12] given
[58:14] you is a
[58:16] king why do you think I preach 1,200
[58:20] messages so when I leave the
[58:22] scene you'll have a king you'll have the
[58:25] king of the Jews you'll have the king
[58:28] and you'll be the
[58:29] [Music]
[58:30] queen you'll have more than hope you'll
[58:34] have Divine leadership of the Holy Ghost
[58:36] in your
[58:40] life verse
[58:45] eight according to all the works which
[58:48] they have done since the day that I
[58:50] brought them out of Egypt even unto this
[58:52] day wherewith they have forsaken me and
[58:55] served other gods so do they also unto
[59:08] thee from the days of
[59:10] Egypt they couldn't
[59:13] shake they couldn't shake their
[59:16] denominational
[59:20] thinking they remained carnal
[59:23] believers
[59:25] and yet they were in the message
[59:28] following Moses but they never
[59:30] understood
[59:32] Moses they never understood his
[59:34] ministry they never understood what he
[59:36] was trying to take him
[59:39] to to a land of
[59:42] promise where the king would be
[59:46] Jehovah verse n now therefore hearken
[59:50] unto their voice how be it yet protest
[59:52] solemnly unto them can show show them
[59:55] the manner of the king that shall reign
[59:57] over
[1:00:04] them a prophet in this
[1:00:06] day protested
[1:00:09] solemnly to the
[1:00:11] people because they wanted a
[1:00:14] king they wanted a
[1:00:17] denomination they're now they're wanting
[1:00:19] one world global
[1:00:22] leader they will get a king
[1:00:25] but he'll do to them and worse than what
[1:00:29] God told
[1:00:30] Samuel and Samuel told all the words of
[1:00:33] the Lord unto the people that asked of
[1:00:35] him a
[1:00:38] king and Samuel told all the
[1:00:43] words of the Lord unto the people that
[1:00:48] asked of
[1:00:49] him a
[1:00:52] king because it wasn't 100% % of the
[1:00:55] people that wanted that it never is
[1:01:00] there's always one little
[1:01:02] percent that are
[1:01:05] saying I don't want a
[1:01:08] king I don't want a
[1:01:10] denomination I want Jesus I want a
[1:01:14] personal experience with Jesus
[1:01:17] Christ and I need it every
[1:01:20] day I need it every
[1:01:23] moment
[1:01:28] amen and Samuel told all the words of
[1:01:30] the Lord unto the people that asked of
[1:01:33] him a
[1:01:34] king and he said verse 11 this will be
[1:01:38] the manner of the king that shall reign
[1:01:40] over
[1:01:44] you and this was the manner of Kings
[1:01:48] since since time
[1:01:52] began and this is what Kings and
[1:01:54] dictators will do when this world
[1:01:56] finally
[1:01:59] ends this is the characteristics of
[1:02:03] Kings flesh
[1:02:05] men and he said this will be the manner
[1:02:08] of the king that shall reign over you
[1:02:09] verse
[1:02:12] 11 he will take your sons and appoint
[1:02:16] them for
[1:02:16] himself for his chariots to be his
[1:02:20] Horsemen and Sh and some shall run
[1:02:23] before his chariot
[1:02:27] and he will appoint him captains over
[1:02:31] thousands and captains over
[1:02:34] 50s and will set them to ear his
[1:02:38] ground and to reap his Harvest and to
[1:02:41] make his instruments of
[1:02:43] war and instruments of
[1:02:46] Chariots that sounds like the Kings we
[1:02:48] serve
[1:02:50] today that sounds like the presidents of
[1:02:52] Nations we serve today
[1:02:55] that sounds like the prime ministers of
[1:02:56] Nations we serve
[1:02:59] today that sounds like all the global
[1:03:02] leaders of
[1:03:03] today and they're all doing the same
[1:03:06] thing because without a born again
[1:03:10] experience this is what Kings will
[1:03:13] do and verse 13 he will take your
[1:03:17] daughters to be
[1:03:19] confectionaries and to be cooks and to
[1:03:22] be Bakers
[1:03:28] and he will take your
[1:03:31] fields and your
[1:03:34] Vineyards and your Olive yards verse
[1:03:38] 14 even the best of
[1:03:41] them you've got two
[1:03:43] Vineyards one's not doing too
[1:03:46] good The Vines are
[1:03:49] dying the other ones has these marvelous
[1:03:52] Thompson grapes growing as as big as an
[1:04:00] orange and the King will say Kenny I'll
[1:04:05] tell you what I'll take this one you can
[1:04:08] keep the other
[1:04:09] one and you're supposed to like
[1:04:12] it you're supposed to say thank you King
[1:04:15] that was aw nice of
[1:04:17] you keep one of
[1:04:20] them that's what Kings
[1:04:22] do he will take your Fields your
[1:04:24] Vineyards your Olive
[1:04:28] yards even the best of them and give
[1:04:31] them to his
[1:04:33] servants his yes
[1:04:38] men and he will take the tenth of your
[1:04:41] seed verse
[1:04:44] 15 and of your
[1:04:46] Vineyards and give it to his
[1:04:49] officers and to his
[1:04:51] servants and he will take your men's
[1:04:54] servants and your maid servants and your
[1:04:57] goodliest young
[1:04:59] man and your asses and put them to his
[1:05:05] work but King I actually needed that ass
[1:05:09] to to to to plow with this
[1:05:15] week too bad I want him this week
[1:05:20] Kings church
[1:05:23] leaders pastors evangelists
[1:05:26] Apostles the same mentality in their
[1:05:30] minds they become
[1:05:31] Kings they aren't servants to the people
[1:05:34] no more they have made themselves
[1:05:38] Kings watch their
[1:05:42] characteristics and he will take your
[1:05:44] men servants verse
[1:05:47] 16 and your M man servants and your
[1:05:51] goodliest young man and your asses and
[1:05:54] put them to his
[1:05:56] work and he will take the tenent of your
[1:05:59] sheep and ye shall be his
[1:06:02] servants he will not serve you you will
[1:06:06] serve
[1:06:08] him and you shall cry out in that day
[1:06:11] because because of your king which ye
[1:06:14] shall have chosen
[1:06:19] you and the Lord will not hear you in
[1:06:23] that day
[1:06:29] nevertheless the people refus to
[1:06:34] obey the voice of Samuel and they said
[1:06:38] nay but we will have a king over
[1:06:41] us that we also may be like all the
[1:06:46] nations and that our King May judge
[1:06:50] us and go out before
[1:06:52] us and fight our
[1:06:56] battles but the Kings didn't always go
[1:06:59] out before
[1:07:01] them and at some point all
[1:07:05] Kings ceased to go out to
[1:07:08] battle and would send only the people
[1:07:11] would only send your young
[1:07:14] men to battle would only send your your
[1:07:18] sons to
[1:07:19] battle would only send your daughters to
[1:07:22] battle
[1:07:24] does that sound like America and Mexico
[1:07:29] and all the other nations of
[1:07:32] 2023 when politicians rise up and they
[1:07:35] say you can't talk to me that
[1:07:39] way I'll draft 10,000 young
[1:07:43] men 18 years old and I'll teach you guys
[1:07:47] a
[1:07:48] lesson and he sends them to
[1:07:51] battle
[1:07:52] Vietnam Africa Germany Israel the Middle
[1:07:57] East look what Kings do and they haven't
[1:08:01] stopped doing
[1:08:03] it since the day that their
[1:08:05] characteristics were
[1:08:10] identified
[1:08:12] Kings
[1:08:14] Apostles pastors evangelists
[1:08:20] teachers if they tell you they
[1:08:22] are then they
[1:08:25] are but watch their
[1:08:28] characteristics and you'll know who's
[1:08:31] leading
[1:08:32] them the Holy
[1:08:35] Spirit or a devil
[1:08:42] Spirit the pattern of what king are they
[1:08:46] following Kings of the
[1:08:49] Earth or King
[1:08:52] Jesus we've been following a star the
[1:08:54] wise men
[1:08:57] said and where is
[1:08:59] he that is born King of the
[1:09:07] Jews verse
[1:09:09] 20 that we also may be like all the
[1:09:12] nations and that our King May judge us
[1:09:15] and go out before us and fight our
[1:09:22] battles and heard all the words of the
[1:09:25] people he re rehearsed them in the ears
[1:09:27] of the
[1:09:31] Lord and the Lord said to
[1:09:33] Samuel hearken unto their
[1:09:37] voice and make a king and Samuel said
[1:09:41] unto the men of
[1:09:43] Israel go ye every man unto his
[1:09:47] City and as you keep
[1:09:49] reading you'll see they picked the
[1:09:52] king and you'll see the king that they
[1:09:56] picked he stood head and shoulders of
[1:09:59] above
[1:10:03] everyone big tall handsome
[1:10:08] fell seemed to have had a great start in
[1:10:11] his
[1:10:14] kingship but as all of these types of
[1:10:18] Kings he had a very bad
[1:10:22] ending and so so did
[1:10:25] Israel the Kings let's go back to
[1:10:30] Matthew Chapter
[1:10:39] 2 and verse
[1:10:42] one now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem
[1:10:47] of Judea in the days of Herod the king
[1:10:50] behold there came wise men from the East
[1:10:52] to Jerusalem
[1:11:00] saying where is he that is born King of
[1:11:03] the
[1:11:05] Jews for we have seen his star in the
[1:11:08] east and are come to worship
[1:11:11] him if they only
[1:11:14] knew that this was the king that they'd
[1:11:17] always
[1:11:18] wanted if they only knew that this was
[1:11:20] the only true
[1:11:22] king
[1:11:24] that came to
[1:11:26] serve and not to be
[1:11:28] served he was born King of the
[1:11:33] Jews but he didn't run to be on a
[1:11:38] throne on the
[1:11:40] contrary this King when he came he
[1:11:45] humbled
[1:11:47] himself he was born in a humble little
[1:11:52] manger
[1:11:55] in a
[1:11:56] barn unlike most other net
[1:12:05] Kings he grew up in a place called
[1:12:10] Nazareth if we were living in Phoenix
[1:12:13] Pho we'd say this guy was born in South
[1:12:18] Phoenix
[1:12:20] Phoenix and he and he roamed around
[1:12:22] Maryville
[1:12:25] can anything good come out of these
[1:12:28] places a king was
[1:12:31] coming but this
[1:12:33] King came to
[1:12:35] serve and not to be
[1:12:39] served he had the
[1:12:41] power he could have spoke a mansion into
[1:12:45] existence but instead he was born in a
[1:12:48] manger that it might be
[1:12:51] fulfilled was spoken of the the
[1:12:55] prophets in Matthew chapter
[1:12:59] 1 it begins with the generation of Jesus
[1:13:05] Christ it comes through
[1:13:07] Abraham then it follows down and and and
[1:13:10] it goes through the tribe of
[1:13:13] [Music]
[1:13:16] Judah Abraham
[1:13:19] David the tribe of Judah they were all
[1:13:22] carriers
[1:13:25] of this Gene that was
[1:13:27] coming that would be the king of the
[1:13:29] Jews and the and the gene finally came
[1:13:32] to
[1:13:34] rest promised from from all the way in
[1:13:38] Genesis
[1:13:40] 1 this Gene had been
[1:13:43] promised it came through
[1:13:45] Abraham Matthew began following this
[1:13:49] Gene with Abraham with David
[1:13:54] with Isaac with Jacob with Judah with AB
[1:14:00] with
[1:14:01] Salon with Solomon with
[1:14:04] Uzziah with with
[1:14:07] ezekias with Josiah he's following the
[1:14:11] gene Matthew anointed of the Holy Spirit
[1:14:15] he's following that Gene as it's coming
[1:14:17] through this lineage of people this
[1:14:20] lineage of the tribe of
[1:14:22] Judah
[1:14:23] and the gene finally finds a resting
[1:14:27] place in a young lady's womb called Mary
[1:14:32] of the tribe of Judah the Jean finally
[1:14:35] finds a resting
[1:14:37] place where it will grow to the stature
[1:14:41] of a perfect
[1:14:43] man Mary a type of the church a type of
[1:14:48] the bride and the gene has been coming
[1:14:52] down but it's found a resting
[1:14:55] place in The Bride of Jesus
[1:14:58] Christ the gene that Matthew was
[1:15:02] following from
[1:15:03] Abraham all the way down through all of
[1:15:06] these all of these
[1:15:10] people once again if you can believe it
[1:15:15] the gene has found a resting
[1:15:18] place in the womb of your
[1:15:20] heart you and I become a resting place
[1:15:25] of this Gene the king of Israel the king
[1:15:30] of the

[1:16:38] book of the
[1:16:40] generation of Jesus
[1:16:43] Christ and how this
[1:16:46] Gene finally came to be
[1:16:50] born in a little young girl
[1:16:54] called
[1:16:56] Mary were following the

[1:18:01] Christ that's what the scriptures
[1:18:05] represent oh written in Parables written
[1:18:08] in
[1:18:09] metaphor written so that you need a
[1:18:11] revelation to catch
[1:18:15] it so it does just doesn't become a
[1:18:21] story
[1:18:25] in Spanish you say so it doesn't become
[1:18:27] just another
[1:18:31] NOA
[1:18:33] no Jesus
[1:18:35] Christ chapter
[1:18:37] 2 from birth to
[1:18:40] Nazareth is what chapter two
[1:18:44] covers where he
[1:18:46] lived until he began his
[1:18:49] ministry at about 30 years of
[1:18:51] age
[1:18:53] in but in Matthew
[1:18:55] 3 John
[1:18:58] begins John begins his
[1:19:02] ministry just before the ministry of
[1:19:05] Jesus
[1:19:07] begins for Elijah the
[1:19:09] prophet was to come on the
[1:19:12] scene a forerunner to introduce the Lamb
[1:19:16] of God to introduce Jesus Christ to
[1:19:20] Israel to tell them behold the Lamb of
[1:19:24] God behold the king of the
[1:19:27] Jews behold what Israel once
[1:19:32] rejected he's here again to give you
[1:19:35] another
[1:19:36] chance he rejected him in the days of
[1:19:39] Samuel the
[1:19:40] prophet but will you receive him
[1:19:43] today in the ministry of John the
[1:19:46] Baptist
[1:19:47] ofet and many rejected in that
[1:19:51] time God
[1:19:53] rich and mercy come down again in the
[1:19:57] mouth of another
[1:19:58] Elijah to give you and I a
[1:20:01] chance to make Jesus our
[1:20:04] King not the prophet the Lord Jesus king
[1:20:09] of Our Lives king of our hearts king of
[1:20:13] our minds oh he's come back

[1:20:31] salvation then you receive healing from
[1:20:33] My
[1:20:35] Touch come back
[1:20:37] again because in you I followed that
[1:20:42] J that's how I know my
[1:20:45] children when I look at them I look at
[1:20:48] you I see the gene of Jesus Christ in
[1:20:51] you that's me
[1:20:54] that's what makes you my daughter that's
[1:20:57] what makes you my
[1:21:01] son God rich in
[1:21:04] Mercy and Matthew
[1:21:06] 3
[1:21:08] Elijah the prophet comes on the scene a
[1:21:13] forerunner introducing the Lamb of God
[1:21:16] to
[1:21:19] Israel so before Jesus begins
[1:21:24] John comes on the scene behold I
[1:21:27] send Elijah the prophet before the great
[1:21:31] and terrible day of the
[1:21:33] Lord and He will turn the
[1:21:36] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:21:40] the ministry of John the
[1:21:47] Baptist John was born to a
[1:21:51] priest
[1:21:53] John was of the tribe of
[1:21:56] Levi John's
[1:21:59] father
[1:22:00] Zachariah was a well-respected priest
[1:22:03] amongst
[1:22:06] Israel so it it it would fall John's lot
[1:22:10] and opportunity he too was born to the
[1:22:13] priesthood
[1:22:18] now because his father was a ranking m
[1:22:22] member of the
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:26] church John you listen to
[1:22:29] me and you'll be in the ministry
[1:22:32] too because you're my son you're already
[1:22:36] accepted no
[1:22:39] worries but John was born for a greater
[1:22:45] Ministry John was
[1:22:47] born to be
[1:22:49] Elijah and to introduce
[1:22:54] Israel to the Lamb of
[1:22:56] God to identify the king of the
[1:23:00] Jews but as a young
[1:23:03] boy his parents being great in
[1:23:07] age when he was born the only son to
[1:23:11] this elderly
[1:23:14] couple history says that his mom and dad
[1:23:17] they passed
[1:23:19] away and as a young
[1:23:21] boy
[1:23:23] the Holy Spirit almighty God takes John
[1:23:25] to live in the
[1:23:28] wilderness he didn't grow up like other
[1:23:31] children he never had a
[1:23:34] childhood as a young boy he never he
[1:23:37] never had a mom to to to to hold him and
[1:23:40] keep him warm on the cold nights of
[1:23:46] Judea he didn't have a dad to teach him
[1:23:48] the things that he
[1:23:51] knew no no his ministry was so
[1:23:55] important that God separated him even
[1:23:59] from mother even from father even from
[1:24:02] all his relatives and took him into the
[1:24:06] Wilderness God became his mom God became
[1:24:09] his dad God became his guide God was the
[1:24:13] one anointing
[1:24:16] him and when he come to be a young man
[1:24:20] 29 30 years old
[1:24:22] God calls him he says your hours
[1:24:26] come you're to go to You're to go out to
[1:24:29] Israel
[1:24:30] now I want you to preach the Kingdom of
[1:24:33] Heaven is at
[1:24:34] hand I want you to start baptizing the
[1:24:37] people unto
[1:24:40] repentance I want you to preach Heaven
[1:24:44] high and Hell
[1:24:47] hot but through
[1:24:49] repentance and water baptism we could
[1:24:53] now begin a
[1:24:55] journey a journey to those very
[1:24:58] Heights of Holiness of Integrity of
[1:25:05] honesty of fidelity to
[1:25:09] God in chapter
[1:25:12] three John is
[1:25:15] baptizing and the River
[1:25:17] Jordan the people are
[1:25:20] coming they' never heard a message like
[1:25:23] this they'd never heard a man preach
[1:25:26] like
[1:25:27] John they never been invited to be
[1:25:30] baptized unto
[1:25:34] repentance they never had the
[1:25:38] opportunity to do an outward
[1:25:42] work to show that there was something on
[1:25:45] the inside moving
[1:25:47] them to show something was being changed
[1:25:50] within them
[1:25:53] just being baptized in water doesn't
[1:25:56] save
[1:25:58] you or every time people go swimming in
[1:26:00] the ocean they'd be
[1:26:05] saved no it was the
[1:26:08] attitude no it's the
[1:26:10] conviction no it's the
[1:26:12] reason no it's the leading of the Holy
[1:26:15] Ghost leading
[1:26:16] you that makes this
[1:26:19] baptism submer in this water
[1:26:23] different from any other time that you
[1:26:26] could be submerged in
[1:26:28] water repentance made the
[1:26:30] difference repentance made it something
[1:26:34] sacred repentance made the Holy Ghost
[1:26:37] come
[1:26:41] down it was the ministry of
[1:26:43] John and while he's
[1:26:46] preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:26:50] hand repent
[1:26:53] and be
[1:26:55] baptized but he also told them my
[1:26:59] Ministry I baptize you with
[1:27:03] water but this is to prepare you for
[1:27:06] something
[1:27:08] Supernatural there's another
[1:27:11] step there's more things to be
[1:27:15] added because there's coming one after
[1:27:18] me who will baptize
[1:27:20] you with the Holy Ghost and Fire I'm
[1:27:25] preparing your
[1:27:27] hearts I'm preparing your
[1:27:29] minds I'm laying a gospel
[1:27:33] seed that if there's something that we
[1:27:36] need
[1:27:37] Israel is to be
[1:27:41] baptized but I baptize with
[1:27:45] water the next
[1:27:47] baptism your second pull is to Long
[1:27:54] and
[1:27:54] look for a supernatural
[1:27:58] baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire if
[1:28:02] this water
[1:28:03] baptism made you feel good made you feel
[1:28:07] clean give you hope oh wait till you get
[1:28:11] the Holy Ghost in
[1:28:13] fire that baptism will give you more
[1:28:16] than hope it'll give you courage it'll
[1:28:20] give you strength it'll give you
[1:28:22] overcoming
[1:28:23] power for every strong
[1:28:26] Temptation the fire of God will keep you
[1:28:31] hold you lift you up he give you the
[1:28:35] victory that's what this King was
[1:28:41] coming we've been following a
[1:28:44] star to this
[1:28:47] spot where is he that'll be born King of
[1:28:51] the Jews
[1:28:55] a king that'll Serve the
[1:28:57] People a king that'll love the
[1:29:01] people a king that that'll let you keep
[1:29:05] the nicest
[1:29:09] property a king that'll let you keep the
[1:29:12] best
[1:29:15] Vineyard then he'll take the Old
[1:29:18] Vineyard and when he cleanses it and
[1:29:21] makes it
[1:29:22] fruitful he'll give you that one back
[1:29:26] too because you can't outgive the
[1:29:30] Lord no matter what you
[1:29:32] do cuz you'll find that in the
[1:29:36] end this King King Jesus has outen you
[1:29:40] an eye a million times
[1:29:45] over
[1:29:48] John in verse 13 of Matthew 3
[1:29:52] Jesus comes to
[1:29:55] him he's going to begin his
[1:29:59] ministry but before he
[1:30:03] begins he is our
[1:30:06] sacrifice and the
[1:30:08] sacrifice must always be
[1:30:10] washed the sacrificial
[1:30:15] Lambs had to be washed
[1:30:19] first then cometh Jesus from G to Jordan
[1:30:22] and to
[1:30:24] John to be baptized of
[1:30:27] him but not for
[1:30:29] repentance but John forbade
[1:30:32] him saying you don't have to repent of
[1:30:36] anything it's I need to repent of
[1:30:40] you I Elijah I the great
[1:30:43] prophet I the human being I the one that
[1:30:47] needs to
[1:30:48] repent why don't you baptize me instead
[1:30:53] Jesus said unto
[1:30:54] him suffer it to be
[1:30:58] so I know you need me to baptize you
[1:31:02] more than I need to be baptized of
[1:31:06] you speaking just
[1:31:09] naturally he says but suffer it to be
[1:31:13] so for there's a prophetic word that
[1:31:16] needs to be fulfilled in my life right
[1:31:19] now and you're the one that I'm calling
[1:31:21] to help me fulfill this prophetic
[1:31:26] word and no matter how short you
[1:31:30] feel no M no matter how how you feel
[1:31:32] that you are not
[1:31:35] worthy do you know there's a prophetic
[1:31:38] word in the scriptures concerning you
[1:31:41] and I that God needs and wants
[1:31:45] you to help him
[1:31:47] fulfill oh God rich in Mercy
[1:31:53] loves you wants you needs you calling
[1:31:58] you the king of the Jews the king of
[1:32:02] Heaven the King of
[1:32:06] Kings he needs
[1:32:10] you because he loves
[1:32:12] you if he didn't love you he wouldn't
[1:32:16] feel he needed
[1:32:17] you but because he loves you he tells
[1:32:21] you this morning
[1:32:23] I need
[1:32:23] you and if you'll meet me in the prayer
[1:32:28] closet I'll show you
[1:32:30] why I need you and why I want you and
[1:32:35] why I love
[1:32:37] you
[1:32:39] Jesus verse
[1:32:41] 15 he tells
[1:32:44] John suffer it to be
[1:32:46] so for thus it becomes us to fulfill all
[1:32:50] righteousness
[1:32:52] then John being a
[1:32:54] prophet he said I don't really
[1:32:57] understand what you
[1:32:58] said and yet I get
[1:33:01] it and yet I do
[1:33:06] understand another words to you I
[1:33:10] surrender all
[1:33:12] obedience Lord I don't really
[1:33:15] understand and yet I do
[1:33:18] understand why I need to put my house in
[1:33:21] order
[1:33:23] why we should put the church in
[1:33:26] order I don't understand and yet it's
[1:33:31] way deep
[1:33:33] inside you do
[1:33:38] understand and Jesus when he was
[1:33:41] baptized went up straight way out of the
[1:33:45] water and lo the heavens were opened
[1:33:47] unto
[1:33:49] him and he saw the Spirit of God
[1:33:53] descending like a
[1:33:54] dove and lighting upon
[1:33:57] him and L a voice from Heaven
[1:34:02] saying this is my beloved
[1:34:04] Son in whom I'm well
[1:34:07] pleased now he was ready to begin his
[1:34:11] ministry now the lamb had been
[1:34:14] washed to prepare for a great
[1:34:18] sacrifice that was coming
[1:34:20] up then he enters on Matthew 4:1 Mount
[1:34:28] Temptation and there we
[1:34:30] see where Jesus defeated
[1:34:35] Lucifer by simply telling him it's also
[1:34:42] written Satan quoted Him
[1:34:46] scripture with a
[1:34:48] period
[1:34:50] Jesus said let me take that period
[1:34:53] off put it here put a comma and show you
[1:34:58] where it's also
[1:35:02] written and after about three
[1:35:05] tries said you know that's
[1:35:08] enough this man's playing with me he
[1:35:12] messing me
[1:35:13] up I ain't talking with you no more
[1:35:16] Jesus I'll just make a plan to get rid
[1:35:20] of you
[1:35:22] I'll anoint Israel and the high
[1:35:25] priest I'll anoint Pontius Pilate Caesar
[1:35:29] of
[1:35:31] Rome I'll anoint the Pagan world and
[1:35:34] I'll anoint the religious
[1:35:36] world and even if they hate each
[1:35:39] other I am leading both of them I
[1:35:42] anointing both of
[1:35:43] them and I'll anoint them both bring
[1:35:47] them into an invisible
[1:35:50] Union finally agree on one
[1:35:53] thing put Jesus to death crucify
[1:35:57] him and those that follow him oh it was
[1:36:02] all going to repeat
[1:36:05] again in our day once again the story
[1:36:11] repeats for a short time both John and
[1:36:16] Jesus were on the
[1:36:18] field preaching to Israel
[1:36:22] at the in Matthew
[1:36:24] 4 it's when Jesus begins his
[1:36:29] ministry as an
[1:36:31] evangelist praying for the
[1:36:33] sick and the more he prayed for the more
[1:36:37] people came until there was thousands
[1:36:40] upon
[1:36:41] thousands that would come together in
[1:36:45] big Open
[1:36:46] Fields and he'd pray for them he'd touch
[1:36:50] them
[1:36:53] he would heal the
[1:36:55] lame he was raising the dead he was
[1:36:58] giving sight to the
[1:37:00] blind he had caught the attention of the
[1:37:03] people they were following him for the
[1:37:06] Miracles they
[1:37:08] saw it's what he wanted them to
[1:37:12] do he wanted to get the
[1:37:16] attention of every little
[1:37:19] Mary that was in the crowd
[1:37:24] in whom was the very Gene of
[1:37:28] God Sons and Daughters of
[1:37:30] God living in spiritual
[1:37:34] Amnesia like you and
[1:37:38] I but now our eyes of our
[1:37:41] understanding is being opened we see the
[1:37:44] pattern of God's
[1:37:46] word we see our place in the
[1:37:49] scriptures we see how
[1:37:51] how he's calling us to
[1:37:54] live we see how he's calling us to
[1:37:57] talk we see how he's asking us to
[1:38:04] think
[1:38:06] because he wants to be born in the
[1:38:10] manger of our
[1:38:12] hearts if he hasn't
[1:38:14] already that's what he's asking this
[1:38:19] morning it's in chapter
[1:38:21] four he begins his
[1:38:24] ministry the Bible
[1:38:28] says in chapter
[1:38:32] 4 verse
[1:38:34] 12 now when Jesus had
[1:38:37] heard that John was cast into
[1:38:40] prison he departed into
[1:38:43] Galilee that means the prophetic
[1:38:46] Ministry had
[1:38:48] ended and now God was giving
[1:38:52] Israel another
[1:38:57] chance John was also a rejected
[1:39:02] Prophet John was a prophet that gone was
[1:39:05] leaving the
[1:39:06] scene like Samuel was a
[1:39:11] prophet God wanted to be Israel's
[1:39:16] King once Samuel when Samuel was off the
[1:39:20] scene they could take their eyes off the
[1:39:23] man and that and see that God had been
[1:39:26] leading them all the time to the
[1:39:30] prophet but now God wanted to lead each
[1:39:32] and every one of
[1:39:35] us no
[1:39:37] mediator between you and God no mediator
[1:39:42] between you and the Holy Spirit yes the
[1:39:45] fightful ministry is supposed to help
[1:39:48] you help you come to perfection
[1:39:52] but they shouldn't get in the
[1:39:54] way of a personal
[1:39:56] experience between you Jesus Christ Our
[1:40:02] Lord no King but Jesus
[1:40:08] now no King but
[1:40:11] Jesus in our
[1:40:15] hearts Jesus
[1:40:18] begins he says and leaving Nazareth
[1:40:20] verse 13
[1:40:23] he came to dwell in capernium
[1:40:25] which is upon the Sea Coast in the bird
[1:40:29] in the borders of Zebulon and
[1:40:32] Naim that it might be
[1:40:35] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
[1:40:39] prophet the land of
[1:40:42] Zebulon and the land of
[1:40:44] neth by the way of the sea Beyond
[1:40:48] Jordan Galilee
[1:40:51] of the
[1:40:53] Gentiles and one of his first
[1:40:58] meetings was amongst the gentile
[1:41:02] people they saw the
[1:41:05] Miracles Pagan gentile
[1:41:09] people and then he went to Israel the
[1:41:12] king of the
[1:41:13] Jews the lion of the tribe of
[1:41:16] Judah was to take the Lion's part
[1:41:19] first
[1:41:22] Israel his
[1:41:24] people and he was going to give
[1:41:26] them the book that Adam had lost and he
[1:41:30] was going to open up for them a
[1:41:33] plan a seven-part
[1:41:36] plan you know it as the Seven
[1:41:39] Seals but Seven Seals are seven parts of
[1:41:44] one divine plan for Jesus to come and be
[1:41:49] born in the manger of your
[1:41:52] heart and lift you up to a place of
[1:41:55] rapturing
[1:41:58] Faith verse five chapter five of
[1:42:03] Matthew the
[1:42:06] Evangelist goes into a Teaching
[1:42:10] Ministry in Matthew 56 and
[1:42:13] 7 Jesus is teaching on
[1:42:18] Perfection what is biblical perfection
[1:42:23] when you and I finally
[1:42:26] break from these creatures of
[1:42:29] time into
[1:42:31] eternity and we are as
[1:42:34] Eternal as the father in
[1:42:37] Heaven not
[1:42:39] potentially
[1:42:44] Eternal Matthew
[1:42:47] 548 be ye therefore
[1:42:49] perfect
[1:42:52] Eternal even as your
[1:42:54] father which is in heaven is an eternal
[1:43:00] being that was verse
[1:43:03] 48 so the question
[1:43:05] is so how do we become
[1:43:09] perfect well you start by going back and
[1:43:16] studying these first these first these
[1:43:19] last 47 verses
[1:43:21] because if you got to
[1:43:23] 48 and you say we can't be
[1:43:27] perfect you completely
[1:43:30] missed the first 47
[1:43:33] verses of all the baby
[1:43:36] steps to be
[1:43:38] perfect even as the father which is in
[1:43:41] heaven is
[1:43:43] perfect he spoke it in a
[1:43:46] parable so in order to understand
[1:43:48] it you'll need to have
[1:43:51] have a restored
[1:43:54] friendship with the
[1:43:56] father and when you have that called the
[1:44:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:44:03] Fire he'll give you Revelation and when
[1:44:07] you see
[1:44:08] it you'll go wow that was
[1:44:15] simple that's God in
[1:44:18] Simplicity when you're born again
[1:44:22] when you're speaking when you're in
[1:44:24] speaking terms with the
[1:44:28] father and he's revealing to his
[1:44:31] word you're getting it straight from the
[1:44:39] author Mary we look to see her on the
[1:44:42] other side
[1:44:45] Maria but we don't need her as a
[1:44:47] secretary to know
[1:44:49] Jesus
[1:44:53] but we do love the example that she left
[1:44:56] us and the life she
[1:44:58] led and the faith she
[1:45:00] had and the price she paid for what she
[1:45:05] believed Prophet preached a little
[1:45:08] message Mary's
[1:45:10] belief go hear
[1:45:13] it chapter 5 6 and
[1:45:18] 7 Jesus preaching on
[1:45:22] Perfection giving us the steps of how to
[1:45:24] get
[1:45:25] there and in chapter eight of the Book
[1:45:28] of
[1:45:30] Matthew he returns back to doing the
[1:45:32] work of an
[1:45:34] evangelist Healing The
[1:45:37] Sick casting out
[1:45:40] Devils he cast out the spirits with his
[1:45:43] word the Bible
[1:45:45] says he says and he healed all that were
[1:45:49] sick all that it might be
[1:45:51] fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the
[1:45:55] prophet saying he
[1:45:57] himself took our
[1:45:59] infirmities and bore our
[1:46:03] sicknesses oh everybody loved him he was
[1:46:07] healing the people he was healing your
[1:46:10] mom he was healing your dad he was
[1:46:13] healing your children they followed him
[1:46:15] by the thousands
[1:46:18] now then people said
[1:46:21] Lord I'll follow you wherever you go he
[1:46:26] said the
[1:46:27] foxes have dens and the birds have
[1:46:32] Nest but the son of man hath not where
[1:46:34] to lay his head
[1:46:37] yet because you see where I'm going to
[1:46:40] place my
[1:46:41] head is I'm going to give my head
[1:46:46] chip on a body called The Bride of Jesus
[1:46:50] Christ
[1:46:51] and when she's finally
[1:46:53] formed when she's fully born on the day
[1:46:56] of
[1:46:57] Pentecost I'll then have a place to lay
[1:47:01] my head you see he wasn't speaking
[1:47:04] literally he was speaking in a
[1:47:07] parable not
[1:47:11] literally he had many places to lay his
[1:47:15] head one time he laid his head in a
[1:47:19] ship the Bible says he fell
[1:47:22] asleep or the apostles thought he
[1:47:26] slept we know that for his children he
[1:47:30] neither sleeps nor
[1:47:37] Slumbers in chapter
[1:47:40] nine this
[1:47:43] evangelist he takes on two more
[1:47:48] attributes of his
[1:47:56] Ministry in chapter
[1:47:59] n he discerns the thoughts of the
[1:48:05] scribes dising a prophetic
[1:48:09] Ministry and in chapter
[1:48:12] nine
[1:48:14] Jesus he forgives for the first time he
[1:48:17] makes a
[1:48:19] statement to someone who was
[1:48:24] sick someone who needed healing in the
[1:48:29] body they brought to him a man laying
[1:48:32] sick of the
[1:48:36] py he's trembling
[1:48:41] shaking lying on a
[1:48:44] bed and Jesus says seeing their faith he
[1:48:47] said unto the sick of the py
[1:48:52] he saw the faith of the people that
[1:48:54] brought this
[1:48:56] man saw their
[1:48:59] faith there was
[1:49:01] people that loved this man they saw hope
[1:49:05] for
[1:49:06] him they said let's four or five of us
[1:49:08] pick up this bed and take him to
[1:49:12] Jesus we can only get him there he'll be
[1:49:16] healed we know he
[1:49:18] will Jesus seen their
[1:49:21] Faith said unto the sick of the
[1:49:24] FY who also had a greater
[1:49:29] need a greater
[1:49:32] healing Jesus said
[1:49:34] Son be of good
[1:49:37] cheer thy sins be forgiven
[1:49:42] him and the scribes
[1:49:45] said this man Blas
[1:49:49] blasphemeth no no he wasn't
[1:49:51] blaspheming he had just entered in to a
[1:49:55] Ministry of the Lamb of God and they
[1:49:59] didn't see it they didn't catch it they
[1:50:02] didn't see the ministerial
[1:50:04] change they didn't see the
[1:50:07] attribute of God the Lamb of
[1:50:17] God they said blasphemer
[1:50:22] when it was
[1:50:23] really the Lamb of God and the Lamb's
[1:50:27] Book was
[1:50:29] opening and a Plan of
[1:50:32] Salvation first for
[1:50:35] Israel but Israel was rejecting
[1:50:38] already as the multitudes followed him
[1:50:41] for the
[1:50:43] Miracles that big denomination of that
[1:50:47] day was rejecting him more and more with
[1:50:51] every Miracle with every sin he
[1:50:55] forgave every good deed he
[1:50:57] did they despised them more and
[1:51:00] more because the people had stopped
[1:51:03] going to
[1:51:05] synagogues and they'd rather be at one
[1:51:07] of his healing
[1:51:09] meetings theyd rather hear him
[1:51:12] preach than the rabbis cuz they said no
[1:51:17] man teaches the way you teach
[1:51:21] we know you're a teacher come from
[1:51:28] God Nicodemus said I wish I could hear
[1:51:31] you preach more
[1:51:34] often but but you know I'm a associate
[1:51:36] minister in this church over
[1:51:40] here so I can't leave my place of
[1:51:43] Duty even even though their preaching is
[1:51:45] boring
[1:51:47] me and I see that your message
[1:51:51] I see you've got a
[1:51:56] message I see you putting the scriptures
[1:52:00] together it's like I'm getting
[1:52:06] Revelation but you know I belong to the
[1:52:08] certain church and
[1:52:11] I you
[1:52:14] know Matthew 9 Jesus displays two more
[1:52:18] attributes
[1:52:20] one he discerns the
[1:52:22] thoughts and intents of the
[1:52:25] hearts men declares him a
[1:52:28] prophet two he forgives sins he's
[1:52:32] entered into the
[1:52:34] ministry of the lamb in Matthew
[1:52:39] 10 he now sets the the New Testament
[1:52:42] Church in
[1:52:47] order with apostles
[1:52:51] he didn't start the New Testament Church
[1:52:53] with
[1:52:56] prophets of course John was a
[1:52:59] prophet but John was a prophet to
[1:53:04] introduce the Lamb of God but now the
[1:53:08] men that are going to be on the streets
[1:53:13] walking preaching the revealed
[1:53:16] word he brings Apostles
[1:53:18] first they're a rare breed of men
[1:53:26] Apostles they go in
[1:53:29] places and they begin setting God's
[1:53:32] people in
[1:53:33] order though they might be
[1:53:36] hated
[1:53:37] despised and never invited
[1:53:41] back they're that kind of
[1:53:43] men that do just exactly what God tells
[1:53:47] them he begins with 12
[1:53:52] Simon Andrew James Ze John Philip phip
[1:53:59] barom Thomas Thomas Matthew
[1:54:03] thean James
[1:54:06] lius Simon the
[1:54:09] Canaanite and Judas scariot and to all
[1:54:13] 12 he gives a gift of healing and to
[1:54:17] preach the gospel
[1:54:20] including Judas because gifts and
[1:54:24] callings are without
[1:54:27] repentance and Judas had a role to
[1:54:36] play and that
[1:54:38] role had been spoken of since the
[1:54:41] beginning in the Old
[1:54:44] Testament remember the Book of
[1:54:46] Ruth when Boaz was going going to
[1:54:51] redeem
[1:54:52] Naomi but to redeem
[1:54:54] Naomi he had to take Ruth to
[1:54:59] wife then Boaz finds
[1:55:02] out that Naomi has a nearer Kinsman than
[1:55:08] him Boaz a type of
[1:55:11] Christ and that and that nearer
[1:55:14] Kinsman represents the
[1:55:17] devil because we're all born in sin
[1:55:20] shaped in
[1:55:22] iniquity all come to this world speaking
[1:55:25] lies we're in a high bread flesh
[1:55:29] body the body is a nearer
[1:55:39] kin so Boaz can't do the work of
[1:55:44] redemption he has to address this
[1:55:48] problem and he calls forth a
[1:55:52] meeting and in that
[1:55:55] meeting he has to call by by the
[1:55:58] tradition of the
[1:56:00] elders he must call 10 Elders to be
[1:56:05] Witnesses he has to be
[1:56:07] present and then this other
[1:56:13] man 12 of
[1:56:16] them and when Boaz
[1:56:20] tells this other
[1:56:23] Kinsman will you take
[1:56:25] Naomi to be your
[1:56:28] wife and thus redeem all of
[1:56:31] eliminex air to all this
[1:56:35] land sure I'll do that he's got a lot of
[1:56:39] land Naomi's old she'll be dead soon I
[1:56:44] don't have to deal with her no more and
[1:56:46] I get the land I'll I'll do it
[1:56:50] he says but in order to have Naomi you
[1:56:54] must take Ruth to
[1:56:57] wife he goes a
[1:57:00] gentile nah I don't do
[1:57:03] that I can't do that I won't do
[1:57:07] it I'm not able to do that he said I I'm
[1:57:11] not a
[1:57:13] redeemer Bo says I am I'm able both to
[1:57:18] redeem
[1:57:21] Israel and a gentile bride
[1:57:24] Ruth I have the power I have the
[1:57:28] means I have the ability I have the love
[1:57:33] to stand in the bridge for
[1:57:35] both a gentile bride and a Jewish church
[1:57:40] I'll redeem them
[1:57:43] all so in this meeting of
[1:57:46] 12 one of them was a devil
[1:57:50] and one was a
[1:57:52] redeemer in the days of Ruth we fast
[1:57:55] forward to this
[1:57:57] day there's
[1:58:00] 12 one of them was a
[1:58:03] devil one was a
[1:58:06] redeemer a type a shadow a metaphor
[1:58:12] unfolding sometimes you read something
[1:58:13] in the
[1:58:14] Bible and we think
[1:58:17] wowow this isn't written in anywhere in
[1:58:19] the
[1:58:22] Bible just wait keep putting commas
[1:58:26] you'll find the pattern of God's
[1:58:29] word Genesis to
[1:58:33] Revelations but when you can see the
[1:58:35] pattern of God's
[1:58:38] word in your life then you're really
[1:58:41] seeing
[1:58:42] something cuz then you're
[1:58:45] seeing your
[1:58:47] Change Daily
[1:58:49] every hour every
[1:58:52] minute then you can say you know
[1:58:55] what I can be a better
[1:58:58] father you know what I can be a more
[1:59:02] patient mom you know what we can set our
[1:59:06] house in
[1:59:08] order because in this womb is the very
[1:59:12] Gene of
[1:59:13] God been coming down all the way from
[1:59:18] Abraham and where did the gene finally
[1:59:21] rest that brought forth a
[1:59:24] man perfect man in the womb of little
[1:59:28] Mary is where that Jee finally
[1:59:32] rested you're that little Mary this
[1:59:34] morning Jesus Christ in
[1:59:37] you of
[1:59:40] Glory
[1:59:44] hallu chapter
[1:59:46] 10 he chooses a Ministry
[1:59:51] and then he tells them what they're
[1:59:52] going to go
[1:59:54] through he tells them where to
[1:59:57] go to these
[2:00:00] Apostles verse six but go rather to the
[2:00:03] lost sheep of the House of
