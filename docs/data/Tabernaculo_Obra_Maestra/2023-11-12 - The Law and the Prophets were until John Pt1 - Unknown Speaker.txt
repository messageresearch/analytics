Dallas Fort Worth and our brother Ser Hernandez herandez so they'll each have be ministering for us a couple of day a couple of services and we'll give you more information as uh as that as those dates come closer um brother Cosman was with us down in Congo Africa he was a great blessing to the people there we had a great time of Fellowship together well we had to we were in Congo we were the only English speaking people there though there is some brethren that spoke English but the most of the folks either speak the uh uh French or they speak their dialect lingala so um but we look forward to those Services coming up and we sure and we're sure these men of God will be a blessing to all of you and we've got with us this morning also a gentleman uh a friend a brother in Christ and who we've invited and he was able to come this morning and we we're sure he'll be a blessing to you also and uh our brother Dennis mcgi Dennis McGary from down in Flagstaff AR FL his wife Sister Louise also came and we're happy to see you here with us so brother Dennis if you'll come at this time and uh as we all stand to our feet and uh we invite our brother Dennis to come and share all that's in his heart um and there is we don't have a time limit we think each man ought to be led of the spirit and if the spirit tells him to stop in a half hour that's what it is but if the spirit keeps leading him and takes him to three hours who are we to argue with the Holy Spirit uh and uh we're sure that the brother's LED of the spirit this morning and the words he has for us will be words of life so uh the Lord bless you all this morning I forgot to mentioned to brother Dennis he'd be speaking with an interpreter but but uh I know he's accustomed to that that's nothing new for him so with that said brother Dennis if you'll come at this time and share with us all that God's put on your heart and uh and bless our hearts bless God bless you this morning it's nice to be in the church house this morning to Fellowship around the things of the Lord every good and perfect gift comes from the father above and we're in his house this morning the scripture came to my mind this morning where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty so we're believing that we can experience that Liberty that we have in and so if you'd like to turn in your Bibles this morning just appreciate the invitation to be here uh we'd like to read from The Book of Leviticus and the 25th chapter we like to read from the 47th verse and if the Lord would help us this morning we we'd like to speak on God's free man God's free man verse 47 and if if a Sojourner or a stranger wax Rich by thee and thy brother that dwelleth by him wax poor and sell himself unto the stranger or Soldier near by thee or to the stalk of the stranger's family after that he is sold he may be redeemed again one of his Brethren May redeem him either his uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him or any that is nigh of kin under him of his family May redeem him or if he be able he may redeem himself let's bow our heads Heavenly Father love you this morning we trust in you that you will give us something for our soul something that our inner man can live by that we can live our lives for you Lord be in love and be free and we commit this into your hands in Jesus name amen amen amen you may be seated just in a way of introduction I'm Rec calling this morning a a time when my wife and I were going overseas and there was just uh for very unusual that we got to the airport hours early for our flight and we were so early that I decided that I would try to take care of some business and make use of my time and my wife she uh she decided to go through a for a little walk in the airport and she was trusting me to be keeping track of the time and I was trusting her to be track keeping track of the time and it turned out that we having so much extra time we ended up being late for our flight flight there overseas flight and so uh just by God's grace the airline uh put us up in the hotel in in Philadelphia Philadelphia and we had to wait for the flight the next day and so we took that opportunity to go to the places in Philadelphia where this country uh first declared its independence and these uh colonies were under a great oppression from the government of England and they made their grievances known and then they proclaimed that they were going to declare themselves a Sovereign Nation and they and they made this declaration of independence and they said we do this in the sight of God and we're believing that God is going to keep us in this move that we're making but we are declaring that we are no longer going to live under this oppression this oppression is wrong we believe it's out of God's divine order and we believe that God's going to stand with us in this move that we are making and we are declaring that we are independent of England and they rung in Philadelphia they had this Bell made and on that Bell it was called the Liberty Bell and what's written on the Liberty Bell now this in our country is a very famous symbol because that Bell is cracked but it's just one of those symbols of uh of the freedom of of this nation but what many people don't know is what's written on that Bell so we were looking at that Bell and what's written on it is the scripture from uh Leviticus chapter 25 and uh Leviticus 25 and 10 says this and you shall hallow the 50th year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family so that Bell became the symbol of Liberty and at different times they would even take this Bell on tours to remind the people that we're to live in Liberty and so where the spirit of the Lord is there is liberty and Jesus said You shall know the truth and the truth will set you free now so many times when we don't look at the big picture and we're kind of in what we call tunnel vision you know that's the problem with these Maps uh these electronic maps on your phone and things many times you're too zeroed in and you can't get an idea where you're at so you have to zoom out and at the big picture and get orientated again to where I really am and sometimes we allow Satan and our circumstances to to pull us in and we we get zoomed in and zoomed in and we come into this bondage that you know well you know I have these lexes I'm in this situation I I got in this uh uh some kind of [Music] cage maybe it's economics you know maybe it's a spiritual things or but sometimes we're all zoomed in and we think you know what's wrong with me you know why can't I get the victory over myself why can't I get the victory over this situation you know why am I so nervous why am I upset and we were too zoomed in and when we zoom out and see the big picture the scripture we opened with this morning this is the law that God made it's called The Law of redemption so many times we as Believers in the message of the hour we've maybe heard ministers and brother Bram talk about Revelations chapter 5 and the Book of redemption and we're familiar with the thought that in our day and age this book of redemption is is being made known or it's being understood it's being revealed but that book of redemption is this book it's the Bible so it's the things that were always in the Bible but we didn't understand them and we did not consider them and so uh they were a mystery to us and many of these things spoken in the Book of Revelation they they they seem very kind of strange to us kind of mysterious and we might ask in our heart well Lord how does that help me in my everyday living but you know when when I was Catholic they taught us that you're supposed to uh accept this condition they they teach you that you're not supposed to understand what's wrong with this picture in your heart and your love for God you want to understand God you want to understand his purpose you you you in your heart you want to understand his will for your life you you want to understand about the things of God because you want to be a partaker and what a dark idea that it's not for you to understand you know if you want to be spiritual uh you can become a priest or you can become a nun but you know for the congregation you just live any way you want go to the movies go to the ball games but if you really want to know something about God then you join the Catholic priesthood and and and we'll teach you Latin and we'll educate you so there was this mentality that you should not have the hope to understand the things of God but I'm so thankful that God became man so that we could understand it's his desire to have Fellowship he don't want to be a mystery and we're gonna by the grace of God this morning we're going to see this that God had this plan for intimacy for friendship for fellowship and understanding don't come by intellect but it comes by the heart you're going to understand these things in your heart there's going to be a voice inside of you that believes that this is the voice of God to me your heart's going to declare I feel safe here I feel the spirit of the Lord I feel the spirit of Liberty I believe this is God speaking to my heart and nobody's going to shove that down your throat nobody's gonna manipulate your mind and say you you know you have to come under my idea my theology but God put something in your heart that you recognize his voice you recognize his spirit so in our scripture this morning God is setting forth by the mouth of Moses this law now we know when we read the New Testament that Paul said that the law is a school Master it teaches you until you come to a place where you can be a son or daughter of God and walk in the true Liberty that God has in mind for you but it's the it's the law that convicts you of sin it's the it's there are certain laws in you that bring you conviction now conviction and condemnation are two different things condemnation doesn't put you in the hole but it don't give you a ladder but God always gives you a way of escape a way of redemption so this law that God's putting forth here it's part of God's picture but God's developing this picture when God delivered the children of Israel he had a picture in his mind where these people would dwell and in this picture in the Old Testament this was called the promised land it was a a land promised to these people they were in slavery under the Pharaohs of Egypt they were making bricks they were slaves but they were given a promise and Moses God sent Moses to them and he said I'm G to take you out of this bondage and I'm going to bring you to a land that belongs to you that I'm going to give you and every family and every tribe is going to have a a a certain place in this land and he said to this tribe or to this family you're going to have from this mountain here down to this River here and your boundaries are going to be here and here and it was God's picture in his mind where every family and every tribe would be and this other family or there would be the other side of this River and from these mountains to this plane and that's the place that God wanted them to be now that's in the natural that was a physical geographical place that God brought them now we know that God's got a place for us but it's a little greater than just geographical but it in God's mind he's got a place for you to now in this scripture in verse 47 it says if a solder or a stranger wax Rich by thee now the people when they come into this land God says that there's going to be others there not your tribe not your family but you're going to be dwelling among them and if one of these Souljers or strangers wax is Rich and your brother that dwells by him wax is poor now we're only in the first part of the scripture and there's a little mystery here why would God let the stranger wax rich and the believer wax poor and you know you can read the book of Job and those religious guys they're painting the picture to to job and they're saying you know if you live for God and you live clean and you do right God's going to bless you and you're going to prosper and you're going to have abundance and it's going to be wonderful and job would have to say amen amen but then job said back he said look at the wicked over here look they're rich too who filled up their coffers with gold they're out there living in pleasure they don't care nothing about God and they got wealth and riches too so you said a good thing but we can look in life and we can see the other thing is true too oh brothers and sisters you know when we're really honest with ourselves every time that we think we get things figured out we find out that at our best brother bradam told a story like this he said one little Canary got up on the high uh branch in the cage and he started telling the other canaries you know I've been a few places I've been in some nice houses I know a lot about humans let me tell you a few things and he's talking to all the other canaries like you know you're pretty smart Canary and then this professor comes up to the cage and he starts you know talking to this Canary and this car Canary can't understand one thing he why can't he understand because he's a canary and this man's a university professor and he's only got a canary brain and brother Bram says compared to God's Great intelligence compared to what God knows and who God is really we just have a canary brain we're only going to know what God reveals to us John the Baptist when when when he was on the banks of the river and they came to John the Baptist and they said John your disciples now they're following Jesus you know aren't you bothered aren't you upset and John said a man can receive nothing except it be given him of God I'm not even worthy to latch his shoes I baptize in water but he baptizes with the Holy Ghost what he does will change you completely what what what what he can do is give you eternal life I'm I'm not the bridegroom I'm just the friend of the one that has the bride he's the bridegroom the god of our life the Lord of our heart he's the master what do we know except what he'd give us by his grace so we don't know why he allowed this man to wax poor but his neighbor who is not one of the children of [Music] Israel his neighbor this land was not promised to his neighbor this land was promised to him it's his inheritance th sayith the Lord this is the word of the Lord you're going to you're going to possess this land the borders are going to be this the borders are going to be this but this Man waxs Poor he's trying to make's to feed his family things don't go good and he sells out and finally he sells his stuff in one place in the scripture says he even sells out his his family and finally he sells himself into slavery just to eat just to survive but in God's law this man can be redeemed and his possession can now when this land is sold God doesn't want that promised possession to be in the hands of another he wants it to be in possession of the one it was promised to because God's plan was this tribe this family is going to be on this side of the river the whole program can't get mixed out but now this person owns part of it and that person is over here that part and God's not going to allow that so God makes this law of redemption and he says your possession can be redeemed but it has to be by your family because I want this family to be here so it has to be your family that comes and redeems your possession it's got to be either your uncle or somebody of close K to you and so when this close kin comes to redeem your possession they don't buy it for themselves they redeem it back to you they pay the price that you can have your possession so that's this law of redemption and this is this story of the kinsman redeemer that the law is that the one who redeems it must be able to do it they have to have the resources they have to have the ability and they have to be your near of K so there might have been a lot of people there was a lot of Rich guys who would redeem it for you but the law was it has to be your kid so God's showing us something here in this Old Testament picture because God in his thoughts he's developing this picture he sees something now when God sees something and he makes a blueprint when in this blueprint how many is anyone in here in construction when you're building a building you have this set of plans is all rolled up normally is printed with blue ink that's why they call them Blueprints and you see the picture of what what you're going to build here you know it's going to go this way and that way streets over there and here's the building they show a picture from above the the floor plan they have one one page for the plumbing one for the electrical but when God has so man he'll make a blueprint and he got a beautiful plan but maybe the project doesn't get financing maybe the people who are going to build the house you know they die but you know there there's many blueprints at the City of Phoenix that they paid for the permit but the building never got built because the the the vision they couldn't make the vision happen but God's not like that God when he had a plan the it those plans were as real when God thought it as when it came to pass because God's thoughts are Eternal so when God was thinking church when he was thinking of a bride when he thought that down at the end of time I'm going to have a people that love me I'm going to have a people that love my word have for me a bride now God's thoughts are Eternal I want to slow down here a moment in an airport in Germany one time talking to some Muslim men very very friendly very kind man but they were Islamic they were Muslim and so I asked him I said does God know who is going to heaven say you believe in heaven and hell they said yeah of course I said well does God know who is going to heaven and who is going to hell they looked at each other they said well yes he's God he knows everything so I said to them when did he know that when when did he know going to heav he always knew that amen so when God has a picture oh it's a beautiful way to live when you talk about living inty it's what God reveals to your heart that purchases your Liberty and he puts something in your heart to believe his word and you live by that so here God is he has in his mind that I'm going to have a true Christian Church in the end time not Hypocrites not people who you know act one way and have another life on another way no I'm going to have a I'm going to have a church that loves me I'm going to have a bride I'm G to have somebody who has confidence in me that believes in me and that loves me and I got this picture in my mind it's the bride It's The End Time bride did he know who would be in his bride when did he know that when did he know that and if he knew who they were did he know what they would look like amen he know what color hair they have they know they' be tall yeah he knew exactly do you know what kind of complexes they would have did they know they'd be a little bit lazy sorry do you know they' be nervous we have an expression of worry wart I don't know that doesn't translate a worry wart you know when you have a little on your hand a little gr they they call people you know like a worry workart worried but did God know who you were and did he know what you would be like amen yes and when did he know that before the foundation of the world SL before foundation for your Redemption this isn't just you know us in our thoughts we watch the news we watch the ball games you know we look in the newspaper for sales you know where we're going to get the best deal and how we're going to save money look for a better place to rent and we're busy with all that and then we think why am I in this condition I love God so much and I have this Human Condition I think it would serve us very well if we worry less about the shopping maybe leave away the ball games maybe don't watch so much news and start looking at the word of God and who you are and there's a witness inside of you that you're a child of God and everything else clouds that picture but like the prodal son when you come to yourself you come to a little deeper things and you your thoughts become a little deeper and you say Lord what am I doing what is my purpose here I talked to a young lady and she working at a little coffee shop I said how you doing and she said she said well you know I'm going to University and she said I I changed my uh program again I changed my direction I was going to get a degree in this and now I'm I'm going to get a degree in this and she said you know I don't really know what I want to do you know to trying to figure out well what's my purpose you know what what's my Direction but you know if you go a little deeper and you ask a bigger question why did God create man why did why did God have people on the Earth what was his purpose you know he had all the animals and each one got more perfect more advanced and then he came to this masterpiece of man who's a little Creator he's like a little God he he he can even create an atmosphere with his own mouth oh sure your words and how you talk what you profess you live in that world you the world you live in you want to talk about faith confidence in God you want to talk about how good God is and you talk about those things you're going to live in that world little creators look at the works that man does Bridges and skyscrapers spaceships and all this did God create man to do those things God created man for Fellowship he wanted to have someone that he could have communion with he could talk to them they he can talk back he could have affection he could have love Fellowship so when the picture gets you know a little confusing like with this young lady she might be having trouble finding her Direction but if she knows her purpose if she can keep that straight my primary purpose my reason for being is fellowship with him now there's a witness in you that loves you that there's a witness in you that loves him excuse me if you look in the word of God and you see the people who don't care about God and you see the people that do care about God some tells you hey I'm over here but you look at your condition and you say well how can I love God so much and be so tempted and be so tore up sometimes but this condition of this man in the Book of Leviticus that's all of usen you see this thing it's not just you you know having a complex being nervous and you know because you're kind of strange no brother sister you're not strange we were sold out in the Garden of Eden we lost our position because Adam and Eve sold us out and now we were born into this carnal body into this Human Condition and the Bible says that the carnal mind you it it's an enity against God and the carnal mind cannot it will not be subject and it cannot be brought into subjection because it's from that fall in the garden it's part of this flesh we have not only our bodies but we also have this carnal thinking and it's just carnality but we do have a redeemer that can redeem us from this condition to buy us back to the land that God intended us to live him and this promised land for the children of Israel that was a land of rest they were going to rest from that slavery they were going to rest from oppression and they were going to come into this land and that was their resting place but there was a group that wouldn't believe and they died in the wilderness and they didn't enter into God's rest because of unbelief so it doesn't matter how much you pray I'm quoting brother Bram he said you can come here to The Altar and and and it doesn't matter how much you cry and how long you pray if you cannot believe that the blood of Jesus Christ makes you clean all that praying and all that crying will do you no good until you accept by faith that the blood of Jesus Christ has made not 80% clean 98% but the blood of Jesus Christ makes you completely clean in the sight of God and your Redemption is complete and you are placed back in the place that God wanted you to have which is complete Liberty in him no condemnation no shame you know it's an interesting thing I believe people can accept that God forgives them of their sin say you know I'm forgiven but I'm so ashamed but he bore your shame at Calvary he was shamed he was stripped naked in front of those that loved him he was crucified nak brother said the artist put that little cloth there but that wasn't so he bore our shame he bore our sin and our shame and that loosing he loosed us from our sins and when that loosing is complete and it and it brings complete Liberty it's the confidence that we have in a finished work yes the thief at the cross what could he do what works could he do he lived his life without God he he he he was careless he was a criminal but on the cross when the other one was blocking Jesus saying if you be the Christ free yourself and us too and he said don't you fear God he said we're we're getting justly what we deserve this man he's he did nothing but good he opened blind eyes he he healed the leopards he spoke the truth never man spoke like this man he opened blind eyes and he's hanging in there on the cross for what for our Redemption did Jesus hang on the cross and thinking I hope that someone Believes In Me I I hope someone feels sorry for me I hope there's someone that believe no died that he fornew came to redeem those that he he knew you would believe he died for you he died for those that He forew and he came to purchase for this Liberty that we walk in today and you say well brother Dennis you know isn't this just common gospel preaching but you know there's only one gospel there's there not the gospel and then the message no the message is the gospel it's the original gospel brought back to its original state it's the same gospel that became obscured it became buried it became hidden by man's Theology and so now this hidden Mana that's been revealed is the same Mana Jesus said I am the bread of life I the bread that came from Heaven if he that believeth on me he'll never die he'll have eternal life now when you can pull that into your heart and know that you're part of his thoughts and brother R said your thoughts are who you are why we have to we have to re our thoughts and bring every thought into so he he purchased our Redemption and in the book of Hebrews Paul is explaining this this is he became our high priest and he says in verse 14 in the second Hebrews let me stop before I read that scripture there's a lot of mechanisms in the mind of man there's a lot of emotions in our heart there's a lot of voices but no matter what those things are the word of God will not fail his word will not fail so you're going to make it and there's a witness in you that you're his child Paul said he put a spirit in you that cries father and he said that spirit that thing that's in you that's crying out ABA father is a witness that you are a child it's the evidence that you're his child because spirit is abiding in you and every legal voice all your situations and your comp they may scream at you but that voice in you that says ABA father is a witness and he's gonna lose none of his so having begun in grace are we going to be perfected by works over us are we going to defend depend on our mental ability to articulate quotations of brother brandom to to to understand every scripture someone says well you know in the Greek it it it really meant this and are we going to move out of our hearts and into our mind and and attain to something intellectually and this is going to get us to a resurrection and a Rapture if that's so then I have little hope because it's hard for me to cope mentally to to handle things mentally there's too much going on in life I get confused I get confused by my phone I get confused by the computer I I I I I get I get confused about a lot of things in life it's really complicated but I'm not depending on my canary brain I'm depending on Holy Ghost leadership depending on the love of God and when I get confused I just get in my little prayer closet I said Jesus you know who I am you know who I am better than I know you understand me you love me and if you want me to understand this teaching this Doctrine this scripture this quotation the only way I'm going to understand is with your help if you reveal it to me I'm going to understand and if you don't I ain't going to understand Jesus said you cannot understand until you're born again and how can you ever be born again until you die to yourself and die to your own ability and you become a new person in Christ Jesus you put off the old man you put on the new man who's full of faith in the Lord Jesus and his ability to keep his own he said I'm not going to lose one of them going to pull them out of my hand and so now today we're walking in that Liberty amen because we've been redeemed we're God's free Man enemy comes and says what do you mean you're free look at that flesh you're in look at look look look at look at this man that you are it don't matter what I look like my redeemer came verse 14 for then as as the children are partakers of Flesh and Blood Hebrews 2 and4 he also himself likewise took part of the same that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death that is the devil and deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage for verily he took not on him the nature of angels but he took on him the Seed of Abraham wherefore in all things it behooved him to be made like unto his Brethren that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things pertaining to God to make reconciliation for the sins of the people he's the one that reconciles our account you know years ago you used to have this checkbook and in little pieces of paper a little book and they all had numbers it from the bank it's called your checkbook and and everywhere you go it used to be that you write these checks but every time you write a check you're supposed to go in the back of the book and you're supposed to say well I I wrote check number 102 to the grocery store so now I have that much left in my bank account and you know if you're diligent that's what you do and they call that to keep your account reconciled keep it in order but you know you start writing checks and you don't write in the book and everything gets all messed up and maybe one of those checks comes back and they charge you extra you know you don't know what your account and you need somebody to straighten out this mess and you know brothers and sisters we say we believe oh I believe the perfect word I believe you Lord but you know the prophet of God said the the root of every sin is unbelief so we're saying you know I believe the prophet I believe in Jesus I'm following Jesus read my Bible I believe Paul I believe all the word of God glory for and then I see sin in my life I think well where did that come from Brother Ram said it comes from unbelief so you're unbelieving some placewhere I believe sometimes when you get anxious I'm kind of a nervous person you know I want to see what happens what's going to happen next you know I'm just wondering what you know how's this going to be but I don't need to know how how it's going to be believe it's going to be good because God is good and I committed my life to him he's going to take care of me he's going to provide for me and he might give me a mountain or he might give me a Val but I'm in his care my is in him but you know you get nervous you get anxious and then you say something that you shouldn't have said and you say yeah that was wrong but where did that come from well it its roots were back there where when you started getting nervous that's what got you ready to say what you said so the unbelief was back there but he gave us a resting place he redeemed us back to our land and that land is is a place of rest and when we go to him in our prayer closet we can know that he understands what we're going through just have a couple more more points and we'll close remember brother brandham when he went to those Pentecostal meetings Jesus only meetings it was kind of a new believer a young preacher and he saw on the back of these cars and things he said Jes it said Jesus only and he was on a fishing trip and he decided to follow them to these meetings [Music] and you remember the story he was all the preachers had to introduce himself and he was the youngest one on the on the podium and you know he was just in his uh fishing clothes you know and the next day they called for him to bring the morning message preaching and they said you know William brandham Willam we want you to come bring the morning message and he slid down in his chair and he wasn't gonna tell nobody and that colored man next to him there black guy next to him he said do you know where where he is he said sh he said I I'm him but I can't go up there look the way I'm dressed and he said those people don't care how you're dressed get there he said no no no no and then the announcement came again and that black guy said here he is here well anyway you know the story in brother bram's at those meetings and he hears these people speaking in tongues and one man he he's met the two men after church and he said one man was a real Christian real devoted Christian and he said the lord gave him a gift a little wave of knowing he said the Lord give me a way to know and he said this other man he's a total hypocrite living in adultery complete hypocrite and they were both operating the same gift well we know by listening to brother sermons and following his ministry we know what that way of knowing brother brandham had brother brandham had a vision he saw it God showed it to him and he looked at it and then he just spoke what he saw that was brother bram's way of knowing and remember brother Bram said said no one can interpret your dream nobody can tell you what your dream meant unless unless they can tell you what you dreamed I remember I was in Romania you know brother he's coming and he he might look Hispanic but he's not he's Romanian and I spent some time there in Romania they had a lot of these gifts going on people said they had Visions they got a word of the Lord and so I just read this quotation that brother brandham said that the only one that could inter your dream somebody who could tell you what they dream and you could hear a pin [Music] drop and then I got under a little pressure from that to trying to hold to what brother Bram said and I'm reading in my Bible and in the Book of Daniel all these divers they were all in trouble this King was going to he was going to kill them all because this King had a dream that troubled him and all the spiritual guys came and they said oh King you know we can give you the interpretation tell us the dream and we'll give you the interpretation he said all you you guys you're you're a joke you're clowns it's in the Bible he said tell me what I dreamed and then I'll know you have the interpretation he said you guys I'm going to kill you all and they got scared and they said oh well we know a real man of God we better call on Daniel and he'll save our hide because God talks to Daniel so we know that brother Bram had visions and that was his way of knowing where does that put all these guys they give you the idea that they have a way of knowing how do you know did God give you a vision and if he did give you a vision then speak that and we're going to see if it comes to pass or don't you better be at the altar but that gift was one to an age there wasn't anybody else like brother BR and brother Ram said there never would be this thing was not done in a corner this is not some kind of game we're playing it's God's provided way now you don't have to be some great spiritual intellect because it's simple and your heart true but you know sometimes we just get confused because we were born under this carnal this curse from the garden and we get confused and sometimes we don't we we we even get confused who we are what we're about and when I was a child they used to have this television show and they had this panel the these people here maybe four or five people sitting in these chairs behind his desk I don't know who they were maybe celebrities maybe someone from the audience but anyway group and then you had three people over here maybe there was three men here and the game was that one of these three men was say an astronaut but you didn't know which one was so this panel over here they would ask them questions they try to figure out which one was the real astronaut they say well how does it feel to wear a space suit you know how much training do you have to do what do you eat what do you see when you're up there and they're trying to get Clues which one's the real guy so after all these questions then these three guys then they ask the question will the real John Armstrong stand up Armstrong he's famous astronaut and one man start to stand up another man start to stand up and finally the real John Armstrong Armstrong he stands up and he say I am the astronaut I am John Armstrong John Armstrong and sometimes life brings so so many things and you start wondering who you are but if you go in your prayer closet and you get alone with God and that Spirit that's in you that chres ABA father you say Lord Jesus I got to work this out I got to have some aners I need some clarity I need things to be clear will the real child of God please stand up and you know finally you just raise up and you say Jesus you this is the real me you know that this is the man that loves you I'm your child the real of God finally stands and says Lord I I can't be anybody else but who you made me I've had a lot of times in my life going to church hear something it brings a little uncertainty somebody told me you know brother Bram said this you have to see it this way or you're missing it you know you're not believing the real message the message inside the message very complicated too complicated for this Canary brain I just I just I'm just reading and believing just whatever ever he shows me you know we just come under these pressures I remember I came as a young Christian I came to a time in my life and through different influences I was trying to figure out who's wearing the black hats and who's wearing the white hats you know in the old western movies people hadn't watched very much movies they're just simple people and you know they're going to this western movie and you know the the the good guys they're upstanding citizens and these guys over here they I don't know robbed the bank or they're stealing someone else's cattle but you know they get in a big gunfight you know they're G Corrals you know and and they're shooting each other and you know the camera is moving to this one and that one hey you got to know who's who well they made it really simple and they put the good guys in the white hats and the bad guys in the black and you know I got confused in some of this teachings and things and I said Lord you know because the devil he wanted to put black hats on people I loved he want to start operating in a spiritual realm and he want to put black Pat on somebody I know that love the Lord but we don't need to know who's you know we don't need black hats and white hats if we don't understand we put it on the Shelf Lord you you'll work it out Paul said the Lord knows who's his own your heart tells you that hey you know that might be someone else's food but for me right now that's not what I'm hungry for somehow the Lord that his sheep know his voice I remember I got to a place I'm out in this forest and I got my arms around this Ponderosa Pine and I'm hugging that tree and I'm telling the Lord Lord you started me on this path you're going to have to take me the rest of hallelujah amen you know and then years later all this ecological thing about saving nature and they started calling this group of people they called them Tree Huggers I said yeah I know what it is to be a tree hug I remember that place I came to in my life where I had to recommit myself to God but i' like to close this morning tell you about a man he he lived in a farming community in the state of Vermont and his name was William Bentley William Bentley Bentley Bentley and everyone was Dairy Farmers in his community they were all Farmers they got up early they harvested the hay to feed to the cows they got up early and they mil milk the cows and so this required a great commitment everybody had to work hard but this young boy he really loved nature and he get up early in the morning too and he go notice things in nature and uh he got interested in snowflakes and he would catch those snowflakes and then he tried to make a drawing of them before they melted and he was so interested in the pattern of that Crystal and there were so many different patterns so many different kind little book about him is a children's book and his mother and father they spent a great amount of money to buy him a special camera like a microscopic camera and he took a picture of these snow crystals and he did that for years and years and he never saw a snowflake that was the same as another one all his years of studying snow he never saw two snowflakes alike now this man he became quite a photographer and he said you know everyone's worried about how you know that people get their milk get their fresh milk they get it up early to make sure people have their milk he said I get up early too but I want to catch a picture of some of God's creation and he said when I share with the people my pictures I give them something too he said I think they'll get their milk all right it's not no big crime I know everybody around thinks you know you got to work very hard and you got to milk those you got to get with the program but I'm doing what I love and I think I'm giving people something they'll get their milk okay but I'm giving them something else now if you've been a partaker of the love of God if you know what his touch is if he's shown you something in his word if he's made unto known unto you Redemption and real Liberty being free from sin and you got a little something different to share the work will get done out there but you got something to share that they can't give and this little man he said I don't have no shame that I'm different God gave him that gift God made him he didn't bow down to all that social pressure that you you got to milk cows he was God's free man he was doing what he led to do he was sharing something else oh if you could just believe in the finished work and know that you're clean and know that your destination is predetermined that's what predestination means your destination to be with him when he comes when he we're going to be like him and we're going to be where he is when he left his Earthly Ministry I go to prepare a place for you that where I am you may be also than Lord God bless you this morning let's together brother Braham said that Jesus knows how you feel and I think many of us said well God knows all things he's omniscient you know he knows everything from the beginning to the end that's why God knows that's how God knows brother Braham said oh no he said Jesus has another way of knowing he knows because he's been in your shoes am you know the Lord took two of our children home and many people would you know being many of my our brothers and sisters have been very compassionate very kind but when someone else has been through the same thing when they say I know how you feel you know they know amen and brother R said about the man running for president he said if he was a farmer he said all the farmers will vote for that man because he knows what it is to be a farmer and Jesus knows what you're going through because he was in every way tempted as you are he's got another way of knowing because he walked in SHO leather isn't that wonderful that Our Redeemer is our brother isn't that wonderful and he has redeemed us and made us clean what a liberty we should walk in God forgive me of my unbelief let me believe more now than ever and walk I want to be God's free man let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we love you we love what you've done for us Lord we want to live clean because we live because we love you Lord we want to be true because because of this love that we have we know that you'll keep us and we rest in that this morning we thank you for your word thank you for this little time of Fellowship Lord before we leave this place Lord we ask again for your forgiveness if we doubted you if we got worried we made some decisions Lord we shouldn't have made did some things we shouldn't have done Lord we put that under the blood and we accept your forgiveness we believe in forgiveness Lord we believe in rece receiving it and we believe in giving it and we just love you and it's so good to go out these doors this morning being free because you've set us free we commit ourselves aresh to you this morning in Jesus lovely name amen amen amen God bless you this morning thank you brother Dennis gra Dennis uh I believe I believe God has used brother Dennis this morning to speak to our hearts it was a word from God it was the Holy Spirit speaking to us here calling us to be God's free men God's free women a family of God and in our troubles and struggles we say Lord I believe now my unbelief I'm a Son of God I'm a daughter of God now help me to live a life worthy of the Gospel of Jesus Christ Leviticus 25 said after that he is sold after we were sold out in Genesis after we were sold out at the beginning after that we were sold Moses said we may be redeemed again we don't have to stay in bondage and slavery all our lives we have a kinsman redeemer we have a Brethren not only may he redeem us but he did redeem us he paid a price he did not owe we owed a price we could not pay Jesus washed our sins away if we can believe it we can be that bride without spot without wrinkle he created man he created man because he desired a family he desired fellowship with his family and it's true the carinal mind is the enemy of God and that's where we all [Music] began that's why we must be born again I've read it before a poem that God gave me many many years ago and I think it's fitting with what our brother Dennis brought what the Lord put on his heart it goes like this sunrise to sunset I will seek your face knowing the victory that awaits me when I make you first place fasting and prayers where I'll wait for you in my prayer closet where your promises come true it's not a busy place where the multitudes abide it's the secret of your Pavilion where bride and groom reside I know it's the best way and yet I try at Last Only to be defeated by Satan's ugly blast I dedicate myself again to the prayer closet with my friend who listen so attent to every word I say but when I listen quietly to every word he speaks it gives me all the strength I need to hear him say you're free free from the sickness free from the pain free from the lust free from the shame Freedom fre free at last in my little prayer closet When I
