[43:30] course brother Jonathan been praying a
[43:33] long
[43:35] time I almost I almost could feel it
[43:38] when he opened the door in the back he
[43:39] was
[43:42] smiling he usually does
[43:45] smile but it was extra big
[43:48] smile and then of course his wife walked
[43:52] in and the baby and I'm sure he's
[43:55] feeling really good good about
[43:57] that it's been several
[44:00] years I'm sure it's been a real trial
[44:02] for
[44:04] them but all these trials work for our
[44:10] good because we're in a a character
[44:12] building
[44:15] process that's what the Lamb's Book is
[44:17] all
[44:18] about that's what this new testament is
[44:21] all
[44:22] about
[44:23] preparing God preparing his
[44:26] children for a new world a better world
[44:30] a better place an eternal place so we're
[44:34] thankful to God that he finally uh
[44:37] brought this little family here
[44:40] together and we extend our warmest
[44:43] welcome to
[44:45] all I bring also greetings from my
[44:48] brother Raul
[44:51] Gonzalez Pastor in Albuquerque New
[44:54] Mexico
[44:56] where we were there this uh this
[44:59] weekend they were uh having a
[45:02] anniversary
[45:05] meetings and uh and also kind of uh
[45:08] rededicating because they got a a new
[45:09] little church
[45:15] building so uh we were very grateful to
[45:18] see that they have a little nicer place
[45:23] now the brothers the Saints all their
[45:28] greetings we had a good time of
[45:32] Fellowship good food good
[45:36] times but it's always good to be back
[45:38] home again
[45:41] also it was all good and coming back
[45:44] home is
[45:46] good being in care and enjoy our time
[45:48] but we also missed every one of
[45:52] you uh I have a short little video I'd
[45:55] like to play you may be seated for a
[46:00] moment uh sent to us from our brother
[46:05] rapael brother Rafael Caba was going to
[46:08] be with us to
[46:12] ministering on September the 10th 9th
[46:15] and
[46:16] 10th but they had a death in their
[46:20] family I believe it was his W her his uh
[46:24] his wife's uh brother
[46:29] he he was a uh he was a high ranking
[46:33] official I believe a general in the
[46:36] congales
[46:39] Army so it was a very sudden
[46:43] death and uh so they had to go back and
[46:45] they won't be here in
[46:48] September but he did send us a
[46:52] video they've been building a new church
[46:54] there
[46:56] to fit everybody
[47:00] in I believe it may be already finished
[47:03] by
[47:05] now the video is probably a couple of
[47:07] months
[47:10] old and uh they they're going to have
[47:13] also a dedicational
[47:16] service they're in the country of the
[47:19] African country of
[47:24] Congo and they've invited us to come
[47:28] down to to minister at the dedicational
[47:34] services the the the the church
[47:39] name a French name of
[47:46] course it
[47:49] means end time
[47:54] Tabernacle
[47:58] and we like to play this little video
[47:59] for
[48:01] youur us to we could continue in prayer
[48:04] for
[48:06] them and for the completion of the
[48:10] church so the services they the
[48:13] dedicational services are in
[48:16] October October um I think it's the 5th
[48:21] 6th sth and
[48:24] eth and nth three or four
[48:28] days and uh so Lord willing if it's
[48:31] God's will we would be heading up there
[48:33] for these dedicational
[48:38] Services cono is one of the poorest
[48:41] countries in
[48:44] Africa and yet in Congo they have some
[48:47] of the largest
[48:51] churches brother Rafael's church
[48:54] here as uh you see the video unfolding
[48:58] here in
[49:01] plane he has a Congregation of maybe
[49:04] 6,000
[49:07] people that gather every
[49:09] Sunday we we there are some other
[49:12] brothers in in Congo
[49:16] also that we know when we've
[49:18] met Brother Richard diok richarda is in
[49:23] the country of the democratic Republican
[49:25] of
[49:28] Congo there there's two Congos in
[49:32] Africa they are two separate
[49:35] countries they're divided by a large
[49:38] river so brother Rafael is in Congo they
[49:41] call it Congo
[49:45] brail and the other Congo is called
[49:48] Congo
[49:50] kinasa so this is
[49:54] Congo Braille and you can see the type
[49:57] of
[49:59] construction very similar to what you
[50:01] see in uh in
[50:04] Mexico or even South
[50:06] America or we've been down into the
[50:08] islands of uh the Caribbean islands of
[50:12] Trinidad and the style of building is
[50:14] also very
[50:17] similar so they I I say this video is is
[50:20] a few months
[50:24] old and they've just about got it all
[50:26] finished
[50:29] up they it will hold probably five or
[50:32] 6,000
[50:37] people and they've already filled this
[50:39] one
[50:40] up our brother who is in Congo
[50:45] kinasa Brother Richard diok Richard he
[50:49] has a
[50:50] congregation uh that gathers every
[50:53] Sunday of 16
[50:56] ,000 our brother Cabella is also in in
[51:01] in
[51:02] kinasa and I believe he had a
[51:04] Congregation of about
[51:08] 10,000 it's it's very
[51:12] impactful to be in a service and in
[51:15] their worship
[51:17] Services of course the colored people
[51:20] they they they they worship
[51:24] freely
[51:26] and as I said the Congo is of one of the
[51:28] poorest countries in all of
[51:33] Africa so it's not like they have any
[51:36] anywhere to go after service is
[51:40] over so their services can last three
[51:43] four five six hours in
[51:48] length because it's really their whole
[51:52] lives and and uh so there's a a great
[51:55] sincerity amongst the
[51:58] people and despite the fact of how poor
[52:02] the country
[52:03] [Music]
[52:07] is yet the people are very
[52:11] giving and they they really give of
[52:14] their need and not what they have
[52:19] extra for for they in a country like
[52:22] this you're the average person doesn't
[52:25] have have a lot
[52:29] extra the little they make is what they
[52:31] need to live
[52:34] on and yet they they give of
[52:37] that it was just like the woman that
[52:40] that gave a in the parable of
[52:45] Jesus and she gave a might she gave a
[52:49] penny maybe it
[52:52] was and and Jesus said she gave more
[52:54] than than
[52:57] all because she gave of what she needed
[53:00] to live
[53:01] on not of what was
[53:04] excess not of extra money that she
[53:08] had that she goes every Friday and uses
[53:11] to go to the restaurant
[53:13] with but these people give they give
[53:16] their
[53:18] all and and uh and and they and they
[53:21] give from what they from what they have
[53:23] need of even to live on
[53:27] so if it be the Lord's
[53:29] will uh these these Services take place
[53:33] the first week in
[53:37] October we had been invited before to go
[53:40] to
[53:42] Congo which was uh quite a few years
[53:45] back maybe oh five six seven years
[53:49] ago and uh we weren't there some
[53:52] circumstances didn't allow us to go then
[53:58] but if it's the Lord's will we we'd like
[54:00] to be there this time
[54:02] and fellowship there with some old
[54:07] friends we have been to Africa
[54:11] before but we were down in the southern
[54:14] tip of
[54:15] Africa which is the country of South
[54:19] Africa we were invited then a few years
[54:22] just before Co I think it was
[54:26] and and we ministered about six services
[54:30] for some Easter
[54:31] [Music]
[54:34] meetings there in just outside of
[54:36] Johannesburg South
[54:40] Africa and we had a wonderful time with
[54:43] God's people
[54:46] there and and Believers from all
[54:48] different parts of Africa had
[54:52] come from Congo from South Africa
[54:55] uh from the different countries that
[54:57] border South
[55:01] Africa and uh we had a great time there
[55:03] with all the
[55:05] saints but it is a long and tiring
[55:09] trip the the trip to South Africa the
[55:12] flying time one
[55:15] way is probably about 20 22 24
[55:22] hours and the trip one way to Congo is
[55:25] about 30 to 36
[55:29] hours so it makes me
[55:33] think because we've been on long trips
[55:37] before but but never at 68 years of
[55:41] age but we we know it will be a
[55:46] blessing and uh so we're looking forward
[55:49] to God's
[55:52] Will and to be there with the Saints
[55:54] there in in
[55:57] Congo um Congo is a French speaking
[56:02] country so I would be speaking through
[56:04] an
[56:07] interpreter when we were in France a few
[56:10] years
[56:11] back preaching in Paris
[56:15] France our brother Abel mango went with
[56:19] us so he was our interpreter then back
[56:22] then so there is a brother brother here
[56:25] that lives in
[56:27] Phoenix and he's ministered for us
[56:34] hereos and um he he might be going to be
[56:38] the interpreter but I'm sure they have
[56:42] others but uh we pray that uh he would
[56:45] be able to make
[56:47] it he's an excellent
[56:50] interpreter from uh from the from French
[56:53] to English
[56:55] so we're praying that uh if we if God
[56:58] opens his doors to be
[57:01] there that that brother Joshua could
[57:04] also make it and be there with
[57:08] us we thank you all for coming
[57:13] tonight and as we'll stand with to your
[57:16] feet and uh we'll read the word of
[57:23] God
[57:26] brother Bram used to
[57:28] say he says he says it's customary to
[57:32] stand uh when when when when the when
[57:36] they raise up the
[57:40] flag and we put our hands to our hearts
[57:42] and we pledge
[57:47] allegiance whether whether it be to the
[57:49] United States or whatever country you're
[57:53] from when I was a young boy in a
[57:56] elementary
[57:57] school every morning
[58:02] began there would be a flag hanging in
[58:04] the corner of the
[58:06] room and they would stand all us
[58:09] children
[58:10] up and we all put our hands on our
[58:13] hearts and we would recite the pledge of
[58:16] the
[58:21] allegiance and to to to the nation
[58:26] and to its people to The Republic and it
[58:30] was done every single
[58:32] day every morning I don't think that's
[58:35] practiced
[58:38] anymore but there's a lot of things that
[58:40] were allowed in school when I was a
[58:44] child that aren't allowed
[58:46] anymore but a prophet would
[58:48] say we we stand and put our hands in our
[58:51] hearts to to a nation
[58:57] how much more should we not
[59:00] stand when we read our Bibles and pledge
[59:04] our
[59:05] hearts to the Lamb of God turn with me
[59:09] to Luke
[59:12] Chapter turn with me to to Matthew
[59:14] chapter
[59:18] 11 and verse
[59:22] 7 Matthew 11
[59:25] starting with verse
[59:26] 7 and it reads like
[59:29] this and as they departed Jesus began to
[59:33] say in the unto the multitudes
[59:35] concerning
[59:40] John what went ye out into the
[59:42] Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the
[59:48] wind and what went ye out to see a man
[59:51] clothed in soft
[59:53] rment
[59:56] behold they that wear soft rment soft
[59:59] clothing are in King's
[1:00:03] houses but what went you out to see a
[1:00:07] prophet yes and I say unto you and more
[1:00:10] than a
[1:00:11] prophet for this is he of whom it is
[1:00:15] written behold I send my messenger
[1:00:18] before thy
[1:00:20] face which shall prepare thy way before
[1:00:23] thee
[1:00:25] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:00:29] now for your word is
[1:00:32] truth your word sets us
[1:00:35] free your word changes Our
[1:00:38] Lives your word makes us better
[1:00:42] husbands and better wives and better
[1:00:45] sons and better daughters Lord It's Your
[1:00:48] word that you we
[1:00:50] want in our hearts Quicken it to us Lord
[1:00:55] and Lord help us to believe every
[1:00:58] word we ask all this in Jesus
[1:01:01] name amen amen you may be
[1:01:07] seated we've been preaching on a little
[1:01:13] series and as you know we had entitled
[1:01:16] it the pale the the the white horse
[1:01:21] rider in the Days of Elijah
[1:01:25] and the pale horse
[1:01:27] rider in the Days of
[1:01:30] Elijah and you might ask well which one
[1:01:32] is
[1:01:33] it and I would say it's both can we we
[1:01:38] get this this
[1:01:40] phrase from The Book of
[1:01:42] Revelations in chapter six where it
[1:01:45] begins when the lamb opened one of the
[1:01:49] seals The Book of Revelations the book
[1:01:51] of
[1:01:53] prophecies end time
[1:01:56] prophecies and and not everything in the
[1:01:59] Book of
[1:02:00] Revelations is in the future to
[1:02:03] happen but many of the visions that John
[1:02:06] saw for he was the prophet that saw
[1:02:09] these
[1:02:10] visions and God had him to write them
[1:02:13] down but many of the things that the
[1:02:16] Visions he
[1:02:18] saw were already
[1:02:20] passed they were history they they were
[1:02:24] they already
[1:02:25] happened and some of the things that he
[1:02:28] saw that he wrote in
[1:02:32] symbols happened in the day that he
[1:02:36] lived so the Book of
[1:02:39] Revelations was a book of things
[1:02:42] past was a book of things
[1:02:45] present and was a book of things
[1:02:48] future and even today it's still a book
[1:02:52] of things
[1:02:53] past but now much of This Book of
[1:02:57] Revelations almost all is is
[1:03:02] history some of it is present
[1:03:06] tense and some of it is in the
[1:03:10] future and in the very near
[1:03:13] future and and
[1:03:17] uh this first
[1:03:20] seal that
[1:03:22] began is really the Bible uses the term
[1:03:25] the Seven
[1:03:28] Seals but what Seven Seals are in This
[1:03:31] Book of
[1:03:33] Revelation it was seven parts of one
[1:03:37] Divine Plan of
[1:03:39] Redemption for the Jewish
[1:03:42] people and for a gentile
[1:03:46] people and where it begins here on these
[1:03:49] Seven
[1:03:51] Seals is in Revelations chapter
[1:03:56] six the Bible says and I saw when the
[1:03:58] lamb opened one of the
[1:04:02] seals so the lamb here in this
[1:04:05] prophecy is Jesus Christ if you'll
[1:04:08] remember in the Book of
[1:04:11] John I believe it's in chapter
[1:04:13] three the Gospel of
[1:04:16] John John is with two of his
[1:04:19] disciples and he sees Jesus
[1:04:22] coming and he said Behold the Lamb of
[1:04:26] God you see John was a was a
[1:04:30] messenger John John was a
[1:04:33] forerunner to the first coming of
[1:04:36] Christ John was was was a prophet of
[1:04:40] God but he was a whole new line of
[1:04:45] prophets John was going to be not under
[1:04:48] the old
[1:04:50] order of prophets and priests in the
[1:04:53] law but John would be a
[1:04:56] prophet a
[1:04:58] messenger uh under no
[1:05:00] law introducing the grace of
[1:05:04] God introducing great changes that would
[1:05:06] come to
[1:05:09] Israel the ministry of
[1:05:11] John would change everything about how
[1:05:15] Israel worshiped
[1:05:18] Jehovah first of all John would bring in
[1:05:22] and Usher in the new name
[1:05:26] it would no longer be
[1:05:28] Jehovah the Jews never even mentioned
[1:05:31] the name of
[1:05:33] God that the name of God to the Jews
[1:05:36] couldn't be
[1:05:38] pronounced in the Old Testament even
[1:05:42] today the Orthodox
[1:05:44] Jews when if if you're in contact with
[1:05:48] one and they send you a text speaking
[1:05:52] about God they they don't even spell the
[1:05:55] word god
[1:05:57] completely spell g capital G they leave
[1:06:02] an
[1:06:03] underline no letter and then they spell
[1:06:07] d because for them just to mention the
[1:06:12] name and and to take the risk of saying
[1:06:15] it
[1:06:17] wrong under the law is
[1:06:20] blasphemy even yet today but so that's
[1:06:23] why John's
[1:06:24] ministry as a prophet to
[1:06:27] Israel was so
[1:06:29] controversial because he was going to
[1:06:31] bring total
[1:06:32] change to the way Israel would
[1:06:37] worship he was he was going to tell
[1:06:40] Israel that they could now approach this
[1:06:44] God the Jews didn't
[1:06:46] believe that a man could approach God it
[1:06:50] all had to be through the high
[1:06:53] priest had to be in that secret little
[1:06:57] room called the holies of holies and the
[1:07:00] people never entered
[1:07:02] there the high priest alone would
[1:07:06] enter and he had to be dressed a certain
[1:07:09] way he would have bells on the Hem of
[1:07:11] His
[1:07:14] Garment and when he those bells had to
[1:07:17] make a certain
[1:07:20] tone accepted when he would walk behind
[1:07:23] the
[1:07:25] the bells every time he moved when he
[1:07:27] went behind the
[1:07:31] Cur let them know that he was still
[1:07:35] alive but when they could no longer hear
[1:07:37] the
[1:07:39] bells they know that he had crossed the
[1:07:43] line and and he had offended
[1:07:46] Jehovah that done something
[1:07:48] contrary to how Moses had taught them to
[1:07:52] enter so on top of all the bells on
[1:07:55] their
[1:07:58] garment and and the robes that they
[1:08:02] wore they were covered from neck to
[1:08:06] toe nothing could show of their
[1:08:10] bodies but when the bells were
[1:08:13] silent behind the veil then they know
[1:08:16] that God had struck the high priest
[1:08:21] down he
[1:08:22] also was a rope tied to his
[1:08:29] foot so that so that if the bells didn't
[1:08:33] move ring
[1:08:35] anymore then they could pull him out
[1:08:39] of of the holies of holies without
[1:08:42] anyone entering
[1:08:44] in for it was death for anyone to
[1:08:48] enter but John brought a
[1:08:51] change where he dared the people
[1:08:55] now when he said from to the
[1:08:58] poorest to the most
[1:09:00] vile he was preaching that that that the
[1:09:03] people could now enter
[1:09:05] in John was preaching an
[1:09:09] invitation that you could walk and talk
[1:09:12] with Jehovah God oh it was so
[1:09:16] contrary everything was changing from
[1:09:19] the Old Testament under the law to the
[1:09:22] New Testament
[1:09:24] a new book was being written a new
[1:09:27] testament was being written this this
[1:09:30] book was the Lamb's Book of
[1:09:32] Life and only the lamb could open
[1:09:35] this and and John was the prophet who
[1:09:38] would be
[1:09:40] introducing the Lamb of God to the
[1:09:43] people of God oh it shook that
[1:09:48] denomination and as you know they
[1:09:50] couldn't accept the change
[1:09:54] John was bringing change after
[1:09:57] change that was what the prophecy
[1:10:00] said we've read it before in Isaiah 40
[1:10:04] turn with
[1:10:06] me it was a
[1:10:08] prophecy
[1:10:11] foretelling the coming of of this
[1:10:15] Prophet The Coming of this
[1:10:18] Forerunner John the Baptist who would
[1:10:22] introduce the Lamb of
[1:10:25] God Isaiah 40 verse
[1:10:28] one Isaiah prophesying about John the
[1:10:33] Baptist this Mighty
[1:10:36] Prophet but his name isn't written in
[1:10:40] here 600 years
[1:10:43] later you'd have to get a
[1:10:46] revelation that the ministry of John was
[1:10:50] the prophecy of
[1:10:52] Isaiah
[1:10:57] John the Baptist's name is not in this
[1:11:03] prophecy and yet the Bible identified
[1:11:11] him but the only way you knew it the
[1:11:14] only way they believed it
[1:11:18] here is they saw his testimony they saw
[1:11:21] his ministry they saw was a
[1:11:26] prophet the in Isaiah 40 And1
[1:11:29] says God speaking to his
[1:11:32] people Comfort ye Comfort ye my people
[1:11:35] saith your
[1:11:37] god listen to the grace of God in this
[1:11:43] prophecy it's not a
[1:11:46] rebuke it's not
[1:11:48] legalism it's grace and mercy being
[1:11:52] extended vers two speak ye comfortably
[1:11:56] to Jerusalem and cry unto
[1:12:01] her that her Warfare is
[1:12:05] accomplished it was a time when God was
[1:12:08] going to bring peace to their
[1:12:11] hearts peace to their lives because as
[1:12:14] we know in the days of John the
[1:12:17] Baptist it was a wicked time it was a
[1:12:21] time Israel was in slavery to Rome
[1:12:26] physically literally they were at War
[1:12:30] but God saying right here speak ye
[1:12:33] comfortably to
[1:12:34] Jerusalem WR unto her that her Warfare
[1:12:37] is
[1:12:38] accomplished listen to this that her
[1:12:41] iniquity is
[1:12:43] pardon you all know what iniquity
[1:12:47] is Iniquity is when you
[1:12:51] know the right thing to do
[1:12:54] do and you choose to do the wrong thing
[1:12:58] yet it says that her iniquity is
[1:13:01] pardoned for she has received of the
[1:13:03] Lord hands double for all her
[1:13:07] sins it was a time of grace and mercy
[1:13:11] being extended to
[1:13:14] Israel because what John would extend to
[1:13:19] them would be the Lamb's Book of
[1:13:22] Life John would extend to them would be
[1:13:25] the new name of God what John would
[1:13:28] extend to
[1:13:29] them was to point to a
[1:13:32] man Jesus of nazare and say behold this
[1:13:37] man is now your
[1:13:41] lamb verse three the voice of him that
[1:13:45] crith in the
[1:13:47] wilderness this is John prepare ye the
[1:13:50] way of the
[1:13:52] Lord listen listen to this his ministry
[1:13:55] what he's going to do make straight in
[1:13:58] the desert a highway for our
[1:14:01] God number one John would do
[1:14:06] this every Valley shall be
[1:14:11] exalted number two Every Mountain and
[1:14:14] Hill shall be made
[1:14:16] low number
[1:14:18] three then the Crooked shall be made
[1:14:21] straight number four and the rough
[1:14:24] places
[1:14:25] plain five
[1:14:27] things was the was the five things of
[1:14:30] John's
[1:14:34] Ministry and yet as you know five
[1:14:38] represents the grace of
[1:14:40] God it's his number of
[1:14:44] Grace and as a young
[1:14:46] man I took this
[1:14:49] prophecy believing this was
[1:14:51] John and I went to the New
[1:14:54] Testament and read the life of John the
[1:14:58] Baptist and the things that he
[1:15:01] did and as I looked at
[1:15:03] it I said the voice of him that crith in
[1:15:06] the
[1:15:08] wilderness prepare you the way of the
[1:15:11] Lord then it says make straight in the
[1:15:14] desert a highway for our
[1:15:17] God and the more I read the New
[1:15:21] Testament the less I could see
[1:15:24] that John had done any work on a
[1:15:28] highway that he had made any road
[1:15:32] straight then it said every Valley shall
[1:15:34] be
[1:15:37] exalted I couldn't see where John had
[1:15:39] done that
[1:15:40] either Every Mountain and Hill shall be
[1:15:43] made
[1:15:45] low and I look at how the land is in
[1:15:50] Israel as you know Jerusalem is in a
[1:15:54] Valley surrounded by high
[1:15:58] mountains and it says every Valley shall
[1:16:00] be
[1:16:03] exalted I couldn't see where he did that
[1:16:06] either and every mountain and Hill shall
[1:16:09] be made low I couldn't see
[1:16:11] it and I said well let's go to the next
[1:16:14] one and the Crooked shall be made
[1:16:18] straight and the rough place is
[1:16:22] plain and I couldn't see where John had
[1:16:24] done any of
[1:16:26] this and he didn't literally but
[1:16:31] prophetically he did
[1:16:33] everyone because the language is in
[1:16:37] symbol the language is
[1:16:39] allegory it's not
[1:16:42] literal I want you to see what each one
[1:16:44] of these things
[1:16:46] were to make straight in the desert a
[1:16:50] highway for our
[1:16:52] God
[1:16:54] even to do that
[1:16:56] literally even to do it here in the
[1:16:58] valley we
[1:17:00] live that would bring a great
[1:17:03] change every Valley shall be
[1:17:06] exalted oh to to literally take a valley
[1:17:09] and make it a
[1:17:12] mountain that would also be a great
[1:17:15] change to take every Mountain around
[1:17:19] Jerusalem and heal and bring it down low
[1:17:23] that would be a great and tremendous
[1:17:25] change if they
[1:17:28] could but they didn't even have the
[1:17:30] equipment to do that in that
[1:17:33] day and the Crooked everything crooked
[1:17:36] made
[1:17:38] straight would be a great change and the
[1:17:41] rough place is
[1:17:43] plain think of everything that's
[1:17:47] rough roads mountains
[1:17:51] rocks build roofs
[1:17:55] and he would make everything
[1:17:58] rough make him
[1:18:01] complain I said
[1:18:03] Lord this is
[1:18:06] written in
[1:18:08] symbols it's not it doesn't have a
[1:18:10] literal
[1:18:12] interpretation and as I looked at it
[1:18:15] more I realized every one of
[1:18:18] these things that the voice of him that
[1:18:21] crith in the wilderness would do
[1:18:26] to make something straight a desert in
[1:18:28] the
[1:18:30] highway it was change for every Valley
[1:18:33] to be
[1:18:35] exalted it was a change for Every
[1:18:38] Mountain and Hill to be made
[1:18:39] low it was a change the Crooked to be
[1:18:43] made straight it was a change for the
[1:18:46] places to be made
[1:18:48] plain it was a change so what was this
[1:18:51] ministry
[1:18:53] of this Forerunner at the first coming
[1:18:55] of Christ who was into who was to go
[1:18:58] introduce Jesus
[1:19:00] Christ as the Lamb of God as the king of
[1:19:03] the Jews what was his ministry of John
[1:19:07] doing it was going to bring to
[1:19:10] Isel five things change change change
[1:19:14] change change change he wanted to bring
[1:19:17] change to
[1:19:18] Israel no more under the
[1:19:21] law no more the killing of animals over
[1:19:24] and over
[1:19:26] again once and for all the greatest
[1:19:30] change to introduce
[1:19:33] Jesus he would be the lamb that would
[1:19:37] wash away your sin he would be the lamb
[1:19:41] that take the curse away from
[1:19:43] you what was that
[1:19:46] curse we're born in sin shaped in
[1:19:49] iniquity we come into this world
[1:19:54] we're born through the sexual desire of
[1:19:56] our mother and
[1:19:59] father that's the curse it wasn't so in
[1:20:02] the
[1:20:03] beginning God didn't mean it to be that
[1:20:05] way that's what the woman fell into
[1:20:10] Eve and it brought the whole human race
[1:20:12] into this
[1:20:14] curse that's why we must be born
[1:20:19] again because a natural birth
[1:20:24] the natural birth is the
[1:20:26] curse but to be born again of the spirit
[1:20:29] of
[1:20:30] God oh that's the
[1:20:32] lamb washing our sins
[1:20:35] away causing us to be born
[1:20:38] again that we can be
[1:20:41] baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:20:44] and begin a new life
[1:20:47] in oh hallelujah hallelujah the new
[1:20:51] order the new min
[1:20:54] Ministry prophets and priests in the
[1:20:57] law but John was not a prophet under the
[1:21:01] law John's prophetic
[1:21:05] Ministry was under a new book John's
[1:21:08] prophetic
[1:21:09] Ministry was under a new
[1:21:12] testament John's prophetic
[1:21:14] Ministry was going to change
[1:21:17] everything about how Israel worshiped
[1:21:20] their
[1:21:21] God they were in
[1:21:23] legalism the Apostle Paul said the law
[1:21:26] made it made no one
[1:21:29] perfect but the ushering in of a new
[1:21:34] hope the ushering in of a new
[1:21:37] testament the fullfillment of
[1:21:40] scriptures of Isaiah

[1:22:39] sin that that you and I would become his
[1:22:44] righteousness a change was
[1:22:46] prophesied in the prophetic
[1:22:49] ministries of John the Baptist who was
[1:22:52] to introduce
[1:22:53] Messiah the lion of the tribe of Judah
[1:22:56] the Lamb of God and a prophet is
[1:23:00] required and more than a prophet Matthew
[1:23:04] [Music]
[1:23:06] 11:10 for this is he of whom it is
[1:23:10] written behold I send my messenger
[1:23:12] before thy
[1:23:14] face which will shall prepare thy way
[1:23:17] before
[1:23:19] thee John was a
[1:23:21] forerunner to the first coming of Christ
[1:23:24] John had more than one ministerial
[1:23:28] gift he was a messenger to a new
[1:23:33] dispensation he was a
[1:23:35] forerunner to introduce Christ at his
[1:23:38] first coming and he was a prophet to the
[1:23:41] nation of is and he was the order of a
[1:23:45] new prophetic
[1:23:47] Ministry John didn't come to introduce
[1:23:50] Moses in the
[1:23:51] law
[1:23:53] no no John came anointed to introduce
[1:23:56] Jesus
[1:23:58] Christ and the name of Jesus Christ
[1:24:01] wasn't written in the Old
[1:24:03] Testament and the name of John the
[1:24:06] Baptist wasn't written in the old
[1:24:09] test it would have to be a
[1:24:13] revelation that when they came on the
[1:24:15] scene you as a child of
[1:24:18] God you could catch that
[1:24:21] revelation God would reveal it to
[1:24:24] you remember
[1:24:26] Peter Jesus was there with the
[1:24:29] disciples and he said unto them who do
[1:24:32] men say that I the son of man
[1:24:37] am the gospel of
[1:24:40] Matthew some of the disciples said some
[1:24:42] say you're
[1:24:44] Jeremiah one of the prophets he asked
[1:24:47] Peter but who do you say that I
[1:24:50] am Peter said th are the
[1:24:53] Christ that means Messiah that means God
[1:24:56] made flesh Thou Art the Christ the son
[1:25:00] of the Living God Jesus said Peter Upon
[1:25:05] This Rock I'll build my church and the
[1:25:08] Gates of Hell won't Prevail against
[1:25:11] it flesh and blood has not revealed this
[1:25:14] you my father which is in heaven you
[1:25:17] heard from Heaven Peter and this is a
[1:25:21] revelation Holy Spirit has given
[1:25:24] you who I am oh we need
[1:25:28] Revelation about God's
[1:25:31] word recognize our day our
[1:25:35] message Matthew
[1:25:38] 111 verely I say unto you among them
[1:25:41] that are born of
[1:25:42] women there has not risen a greater than
[1:25:46] John the
[1:25:47] B not
[1:25:49] withstanding he that is least in the
[1:25:51] Kingdom of Heaven
[1:25:54] is greater than
[1:25:55] thee verse 12 and from the days of John
[1:25:59] the Baptist until
[1:26:01] now the Kingdom of
[1:26:03] Heaven suffers violence and the violent
[1:26:08] taken we've shared it here with the
[1:26:10] church many
[1:26:12] times verse 11 and verse 11 11 and
[1:26:16] 12 and also the the the chapter of
[1:26:20] Matthew 11
[1:26:23] the chapter of Matthew
[1:26:24] 11 is a direct
[1:26:30] fulfillment right out of the Book of
[1:26:33] [Music]
[1:26:34] Revelations this is the Fulfillment and
[1:26:37] the beginning of that first
[1:26:40] seal what is the first
[1:26:43] seal it's part one of seven part so when
[1:26:47] you go and read that book of
[1:26:50] Revelations and you read on the these
[1:26:52] Seven
[1:26:53] Seals just remember say
[1:26:56] this Seven Seals it's seven parts of one
[1:27:01] divine plan of
[1:27:04] restoration of Salvation beginning with
[1:27:08] Jesus in his Earth
[1:27:10] Ministry taking us all the way to the
[1:27:13] end when the Trump of God should sound
[1:27:17] and the dead in Christ shall rise and we
[1:27:20] which are alive and will be caught up
[1:27:23] together in a meeting in the air in the
[1:27:26] second coming and we're living in that
[1:27:30] day the second coming of
[1:27:32] Christ and Matthew 11 was the
[1:27:35] Fulfillment of
[1:27:37] Prophecy the first coming of
[1:27:39] Christ the unfolding of the first
[1:27:43] seal part
[1:27:45] one the ver and 12 and and verse 12 of
[1:27:49] Matthew
[1:27:50] 11 Jesus
[1:27:52] we'll share more
[1:27:54] later but this is the ride of the
[1:27:59] Antichrist this is the white horse rider
[1:28:01] beginning his
[1:28:03] ride Lucifer and it said of this white
[1:28:07] horse
[1:28:09] rider he had a bow in his
[1:28:11] hand but the bow had no arrows and he
[1:28:15] had a crown in his hand he wasn't
[1:28:18] crowned but he had these two things in
[1:28:20] his hand
[1:28:22] it was the ride of the
[1:28:25] Antichrist the
[1:28:27] bow was
[1:28:29] Israel the denominational Church of that
[1:28:33] day and the crown was Pagan Rome and
[1:28:37] both both Israel the
[1:28:40] church and Rome the Pagan
[1:28:43] Nation were in Satan's hands in
[1:28:47] Lucifer's hands and they both worked
[1:28:51] together that day to cry out and say
[1:28:55] crucify
[1:28:57] him that's this coming to pass Matthew
[1:29:01] 11 is Jesus
[1:29:03] declaring that this day that scripture
[1:29:07] was coming to pass Matthew
[1:29:10] 11:13 for all the prophets and the law
[1:29:13] prophesied until
[1:29:17] John in the Book of
[1:29:20] Luke verse 16 and
[1:29:24] 16 it's it's Luke pretty much saying the
[1:29:27] same
[1:29:29] thing and giving witness of
[1:29:31] this of what was spoken in Matthew
[1:29:35] 11:13 and Luke 16 and
[1:29:39] 16 it says the law and the prophets were
[1:29:42] until
[1:29:44] John and many times we think we hear
[1:29:48] that
[1:29:49] statement we say okay okay no more law
[1:29:53] no more
[1:29:54] prophets that's not what the scripture
[1:29:56] is
[1:29:57] saying the law and the prophets
[1:30:00] were since that time the kingdom of God
[1:30:04] is
[1:30:05] preached in other words from this day on
[1:30:09] beginning with John was he a
[1:30:12] prophet Jesus said he
[1:30:15] was so then he
[1:30:17] is so this was a a ministerial change
[1:30:20] for the prophets
[1:30:24] ending the Old
[1:30:26] Testament beginning a new
[1:30:29] testament a New Covenant a new book this
[1:30:33] is this new testament this is the Lamb's
[1:30:36] Book of
[1:30:37] Life because remember we just readel
[1:30:42] 61 and when the
[1:30:44] lamb opened the
[1:30:47] seal when did the lamb do
[1:30:50] this when the the lamb was on the
[1:30:53] earth when this book was getting
[1:30:56] written it was an Unwritten
[1:30:59] book at one time it was just a plan in
[1:31:02] the mind of
[1:31:04] God of how he was going to save
[1:31:07] you but his grace he allowed it to be
[1:31:12] written he used men as scribes to write
[1:31:16] it so that you would have a chance to
[1:31:18] read
[1:31:19] it so he could give you a re
[1:31:23] you could
[1:31:24] recognize the L of God in this day in
[1:31:30] 2023 he's here today
[1:31:33] with he just back 2,000 years
[1:31:37] ago his holy spirit is
[1:31:40] with he said in his word I will be with
[1:31:44] you in you to the ends of the world
[1:31:49] that's a personal promise for you
[1:31:51] tonight
[1:31:53] God rich and
[1:31:58] mercy the law the prophets were until
[1:32:02] John since that time since the time of
[1:32:06] John John would begin preaching the the
[1:32:08] kingdom of
[1:32:10] God and causing every man and asking you
[1:32:13] to press into
[1:32:16] it what was John
[1:32:20] bringing five things
[1:32:23] were the five the Five Points of his
[1:32:26] ministry for Israel that he was going to
[1:32:30] bring Israel John said I'm ordained of
[1:32:35] God to bring you five
[1:32:40] things change change change change
[1:32:44] change nothing will ever be the same in
[1:32:47] your life
[1:32:48] again guess
[1:32:50] what John John was this Elijah
[1:32:54] Prophet that Jesus also called him so
[1:32:57] John wasn't just the voice of one crying
[1:32:59] in the
[1:33:02] wilderness in Isaiah 40 John also
[1:33:05] fulfilled Malachi
[1:33:08] 4 verses five and
[1:33:11] six but he only fulfilled half of
[1:33:14] it because the second half was for the
[1:33:17] second coming of
[1:33:19] Christ and Jesus Christ yesterday today
[1:33:22] and
[1:33:23] for unchanging in all his
[1:33:26] ways then the way he ushered in his
[1:33:29] first
[1:33:32] coming a prophet in the spirit and power
[1:33:35] of
[1:33:37] Elijah then the prophecies tells us that
[1:33:41] at the second coming of Christ that
[1:33:43] there would have to be a
[1:33:45] prophet the spirit and power of
[1:33:47] el to once again remind us
[1:33:52] of all the changes that were
[1:33:54] made for God's people the first coming
[1:33:59] it's not a different
[1:34:00] word same word the
[1:34:03] promises they were lost through
[1:34:06] the were lost when the Roman Catholic
[1:34:09] Church rised
[1:34:11] up took the Bible away from the people
[1:34:15] they had no book to
[1:34:16] read so how did they
[1:34:20] manage they had
[1:34:22] revelation of a plan that was in the
[1:34:25] mind of
[1:34:28] God you see it and today it still takes
[1:34:33] a
[1:34:34] revelation like Peter had and the father
[1:34:38] gave it to him and the father is still
[1:34:42] practicing to get close to his
[1:34:45] children and give you a
[1:34:47] revelation of his Plan of
[1:34:50] Redemption for
[1:34:52] you you see this book is
[1:34:56] personal this book wasn't written for
[1:34:59] for
[1:35:00] groups this book is written to
[1:35:04] individuals and you've got to take and
[1:35:06] reach out by
[1:35:08] faith and say this book is my
[1:35:11] book this Plan of Salvation is my
[1:35:16] plan you've got to own it and make
[1:35:20] it
[1:35:22] what was what was being
[1:35:25] preached Mo Moses and the
[1:35:28] law was about to
[1:35:30] change no more law John had come at the
[1:35:35] end of the Jews
[1:35:38] ages Daniel had spoken that the Jewish
[1:35:40] people had 70
[1:35:44] weeks accomplished unto
[1:35:47] them and at the time of when Jesus came
[1:35:52] those prophetic weeks were counting
[1:35:55] [Music]
[1:35:56] down and when Jesus had
[1:35:59] come there was one week
[1:36:02] left for the Salvation of
[1:36:05] Israel Jesus preached for three and a
[1:36:07] half
[1:36:09] years he fulfilled the first half
[1:36:14] week and when he did Israel
[1:36:18] rejected the Plan of Salvation
[1:36:21] Israel
[1:36:22] rejected the Lamb's Book of
[1:36:25] Life Israel
[1:36:27] rejected
[1:36:29] Redemption and when they did they
[1:36:33] crucified
[1:36:34] him in the midst of the
[1:36:38] week and and God's timetable for Israel
[1:36:46] stopped and the Lamb's Book of
[1:36:48] Life and the Plan of Redemption
[1:36:52] was given to another
[1:36:53] people a gentile people on the day of
[1:36:57] pentec at the cross of Calvary when
[1:37:00] Israel
[1:37:02] rejected this seven seal Plan of
[1:37:05] Redemption then the plan came to you and
[1:37:08] I salvation came to you and
[1:37:11] I then the then then the opportunity to
[1:37:14] be born again came to you and
[1:37:17] I then the
[1:37:20] possibility to live a life worthy of the
[1:37:24] Gospel you and I that's what Israel
[1:37:28] rejected that's what we have received
[1:37:31] and when God takes a little bride off
[1:37:33] this
[1:37:34] Earth who been fully
[1:37:38] redeemed then Jesus messah the Bible
[1:37:41] tells us goes back to
[1:37:44] Israel and he reveals
[1:37:46] himself he appears unto them he shows
[1:37:50] them his hand
[1:37:51] hands they say where did you get
[1:37:54] that in the house of my
[1:37:57] friend then revelation will strike their
[1:38:01] hearts they realize that just Jesus of
[1:38:05] Nazareth it was their
[1:38:07] lord God made flesh it was their savior
[1:38:12] the Bible says to sackcloth and
[1:38:16] Ashes
[1:38:18] weeping understanding what their
[1:38:20] ancestors
[1:38:22] did C the
[1:38:24] Revelation and receive
[1:38:27] Jesus salvation and Redemption for the
[1:38:30] Fig Tree God rich in
[1:38:36] Mercy the law and the
[1:38:38] prophets were until
[1:38:41] John John was the beginning of a new
[1:38:44] ministry a new message and once he came
[1:38:47] out of the
[1:38:49] Wilderness he never went back again
[1:38:51] again as did the Old Testament
[1:38:56] prophets the Old Testament way had
[1:38:59] changed now it was a new testament
[1:39:07] made in Matthew
[1:39:12] 11:14 it says and if you will receive
[1:39:15] it this is Jesus speaking in Matthew
[1:39:19] 11:14 and if if you will receive
[1:39:23] it this is
[1:39:25] Elias which was for to
[1:39:28] come I thought John was a voice crying
[1:39:31] in the
[1:39:33] wilderness he was but now Jesus is
[1:39:36] telling
[1:39:37] us taking us to another
[1:39:41] prophecy identifying John
[1:39:44] again and if you will receive
[1:39:46] it this is Elias which was for to
[1:39:50] come
[1:39:51] Jesus is now including
[1:39:54] John in the scripture of Malachi 4
[1:39:58] and6 for Malachi
[1:40:01] 46 is his first
[1:40:03] coming but it's also his second
[1:40:06] coming just like Isaiah
[1:40:09] 61 verse 1 and two if you'll remember in
[1:40:13] the Book of
[1:40:14] Luke in chapter 4 the Bible says Jesus
[1:40:19] was back in Nazareth
[1:40:22] and he went to the
[1:40:23] synagogue on a day of worship as was his
[1:40:28] custom and when he went into the
[1:40:30] synagogue the Bible tells
[1:40:33] us that the priest handed him the scroll
[1:40:36] of
[1:40:39] Isaiah and Jesus took that
[1:40:42] scroll and he began to unfold that
[1:40:47] scroll and he finally stopped at
[1:40:49] a now remember they didn't have books as
[1:40:53] we have
[1:40:55] today no it was a
[1:40:58] scroll it was a paper that's all rolled
[1:41:02] up it was animal
[1:41:05] skins of some kind and they would write
[1:41:08] messages in there and the Old Testament
[1:41:11] was written like
[1:41:13] that and the book of Isaiah was one long
[1:41:18] scroll that could reach from that wall
[1:41:20] to this
[1:41:21] wall and when they handed Jesus that
[1:41:25] scroll in that scroll that would go from
[1:41:28] wall to wall he knew just where to open
[1:41:32] it
[1:41:33] to he knew just where he wanted to read
[1:41:37] from and he stopped in the prophecy of
[1:41:41] Isaiah
[1:41:42] 61 and he read the first half
[1:41:46] only and he stopped and he said this day
[1:41:50] this
[1:41:53] something that had been written 7 800
[1:41:55] years
[1:41:57] ago that day in the lives of those
[1:42:01] people in that Church of
[1:42:04] Nazareth that day prophecy was becoming
[1:42:09] history oh but they didn't recognize
[1:42:12] their
[1:42:13] day they didn't recognize
[1:42:15] that and Jesus stopped in the middle of
[1:42:19] the verse because the second part was
[1:42:22] for his second coming and Malachi 46 is
[1:42:26] the
[1:42:28] same it's a prophecy of first and second
[1:42:33] coming and what
[1:42:36] divides this
[1:42:38] prophecy is a
[1:42:45] Comm so what would it take to
[1:42:49] understand that in one
[1:42:52] verse his first and second
[1:42:55] coming a
[1:42:57] revelation by the Holy
[1:42:59] Spirit showing you that the
[1:43:02] comma represents a difference of 2,000
[1:43:07] years God rich and mercy in Matthew 11
[1:43:11] Jesus said father I thank
[1:43:16] you that you've hidden these things from
[1:43:18] the wise and
[1:43:19] prudent
[1:43:21] and will reveal it unto
[1:43:23] babies such as would learn he didn't
[1:43:26] mean little
[1:43:29] babies little
[1:43:31] children he meant
[1:43:33] adults who could now be born
[1:43:35] again of the spirit of CH
[1:43:38] Christ and receive spiritual
[1:43:43] understanding of this word of
[1:43:46] God not only had the message
[1:43:49] changed from law to
[1:43:52] Grace John's
[1:43:54] Ministry had changes in it
[1:43:57] also John fulfilled Isaiah
[1:44:00] 40 John fulfilled Malachi
[1:44:07] 3125 John fulfilled Malachi 45 and six
[1:44:11] the first
[1:44:13] [Music]
[1:44:16] half and in none and in none of these
[1:44:20] scriptures
[1:44:22] was John's name
[1:44:25] mentioned when he came upon the
[1:44:27] earth when he was
[1:44:30] born when at the age of eight nine years
[1:44:34] old the Holy Spirit took him to live
[1:44:36] Into the
[1:44:39] Wilderness because his because his
[1:44:41] ministry would be so
[1:44:43] important that he couldn't afford to let
[1:44:47] John to get involved without huge Jewish
[1:44:54] denomination for they had all the word
[1:44:57] twisted
[1:44:58] up they had the writings of the
[1:45:02] prophets but they had no
[1:45:04] Revelation John the Holy Spirit was
[1:45:07] going to take him
[1:45:08] wildness to give him what no man could
