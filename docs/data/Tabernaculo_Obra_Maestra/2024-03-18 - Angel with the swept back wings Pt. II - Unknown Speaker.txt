angel with his the angel with his sweep back Queens part two backg background uh background uh finish this thought this morning so we could read the word we're going to read in the book of the 2 Corinthians that would be chapter 5 in 2 Corinthians 2 Corinthians chapter 5 we're going to begin at verse one uh 2 Corinthians first chapter 5 verse one 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse one for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens for in this we grown earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked Paul is speaking here he's saying that we're going to be clothed he's speaking of something Supernatural he's speaking of a house not made with hands something that God has done it's our our Heavenly place it's this that will be clothed upon and we will not be naked verse four for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not not for that we be unclothed but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of Life Paul speaks here distinction between the natural and the superal for we that are in this Tabernacle do grown being burdened not for that we be unclothed he's speaking of a natural man but look what he say but clothed upon that mortality might be swallowed up of life doing the distin in these four verses I'm not speaking of the natural I'm speaking of is what's going to cover the natural is the supernatural a house a house made from God verse five now he that hath wrought us for the selfsame thing is God who also hath given unto us the earnest of the spirit Lord add His blessings this morning let's pray Heavenly Father we give you thanks again bless your uh sons and your daughters this morning each one that would hear by um the recording and the Lord bless all amen amen you can have your seats we're going to be reading some quotes this morning and some we've already read last uh service and some are going to be that we have we haven't read let's begin with the first quote and the teaching of Hebrews Hebrews okay and it says like this and paragraph 128 and now when these great lights went out or great rays of spirit love peace that's all there was there wasn't no suffering there there was no hate No Malice it had to come from this fountain that was Jehovah Jehovah God and now the theologians call it a theop that went from that which was called in the scripture the logos that logos that went out from God it's hard to explain but it was part of God now here's what happened well I'm going to jump forward a little bit okay it is this this great spirit now this great spirit began to form in the creation and the logos that came out from there it was the son of God was the only visible spirit that was seen and that was a theophany which means a body and the body was like a man we can we can listen to a lot of theologians and some say that theophany it was all a manifestation of God the pillar of fire that appeared and all of these things they call a theophany but the prophets and he made it more like singular he said a theophany means a body and the body was like a man speaking of the theophany of God and God has had many distinct manifestations of the valley the L of the valley the rose of Sharon the pillar of fire the cloud that appeared in Israel God has had many distinct and but God also has a body a theophany and he said this Theon it means a body and the and the body was like a man now the theophany of God is like a man it's not like an angel with even though God had that manifestation and even though it has manifested like a like a angel with wings with wings but the the body of the theophany of God the prophet said it was like a man Moses saw it when it passed through the Rock by The Rock and he looked at it and he looked at and he said it looked like the H part of a man and he said that same type of body that we received when we died that's when when us when we die the the type that Moses saw a man it's the same type that every Christian will have every son or daughter of God now the scripture continues and the quote where Paul speaks and when this Tabernacle appears be dissolved I'm sorry be is dissolved it's a quote Hebrews chapter 1 keep that open for you it's the second quote the book of Hebrews okay that one second and uh Hebrews chapter 1 start from the where you start Hebrews chapter 1 okay just going to be that what uh paragraph 130 130 we're at 129 right okay3 yeah oh right here okay right there okay oh yeah we read okay sorry it's the same type of body where it says there okay it's the same type of body that when we die here if this same body dis be dissolved we already have one awaiting us so it's a quote you're going to read and that's what it is and that is what the the Theon which was the um you're reading the quot okay 130 about the middle of the paragraph Moses saw it when it passed through by The Rock and he looked keep going down keep going down not much down it's the same paragraph I don't think I have it here sorry brother I don't see it it's there it's just really small what you're reading he said verse one uh paragraph 130 right 130 about the middle of the paragraph because there's 130 but then it goes into another paragra I see I have 130 and it goes to 42 okay part of them okay so that last part didn't get put in there so you just quot it okay it's the same um body when we die here when this same Tabernacle uh ends we already have one awaiting us that's what it is and that was the same theophany that was the son of God that same son the same logos was made flesh the same way we were made in flesh and the theophany the logos that was made in flesh and simply it was the place the location habitation habitation I'm sorry because the fountain uh the complete Fountain was in him can you see it and the in the sermon the breach 64 63 okay the brid breach right here 63 the breach begins with just as John it'll say 74 next to it and 42 okay I got it so just as John was given his message the same time that Messiah come in the days John knew he would see him because he was going to to introduce him and we realize that in the scriptures over in Malachi 4 and there's going to be one like John an Elijah to whom the word of God can come to and he's going to reveal by the holy spirit all the mysteries of God and restore the faith of the children back to the faith of the apostolic restore back all these Mysteries that's been proved at through the denominational years now that's what the word said I'm only responsible for what it said and it is written is right and in the same way like John the first Elijah introduced Jesus and the second Elijah it's his ministry will be the same also came to introduce Jesus they both had to uh decrease so has in our hearts in the same sermon the breach now the uh Prophet says now we see that this seven seal book it's the mystery of redemption now if this uh book is seven sealed this book that is sealed with Seven Seals it's the mystery of redemption then why would each believer have this revelation of this mystery he was going to want to have it because it was going to be the revelation of his Redemption it is the book of redemption that comes from God now all the Mysteries that in this time they'll be consumed when this um messenger begins to sound we're quoting now here is the the messenger Ang the angel it's it's it's the quote 744 now okay now here is the Angel over the Earth on the earth on the earth and another Angel powerful angel that descends this was an angel that was that came to the Earth is it you're not you're not reading okay 7:44 okay read off the quotes here you going to read from here get close now here's on the earth and another angel Mighty messenger came down and this Angel was an Earthly Angel messenger But Here Comes one down from heaven a rainbow a covenant see chist could it be it was in Revelations 1 standing in the midst of the seven golden candles [Music] with a rainbow to look upon this Jasper and Sardis it's God this Angel of the right here notice it was to be the seventh Angel's message that was to reveal the seventh the Seven Seals Revelations 10:7 now you'll find it see you see the basis of what many sayam that William Bram has to return because they say that he's never um hold it or the seals have never been uh opened and for those that say it it for them it's true because they don't have Revelation that what the prophet had spoken because what he said it wasn't an explanation it requires a revelation is what the messenger said What Will William Brandon preached it requires a revelation not an explanation even in the way that he spoke he spoke in Parables he also said he also said in the way I speak it's a parable in the way I speak now the prophet said and he saw this Angel come down put his foot on the land and on the sea and that was Christ and he had a rainbow over his head notice him you'll find him in Revelations once again one with the rainbow over his head and look upon a Jasper and Sardis this Stone and then he comes he puts one foot upon the land and over the water see raised up his his hand and he had a rainbow over his head yet that's a covenant and he was a covenant Angel he was Christ a little lower than the angels to suffer there comes and he put his hands up to heaven and swore by him and lives forever and ever the Eternal one father God this time shall be no more and when this takes place it runs out it's done it's finished this angel he was the seventh angel in the cloud that appeared over the um Sabino Canyon the the picture that Life Magazine took um Revelations 10: 7 and Revelations 10 it is the prophecy that was what was fulfilled in Sabo the prophecy of the same angel had the angel the Covenant in the same message souls are imprisoned now the prophet says and the scripture says and at the message of the seventh Earthly Angel the messenger on Earth the seventh and last Church age at the beginning of his ministry when it starts off into the Earth at that time the mystery of God of these Seven Seals should be made known by that time now we see it now we see where we're at could it be friends could it be that we've that we here in the the last days the prophet said in the beginning of his ministry of this Messenger on the earth when he begins at that time the mysteries of God of the Seven Seals should be made known Min so now we see where we're at it would be important to know when his ministry began uh 1946 the prophet he he had an experience it was in a cabin an angel appeared to him and there he gave unto him a Ministry a commission to go to all around the worldi that's where brother brandom that's where he received the mantle to to be the angel of the leodan age and the word and that's where this ministry began that's where the opening of the seal the the seventh seal because the opening of the seventh seal it released a message it released a messenger the prophet said it what is the opening of a seal we all know that the opening of a seal it releases a messenger a message and a messenger in 1946 God he gave him a commission to a prophet to take this message around the world so if he released a message and a messenger how is it that he released it how is it that he opened it the seventh seal open uh 1933 1963 63 I'm sorry no no 1946 the seventh angel where did he come from for the open from the opening from the seventh seal Paul Paul the messenger from the um age of Ephesus where did Paul come from from the opening from the first seal in the message scriptural signs of the time don't be ashamed if you're ashamed of him here he said I'll be ashamed of you before the father and the Holy Angels you're in his presence now he is here he absolutely is here great Holy Spirit the pillar of fire that wases is right here remember when he was here on Earth he said I come from God and I go to God and they said Moses forsook the treasures of Egypt considering the treasures of Christ greater than all the reproach of Christ greater than all the treasures of Egypt he went in the wilderness with Christ and any Bible reader knows that the pillar of fire was the Angel and the L that went out of God which was Jesus it was the same body that God was using when Jesus died he ascended up to heaven and when he was met when he met Saul on the road to Damascus he had done turned back to the pillar of fire again and he even put Paul's eyes out with brightness with the brightness of the light and the prophet says and now he he's here tonight the same yesterday today and forever would you like to identify yourself before him say Lord God I haven't had that kind of experience but I want to have it or does God change his mind about his word and the prophet says and Moses was leading the children of Israel just as God would tell them by the led by the pillar of fire and a supernatural being that was leading the way and Moses was getting his information through the logos and that went out of God that Pillar of Fire which was the angel of the which was Christ the anointed one his message through there and G giving it on the road to a promised land so if that prophet of the first Exodus if that was the way he was receiving his information so how about the one the message of the third ex if that's the pattern of the first then God will do it the same in this day the prophet says he says this man he was calm he had his kingdom he had his churches he had everything in order he so he sends over to get this man he's speaking of balam to bring this man to come over and to curse this people the the people of Israel now notice could you imagine that one Prophet one man of God seeing the works of God and tried to challenge The Works of God and when he knew he he he was he knew better now sent him and told him come over and curse this people B and Baal bom rather he done this thing that was right he sought God he sought God first now that's what we ought to have done and then God and gave him his Perfect Clean Cut answer don't go with him leave them alone don't you curse those people they are blessed they're blessed now that ought to be enough When God says anything he cannot change that notice this was his perfect will don't you go don't attack that people they are my people that was his perfect will butam he didn't like those people you see how manys do we have today doing the same thing and they know better they know better remember what the prophet says and Moses was getting his message through the logos and the prophet and he was also receiving the message through a people through the logos and the Holy Spirit the pillar of fire god the same God it was the same Angel of the Covenant it is Christ the anointed one and from there and and Moses was receiving this message Moses was not getting this message because he was speaking with his own theophany no no it was the angel of the Covenant the Holy Spirit speaking to Moses a prophet of the first Exodus and the prophet of the Third Exodus he also received the message the same way through the Revelation through the angel of the through the the Holy Spirit the same God once more bringing his book of redemption his Plan of Redemption for his people for you and me in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed Prophet says GL Oh Glory that great Angel of the Covenant that one was who was with Moses in the wilderness that one who came to Paul on the road to Damascus see the same one the prophet's giving you the pattern because Christ is the same yesterday today can because he he cannot change and he speaks the same way to his glory the great Angel of the Covenant with Moses in the wilderness the one that was with Paul on the road to Damascus the same one that was permitted that his picture be taken with us he's talking of the picture that the Pillar of Fire was over and then he says notice the same one that was in the picture in the Life Magazine the other day the same word by the same God the Chanel the way the whether two or three are gathered in my name I am there in their midst then he is here then he is here he gave us three Witnesses he gave us one pattern and he applied to the three Witnesses Moses Paul William Bram William Bram how are you receiving the message how were they receiving the message by by the angel of the Covenant Jesus not speaking to their theophanies no no that is a thought Pagan that's an Adoration of a a saint of a holy the same way it's written in the Book of Daniel that the king he made an image and he wanted all the world to worship and that same image that he made it was the same image of he wanted Daniel to do the same thing and that the prophet said that's going to repeat in this day it's repeating in this see it with our own eyes it is repeating but the prophet said the great Angel of the Covenant the one that appeared with Moses in the desert the same one that appeared to Paul in the road to Damascus the same one that permitted his picture to be taken with us the same one that was in the picture Life magazine in Life Magazine the other day the seventh angel those wings backed who is it the angel of the Covenant Christ the the Lord Jesus it can't be any more clear what is Prophet say what is a theophany the prophet said Moses saw it only the theind part behind behind part of a man of a man it was a man that was the theophany of God and the scripture says and when he appears and we'll be like he is the same um kind the same kind same seed will produce sons and if the theophany of God is a man then what would be the theophany of a a son and daughter of God huh wouldn't it be the same wouldn't it be the same as as he appears will be like him we're going to be reading we're going to be reading more quotes of the testimony of the Prophet when he came out of this this Earthly body Earthly body and he entered into and the Lord permitted for one moment to leave this dimension iion and to go to the sixth Dimension and here in the message the fifth seal he the prophet gives a testimony of this not only here I I chose this portion because of the detail it gives us take have patience we're going to be reading much it says says here U notice these souls are to wait a little season 144 to be martyred now he says my time it's [Music] finished and if I let you leave a little early I have a few more things to say I know it's hot and I'm sweating but listen I just got something to tell you it's just so good just burning right up in my heart and I hope you haven't forgotten it let me say this in the presence of him by his grace he also let he let me see my people and white robes also how he let Paul William brand was not the first Paul also spoke the he also came out of and he also was allowed permitted to he also was allowed to go into that sixth Dimension he said the eyes have not seen ears have not heard what God has in store for us and the same experience that they had and the same experience I have I can't tell you everything I saw I can only tell you you remember you remember the story not long ago the gentle Gentile bride and they were all in right white robes now and now he begins his testimony he said I woke up I had been on a meeting been about a year ago or a little more and I woke up one morning and I raised up and I said sweetheart to my wife she didn't move I had to take the kids to school and I was going to get up from the bed and I I I leaned there and you know how you just sit up and just lean your head you lean your head against the headboard and I was just laying back like that and I thought boy oh you're already going to be 53 if you're going to do anything for God you better you better get doing it because you're going to be real old after a while and I thought you know that's right I thought I thought yes that's right I don't have much time left and I have to go soon now I'm a year older than my daddy when he when he when he lived I thought I got to move right right away and I thought I ain't done nothing for God and I said I always wanted to do something for him and I thought I got to hurry and do it if I'm going to do it I don't know how many years I'll have now and I begin to think man I hope to see his coming I don't want to be like a spirit spook see I was always afraid of a spirit and and I always thought and I thought well like maybe I'd be with brother Neville White Cloud moving around and you know I'd say hello brother Neville and he'd say hello brother brand and by some sense could he couldn't talk but I know that it was just brother Neville but even though I I want to shake his hand like I always do because that's how the human beings do it see I'd want to shake his hand but he ain't got no hand it's down there in the grave rot it away and I thought what a thing I hope that I don't have to go through that now I'm going to tell you the truth I'm telling you the truth I was afraid to die not afraid I'd be lost but I didn't want to be a spirit I wanted just to remain a man I wanted to wait for the Rapture see I just wanted to stay like that I didn't want to be no spirit and then the prophet says and I was there laying on the thinking and in a moment something happened now you know I know you are conscious of the visions and if this was a vision I've never had one like it and I've had Visions since I was a little boy and all at once something happened and and I felt myself leaving and I thought and I thought oh I'm dead and I've gone and then I thought and I'm going to look back friends this was so real as I'm standing right here and I turned around to look back and there lay on the bed stretched out laying by side of my wife the fleshly Tabernacle he was already in another dimension theophonic body the body in the in the bed it was moving no no was speaking no no he was shaking his wife no no because that body William William brandham was not in that house God moved him to another dimension to give you to give him that experience if God doesn't send that body William Bram they would have said uh brother brandom died in his bed next to his wife I thought well it probably a heart attack see well I say I just died instantly well it would be a fine way of going so I thought that's a heart attack I didn't have to suffer and then I looked and I thought well that's strange there I lay right there and there I was stretched out but now I'm here standing looking at the same that body my same body in the bed but the body in the in the bed the body in the bed had 50 was 53 years old William brandom in his his body Celestial he was a a body of 20 years old it was the same man but it was two uh distinct bodies one one flly body and one fleshly body William brand and William brandom in his house in in that the one that God made in in Corinthians chapter 5 and Paul spoke of these two bodies and then the prophet says so I turned and I looked and I saw a great big field and over that field and there was like blue grass and I went to think about this and all of a sudden and as I looked here come thousands thousands of young women they're not just women but young women all in white robes and their hair their hair hanging down to their waist and their um barefooted and they were running right towards me and I thought what's this and I turned around and and there was and there I was and I looked up this way there they came and I bit my finger and I said and I'm not asleep because I could feel that I was biting my finger and I said there's something funny here and these women and they came running towards me and I've never seen I've never seen such pretty women and they all came right to me and when they ran to me and you know how I've been and they call me a woman hater but I'm not but I think but a good woman is is a jewel right the same way that Solomon said but a bad woman said she was watering so I certainly ain't got no use for of ill faint now he says that these women they all came and they they started and they put their arms around me and that is something strange and you know I would have never stood for that now I will have to say something in a mixed crowd but these were women they were women and they hugged me they said our precious brother and one hugged me another one would hug me and I was standing there and I thought and I said what's this see and they were there standing and I thought what happened and I looked back and I was lying right there on the bed but even though I was standing here and I thought now that's odd and I don't understand and them women they were saying our precious brother and then hugging me and they were were and they were to feeling me feeling 100% they were women and the prophet said inside and I I begin to think for me and the prophet says now forgive me sister and I know that you listen to your doctor and if we don't have clean Minds then we're not Christians always tried to live clean morally morally God knows that and when I was a little boy and the angel of the Lord told me not to defile my body not to smoke no not to drink and that's been the truth by the of God I've kept that and when I was a sinner I didn't run around with women and so but any man that lets a woman that that lets a woman hug him in his arms being made of cells of a man and her of a of a woman there's going to be a sensation I don't care who you are and if you're a person of good health I don't I don't care who you are don't tell me that you're not if you're if you're a healthy person but not there because you don't have now you know that those Sals are different you don't have any more different sales you'll never sin there because there was a change from a Earthly body to a Celestial body now the carnal doesn't exist there it's only a a brotherly love with these women and even though by the grace I believe that a woman a pretty woman that holds herself right and Walks Like a Lady an example of a jewel on Earth I like anything that's graceful and I think a woman that holds Place tries to be like a lady is a statue of Honor I do believe that and I think that one that isn't and it's like Christ and anti the same thing like anything that's natural now the prophet how he's explaining here it's difficult to follow his thought but I'm I'm reading it as he speak he he he spoke it because he's speaking and he's here speaking in Parables now the prophet says uh like a pretty horse and he just stands in the Statue of a real pretty and a pretty Mountain a pretty Mountain a pretty woman and a pretty men anything that stands in the making of God and I've always admire admired it and these were perfect these were perfect sorry but no matter how many that would hug me into their arms and they were women you understand but there there could be never no sin the male glands and the female glands but was gone thank the Lord they were my sisters completely and then the prophet says and I seen my hands and I seen my hands and I seen my hands that they were young my hands and I was young same William the six dimension in his Celestial in his theop he was young and when you look back will that was in the bed that man was old one was the The Natural Body and the other was the celestial body I was young too and losing my hair as a Young Man through an accident putting carbic acid a barber did and it took all they took it all when I was a young boy and it's always been and I've always gotten a cold quick you know and I I lost the roots of was carb and now my hair couldn't grow back you see now and I went my wife it was years ago and she bought me and she bought me a hairpiece to put on me to cover my head but I've always been ashamed to wear it because it it looked like it was something false and I've never wanted something false so I thought and what if I just put a like a stocking but if I put that and then they're going to begin to say that he is a bishop and then I I said I'm not going to do that and I'll just suffer with the bad cold and let it and so and the prophet said and I went to a doctor and I asked him what he thought and he said and the pores are open you're sweating from preaching from preaching and then the air comes and and it puts a cold germ up and it and it runs down the next morning your horse and you that have hair you don't know how thankful you should be the prophet he goes out of his he leaves his testimony and and like he always because that's the way God how God was going to hide it from the and he was going to bring it through Revel the ones that want a explanation clear they they close the the the tape this man can't hold his subject that he chose this man speak the way he spoke um listen but I looked at my hands and they were young and I put my hands over my head and I had hair once again I was young and everybody here was young and I begin to think how strange they're here they're running to me and then I saw hope coming coming Hope was his first wife and when she uh died at 22 years of age and she was still very uh pretty and many of you remember her she had a very big eyes she was a German her hair was uh down to her waist back and I thought and when she comes to me and she she's going to say Bill and how she would always say I know that she's going to say I know that she'll say she call me Bill when she comes here I was seeing her and every one of those women coming um hugging me saying our precious brother it's so good to see you and I thought and they were all clothed the same way but their hair was different you know red hair black hair blond hair and as they were coming they were all young and when she got to me and I thought I'm just going to see what she says and she looked at me and she said her his wife Hope Oh Our precious brother she hugged me and she just went on and some other women came and they also hugged me and I heard a noise it looked like he was coming over this way and then there came some men uh young and they were all about the same age of 20 years old and they had dark hair some were blonde hair and they had white robes on to to their feet and they ran to me and they began to me they said our precious brother and I thought and then I look behind me and then I saw myself and I was still stretched out on the bed and I said this is strange and then I said and a voice said it began to speak to me and I never seen only to hear the voice and the voice said to me you you have been reunited reunited with your people and then a man picked me up and he set me way up on high and I thought I why did you do that said in Earth you were a leader well I don't understand this and the voice that was speaking to me the voice I could never see the voice and now over me talking to me and I said and if I have passed on if I if I have passed on I want to see Jesus he is all my life I want to see him and he said you can't see him now he's still higher in another dimension he was in the sixth Dimension and God was in the seventh Dimension you see I was below the altar how under the altar go read chapter 5 of Revelations apal um I'm sorry apocalyps Revelations chapter 6 when it speaks of the fifth seal Souls under the altar now we know the souls were the Jews but we know that they were Souls that were redeemed and they were under the altar in other words the altar is in the seventh diens the sixth Dimension a people that was already redeemed uh the sixth place where mang goes not the seventh where God is Dimension the sixth they were all there and they were passing by and I looked and it looked like there were millions of them and as I was there and these women and men they were still coming to me and hugging me saying brother and there I was and I Heard a Voice and you have been rited and to your people like Jacob like Jacob was gathered to his people and I said all and I said all these are my people all these are Brams no he said no they are your converts to Christ and I saw and there was a woman very beautiful that ran up to me and all of them were pretty much the same and she um hugged me she said oh my precious brother and she looked at me and I thought and she said he said I my she looks like an angel and she passed by and the voice said didn't you recognize her I said no I I didn't recognize and he said you led her to Christ when she was past 90 years old he said said you know why she thinks so much of you I said said that pretty girl was past 90 and she said yes and she can never change no more now and that's the reason she's saying my precious brother and I thought oh my and I was afraid of this why these people are real here they are they weren't tired of being there and I said why why can't I see Jesus and he said well he'll come someday and he'll come to you first and you'll be judged and the these people are your converts and I said you mean by being a leader that he will judge me he said yes and he said does every leader be judged like that he said yes I said what about Paul he will have to be judged like that with yours too as yours as his sorry and I said and if this group goes in so the group of his group goes in so will mine because I preach the same word where it says be baptized in Jesus name I did it too I also preached it and millions screamed resting on that and I thought if I only knew this before I come here I would make the people come here you can't afford to miss this and then he said someday he will come Jesus and in this place we don't have to eat drink sleep we're just all one and he says why isn't it isn't perfect this is beyond perfect it's not Sublime Beyond Sublime no name can put on it there's no word or to say it you just arrived that's all and I thought well this would be perfect then what are we going to do next and he said and when Jesus comes and he judges us for for you and for your ministry then we'll go back to the Earth and take up new bodies bodies that are glorified our theop it our theophany body is not our final Dwelling Place in the theop that we the Lord will clean this Earth over will step over the ashes of glorify these bodies and over a glorified live over the Earth forever Prophet says and I I thought on this this is exactly the scripture and he said then we go back to Earth we'll take up those new bodies and then we'll eat but here in this sixth Dimension we won't eat here neither neither do we sleep now when we go back to the Earth we'll eat down there there on the earth and I said this is marvelous and I I was scared of this and I was scared scared to die to to get to come to this why this is perfection per this is wonderful see see we're right we're right under the altar right under the altar waiting for his coming when he goes to get those ones that are sleeping and the body sleeping in the dust to raise them up again like Jesus he went to the paradise Abraham Isaac and all of them you know and they were waiting first and they were waiting in the first resurrection and they entered into the city and appeared to many perfectly scriptural a vision was there whatever it was perfectly scriptural and then I said well isn't this wonderful and then I thought and then I heard liquor like a horse and I looked and it was my saddle horse that I used to ride in this sixth Dimension not only men not only women a horse Prince the the name was Prince of the horse I thought so much of him and here he was standing there by Me by he put his head over my should to get like hug me I I used to give him and I used to give him like sugar and I would hug him and I said Prince I knew that you would be here and all of a sudden and I felt something liing my hand oh blessed be in the sixth Dimension a in a Celestial body I felt something licking my hand and it was my dog and a man named Mr short and he had poisoned him I swar I would kill him and I was about 16 years of age he poisoned my dog and my daddy and he caught me with a rifle going down there to kill him and I said and I went to to to theg grave and where I buried him and I spoke to him I said Fritz you've been a companion to me always you've helped me to clothe me and sent me to go to school and when you got old and I was going to take care of you and now they've killed youz and I said a promise to Fritz the man that killed you is not going to live and I'm gonna one day I'll get him in the street walking I'm gonna step over him and I'm going to kill him and I'm going to take Vengeance against him because for you and then you know what happened you know what happened I led that man to Christ I baptized him in the name of Jesus name and I buried him also at his death you see what had happened the uh years later before a few years before before I'm sorry I had I was converted then I seen things different and now I loved this man that poisoned my dog instead of hating him but even though but there was Fritz licking my hand I couldn't cry there nobody can cry it was all joy there you can't be sad because it's all happiness nobody there can die because it's all life nobody there gets old because it's all a youth it's something perfect and I said this is something wonderful and millions and I felt at home and then I heard a voice and it said and all that you ever loved for my service I don't need a reward for but he said all that you ever loved and all that ever loved you God has given to you and I said praise the Lord and I began to feel funny what's the matter I feel funny and I turned around and looked and I looked at at the my body on the bed and it began moving because when he left that body it was no longer moving and then when he went to look back that body wasn't moving because the life that was in that body was in this body six Dimension that body there was dead he says glory to God I felt a little funny and I said what happened I I feel funny and I turned around and looked and I looked my bed on that on that bed my body on that bed and it was moving and I said oh certainly I don't have to go back he had his wife his children young still the church his ministry but being over there but knowing that he said oh really I don't want to have to go back don't let it happen but the gospel had to be preached and in a second I was on the bed again God he permitted the prophet to enter into his theop how was his theop he was a young man did you hear in this testimony that William that all had wings nobody had wings nobody had wings he didn't have wings nobody had wings the he said that they were men they were women there was the horse or the dog had wings all of the same how God made them originally were the same am in the message Israel and the church now we're here who are getting along past when a man and a woman pass 25 years old you might as well say face it you're not a you those days are finished and to think to think that glorious promise and we're facing and with the setting of the son what is it is life finished no oh no life just has begun oh if we just had the time to uh calmly to go over these scriptures before the people there they are friends I can prove by God's Bible hope of the holy spirit that every one of you that's in that one of these days those gray hairs will and those wrinkles run from your face and you'll go back a young man at one live forever with Christ I can show you where God proves it in his Bible he showed the shadows and the promise it swore by it that he'd do it then he said will I love my wife then sure more than I do now I don't know how it could be but I know it will be will she be mine sure she sure will she will be my shall be no children or nothing but the children that we have here on Earth will be there with us if they've been born again that's right but they're not going to be children fathers and mothers fathers and Sons they're going to see they're going to be the same age the prophet says and the message Israel in the church 1953 I used to think I say well forgive me excuse me was before you knew better too that we used to have wings and we were going to be flying around you know I like to eat and drink sh hands with the people and I thought and one that'll finish then oh no oh no I I I noticed and I found that God never did make me an angel he made me a man I will always be a man be an angel that's an error God has angels He made angels He made Caribs with and he made Angels without and when I heard these old songs when I was a sinner and I would go in those places and an angel would be waiting for me and I thought an angel and I'm going to be an angel and I noticed and I found out that is a lie of the devil that never took place you notice and and now in this message the the teaching is shown and the angel of the picture of the Ang and the angels and the angel singular in the picture of Life magazine the angel that you can see with his wings back that same Angel it is the theophany the William Bram of William brandham and the prophet says that is an error and he even goes to past that to say that it's an error he says it's a lie of the devil when I used to hear those songs old songs when I was a sinner and I would go to those places and they would play that music the record and a angel would be waiting for me and I said and I thought and I'm going to be an angel and the prophet says and I I I found out that's a lie of the devil there's no such thing in the message and the church that's paragraph 15 and verse 16 his testimon how that you see the the theop William how the theophany of William brandham that's a young man I looked at him and they were young and in the in the earth he was a man that was bald and but there he says but I put my hands on my head and I had hair no no wings hair a young man amen and the prophet said the angel of the Covenant that appeared to Moses in the desert and the same Angel of the Covenant that appeared it appeared to Apostle Paul and the road of Damascus and the same Angel of the Covenant and it was in the picture Life Magazine Life Magazine who that angel this the seventh the one that was more notable the angel of the Covenant Christ the pillar of fire it's one more time it's God showing us God the same yesterday today and forever and he won't break his scripture he'll fulfill it let's stand please the prophet said in his testimony and I was scared of death because I was going to leave um say that one more time and I was scared of death because I was coming to this place in on the in the on the other just the contr just the contrary to reach when I reach that place that sixth Dimension that Celestial body that theophany when I noticed that I had had to go back he felt he was burdened he said no Lord God certainly I don't have to go back to that body that old body and um filled with woes and troubles and troubles filled with complex human no no I don't want to return in a second in a moment he was there once more he was back and he says now I know why because the the the um Evangel the word of God the gospel had to be preached and the testimony and this experience it had to be had to be Pro proclaimed to encourage one of each one of us don't be scared of the death we're not going to be a spirit we're not going to be a cloud we're going to be men and women the same way asist like the logos that came from God and the theophany of God Moses saw it the behind part back of a man it was a man and William Bram and he saw it face to face you remember in that Fieldy he looked above and not much more than this ceiling I seen Jesus in a white Rob the wind was blowing it his rope he made a noise with his throat and Jesus didn't see him didn't look at when he said Jesus he turned he saw he looked at me eye to eye face to face signifying this book of redemption these Seven Seals they're open Moses could only see the hind pack part of the back because the book was closed because when the reation of This Book of redemption comes you are seeing Jesus face to face as you see the picture here of Christ and the prophet said when he first saw the painting of this of this artist of 300 years ago he said that's him and that's the one I saw that night when I was praying for my parents that God would save them I want to go to the other side let's pray Lord we give you
