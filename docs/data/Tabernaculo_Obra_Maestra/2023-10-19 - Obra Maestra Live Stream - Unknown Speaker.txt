Saints of like Precious coming with one Focus as worshippers of the Lord Jesus and and asking him to accept our worship and our praises and vindicate it by touching our hearts once again where each one of us can go home and we're ready to Face Tomorrow one day at a time lord Jesus is all we're asking we U going to continue on this what we were speaking on on Sunday For Whom Shall I fight and what shall be the weapons of my Warfare and seeing seeing the day that we're living and there's always been Wars raging Civil Wars of all kinds but when Israel goes to war then the T the then the clock is ticking it's it's it was called the Doomsday Clock and it was a the scientific community and the political community and they all came together and it's not a real clock that you hang on the wall and yet it's a very real clock because they got together to to watch what's happening in the world because they were they feared Another War they feared a they fear and they fear it yet today a third world war because of the technology that all the nations have one one man putting his finger on one button with with the bombs that are available to every major country and even Israel such a small country has the nuclear capability to bring the world to an end in 19 in the in the war of 19 19 was it 66 or 67 Six Day War of Israel when all the Arab nations came in to destroy Israel I believe the Prime Minister that time was a man called manin bean and and at the time it didn't look too good for Israel at all their borders the Syria and Iran and all these already were mounting hundreds and hundreds of thousands of soldiers and and equipment and and the Prime Minister minan Bean went on National Airways and he says I want to remind all our enemies and the world world that we have we have nuclear weapons and if it appears to us that you're going to take us down then I want the world to know everyone that if we go down say the world goes down with us so it it was quite a statement and of course uh Israel has been known to back up its statements their their generals and their Prime Ministers are anointed they're anointed to protect the land and they're anointed to protect 144,000 it's true not all Israel is Israel not every Jew is going to going to be slave saved just like not every Gentile in the world will be saved but there is a chosen people both Jewish and Gentile that God is holding back the wrath of his so you and I and a little group in Israel can prepare our hearts so the question is For Whom Shall I fight and what shall be the weapons of my Warfare want to begin by reading that quote once again the prophet spoke of in a message show us the father and it will satisfy us but he says looking around at the nature of people seeing that we're in the spirit of the last day he said now they had to get in the spirit of the anti- deluvian world that was the days of Noah they had to get in that spirit in that day before they could be destroyed they have to be in the spirit of War before they can have War we've got to get in into the spirit of peace before we can make peace he says he said God let us be in the spirit of Christ tonight so we can have Christ let us be in the spirit of repentance Spirit of Faith give it give it to us tonight our father of these great Treasures of Life they're so freely just by asking and realizing the greatest things of life and the only real lasting things are the Unseen turn with me to the to the Book of Matthew Matthew chapter 4 and verse 8 the the the devil was making Jesus an offer just like in the beginning he made Eve an offer but this time he didn't know who he was messing with he didn't realize who this was that this was the this this was the Fulfillment of the woman's seed this was God Emmanuel can in in Matthew 4 and: 8 Bible says again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them Lucifer Satan has all the kingdoms of the world in his hands and he anoints him for natural War he anoints them for for killing he's he's been that he's done that since the beginning in Eden when there in a time when there was only a few people on the face of the Earth Adam Eve Cain and Abel he swept down and anointed one of them Cain to kill his brother the Bible says he is a murderer and a liar from the beginning verse n and saith unto him all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship him and he's made the same offer to the elite and Rich of this world and we can see today that they have all accepted his offer and they Fallen at his at his Dragon feet and are worshiping Satan even even the churches today have fallen at the feet of Lucifer and they think they're worshiping Jesus Christ but they're not verse 10 then sayith Jesus unto him get thee H Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shalt thou serve let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this even for it was in the evening time when you would come down and visit with your children back in Eden before they fell Lord Jesus may you once again be in our midst this evening in Jesus name amen amen may be seated Lucifer Lucifer according to the scriptures he's in control of all the kingdoms of the world he's in control of all the governments he anoints them and moves them and they don't even know they're being anointed and moved of Satan in the days of Jesus Lucifer was in control of two major Powers one was was was was the the church that followed Moses one was the the the Jews Satan was in control of the Jewish Church Satan was in control of the Jewish high priest and Satan was in control of Roman of course and both of them were enemies and yet he influenced both of them to do violence and persecute the church and the Believers that were following Yeshua Jesus of Nazareth Messiah that those that had caught the Revelation that this man was the Lamb of God that this man was their king king of the Jews and who was persecuting these Believers the Jewish church and Rome enemies of each other but both anointed of Lucifer so if you fight even for your nation today who are we really fighting for it's the devil himself and he's a liar and a murderer from the beginning the spirit of War natural is anointing men and women in what is called even the message today they don't know who they're fighting for or what the weapons of their Warfare are that's why men will use their pulpits to publicly denounce each other in the message that the What's called the God's sacred desk has become bully pulpits for men and pastors they cause churches to go to war with each other they they're being Anointed with the same Spirit of this world for their own destruction oh we don't want to be partakers of this sin we we are in a in a battle ourselves it's a spiritual warfare but in this battle as a believer in Christ you know who your greatest enemy is this flesh this flesh in Matthew 6 and verse 9 it was it was it was a prayer that God gave us and this prayer that Jesus prayed was so contrary to what the people were going through in their time the Jewish people were in slavery the Jewish people by Rome were being persecuted the Jewish people lived in their land but it wasn't their land they didn't control it and and in Matthew 6 and verse 9 Jesus comes to them in this violent time and he's going to teach them he's going to change the way they they pray because that's what he came for to bring change to Israel he he he came to change everything about how they were living he said Can in verse n he says after this manner therefore pray ye and the multitude is listening to him Our Father which art in heaven Hallowed be thy name and most everyone the multitude says okay I'll accept that and then he says thy kingdom come thy will be done on Earth as it is in heaven and the multitude listening saying it's getting better and then he says give us this day our daily bread and he got a 100% amen from the crowd now he got their attention they're listening and then he says then forgive us our depts as we forgive our deor then they stopped for a minute okay where is he going with that because and lead us not into temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for thine is the kingdom and power and Glory forever amen and the multitude thought okay he's on the right track so far then in verse 14 he says for if you for forgive men their trespass FES your heavenly father will also forgive you and they said Moses didn't said that find that in the Bible Jesus no no don't you remember it's an eye for an eye it's a tooth for a tooth for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you forgive us they said This is Our Land God gave it to Abraham and to his descendants that's us the Romans are the squatters the Romans are The Intruders and the multitude started dispersing and leaving verse 15 but if you forgive not many your trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses and he was left alone and all had walked away because they were living in a time of violence where their children were being killed where their mothers were being killed where their grandfathers were being killed where they were being thrown in prison and persecuted and the multitude said nice prayer but your timing is all wrong don't you know Hamas just attacked he knew better than all that the timing was perfect Matthew 15 and verse 22 For Whom Shall I fight and what shall be the weapons of my Warfare and Wars are fought because an offense will not be forgiven and men and women divorce because of offense will not be forgiven and friends take their their their their two different ways because there's an offense that took place that one or both say I can't forgive this I won't forgive it Matthew 15 verse 22 and behold a woman of Canaan came out of the same coast and Cried unto him saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the Devil she she was a gentile she wasn't a Jew and the ministry that Jesus was fulfilling was King of the Jews even his Apostles he had commanded him go only to the house of Israel don't go to the Samaritan don't go to the Gentiles go only to the house of Israel because that was the season Jesus the lion of the tribe of Judah according to Matthew 5 he would open the book and loose the Seven Seals that just means he that a new testament was opening up with a plan of redemption with a Plan of Salvation with a plan to change you and I our hearts and Minds so here's this woman a gentile here's Jesus king of the Jews he was focused on his ministry and who he was sent to First and that was Israel the Elder son verse 23 but he answered her not a word he ignored her someone could already take offense with that and his disciples came and besought him saying send her away for she crith after us strike too someone could take more offense with that but he answered and said I am not sent but unto the LW sheep of the House of Israel then came she and worshiped him she had already been things had been told to her that were already quite offensive even the disciples offended her get rid of her Jesus we don't need her and then the next thing it says when these offenses started lining up the Bible says then came she and worshiped him pushed away her feelings because it was the word then came She and worsted Him saying Lord help me but he answered and said it's not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to the dogs that was reason to be offended that was reason to go to war to be called a dog verse 27 and she said truth [Music] Lord she was doing all the right things at every step at at every offensive point this woman was doing the right thing because she was doing it by faith verse 27 and she said truth Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's table then Jesus answered and said unto her oh woman great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou will and her daughter was made whole from that very hour her response to the trespass God was testing her it showed her level of faith it showed the real depth of her Revelation what was her Revelation she had a revelation of Jesus Christ she knew who he was how did she know it she just knew it down in her heart she just knew it and he said woman great is thy faith what a woman of prayer she must have been second Corinthians chapter 10 beginning at verse one the Apostle Paul speaking here he says now I Paul my self beseech you by the Weak by the meekness and gentleness of Christ Paul was a man that had been changed because Paul was a violent man Paul persecuted the church Paul put them in prison Paul put them to death and now here's that same Paul he says now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentle Ness of Christ who in presence and base among you but being absent and bold toward you but I beseech you that I may not be bold when I am present with that confidence wherewith I think to be bold against some which think of us as if we walked according to the flesh here it is listen to this verse three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh the unbeliever the make believer He Walks In the Flesh he Wars In the Flesh he's anointed of a different Spirit verse four Paul says for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds what kind of strongholds Paul's going to tell us in verse 5 now this kind of strongholds casting down your imaginations and every High thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of God and and bringing into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ these are the strongholds that Paul is telling us that we need to pull them down because the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal if we're truly fighting for Christ then the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal we need to bring down these strongholds Paul the strongholds of the spirit man and and and the spirit has five senses memory imagination conscience affections reasoning and the flesh body has five senses sight taste hearing smell touch and of all these senses of the spirit man and the flesh man none of them were given to you to contact God none of you none of them were given to you to have a a friendship restored with the father there's just one sin that's faith faith is what touches him faith is what moves him faith is what keeps us from from from being offended and letting it become a root of bitterness in our hearts will we get offended yes but faith will keep us from going down that road Ephesians 6 and verse 10 Apostle Paul finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may able to stand against the Wilds of the devil for we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities against Powers against the rulers of the dark darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places wherefore take on to you the whole armor of God that you might be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand what a tremendous message Paul was preaching and yet Paul when he wrote this epist he was in prison when he wrote Ephesians colians Philippians fiman he was in prison he was in Chains he was in bondage and look it to the things he's writing he's saying stand therefore having your LS G about with truth and having on the breastplate of righteousness and he's in prison and your feet shot with the preparation of the gospel of peace and he's in prison above all taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye shall abide to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked and he's in prison can take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God and he's in prison praying always with all prayer and supplication the spirit can where on can watching there too with all perseverance and supplication for All Saints and he's in prison for whom shall we fight and what shall be the weapons of of my Warfare verse 19 and for me that utterance may be given unto me that I may open my mouth boldly to make known The Mystery of the Gospel and he's in prison alone now maybe there was a rat or two roaming around but the man's in prison and look at the things look at the faith look at the Revelation that was holding him up he was in a different Spirit now not the not the spirit of War not the spirit of hatred that was amongst the Jews and the Romans he was he was living in a different world his mind and heart had been transformed looking around at the nature of the people seeing that we're in the spirit of this last day they had to get in the Spirit of the anti- delvian world before they could be destroyed they have to be in the spirit of War before you can have War but in this time of war and a spirit of War all around us let us be in the spirit of Christ tonight so we can have Christ let us be in the spirit of repentance a spirit of Faith give it to us tonight our father of these great Treasures of life so freely just by asking and realizing that the greatest things of life and the only real lasting things are the Unseen and may thy Spirit come tonight and feel every heart reclaim every backslider save every sinner and may those who are seeking the baptism of the Holy Spirit may come tonight and fill every heart May the sick be healed God receive glory for we ask in the name of his beloved Son Jesus our lord and it was a time of War as it is tonight the world is at War they're demanding you take sides we have we've taken sides with Jesus the man Christ Jesus who taught us how to pray led us by example in Luke chapter 23 and verse 33 Bible reader you remember this passage Jesus on the cross and verse 33 and when they were come to the place which is called Calvary There They Crucified him and the malf factors one on the right hand and the other on the left then said Jesus father for forgive them for they know not what they do and they parted his reignment and cast lot and the people stood beholding as the rulers also with him derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be Christ The Chosen of God but because he was Christ The Chosen of God because he was the Lamb of God he wouldn't come off that cross because he did it for you and he did it for me and he wouldn't be offended and to say I'll show you who I am I'll get off this cross I'll show you my power no he did show his power he wouldn't be offended he was going to stay there for die for you and I and the people stood beholding and the rulers also with him derided him saying he saved others let him save himself if he be Christ The Chosen you see he never did change his mind about that prayer or or how to pray God will never ask you to do something that he hasn't already done himself more than once Mark 11:23 verse 23 reads like this for verily I say unto you that whosoever shall say unto this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart but shall believe that those things which he saith shall come to to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith this is an end time promise and a prophecy to to be fulfilled in our Day verse 24 therefore I say unto you what things soever you desire When you pray believe that you receive them and you shall have them and when you stand praying forgive if you had ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive your trespasses but if you do not forgive neither will your father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses this change for Israel was more than they could take they couldn't they wouldn't accept it they wouldn't accept God opening the book of Salvation they wouldn't accept these Seven Seals being loosed which is seven parts of a divine plan to change you and I and one of the first things revealed under these seven Parts was Jesus coming to Nicodemus Nicodemus in this time of violence and War and killing you must be born again you must be born again The Battle Hymn the battle prayer the weapons of our Warfare through prayer it's truth it's righteousness it's peace it's Faith it's salvation it's the word of God praying always with all prayer and supplication in the spirit you might ask does God have a a going away plan he does indeed in the first seal brother R says here's the plan of it the first thing happens there's an announcement in the heavens first you know like a star that was seen across the heavens but only three men saw it three wise men it was a sign in the heavens here's the plan of it the first thing happens there's an announcement in the heavens first what happened a seal is open and who knew it nobody who understood it nobody God hid it from the eyes of the wise and but he's making us sensitive to his presence so we can see what he did at the first coming and see the pattern of how he'll do it at his second so we can recognize our day in its message and realize his his he is so close taking a bride away to a resurrection of the Dead Saints say where the dead in Christ shall rise and we which are alive and remain will be caught up to meet him in the air that means there'll be a people in this day I hope it's every one of us that we won't be we won't be we won't see death we will be changed supernaturally from a ter cesal body to a Celestial body from a creature of time to a creature of Eternity that's our promise if we don't get out caught up in the spirit of War of this world here's the plan of it the first thing happens there's an announcement in the heaven first what happened a seal is opened what is that a mystery unfolded and when a mystery unfolds then a trumpet sounds it declares a war or a plague Falls a church age opened see what's the see what is the war part the angel of the church cast catches the mystery of God not fully yet revealed but when he does he catches this of God then he goes forth to the people after the mystery has been given to him Goes Forth to the people what does he do there he begins to Proclaim that message and what does it start a war a spiritual war in the days of in the days of Jesus before he was born there was a sign in the heavens one that had been prophesied a star would appear and it would lead three wise men to the birth of Christ the star was declaring he's on Earth he's here now a star represents a messenger a star represents a prophetic Ministry then come John the Baptist again a Ministry that was prophesied but nowhere in the prophecy did it give John's name Isaiah 40 was the ministry of John we know it now but it never said that that that that Messenger to Israel that that his name would be John the Baptist Malachi 3 spoke of him neither did it mention that his name would be called John neither did it say when he would come Malachi 4 verse 6 spoke of John's Ministry also that he would be the Elijah Ministry to Israel at the first coming of Christ and and this Prophet would come first to make a way for messiah to make a way for Jesus he would introduce Israel he would tell them what the ministry of Jesus was going to be about it was going to be about change change change change everything you do would be would God would change it if you used to cheat on your taxes you used to cheat on your taxes you ain't doing it no more because Jesus come to change that if you used to steal from your employer you don't do that no more because Jesus said he'll change if if you if you used to sit down and hear rock and roll music all night and all day long you won't do it no more because Jesus is changing you changing your appetite pulling your mind and heart out of spiritual Amnesia now you realize who you are I'm a son and daughter of God and he's Lifting me up he says and then God takes his messenger with the elect of that age and lays them away to sleep then he drop drops a plague upon them who rejected it temporary judgment then and then after that is over then he goes on and they denominate and bring in denominations and start off with the man's work like of Wesley and all of the rest of them and then it gets all in a scrapple again confusion and then another mystery comes forth then what happens another messenger arrives on the earth for a church age that's what the seven churches are about in The Book of Revelations starting with the Ephesian Church age there's seven of them from Ephesus to pergamus to thra to Sardis to to to Philadelphia to Revelations chapter 2 and 3 speaks of seven churches there there are seven churches that actually existed in the days of the Apostles and the days of Jesus but here they're being used as a symbol to represent a gentile Generation The Bride of Jesus Christ from the days of Jesus his first coming to his last to his second coming seven Church ages and a cycle would repeat throughout these ages because God has a bride and and God's waiting for the last one to be born on the face of the Earth to take this little bride home that's what he's been waiting on that's why time has carried you say why has God waited so long because he's waiting for the last son and daughter to be born on the face of the Earth so he can give them a born again experience so he can give them rapturing Faith so he can give them victory over the lust of the flesh over the lust of the eyes over the pride of life over this old carnal nature so you pray Lord find that last a child of God soon so we can go home he says then God takes his messenger with the elect of the age and lays them away asleep he say oh it's a great plan until it comes to the last Angel because for every Church age there was seven angels which means seven Messengers seven prophetic Ministries that in every age for the last 2,000 years or more God always raised up a prophet to point the people back to the word of God because every time theyd stray away like Isel and God had to God had a voice to call his children back pull you out of the world pull you out of denomination pulled you out of slavery pull you out of every kind of bondage he said oh it's a great plan until it comes to the last angel now he has no certain mystery but he gathers up all that's been lost in those other ages all the truth that wasn't truly revealed yet as the Revelation comes then he reveals those things in this day he says if you want to read it there it is in Revelations 101 he said you'll get it all right God rich and mercy in the message I will restore sayith the Lord oh how theology has scrupled up the plan of God it's a disgrace we're living in the days of evil and evil usually comes from the pulpits that's where it's the most deceptive and evil usually comes from the pulpit if the pulpit would have stayed clean and straight we wouldn't have all all this stuff spread over the world today and people acting and living the way they're doing in unbelief some great teacher on the west coast met me the other day and he was going on about a certain man over there that's got a big church he said Reverend Branham do you think that man's a Christian I said I have no other reason than to believe he's a Christian he said all that Divine Healing and stuff you all are talking about he said you know a long time ago he said we have a great fine church I won't call its name because I don't believe in talking about anybody but he said we have the greatest churches on the west coast and Along Came the call The Cult of Christian Science and you know what they stripped our churches I said if you a great church would have stayed with the principles of Jesus Christ and taught Divine Healing like the Bible did they would have had they would have had to have no cult to come to the coast and these people is Hing about tearing up churches and things like that brother hungry children will eat out of a garbage can feed them with the word of God and they'll stay where they where they ought to be that's the truth certainly hungry people every man is trying to look behind the curtain to see where he come from and where he's going if you won't teach it in your church and give them the Salvation that he needs to his soul he's a Son of God in his Fallen estate yet he's a Son of God and he wants to see out long long Yonder God help us ministers to get to the place when we where we can introduce him Jesus Christ the true Living God and the thing that their soul hungers for after they have confessed and become Christians and closing I'd like to read one more quote here it's in the message only believe he says in in time and in time the old Wheels grind slow but it grinds sure very last paragra it's got to be just the way God said it was going to be no matter how unreal it seems but it's going to be that way as we talked last night one time they didn't have electricity but some man believed there was such a thing and he kept working tireless hours until he discovered what it was and the same thing by television and the automobile God put all these things here for our benefit and he says now if we who are acquainted with a supernatural would just take a man where where the man in his senses is limited to a senses but a man and his spirit is unlimited see the the tree of knowledge can only climb so far and it breaks back but the Tree of Life life goes on forever and look how science how that science look at how that science has taken men farther with his five senses than we have with his soul that's where we're at tonight with the world of computers with the world of technology it appears like science has taken man further with his five senses than we have with his soul he says well he says we've got untapped resources where all things are possible if we can believe God is one take you further than what science has taken you and yet with what they have in computers sometimes we stand in awe you know that they can make a video with you in it show you doing all kinds of things and it never was you science they can make it they can make a whole scene where you where you where you murdered someone and with our eyes we see it and we say yes that was that's brother Daniel that's that's him and yet they can do that with technology and it was never me and there's no way to know that it wasn't you once they make that and yet God wants to take you an ie further than what science has taken us God wants to take us back to Eden God wants to take us back
