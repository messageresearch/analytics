[30:20] God welcome everybody in the name of the
[30:22] Lord Jesus
[30:24] Christ as well as everybody watching in
[30:26] the internet
[30:30] if we could all stand
[30:33] up if you have your bibles if you could
[30:35] turn with me to Psalms
[30:44] 107 says oh give thanks unto the Lord
[30:47] for he is good and for his mercy
[30:49] endureth
[30:50] forever let the redeemed of the Lord say
[30:53] so whom he has redeemed from the hand of
[30:56] the enemy
[30:59] and gather them out of the lands of the
[31:01] East and from the west and from the
[31:03] north and from the
[31:05] [Music]
[31:16] [Music]
[31:18] south they wandered in the wilderness in
[31:20] solitary way they found no City to dwell

[31:26] in
[31:28] hungry and thirsty their souls fainted
[31:30] in
[31:32] [Music]
[31:36] them then they Cried unto the Lord in
[31:39] their trouble and he delivered them out
[31:41] of their distresses
[31:46] and and he led them forth by the right
[31:50] way that they might go to a city of
[31:56] habitation
[31:58] that's talking about is that how the
[31:59] Lord
[32:00] [Music]
[32:02] provided
[32:03] amen how he was
[32:05] [Music]
[32:06] there but notice when they cried
[32:10] out that's what made the
[32:13] difference because they had a
[32:15] desperation in their
[32:17] heart amen and that if we could have
[32:20] that same
[32:22] desperation cry to the
[32:25] Lord saying we we're here

[33:33] our
[33:36] heart it's something that with words we

[1:07:35] something that'll be a help to the
[1:07:37] people
[1:07:39] there it's it's kind of a heavy
[1:07:44] burden churches are Ministries are at
[1:07:46] different
[1:07:50] stages and there's different things that
[1:07:52] that particular people are going going
[1:07:56] through so so we don't want to go and
[1:07:58] just say something that's that that
[1:08:00] doesn't relate to the struggles they're
[1:08:02] they're
[1:08:08] having we want to say something that God
[1:08:11] wants us to say just for

[1:09:19] that service go
[1:09:22] and and how how we' like to divide it up
[1:09:26] and let people share whatever is on
[1:09:28] their hearts
[1:09:31] and we'll we'll get together later just
[1:09:34] before that
[1:09:37] time we're continuing here preaching on
[1:09:40] part
[1:09:42] six of marriage and
[1:09:45] divorce was the title and the subject in
[1:09:48] the mouth of two or three
[1:09:51] Witnesses because that's exact exactly
[1:09:54] how the revelation of this of this
[1:09:57] teaching
[1:10:00] is and uh brother Brandon preached the
[1:10:03] message marriage and
[1:10:05] divorce and and and God allowed him to
[1:10:09] show
[1:10:10] us and bring these loose ends
[1:10:14] together that it was in the mouth of
[1:10:16] these three
[1:10:18] witnesses that that God was going to
[1:10:21] reveal to
[1:10:22] us
[1:10:24] uh this Brokenness amongst the human
[1:10:29] race and and and things of how to do it
[1:10:35] correctly and and and and and things of
[1:10:38] how to help those that are already in a
[1:10:40] broken
[1:10:45] condition by the grace of
[1:10:47] God we continue here in in part
[1:10:52] six
[1:10:55] and the three
[1:10:57] Witnesses was the Lord Jesus
[1:11:00] himself the Apostle Paul and Moses a
[1:11:05] prophet of God all three of them
[1:11:08] prophets Jesus being a god
[1:11:13] prophet and and yet and and the greatest
[1:11:17] of all the
[1:11:19] prophets the Apostle Paul prophet Moses
[1:11:23] a prophet but to bring these three
[1:11:26] Witnesses
[1:11:28] together then once again it also took a
[1:11:32] prophet but once a prophet brings it
[1:11:35] together then the book is open and
[1:11:38] Revelation is Flowing God's
[1:11:42] people and and though God would take his
[1:11:44] Prophet
[1:11:46] home the god of the prophets is still
[1:11:49] here to continue to open and bring us
[1:11:52] more revelation
[1:11:56] details hooking word with
[1:11:59] word line upon line and we see it all
[1:12:02] flow together
[1:12:06] just let's uh read once again the
[1:12:10] scripture we've been
[1:12:12] sharing first Thessalonians
[1:12:14] 4 the Apostle Paul verses
[1:12:22] 1-7 first Thessalonians
[1:12:26] 4 and the first verse and it says
[1:12:30] furthermore then we beseech you Brethren
[1:12:32] and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as
[1:12:35] ye have received of us how ye ought to
[1:12:38] walk and to please God so ye would
[1:12:41] abound more and
[1:12:50] more for you know what Commandments we
[1:12:53] gave you by the Lord
[1:12:57] Jesus for this is the will of God even
[1:13:00] your
[1:13:03] sanctification that you should abstain
[1:13:05] from
[1:13:07] fornication that every one of you should
[1:13:09] know how to possess his vessel in
[1:13:11] sanctification and
[1:13:16] honor not in the lust of concupiscence
[1:13:19] even as the Gentiles which know not
[1:13:22] God
[1:13:25] that no man go beyond and defraud his
[1:13:27] brother in any
[1:13:30] matter because the Lord is the Avenger
[1:13:33] of all such as we also have forewarned
[1:13:36] you and
[1:13:40] testified for God hath not called us
[1:13:43] unto
[1:13:46] uncleanness but un to
[1:13:49] Holiness let's pray Heavenly Father we
[1:13:52] thank you
[1:13:55] add your blessing to your
[1:13:57] word bring Revelation to our
[1:14:00] hearts that Revelation would bring a
[1:14:05] growth and that we could grow into the
[1:14:07] stature of a perfect
[1:14:09] man in Jesus name amen amen you may be
[1:14:20] seated Matthew 19 m
[1:14:24] we begin at verse
[1:14:28] one Jesus had finished
[1:14:33] speaking sharing Parables with the
[1:14:37] people and within those Parables were
[1:14:39] hidden great mysterious
[1:14:45] truths that would later be divinely
[1:14:50] revealed and that divine revelation
[1:14:55] was to be in our day and it was to be
[1:14:58] and we were to be that
[1:15:00] people Matthew 19
[1:15:02] verse1 it came to pass that when Jesus
[1:15:05] had finished these
[1:15:09] sayings he departed from Galilee and
[1:15:11] came into the coast of Judea Beyond
[1:15:17] Jordan and great multitudes followed him
[1:15:21] and he healed them there
[1:15:25] it was for the healings and the Miracles
[1:15:27] that they followed
[1:15:30] him he he his ministry had
[1:15:34] changes it had a first
[1:15:36] pole had a second pole when he would
[1:15:39] pray for the sick in Matthew 4 and
[1:15:43] thousands and thousands would
[1:15:46] gather and hundreds and thousands would
[1:15:48] be
[1:15:50] healed then he come to a place where the
[1:15:52] ministry Ministry shifted went to a
[1:15:55] higher
[1:15:58] level he was still praying for the
[1:16:00] sick but then now he was Discerning the
[1:16:03] hearts of people
[1:16:06] also so now they were more
[1:16:09] cautious they didn't want to be in the
[1:16:11] prayer
[1:16:12] line if their sins were going to be
[1:16:15] found
[1:16:16] out the word had gone and the ministry
[1:16:18] had gone to a higher
[1:16:21] level even as it did in this 20th
[1:16:24] century with us and verse three says and
[1:16:26] Pharisees also came unto him tempting
[1:16:29] him and saying unto him is it lawful for
[1:16:32] a man to put away his wife for every
[1:16:41] cause and he answered and said unto them
[1:16:44] have ye not read that he which made them
[1:16:46] at the beginning made them male and
[1:16:52] female
[1:16:54] he got Stern with
[1:16:57] him he start he they pushed on
[1:17:00] him he pushed back he said I thought you
[1:17:04] guys were Bible
[1:17:07] readers I thought you guys are studying
[1:17:09] the Scrolls all the
[1:17:12] time he said because if you have you
[1:17:15] would have read this part and at the
[1:17:18] beginning he made them male and
[1:17:22] female and said and for this
[1:17:26] cause shall for this word that was
[1:17:29] written
[1:17:30] there shall a man leave father and
[1:17:34] mother and cleave to his wife and they
[1:17:38] twain shall be one
[1:17:40] flesh wherefore they are no more Twain
[1:17:44] but one
[1:17:48] flesh then he drops the bomb on
[1:17:50] them what therefore God had joined
[1:17:55] together how dare you ministers put it
[1:18:05] aunder they say unto
[1:18:07] him why did
[1:18:10] Moses that great prophet of God
[1:18:13] Vindicated
[1:18:16] Prophet
[1:18:18] command a commandment they tell them to
[1:18:21] give a writing of divorce and put her
[1:18:25] away Jesus said that's an easy one
[1:18:30] that's a very easy question you asked
[1:18:33] me he said unto them Moses because of
[1:18:37] the hardness of your
[1:18:39] hearts the same thing you're manifesting
[1:18:42] right now in front of
[1:18:43] me because of the hardness of your
[1:18:46] hearts suffered you to put away your
[1:18:48] wives but from the beginning it was not
[1:18:51] so
[1:18:55] and I say unto you whosoever shall put
[1:18:58] away his wife except it be for
[1:19:04] fornication and this is where the
[1:19:06] language that Jesus
[1:19:09] used speaking in a parable
[1:19:13] form mixing the term of
[1:19:17] wife with the word
[1:19:19] fornication which seems
[1:19:21] odd because usually the word
[1:19:25] fornication would be used for people
[1:19:27] living in sin who are single people not
[1:19:33] married but here he uses it concerning
[1:19:35] the putting away of his
[1:19:40] wife that he said he says whosoever
[1:19:43] shall put away his wife except it be for
[1:19:48] fornication not
[1:19:50] adultery shall and and shall marry
[1:19:54] another committeth
[1:19:57] adultery and whosoever marrieth her
[1:20:00] which is put away doth commit
[1:20:04] adultery his th disciples say unto him
[1:20:07] if the case of the man be so with his
[1:20:13] wife it's not good to
[1:20:18] marry if we don't have that
[1:20:21] right if we can't have that little paper
[1:20:24] and Pen in
[1:20:27] Hand to put her away when we want
[1:20:31] to why would we even want to get
[1:20:35] married that was the
[1:20:37] mentality under the law of men Sinners
[1:20:42] and Saints
[1:20:44] alike Jews Philistines
[1:20:48] amorites the entire
[1:20:51] world
[1:20:55] but he said unto them all men cannot
[1:20:59] receive this
[1:21:04] Revelation save they to whom it is
[1:21:08] given Jesus
[1:21:10] speaking Jesus was our first
[1:21:14] witness one of three for in the mouth of
[1:21:18] three
[1:21:19] Witnesses was this teaching made more
[1:21:23] clear to
[1:21:29] us
[1:21:31] Jesus
[1:21:34] Moses and the Apostle
[1:21:37] Paul and Jesus in his
[1:21:40] teaching and speaking to the
[1:21:42] Pharisees he immediately takes them
[1:21:46] back to the
[1:21:49] beginning immediately takes him back to
[1:21:51] the beginning
[1:21:53] because that's where he's wanting to
[1:21:55] take us to is the
[1:21:58] beginning he took them back there for
[1:22:01] the
[1:22:03] teaching but he wants to take us back
[1:22:07] there for a place where life will be
[1:22:09] Eternal with him in his
[1:22:13] presence more than just a
[1:22:17] teaching in the mouth of two or three
[1:22:20] Witnesses God was establish l
[1:22:24] in these
[1:22:28] truths in Genesis
[1:22:31] 3 we read
[1:22:33] of the tribunal the Judgment that that
[1:22:37] that Came Upon Adam Eve The
[1:22:42] Serpent and and in verse
[1:22:45] 16 God speaking to the
[1:22:48] woman bringing
[1:22:51] Judgment of the things that will now
[1:22:53] befall
[1:22:56] her and what she has brought on her
[1:23:00] gender and he says unto the woman he
[1:23:02] said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:23:04] and thy
[1:23:08] conception it wasn't to be that way in
[1:23:11] the
[1:23:12] beginning this was because of the
[1:23:14] fall and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[1:23:19] children it wasn't supposed to be that
[1:23:21] way original plan of
[1:23:24] God he says and thy desire shall be to
[1:23:27] thy
[1:23:28] husband because she had also put her
[1:23:31] desire to another
[1:23:34] man and he shall rule over
[1:23:39] thee in the beginning they were
[1:23:43] co-equal but when Eve fell into this
[1:23:48] transgression it brought judgment unto
[1:23:51] her and to all
[1:23:54] women in this
[1:23:56] fall and and in the beginning God had
[1:23:59] made them
[1:24:01] co-equal the the husband didn't rule
[1:24:04] over
[1:24:05] her but now he would rule over
[1:24:10] her and him being a fallen creature
[1:24:16] himself that would bring more
[1:24:19] complications a fallen man a beastly man
[1:24:24] now ruling
[1:24:25] over the woman who had fallen
[1:24:29] also you see the picture we're in
[1:24:32] today but there is hope and the hope
[1:24:35] when is when Jesus came to
[1:24:40] Nicodemus Jesus came to Nicodemus and
[1:24:43] told him you must be born
[1:24:46] again to break the
[1:24:48] curse to break the curse up upon the
[1:24:51] Earth
[1:24:53] you must be born again to break the
[1:24:56] curse that's upon the
[1:24:58] woman you must be born again break the
[1:25:02] curse that's upon
[1:25:03] you for the Earth groans and moans for
[1:25:06] the
[1:25:10] manifestation man that can take God at
[1:25:12] his
[1:25:13] word break the curse of the
[1:25:17] family God rich in
[1:25:20] Mercy and the in the mouth of three
[1:25:24] Witnesses bringing
[1:25:26] us this divinely
[1:25:37] revealed the truth of marriage and
[1:25:39] divorce in the mouth of three
[1:25:43] Witnesses Jesus Paul and Moses and
[1:25:48] brother Branham tied the loose ends
[1:25:51] together of what Jesus said what Paul
[1:25:55] said what Moses said in
[1:25:58] Genesis for Moses was the one that wrote
[1:26:01] the Book of
[1:26:02] Genesis and he wrote down the New
[1:26:05] Covenant that God had given the
[1:26:09] woman all all three of these men were
[1:26:15] prophets with thus sayith the Lord and
[1:26:18] it would require prophetic
[1:26:21] Ministry
[1:26:22] to tie them
[1:26:24] together so the revelation of marriage
[1:26:26] and
[1:26:27] divorce once again has come to us in the
[1:26:31] mouth of three
[1:26:33] Witnesses Jesus the first
[1:26:40] witness in in Matthew in M there 19
[1:26:48] verse3 the Pharisees also came unto him
[1:26:50] tempting him and saying unto him is it
[1:26:53] lawful for a man to put away his wife
[1:26:55] for every
[1:27:01] cause and he answered and said unto them
[1:27:04] have ye not read that he which made them
[1:27:06] at the beginning made them male and
[1:27:11] female and said for this cause shall a
[1:27:14] man leave father and mother and shall
[1:27:16] cleave to his wife they twain shall be
[1:27:19] one
[1:27:21] flesh
[1:27:25] wherefore there are no more Twain but
[1:27:27] one
[1:27:29] flesh therefore God ha joined
[1:27:32] together let no man put us son that's
[1:27:36] why a prophet said he says You must
[1:27:38] consider marriage
[1:27:43] prayerfully that indeed it's God putting
[1:27:46] this together this making this
[1:27:50] Union for what God joins
[1:27:53] together man can never put it
[1:27:56] aunder but most marriages
[1:28:00] today isn't God putting it
[1:28:03] together that's why they're put
[1:28:05] aunder that's why they're divorced after
[1:28:08] six
[1:28:09] months that's why they're divorce after
[1:28:11] a
[1:28:12] year that's why they separate after five
[1:28:15] years that's why some after 25
[1:28:19] years they say I'm done we're we're
[1:28:21] divor
[1:28:24] in approached
[1:28:28] prayerfully asking God for a
[1:28:32] revelation of who will
[1:28:34] be my partner until death to me
[1:28:42] part they say unto him why did Moses in
[1:28:45] command to give a writing a divorcement
[1:28:47] and put her
[1:28:50] away and this is a the answer for many
[1:28:54] things in our
[1:28:56] lives and he saith unto them Moses
[1:29:00] because of the hardness of your hearts
[1:29:03] suffered you to put away your wives but
[1:29:06] from the beginning it was not
[1:29:13] so and I say unto you whosoever shall
[1:29:17] put away his wife except it be for
[1:29:20] fornication
[1:29:25] the only
[1:29:27] exception and shall marry
[1:29:30] another he's talking to the man
[1:29:33] now committeth adultery and whosoever
[1:29:36] marri her which is put
[1:29:39] away do commit
[1:29:43] adultery his disciples sayto him if the
[1:29:46] case of the man be so with his wife it's
[1:29:49] not good to
[1:29:50] marry
[1:29:55] because not
[1:29:57] everybody will
[1:29:59] marry by Faith by
[1:30:02] Revelation and base the relationship
[1:30:05] around the word of
[1:30:07] God if you're going to have a lasting
[1:30:11] marriage it's got to be based on God's
[1:30:15] word the two of you must have the same
[1:30:20] absolute I guess I guess uh another way
[1:30:24] to say
[1:30:27] it is you've got to live by the same
[1:30:31] rules you got to live by the same
[1:30:34] book then there'll be
[1:30:36] peace then there'll be the love of God
[1:30:38] in your
[1:30:40] hearts then you'll make wiser
[1:30:44] decisions then you'll give your marriage
[1:30:49] 100% because a marriage is not
[1:30:54] 5050 if the man gives
[1:30:57] 50 expecting the woman to give
[1:31:00] 50 that will be a miserable
[1:31:04] relationship no no the man has to give
[1:31:08] 100% no matter what the wife is
[1:31:11] doing
[1:31:13] regardless you picked her now do her
[1:31:20] justice
[1:31:24] you said God gave me this
[1:31:27] girl now Treat Her Like A Daughter of
[1:31:33] Zion God never changed the one
[1:31:38] Commandment that he left for
[1:31:41] sinner or Saint to abide
[1:31:47] by so even under
[1:31:50] polygamy there might be some order and
[1:31:53] mercy for the
[1:31:56] woman but God never he says you can't
[1:31:59] and and and and that
[1:32:02] mercy and that
[1:32:04] statement there was a commandment from
[1:32:06] the
[1:32:07] beginning from
[1:32:09] Genesis to the whole human race even in
[1:32:12] a fallen condition to the man and that
[1:32:17] was you cannot take another man's
[1:32:20] wife
[1:32:22] it pollutes the Earth every time a man
[1:32:24] does
[1:32:30] it that still applies
[1:32:32] today and here is the Bible reason
[1:32:36] why and this is the woman's New Covenant
[1:32:39] after the
[1:32:41] fall a woman is bound to her
[1:32:46] husband as long as he
[1:32:48] lives that's the Covenant that the woman
[1:32:51] is under
[1:32:55] you say that's not
[1:32:57] right no it's not
[1:32:59] right and it wasn't that way in the
[1:33:03] beginning God made her co-equal with the
[1:33:07] man the woman broke God's word Ste out
[1:33:11] from behind the protection of the word
[1:33:12] of
[1:33:13] God and brought the
[1:33:16] fall of all the women brought the fall
[1:33:21] of of all nature brought the fall of
[1:33:27] H Genesis
[1:33:30] 3:16 unto the woman he
[1:33:33] said I'll greatly multiply thy sorrow
[1:33:36] and thy
[1:33:39] conception sorrow Thou shalt bring forth
[1:33:42] children and thy desire shall be to thy
[1:33:46] husband now we understand why all those
[1:33:48] things were
[1:33:50] said because because her desire had been
[1:33:52] to another other than her
[1:33:55] husband and that's what had broken that
[1:33:58] family
[1:34:00] bond that's what broke her fellowship
[1:34:02] and friendship with the
[1:34:06] father and then he said and he shall
[1:34:09] rule over thee from now
[1:34:15] on God made them
[1:34:19] co-equal that is still God's desire
[1:34:23] for the man and for the
[1:34:25] woman that the only ruler you'll ever
[1:34:30] have the only guide you'll ever
[1:34:34] need is
[1:34:40] him when a woman accepts a man's
[1:34:44] proposal for
[1:34:46] marriage a lot of this we are
[1:34:50] backgrounding we've done it every
[1:34:53] Service as we try to connect it
[1:34:56] all so when a woman accepts a man's
[1:34:58] proposal for
[1:35:02] marriage if she has a head at home a
[1:35:04] father at
[1:35:07] home he he has helped
[1:35:09] her to to choose a righteous God-fearing
[1:35:14] man that's what a father should
[1:35:18] do that's his
[1:35:20] responsibility is to be a Watchman in
[1:35:23] the tower of his
[1:35:26] house that's the things he to be
[1:35:28] watching
[1:35:30] for we must help our daughters
[1:35:34] choose we want them to marry a man they
[1:35:37] love but we as
[1:35:39] fathers must be
[1:35:41] involved to judge of the man is
[1:35:45] worthy when our daughters marry we we
[1:35:48] turn over full
[1:35:50] headship
[1:35:52] to another
[1:35:53] man you can't fix it once you've given
[1:35:56] her
[1:35:58] away you do wrong to get into their
[1:36:01] business once you give them
[1:36:05] away your business is not to give her
[1:36:08] away until you find the right Godly
[1:36:11] [Music]
[1:36:20] Man
[1:36:32] we turn over full
[1:36:35] headship I
[1:36:37] understand that a young man asking you
[1:36:40] to marry your
[1:36:44] daughter he has no
[1:36:46] idea the responsibility he's asking
[1:36:50] for
[1:36:51] and most
[1:36:53] fathers have no
[1:36:55] idea what they're giving
[1:36:58] away full Authority and
[1:37:01] power over that young
[1:37:04] lady you're giving it all
[1:37:08] away it's got to mean something to
[1:37:11] you we've got to take it
[1:37:14] seriously we've got to we've got to see
[1:37:16] how the the longl lasting effects it'll
[1:37:19] have on
[1:37:25] how long we
[1:37:27] say sometimes all our lives on planet
[1:37:31] Earth it's
[1:37:34] serious it can mean the difference
[1:37:36] between happiness in a
[1:37:40] home or a house of
[1:37:46] hell so we turn our we turn over full
[1:37:49] headship to another man
[1:37:53] and she is bound to that
[1:37:56] man as long as he
[1:37:59] lives if they
[1:38:01] divorce dear sister you cannot by the
[1:38:05] word of
[1:38:06] God
[1:38:07] remarry unless he
[1:38:10] dies or you find yourself to be an
[1:38:14] adulteress and he finds himself to be an
[1:38:19] adulterer is it fair
[1:38:22] as we would say as human beings is
[1:38:25] fair no it's not but God Made You
[1:38:31] co-equal with
[1:38:34] man he's not the
[1:38:36] one that put put us into this world of
[1:38:40] sin he simply gave us free moral
[1:38:44] agency to choose between right and
[1:38:48] wrong because he didn't want a people
[1:38:50] that were his
[1:38:52] puppets he went out he wanted a family
[1:38:54] that loved him and served him because
[1:38:57] they loved
[1:39:00] him Lucifer Luci through the
[1:39:03] serpent Lucifer
[1:39:06] enticed
[1:39:09] Lucifer anointed this this beast called
[1:39:12] The
[1:39:14] Serpent that beguiled
[1:39:17] Eve first with his
[1:39:20] words
[1:39:21] and Disobedience to God's
[1:39:24] word aned Eve's first
[1:39:28] Covenant where she was
[1:39:30] co-equal and gave her a
[1:39:33] covenant that was now
[1:39:35] equal to her
[1:39:43] conduct the Bible says all that we
[1:39:47] sow we
[1:39:50] reap
[1:39:52] Matthew
[1:39:53] 19:7 they say unto him why did Moses
[1:39:57] then command to give a writing a
[1:39:59] divorcement and put her
[1:40:04] away Jesus said the why doesn't lay on
[1:40:08] the
[1:40:10] woman no no the why for the for the for
[1:40:13] the writing of divorcement lays on the
[1:40:18] man and in verse eight he saith unto him
[1:40:21] Moses because the hardness of your
[1:40:24] hearts suffered you to put away your
[1:40:28] wives because of
[1:40:30] you hard-hearted
[1:40:33] men who really weren't
[1:40:36] worthy of the daughters of
[1:40:41] Zion but from the beginning it wasn't
[1:40:45] so and then he goes in verse 9 again and
[1:40:49] I say unto you who whoever shall put
[1:40:51] away his wife except it be for
[1:40:54] [Music]
[1:40:58] fornication remember there's now Jesus
[1:41:01] is saying there's only one
[1:41:04] reason
[1:41:06] one why a man could put away his
[1:41:10] wife and the big question and marry
[1:41:14] again only one reason
[1:41:18] Jesus they had any reason before for
[1:41:21] 4,000
[1:41:24] years and Jesus Takes It All Away like
[1:41:30] that because what they
[1:41:32] had was a
[1:41:34] proverb and
[1:41:36] Proverbs can and will be
[1:41:40] annuled this wasn't the first
[1:41:46] one his disciples say unto him
[1:41:53] he say and and shall marry another
[1:41:56] committeth adultery and whosoever Marth
[1:41:58] her which is put away do commit
[1:42:07] adultery his disciples say unto
[1:42:10] him if if the case of man be so with his
[1:42:17] wife it's not good to
[1:42:19] marry
[1:42:21] remember it's it's one
[1:42:25] cause not two
[1:42:28] fornication not fornication and
[1:42:31] adultery that gives you a right to
[1:42:35] remarry because then that would
[1:42:38] be two causes two reasons and Jesus
[1:42:42] didn't give two he gave
[1:42:44] one so Jesus is now opening the book
[1:42:47] that's been sealed with Seven
[1:42:49] Seals
[1:42:52] and telling you now the truth of
[1:42:53] marriage and
[1:42:56] divorce he he said I say unto
[1:43:00] you whosoever shall put away his
[1:43:03] wife except it be for
[1:43:06] fornication and shall marry another
[1:43:09] committeth adultery and whosoever
[1:43:12] marrieth her which is put away does
[1:43:14] commit
[1:43:16] adultery so Jesus now tells
[1:43:19] us despite many
[1:43:23] opinions there's only one
[1:43:25] exception for a man to put away his
[1:43:29] wife sinner or
[1:43:33] Saint preacher or a hell's Angel's
[1:43:37] [Music]
[1:43:41] biker it doesn't matter if you're a
[1:43:44] Believer or an
[1:43:47] unbeliever because God will judge This
[1:43:49] World by One
[1:43:52] Thing by the word of God Jesus
[1:43:56] Christ every man every woman will be
[1:43:58] judged by the word of
[1:44:01] God sin or
[1:44:03] Saint ignorant or
[1:44:07] aware one day before God all will stand
[1:44:11] and be
[1:44:14] judged by the very same
[1:44:18] word w won't be a different measuring
[1:44:20] stick for
[1:44:24] anybody so Jesus now tells us there's
[1:44:28] just one exception for a man to put away
[1:44:31] his wife and Mar another that's
[1:44:34] fornication now the great debate we
[1:44:37] have the many schools of what does
[1:44:40] fornication
[1:44:43] mean you won't find it through
[1:44:47] reasoning you won't find it in any
[1:44:49] dictionary
[1:44:51] not even a Bible
[1:44:54] dictionary we will find the
[1:44:57] definition back in
[1:44:59] Genesis of what Jesus meant when he
[1:45:02] said except that be for
[1:45:06] fornication so what
[1:45:08] happened in
[1:45:11] Genesis that reveals the
[1:45:15] statement that Jesus
[1:45:17] made Eve before before she's intimate
[1:45:21] with her
[1:45:23] husband has an intimate
[1:45:27] relationship with this most subtile
[1:45:29] beast of the
[1:45:31] field the
[1:45:33] serpent who to look at was a
[1:45:37] man the most subtile beast of the
[1:45:40] field and he plants a
[1:45:43] seed in her
[1:45:45] womb and it brings forth a
[1:45:48] Cain the son of the wicked
[1:45:51] what has she done she is a
[1:45:57] damsel who has surrendered her
[1:46:00] virginity to another man with whom she
[1:46:04] had no intention of
[1:46:07] marrying then approaches
[1:46:09] Adam who is unaware of her
[1:46:13] condition who is who is her betroth
[1:46:16] [Music]
[1:46:18] husband now both their eyes are
[1:46:21] open and equally
[1:46:24] ashamed Eve was a
[1:46:27] damsel and a virgin with a betroth
[1:46:31] husband in other words engaged to be
[1:46:39] married a woman
[1:46:43] betro she was Adam's
[1:46:46] wife but they had not lived together
[1:46:49] intimately
[1:46:52] just like Joseph and
[1:46:55] Mary Mary was Joseph's
[1:46:58] wife but yet they had not been together
[1:47:01] and lived together as husband and
[1:47:06] wife according to the Jewish
[1:47:10] religion their culture their
[1:47:13] rituals that when a man when a woman
[1:47:17] accepted a proposal for marriage from a
[1:47:22] man then in Jewish
[1:47:25] culture she was that man's wife
[1:47:30] already she was the
[1:47:32] bride she was now to have a time of
[1:47:36] preparation to Adorn
[1:47:39] herself get her wedding dress
[1:47:42] ready for the day when they would have a
[1:47:45] public display their display their their
[1:47:49] their their their their vows one to
[1:47:54] another then Joseph would take Mary to
[1:47:57] live with him
[1:48:00] forever it's a type and the shadow of we
[1:48:03] the bride of
[1:48:05] Christ we ministered on
[1:48:08] that are we the bride or we the wife
[1:48:11] well according to the Eastern
[1:48:16] culture the
[1:48:18] bride was the
[1:48:20] wife preparing adorning
[1:48:24] herself getting her wedding dress
[1:48:29] ready for the wedding day when the
[1:48:33] husband would come and take her away you
[1:48:37] see the type and Shadow of the bride of
[1:48:40] Christ of a Rapture so when are we the
[1:48:44] Lamb's
[1:48:46] wife we already the Lamb's
[1:48:49] wife we the Lamb's bride we are now the
[1:48:53] bride of
[1:48:54] Christ so who is this
[1:48:56] bride this bride is the wife who is
[1:49:00] adorning herself and getting her wedding
[1:49:03] dress
[1:49:04] ready what do that mean adorning herself
[1:49:08] preparing her wedding
[1:49:11] day this is what it means repent and be
[1:49:14] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:49:18] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[1:49:21] and that Holy Ghost
[1:49:23] experience will lead you and guide
[1:49:26] you it will bring you to be justified by
[1:49:30] faith it'll it'll urge you you want to
[1:49:33] live a holy life and be Sanctified by
[1:49:35] the
[1:49:37] spirit it'll bring you to a higher
[1:49:40] level to a friendship with the
[1:49:43] father that when you pray you know he
[1:49:47] hears because you've heard from him
[1:49:51] before being
[1:49:53] adorned getting your wedding dress
[1:49:58] ready for a catching away for a
[1:50:03] Rapture the last
[1:50:05] change what is a
[1:50:07] bride she is the
[1:50:09] wife being
[1:50:12] changed from Glory glor glor from Faith
[1:50:17] to Virtue to patience
[1:50:20] to Temperance to knowledge to brotherly
[1:50:25] kindness to the Capstone of the love of
[1:50:32] God do you see
[1:50:35] it are you his wife now you
[1:50:39] are we're still in this body of
[1:50:42] Flesh so we're wanting to go through
[1:50:45] these stages of
[1:50:48] changes to get get to the final
[1:50:51] change a body
[1:50:54] change the
[1:50:57] wedding where the
[1:50:58] groom catches you
[1:51:01] away to the wedding supper of the
[1:51:05] Lamb to live with him
[1:51:18] eternally
[1:51:28] Eve was a
[1:51:31] damel and a
[1:51:33] virgin betroth to a
[1:51:35] husband his name was
[1:51:38] Adam she was Adam's
[1:51:41] wife but they had not lived together
[1:51:45] intimately today we would say they were
[1:51:48] engaged this is the
[1:51:51] fornication that Jesus spoke of that a
[1:51:54] man could leave his
[1:51:56] wife and marry another this is the one
[1:52:01] exception it's the decision that Joseph
[1:52:03] had made with
[1:52:06] Mary when they found that Mary was great
[1:52:09] with
[1:52:11] child and he knew it wasn't his
[1:52:14] child because the wedding day hadn't
[1:52:16] come
[1:52:18] yet they had not lived together so he
[1:52:21] thought that
[1:52:24] Mary if she was his child then she's
[1:52:27] been with another
[1:52:29] man she gave away her sacred virtue to
[1:52:32] another
[1:52:34] man now Moses had now now Joseph
[1:52:39] had a new testament
[1:52:43] right to put his wife
[1:52:47] away and marry another
[1:52:50] here in
[1:52:51] Genesis this is the fornication that
[1:52:54] Jesus spoke
[1:52:55] of why a man could leave his wife and
[1:52:59] marry another and this is the one
[1:53:02] exception before Adam knew his wife
[1:53:07] intimately Eve had already defiled
[1:53:11] herself with another
[1:53:15] partner and Adam knew it
[1:53:17] not even Eve hid it from him
[1:53:21] until his eyes came
[1:53:23] open then God
[1:53:25] descended to judge them a white Throne
[1:53:30] judgment in this judgment the serpent
[1:53:32] the Beast is
[1:53:36] cursed in its physical
[1:53:38] body where it's where it's not would be
[1:53:41] now
[1:53:43] unrecognizable it will never be capable
[1:53:46] again of defiling a
[1:53:48] woman
[1:53:51] but it has already planted his seed of
[1:53:53] every Wicked attribute that it
[1:53:58] has and the family of
[1:54:01] God has been genetically
[1:54:05] modified in the
[1:54:08] beginning this GMO stuff is nothing
[1:54:14] new since the
[1:54:16] beginning science has just not been
[1:54:19] breaking into it the last 100 years
[1:54:24] maybe because Lucifer's been anointing
[1:54:28] them because it if it destroyed the
[1:54:31] first
[1:54:32] family and brought down the human
[1:54:36] race then he's playing the same games
[1:54:39] over and over
[1:54:41] again just as Jesus Christ is the same
[1:54:45] yesterday today and
[1:54:47] forever and when you see him do
[1:54:51] something and honor Faith you can be
[1:54:54] sure that if you meet those
[1:54:58] [Music]
[1:54:59] requirements he'll honor your faith
[1:55:03] again well Satan works the same way
[1:55:09] also the definition of
[1:55:12] fornication that Jesus spoke of is found
[1:55:16] in the act that Eve
[1:55:18] committed
[1:55:20] against her husband
[1:55:22] Adam before they ever knew each other
[1:55:26] intimately Even Adam were husband and
[1:55:30] wife but had never
[1:55:34] cohabitated they had never entered into
[1:55:36] an intimate
[1:55:39] relationship therefore in Genesis
[1:55:42] 3 when Eve was meeting with the
[1:55:45] serpent she's a
[1:55:48] virgin a damn
[1:55:50] and she was another man's
[1:55:54] wife Eve in Genesis
[1:55:58] 3 is Virgin and yet Adam's
[1:56:01] wife according to Old Testament
[1:56:05] customs of the Jews marriages were
[1:56:08] arranged by
[1:56:13] Elders many times of both
[1:56:16] families with a consent of the girl if
[1:56:18] she was of age
[1:56:22] I say that because many a Jewish
[1:56:26] men sold their
[1:56:31] daughters without their
[1:56:34] consent once they entered into the
[1:56:38] agreement whether whether the girl was
[1:56:42] bought or the intention was to be part
[1:56:45] to be the man's wife from the
[1:56:48] beginning
[1:56:51] but once they entered into the agreement
[1:56:53] they were they were considered man and
[1:56:56] wife in all legal and religious
[1:57:04] aspects legal and
[1:57:09] religious except that of
[1:57:13] cohabitation living
[1:57:16] together so to be
[1:57:18] betr
[1:57:20] was to contract an
[1:57:24] actual but but incomplete
[1:57:29] marriage once
[1:57:31] betr there was a waiting
[1:57:34] period sometimes as much as 12
[1:57:36] months not always but when the marriage
[1:57:40] was being taken was was was was was
[1:57:45] between a free
[1:57:48] woman
[1:57:49] of Israel A Daughter of Zion then there'
[1:57:53] be a waiting
[1:57:55] period as much as 12 months and then the
[1:57:59] wedding
[1:58:00] ceremony where man and
[1:58:03] wife would have a public
[1:58:06] ceremony and from that day
[1:58:08] on lived together thus now the marriage
[1:58:15] complete and the father turns
[1:58:17] over full head ship to another
[1:58:21] man until then the father holds full
[1:58:27] headship and he could even annul the
[1:58:33] betral once
[1:58:35] married he has no more
[1:58:38] headship over his daughter once married
[1:58:44] dad you have no more
[1:58:47] headship over the the
[1:58:51] daughter you must go to her
[1:58:54] head if you think something you want to
[1:58:57] make a
[1:59:01] recommendation that's hard to
[1:59:04] swallow no it's my daughter and if I
[1:59:07] want to tell her something and that guy
[1:59:08] don't like it no
[1:59:14] no we've got to go back to the
[1:59:17] word not to our emotions
[1:59:20] not to our
[1:59:24] feelings if we don't like
[1:59:26] it there there is a way to get out of
[1:59:32] it Jesus said the way to get
[1:59:36] out you must be born
[1:59:39] again that's the
[1:59:41] start to get us out of this
[1:59:45] condition to get us out of this
[1:59:47] body and into a
[1:59:50] theophany into a Celestial
[1:59:52] body back to the
[1:59:57] beginning in Deuteronomy
[2:00:01] 22 and verse
[2:00:04] 22 it says
[2:00:07] this if a man be found lying with a
[2:00:10] woman married to a
[2:00:16] husband then they shall both of them die
[2:00:20] both the man that lay with the
[2:00:23] woman and the woman so shall thou put
[2:00:26] away evil from
[2:00:29] Israel remember the parable in the of
[2:00:34] Jesus Pharisees and men brought a woman
[2:00:37] to
[2:00:38] him cast her on the
[2:00:41] ground and he said this woman we caught
[2:00:44] her in the very Act of
[2:00:48] adultery
[2:00:50] Moses said she ought to be
[2:00:53] stoned the Bible says he said
[2:00:55] nothing and he began writing on the
[2:00:59] ground the Bible
[2:01:01] says one by
[2:01:03] one the men
[2:01:06] left they knew the
[2:01:09] law my guess is Jesus
[2:01:17] wrote here is the woman
[2:01:20] but where is the
[2:01:22] man and they
[2:01:29] go verse 23 says if a damsel see if a if
[2:01:34] a man be found lying with a woman
[2:01:36] married to a husband then they shall
[2:01:38] both of them die both the man that
[2:01:40] layeth with the woman and the woman so
[2:01:43] shall thou put away evil from
[2:01:48] Israel
[2:01:54] if a damsel that is a virgin be betr
[2:01:57] unto a man and a man find her in the
[2:02:00] city and lie with
[2:02:08] her verse 22 sounds like it's just
[2:02:11] repeating verse
[2:02:15] 23 but one is a woman
[2:02:17] married
[2:02:20] in other words their wedding day they've
[2:02:22] already had
[2:02:26] it this is past the
[2:02:29] engagement past the time of
[2:02:33] adorning this this is after the wedding
[2:02:36] takes place
[2:02:38] publicly but verse
[2:02:40] 23 says if a damsel that is a virgin be
[2:02:43] betrothed unto a
[2:02:46] husband engaged
[2:02:49] they have not been together yet and a
[2:02:52] man find her in the city and lie with
[2:02:55] her then you shall bring them both out
[2:02:57] into the gate of the
[2:03:00] city and you shall Stone them with
[2:03:02] stones that they
[2:03:04] die the damel because she cried
[2:03:08] not being in the
[2:03:11] city and the man because Heath humbled
[2:03:14] his neighbor's
[2:03:16] wife so Thou shalt put away evil from
[2:03:19] among
[2:03:21] you today we have a similar
[2:03:24] process called being
[2:03:27] engaged your your
[2:03:30] fiance it's an old French
[2:03:33] word simply meaning a man or a woman
[2:03:37] engaged to be
[2:03:40] married so Eve here in
[2:03:44] Genesis was a damsel a virgin betrothed
[2:03:48] unto a husband
[2:03:51] Adam and another man finds her in the
[2:03:56] garden and convinces
[2:03:58] her of a
[2:04:01] shortcut and they commit an intimate
[2:04:04] act with a serpent the most subtile
[2:04:09] beast of the
[2:04:12] field before she ever is with her
[2:04:15] husband
[2:04:17] Adam she was a woman
[2:04:22] betr she was a
[2:04:24] bride who who was supposed to be
[2:04:27] preparing for her wedding
[2:04:30] day and she gave her sacred trust to
[2:04:37] another that's the
[2:04:40] fornication that Jesus was speaking
[2:04:45] of this scripture interprets that word
[2:04:47] for us
[2:04:51] we'll stop
[2:04:53] here marriage and divorce in our
[2:04:57] day in the
[2:04:59] mouth of three
[2:05:01] Witnesses
