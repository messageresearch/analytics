just to know that the things we've asked him he's heard our prayer even today we don't have to look back too far to see he answers things that we've asked him you woke up this morning we ask God to be with us we asked Him to guide us and lead us we ask them to take care of each and every one of you and he did just that we appreciate that song brother Kenny and there is power in prayer when When sin when we do it sincerely and when we make our house a House of Prayer then God is a God who answers prayer he's always listening he he he's he's always attentive he is he is one of he is he is the best listener above everyone some folks might be able to boast they say you know I'm a pretty good listener and and that might be so but there is no one who is a better listener than our lord Jesus the holy spirit so we appreciate that song Matthew 24:35 says Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my words shall never pass away Jesus said in Luke 1946 he said my house is a House of Prayer that's how you know about about a house about a home and that is if it's a House of Prayer then that's a house that God dwells in and and we are God's house individuals and the homes that we live in made made of made of wood and and stone and we can make those houses a House of Prayer we never want to do what Israel did to God's Jesus said you have made it a den of Thieves he says but my house shall be a House of Prayer but he and he's always listening I remember testimony my dad told me when he when he had taken my uncle to to to um have a have an appointment with brother brandham personal interview and since it was not his since it was not his interview he he he he didn't feel to speak or ask anything or say anything but while brother brandham was speaking to my uncle in his heart he said I'd sure like to ask brother brandham how that gift in his hand works because they'd been in the meetings but they'd seen it from a distance sitting in the audience and now the man was this close to him and in his heart he's saying Lord I'd sure like to ask him how that gift in his hand works but he said I didn't dare do it because it wasn't my interview it was my uncles and he says as brother brandom and his uncle are speaking just fellowshipping because that was what my uncle had asked for he just wanted a few minutes of fellowship with brother brandom because he'd been in the meetings too and his prayer was answered now they're there at at the Ramada in they in Tucson Arizona and my father's just sitting quiet and and brother brandham and and and my uncle are speaking and brother brandham turns to my dad he doesn't know he's never met my dad before and he just said he told me brother would you like to see how that gift in my hand works but the M says yes you wouldn't believe it but I was just thinking that right now before the Lord you know he just thought it God heard it he says that's easy I'll just tell the prophet to show you how the gift works and he did prayer he's always listening he he'll always answer sometimes it's yes sometimes it's no but he's the best listener that's ever been turn with me to Matthew verse one and chapter one Matthew 1 and one the book of The Generation of Jesus Christ the son of David the son of Abraham let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you and we certainly believe what your disciple and Apostle wrote that this is the book of the generation of Jesus Christ his generation is his children his generation is his little bride his generation is both Jews and Gentiles and every one of them has their name written in this book the Lamb's Book of Life we thank you now in Jesus name amen you may be seated part nine of Jesus evangelist teacher Prophet Lamb of God the New Testament is the Lamb's Book of Life for many for many for a long time I wondered because I'd read the scriptures there in Revelations 138 Revelations 2127 2127 where it speaks of this l Book of Life and and the prophet would speak of it and sometimes it would sound like something abstract something that that that that I believed but something that maybe we couldn't touch we couldn't handle until I come to find out that I've been carrying the Lamb's Book of Life ever since I've carried a Bible in my arms this is the Lamb's Book of Life and the lamb was slain before the foundation of the [Music] world that's the book that Adam lost and it wasn't so much a written book we do have a written book today but then the book was a was the spoken word Adam's life was unfolding unto eternal life by the spoken word because he was in a personal relationship with the father he didn't need the written book he had he had god with him the living book the author walking him through the book chapter by chapter taking them unto Perfection and had they not Fallen they would have broken into eternal life because that's what Perfection is Bible Perfection human Perfection is is is is you doing something a carpenter and he finishes a a woodworking project and he says wow that's perfect wow and then and his family looks at it and friends they say that's perfect and then he gets a visitor that's another Carpenter maybe better than him and he goes That's nice but I'll tell you what that ain't perfect and there goes the Perfection that's human Perfection human Perfection is I just cooked the best pizza it's perfect Joseph's going to love this one and then Joseph eats it he says well it was good but it wasn't perfect you see so our Perfection has critics God's Perfection it's not natural It's Supernatural it's eternal life to be perfect as the father is perfect is to enter into eternal life with the father but the father had a plan of restoration to restore the Fig Tree to restore the bride tree to restore you and this new testament this New Covenant this is the Lamb's Book of Life it contains 27 books and it's and in these and in these 27 books is the name of every son and daughter of God your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life if if you've ever had a little homework to do it's from this day forward go to that book read it from start to finish and find where it's written your name because it's there it's in this book this book of the New Testament it began with Matthew saying the book of the generation of Jesus Christ that means this is the this is the Lamb's Book of Life for if Jesus Christ had a generation that means he had children that means he has family that means he gave forth his life and he brought forth life oh this is the Lamb's Book of Life New Testament we have our hands on it and he's and he's opening the eyes of our understanding to see what his plan is and how to restore us how we can take little steps that will take us to to to the very Throne of God the Father which is in heaven is perfect it's not impossible but it is supernal nothing natural about it and yes we must yield to the moving of the Holy Spirit to enter into this Supernatural life that's how every biography began with the birth who were the parents who are his children what that person did with their life is that not what the what the writers of the gospels wrote because they were anointed to write this biography of the Lamb Jesus Christ this is his book and your name is in it and your life is in it because his life is your life we are his children in Revelations 13 and 8 it reads like this and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him but it wasn't was n talking about Christ it wasn't talking about the lamb no it was talking about the dragon it was talking about the Beast it was talking about that Harlot Church the Roman Catholic Church it was talking about her daughters the denominations in verse four it said or verse three and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast and they worshiped the dragon which gave power unto the Beast and they worshiped the Beast saying who is like unto the Beast and who is able to make war with him because he is now become the global leader of the whole world and everyone is and all the nations are pushing for this they don't know that they're being anointed and their names are in the book too but there are names that on the white Throne judgment they will be judged and be cast into a lake of fire but in verse 13 and 8 it said and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him worship who the dragon worship who the Beast whose names all were worship him except those whose names are written in the Book of Life of the Lamb the lamb that was slain on Calvary the lamb that was slain from the foundation of the world in other words God has a plan he's always been in control he's always known what's happening he W he didn't lose control in the Garden of Eden no Adam and Eve lost control God didn't lose control he knew when he gave them free moral agency they'd make the wrong choice and before they made the wrong choice the lamb had already been slain his sons for his daughters Lucifer was given free moral ageny the angels that fell with them because they had a soul a soul is a seed but not every soul is the seed of God some souls are the seed of the serpent we are not all one there are those there are the seed of The Serpent and there are those that are the seed of God predestinated unto eternal life all you've got to do is believe when you pray and God will give you and bring you to the stature of a perfect man that's spoken of in the Lamb's Book of Life this is what the gospels of Matthew Mark Luke and John were all about it was the beginning of the Lamb's Book of Life but the New Testament has 27 books and each one gave more and more detail of this lamb of his life and how you and I can be blessed with this life you and I can return back into fellowship with this life the life of the father it's a plan it's it's it's it's little baby steps and how to get back into his pray into his presence and how to be a House of Prayer in Genesis 3:15 there was a prophecy and that prophecy was concerning this lamb it was concerning the the generation of this lamb Genesis 3:15 it reads like this and I the the the man and the woman had fallen this was a this was the first White Throne judgment that was taking place there'll be another one coming but this was the first God was judging everyone on the Earth all had fallen his sons his daughters the animal kingdom had fallen of course when I say all on Earth had fallen there was only his son and his daughter and the serpent the most subtle beast of the field and this was the Judgment going forth but in in verse 15 he had the the Lord was speaking to the serpent he had already cursed this serpent in verse 14 because the serpent was a beast a single Beast that had been created for a single purpose I don't believe there was a a Mrs serpent a female Prophet said he he stood on his the Bible says he stood on his feet like a man Prophet said he looked like a man but he was all Beast someone would say well the Bible says that there was two of each kind that were made so how could you say that all of a sudden God breaks that pattern unless there's a pattern in the Bible to show us where he's did it before or repeated it brother brandham tells us of a time he had gone to a fair of some kind and or a museum maybe don't recall exactly but he said they were going on a tour with a guide and he showed them a great skeleton of it was supposed to be be one of the largest whales in the world and the entire skeleton is on this giant trailer and the man begins to tell him about the whale large it is how long they live then he says you've and you've probably and you've probably heard uh the the the old story that's written in the about how a whale swallowed Jonah he said I want you to notice that this whale that you're seen here is one of the largest whales in the world and if you look at its throat how small it is it would probably have trouble swallowing a grapefruit so we know that that was just a legend it's not true and brother bram's listening he said about that time I had heard all I could stand I said wa excuse me sir I don't needan to interrupt you I'm afraid you you've got that wrong because the Bible said that God created a fish to swallow Jonah if if God had wanted to he could have made a fish they could swallow this whole skeleton in the trailer too but this was a special fish that God had made just for this purpose just for this day just for This Man Called Jonah One of a Kind Beast that God made he didn't make two a male and female he made one that was it so now we go back to Genesis to the serpent he only made one and there was a purpose and there was a reason and we've spoken on it so we won't we won't go on that or I'll get off my subject all together even even though every subject of the Bible does this and it comes together and and in verse 15 it said I will put am between thee and the woman so so he said I will put enity between thee The Serpent and the [Music] woman and between thy seed who was he speaking to the serpent so the term being used here is what in the Book of Genesis the seed of the serpent because they ask us where do you get get that from serpent seed he says well it starts in Genesis and it goes all through the Bible and I will put enity between thee and the woman and between thy seed the serpent seed and her seed but he wasn't referring so much to Eve I will put City between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shal bruise his heel this seed was not the woman's seed and yet it says it was because that was the prophecy her seed but this woman was not Eve that the Bible was speaking of this was a prophecy this was a parable this was a metaphor this was the prophetic word this woman was not was not Eve and this woman was not Mary this woman was the mystical body of Jesus Christ and her seed is Christ himself Christ in you in me the hope of glory you say didn't didn't include Eve and Mary at all did they're included in this woman but the woman that the prophecy is speaking of the many membered body of Jesus Christ that's his wife they're included in the whole the prophecy wasn't about one specific Natural Woman prophecy was about the Bride of Jesus Christ about the Lamb's wife that's the woman the mystical body of Jesus Christ The Gospel of Matthew it showed us the everchanging ministry of Jesus king of the Jews the Bible tells us he was born the king of the Jews Magi came that was their question once they got this close they'll say surely everyone in Jerusalem knows about this they said where is he that's born King of the Jews they said what we ain't never heard that message before yeah it's it's on tape 1963 they said we' never heard the tape and yet he was there Jesus he had already made his tapes he had already recorded his voice in the hearts of the people and the church world didn't know it the prophets had spoken of it but they weren't waiting for it and even the Prophecies of today that have been brought to light for our day they've been spoken and people aren't looking for them people aren't waiting for them they'd rather wait on something that's not even written in the word and you know when that will come to pass don't you never only what God Said thus sayith the Lord will come to pass if it's not written in the word if it's not thus sayith the Lord it will not happen there are three parts in this plan of God at the first coming of Christ the first began with an incredible Supernatural healing campaign that gathered and and healed thousands the lamb was drawing the attention of the people they had never seen anything like this before they'd never seen the lame walk they'd never seen the blind to see they'd never seen the deaf here they certainly had never seen the dead rise it was the it was the first part of this plan of God unfolding from the Lamb's Book of Life it was the first poll of the ministry of this king of the Jews but he wouldn't come as a king he was a king but the king would descend and never declare himself King but rather he would declare himself a servant to the people and he come as an evangelist praying for the sick working night and day preaching the Kingdom of Heaven has come and I'm unfolding this Lamb's Book of Life as he prayed for the sick the second part of the ministry began to unfold part two second pool and while he's praying for the sick he begins at Discerning the intents of the hearts that in itself Vindicated Jesus to the people as a prophetic Ministry because only God knows the intents of the heart and then the Third part of his ministry he would begin unfolding to them and reveal to them the word his word his Plan of Redemption his Plan of Salvation his plan of how you can be born again and go from a natural birth to a supernatural birth go from a fallen birth an Immaculate birth the Born Again experience growing into the stature of a perfect man Jesus Christ these are the three parts of the plan of God as the Lamb's Book of Life is [Music] opening the first coming of Christ and these three parts would unfold in a fful Ministry the fful ministry was the ministry of Jesus Christ as these three parts are unfolding and keep in mind this is a pattern of what's happened in our day in his first coming Jesus he was born King of the Jews that's how he came to the Earth he left as the Lamb of God that's how he left the Earth but he unfolded his plan to redeem to save to change you and I into his likeness to give us eternal life and through and he did this through his fful ministry Jesus was an evangelist a prophet an apostle a teacher a pastor in Matthew 4 you remember reading it in our last Services verses 12 to 25 the King of Kings begins his ministry not in a big castle but in the poorest neighborhoods in the streets of Judea in in in in the bad neighborhoods of Galilee born in one of the worst little cities called Nazareth to where even one of his disciples said when they told him come see a man I think he's a prophet I think he's Messiah where's he from he's from Nazareth oh can anything good come out of Nazareth that's like that's like me telling you I was born in e in Los Angeles is it really brother Kenny would tell Rachel watch him you know where he's came from because if you've ever been there you know the area anything good come out of Nazareth he said he said they and rather than argue the point with him the disciples said come see come see for yourself so he begins his ministry as evangelist matth 4: 12-25 But Not only was an evangelist but a prophet turn with me to Matthew 9 and we'll be reading in verse four we've gone through Matthew chapter 1 to chapter 10 and we found out that each chapter isn't an individual story we realize that every chapter is an exact walk letting our fingers do the walking through the Bible Pages we see it all connected just perfectly unfolding the ministry of Jesus Christ and showing us a pattern of things to come so that when he does these things again as he's done it in our time we could recognize him and see he's come again and he's appearing to us personally even now and he's opening the eyes of our understanding Glory and here in chapter nine Jesus still doing the work of an evangelist and he and someone a man sick of the py is brought to him and he sees the faith of the people that brought him and he says son be of good cheer thy sins be forgiven thee you say shouldn't he shouldn't he have healed him first because if you're really sick to tell someone don't worry your sins are forgiven is he telling me I'm going to die why doesn't he tell me I'm I'm I'm Healed there was a Divine reason because he was entering into another part of his ministry the prophetic part and he was going to provoke men to say and certain of the scribes said within themselves this man blasphemed and Jesus knowing their thoughts the prophetic Ministry had just begun the and Jesus knowing their thoughts where said wherefore think ye evil in your hearts it had begun Jesus the Evangelist in Matthew 5 6 and 7 it was Jesus the teacher here in Matthew 9 now it's Jesus the prophet and once he enters into that Ministry he hasn't lost the others they're all unfolding together but getting greater unfolding showing himself as the Lamb of God acts three and verse 22 Peter on the day of Pentecost he says for Moses truly said unto the fathers a prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you out of your brethren like unto me him shall you hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you and it shall come to pass that every soul which will not hear that Prophet shall be destroyed from among the people what a Ministry this Lamb of God had what a Ministry this evangelist had what a Ministry this teacher had what a Ministry this Prophet had he says yay and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after as many as have spoken have likewise foretold of these days then Jesus says then Peter said ye are the children of the prophets and of the Covenant which God made with our fathers saying unto Abraham and in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed unto you first God having raised up his son Jesus sent him to bless you in turning away every one of you from his iniquities it's part of the plan for you in the Lamb's Book of Life to turn our hearts Minds away from our iniquities Jesus the Evangelist Jesus the prophet Jesus the Apostle turn with me to Hebrews Hebrews chapter three verses 1 to 3 wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus the fful ministry of Jesus Christ evangelist Prophet Apostle AP turn with me to Matthew chapter St John chapter 3 St John chapter 3 and verse one there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the [Music] Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him we know that th are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him and then Jesus said a scripture we've all known and read Jesus answered and said unto him verely verely I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus had just told him we know you're a teacher sent from God and he begins teaching him immediately and Nicodemus says wait a minute um how can I be born again when I'm old you're a teacher sent from God Jes we can plainly see that then Jesus immediately begins teaching him and he throws the brakes on okay okay but maybe not this teaching I it's it's impossible but he was talking to a teacher who was more than a teacher and he did didn't realize the parable of the prophetic word that was being spoken to him had he said Lord I believe help by my unbelief would have been a better answer so Jesus his five full ministry evangelist Prophet Apostle teacher it's all in the word the Apostle Paul did did not invent the fivefold ministry he only got the revelation of the fful ministry of Jesus Christ and when Jesus said I'm going to send gifts unto Men book of Ephesians he caught the Revelation that these were the gifts they were Gifts of ministry so that the second coming would unfold for God's people just like the first coming did so that we at the second coming learn about this Lamb's Book of Life and hear the same things they heard at the first coming and hear the same things that were told to Adam in the beginning things that he didn't bring to pass things that he couldn't live but God said in his word my word will not return voidage I've got a people whose names are in my book and if you can believe it's your name in the book surely you can believe you're the one God will keep his word in you will be the sons and daughters manifested on the earth in this wicked generation but he was also a pastor not just evangelist not just Prophet not just Apostle not only a teacher but the pastor turn with me to First Peter First Peter chapter 5 see is that right First Peter chapter 5 let's begin at verse one Peter speaking here the elders which are among you I exhort who am also an elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ and also a partaker of the glory that shall be revealed feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof Peter is speaking to the fful ministry to men who are called to keep a part of the ministry of Jesus Christ amongst the children of God he said feed the flock of God which is among you taking the oversight thereof not by constraint but willingly not for filthy looker but of a ready mind Peter is speaking to the fful ministry he says neither as being Lords over God's Heritage that means Ministry has no right to tell you where you have to live what church you must go to no you have to be led of the spirit for that brother Bram himself said I'm not a dictator to tell you where to live or where to go you seek God for those answers you can ask my advice we can share based on circumstances but the final decision is yours in prayer be a House of Prayer ask God because he's a listener he's the best listener he's not like us he is a true listener a gentleman once said my wife accuses me of being a very poor listener and uh and she's and and she she she said there's only two things she doesn't like about me one of them is I never match my clothes properly and the other one I don't remember I wasn't listening so as men we're not very good listeners but Jesus Christ listens to every word you say and he wants to answer you and he'll meet you in your prayer closet with an answer every time neither is being Lords over God's Heritage but being examples to the flock and when the chief Shepherd shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory that faded not not away he's speaking to the Ministries he's speaking to the fful ministry and if you do as he says when the chief chief Shepherd shall appear you shall receive a Crown of Glory that fadeth not away if you're an example if you're a servant if you're not being Lords over his heritage if you're unfolding the ministry I gave you if you're looking in the scriptures to see how I was an evangelist if you're looking in the scriptures to see how I was a pastor if you're look in the scriptures to see how I was a prophet if you're look in the scriptures to see how I was an apostle if you if you unfold the ministry just that way when I appear you'll receive a Crown of Glory fth not away that's eternal life the fightful ministry of Jesus Christ was is unfolding in this Lamb's Book of Life and it it unfolded all the way to chapter 10 of Matthew where God begins to put his church in order to send them out gives them a message to preach the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand gives them gifts along with their callings to display the Life of Christ and in verse 11 Jesus moves in to another part of his ministry the part that he would keep with him till he left the scene the lamb he would enter the lamb Ministry because the lamb is the revealer of the book it's in the Bible turn with me to Revelations chapter 6 and it reads like this in closing now and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and one of the for be saying come and see and when this came to pass it happened in the Lamb's Book in the Book of Matthew chapter 11 this prophecy became history and it was there where the lamb Christ opened up his plan fully opened the book and was given it to Israel in parables in a prophetic word in Proverbs and they didn't catch it they didn't see it they weren't ordained to see it but you and I are and the lamb is still the revealer of the word and when you when
