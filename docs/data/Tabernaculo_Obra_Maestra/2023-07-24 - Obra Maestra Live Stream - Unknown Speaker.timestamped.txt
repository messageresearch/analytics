[16:31] it's what's giving us healing for our
[16:33] bodies and
[16:35] healing for our minds
[16:38] and we're thankful thankful to God for
[16:40] all of them
[16:42] this morning uh
[16:45] I want to pray for prayer although all
[16:48] the saints that are out visiting
[16:50] vacation traveling
[16:53] sister carmender in Mexico I think
[16:55] Esther's also with her
[16:57] um
[16:58] I'm going to remember them in prayer
[17:00] there where they're at and
[17:03] I also want to remember our brother
[17:04] Jonathan
[17:06] um
[17:07] this morning brother Jonathan is kind of
[17:09] an Ellie easer only he's not getting a
[17:12] bride for Isaac he's going to get his
[17:13] own bride and pick her up and he may be
[17:16] gone for I think it was the 17th was the
[17:19] actual date but he said they had many
[17:21] things they had to do prior I think
[17:23] medical tests and I'm not sure what else
[17:25] they had to take care of and everything
[17:28] and uh so Lord willing when all that's
[17:30] done and complete when he returns uh
[17:33] he'll be here with his little family his
[17:35] little daughter
[17:36] um and uh we want to kind of get
[17:40] together with them and have a little a
[17:44] little celebration a little Feast with
[17:46] them all brother Jonathan to give his
[17:50] wife and the girl up a little welcoming
[17:53] fiestas we would say
[17:55] and when they get back here Lord willing
[17:58] and just plan a little something for all
[18:00] of them there
[18:01] I also wanted to announce uh September
[18:03] the 9th and September the 10th we'll be
[18:07] having a visiting brother and uh and a
[18:10] good friend of mine brother Rafael
[18:12] Cabello that's September 9th and 10th
[18:15] it's a Saturday and Sunday whether
[18:18] Rafael Cabellas from uh Congo
[18:21] Africa Congo brazzaville they call it
[18:25] if you don't know there's actually two
[18:27] Congos two countries called Congo
[18:30] and one is just Congo and the other one
[18:33] is the Democratic Republic of Congo
[18:37] and the brothers when they refer to the
[18:39] Congo they're from they say I'm from
[18:41] Congo brazzaville where I'm from Congo
[18:44] kinchasa which is the capitals of those
[18:46] two countries so our brother Rafael is
[18:49] from Congo brazzaville and he has a
[18:53] church there that he's pastored for for
[18:55] many years and he just uh maybe less
[18:58] than a month ago he sent me some videos
[19:00] that they're building a new church
[19:02] and uh
[19:04] it's I don't know it's it's Warehouse
[19:07] size just as the videos were we were
[19:10] showing the videos of How It's coming
[19:11] along
[19:13] I guess they could probably see five six
[19:15] thousand people or more and uh he used
[19:19] to have a small church when he first
[19:20] started pastoring it was a church of
[19:23] about I think it was a thousand or
[19:25] fifteen hundred people
[19:27] and uh that's considered a small Church
[19:29] in Congo a modest congregation
[19:33] uh other brothers that we know there
[19:35] brother Richard nioka they have a
[19:39] Congregation of maybe ten thousand
[19:41] people seven thousand another brother
[19:46] that's in Congo kinchasa also
[19:50] Cabella uh has it one of them has a
[19:53] church of about 15 000 people and when
[19:56] you look at the churches they're they're
[19:58] warehouse warehouse size
[20:01] and usually when you see the videos
[20:02] you'll you'll see all the sisters are
[20:05] set on one side and and all the brothers
[20:07] are sat on another side and one of the
[20:10] reasons they do that is so they can pack
[20:12] them in tighter
[20:14] into the into the service so it's not a
[20:16] when you see it it's not some kind of a
[20:18] strange Doctrine or anything they have
[20:21] no it's it's for the purpose of being
[20:22] able to sit everyone a little closer and
[20:26] without it being inconvenient or awkward
[20:29] for the Brothers and Sisters in Christ
[20:30] but so brother Cabello be here he has
[20:34] always kept in touch with me for many
[20:36] years since he first came
[20:38] can we visit it he stayed in our home
[20:40] and we took the time to take him a few
[20:43] places and we have a friendship together
[20:46] that is has remained and so he uh he is
[20:50] in Dallas Texas he's been there for a
[20:52] few weeks has a daughter that's there
[20:55] and and he sent me some some texts and
[20:57] sent me the videos and he let me know I
[21:00] he was going to be in town till about
[21:02] September 13th before he leaves again
[21:04] so um
[21:06] I said wonderful have a great time in
[21:08] Dallas and I sent him a text to WhatsApp
[21:12] and and uh a couple of days later the
[21:15] Lord just put in my heart well he's here
[21:17] until September 13th
[21:19] um why not invite and I called up and
[21:21] invited him and and he's and he said and
[21:25] he tells me well I let you know how long
[21:27] I would be here just in case you wanted
[21:30] to invite me he said well I said but
[21:33] just in case it's come up we do wish to
[21:35] invite you and have you come down and
[21:37] share with us the word of God
[21:39] experiences and in the past in pastoring
[21:42] and what God puts whatever God would put
[21:44] on your heart so September the 9th and
[21:47] September the 10th as we get closer
[21:49] we'll give you the times the Sunday will
[21:51] not be a regular time that we start all
[21:53] the time and perhaps Saturday we'll
[21:56] start a little early maybe about six
[21:57] o'clock and you're certainly welcome to
[22:00] invite any and all that that you would
[22:02] like to invite for these for these
[22:04] Services
[22:05] I'm sure the brother does speak English
[22:08] he can communicate and have a
[22:10] conversation with you in English I don't
[22:13] know that he'll preach in English but
[22:15] but uh if not then I'm sure he'll have a
[22:18] a lot of brothers are living in Phoenix
[22:21] that that also knows in our cups
[22:24] the relatives of his wife that couldn't
[22:27] interpret I mean I'm sure you all
[22:29] remember brother Joshua mukabe that
[22:31] spoke for us a while back when I was
[22:33] when I was unable to him and uh I
[22:36] believe brother Joshua that's his
[22:37] brother-in-law isn't it so brother
[22:39] Joshua Bay is his brother-in-law in heed
[22:43] a very good interpreter from French
[22:45] French to English I asked Josh if he
[22:49] wanted to interpret for him uh French to
[22:51] English or French to Spanish but he
[22:55] hasn't told me yet that he wants to so
[22:57] I'm assuming that he doesn't want to
[22:59] even try so but uh we're thankful for
[23:03] all what God does for us we're thankful
[23:05] for for friends uh like brother Rafael
[23:08] we're thankful this morning for all of
[23:10] you that are here present the Bible says
[23:12] where two or three are gathered in my
[23:14] name there shall I be also so we're
[23:16] believing that this morning
[23:18] and uh
[23:21] I'm gonna turn here to
[23:28] we'll stand to our feet this morning
[23:34] we'll be reading from The Book of John
[23:36] John chapter 10.
[23:39] we'll read verses 1 to 7.
[23:43] and it's a lengthy subject this morning
[23:46] but we won't be lengthy this morning
[23:48] because we'll probably speak on this
[23:50] subject for for some time
[23:52] and uh I believe I spoke a little bit on
[23:56] it
[23:59] in the past and much what much of what
[24:02] will be saying here is things that I've
[24:03] said to you often
[24:05] and repeat often
[24:08] and I do that for the purpose of of it
[24:12] sparking an interest in your lives and
[24:14] hearts that when you get home
[24:17] um you'll start searching the word of
[24:19] God it's not so much
[24:22] the things that I'll say to you here
[24:24] but but it's the earnest desire to get
[24:27] into the word
[24:29] when you get home that's where you'll
[24:33] reap Revelation far beyond that I could
[24:36] share with you I'm sharing with you my
[24:39] Revelation my understanding but know
[24:42] this that and I know this that God has
[24:44] more Revelation understanding for you
[24:48] in your personal time with him that I
[24:51] could ever give you but what he has
[24:53] called me to do is to give you something
[24:56] to spark that interest in the word of
[24:59] God Beyond any other thing any other
[25:02] music or book or any thing that that
[25:04] interests you that this interest of the
[25:07] word to prepare our lives for rapturing
[25:10] Faith would be the greatest
[25:12] motivating factor in our lives as
[25:15] Believers in Christ
[25:18] because if you're in the word now and
[25:22] God is changing you from the inside out
[25:25] then the easiest change and the easiest
[25:28] thing you'll ever go through in life is
[25:30] a body change because you'll be ready
[25:33] when he calls you you won't think twice
[25:36] and we're gone
[25:38] Saint John chapter 10.
[25:41] verses one through seven
[25:43] it says this
[25:45] barely verily and I say unto you he that
[25:48] interest and not by the door into the
[25:51] Sheepfold but climeth up some other way
[25:54] the same is a thief and a robber
[25:58] but he that entereth in by the door is
[26:01] The Shepherd of the Sheep so in this
[26:03] Parable in verse 1 it sounds like it's
[26:06] talking about just the common lay member
[26:08] but let's read it again verse one it's
[26:11] merely verily I say unto you he that
[26:13] entereth not by the door into the
[26:15] Sheepfold where the Sheep are at are a
[26:19] pasture for the Sheep to feed but
[26:22] climeth up some other way the same is a
[26:25] thief and a robber
[26:27] but he that enters by the door is The
[26:30] Shepherd of the sheep verse 2 reveals to
[26:32] us something about verse one and that is
[26:35] this thief and this robber that Jesus is
[26:37] speaking of is not the lay members not
[26:39] the Sheep it's the Shepherds
[26:43] Shepherds that are thieves and robbers
[26:45] because they come in the wrong way they
[26:47] don't come in through the door so he's
[26:49] speaking to the ministry here Pharisees
[26:51] scribes pastors evangelists that's a
[26:55] verse two reveals it but here that
[26:57] enters him by the door is The Shepherd
[26:59] of the Sheep
[27:02] to him to him the porter openeth who's
[27:05] the porter the father God the Father
[27:09] who is this Shepherd the chief Shepherd
[27:12] Jesus Christ
[27:14] he's speaking to ministry here not just
[27:16] the late members but he's a to him the
[27:19] porter God open it can the sheep hear
[27:23] his voice in other words the porter the
[27:26] father allows the shepherd to enter into
[27:29] his pasture into enters Green Fields
[27:31] enter into the open book enter into the
[27:34] revelation of these Seven Seals to him
[27:37] the border openeth and the sheep hear
[27:39] his voice
[27:40] can he calleth his own Sheep by name and
[27:44] leave them out
[27:45] and when he puteth forth his own sheep
[27:48] he goes before them and the Sheep follow
[27:51] him for they know his voice can a
[27:54] stranger will they not follow but will
[27:57] flee from him for they know not the
[28:00] voice of strange Ministries
[28:03] this Parable it was a parable so in this
[28:06] things that he was speaking is a mystery
[28:08] hidden this Parable Jesus spoke unto him
[28:12] but they understood not what things they
[28:17] were which he spake unto them because
[28:19] that was the purpose of the parable and
[28:22] reveal it unto babes such as Woodbury
[28:24] then said Jesus unto him again verily
[28:27] variation to you I am the door
[28:31] of the sheep I'm the shepherd I'm the
[28:34] door
[28:35] I'm the son of God
[28:37] follow me follow the lamb Don't Follow
[28:42] the Man let's pray Heavenly Father we
[28:46] thank you this morning
[28:48] can we ask your blessings upon your word
[28:50] reveal it to us for we know you spoke
[28:54] everything in Parables for a purpose you
[28:56] even said at one time in Matthew 11
[28:58] father I thank you that you have hidden
[29:01] these things from the eyes of wise and
[29:03] prudent
[29:04] and you've revealed it unto babes such
[29:07] as would learn that means it takes a
[29:09] born-again experience or we cannot see
[29:12] the Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom of God
[29:15] we cannot see the opening of the word we
[29:18] cannot see the loosing of those Seven
[29:19] Seals
[29:21] and yet Seven Seals is just seven parts
[29:24] of one Divine Plan of Redemption to take
[29:28] us back into your presence to take us
[29:30] back to Eden can take us back and to
[29:33] where we can swap this life of time for
[29:35] a life eternal with you we thank you now
[29:38] bless the word for every heart in Jesus
[29:42] name we ask it amen you may be seated
[29:44] this morning
[29:50] just for a title
[29:53] The Pale Horse Rider
[29:55] in the Days of Elijah
[29:57] just as it was the white horse rider in
[30:01] the Days of Elijah
[30:03] so there was a white horse rider in the
[30:06] Days of Elijah
[30:08] and there was a pale horse rider in the
[30:11] Days of Elijah
[30:13] because there was there was in the
[30:16] opening of This Book of redemption this
[30:18] new testament
[30:19] two forerunners that were to come at the
[30:22] first coming of Christ and the second
[30:24] coming of Christ John the Baptist was
[30:26] this first Forerunner at the first
[30:28] coming of Christ the Elijah Jesus
[30:31] himself told us that in Matthew 11. the
[30:34] ain't the angel Gabriel spoke to
[30:37] Zachariah in Luke 1 and confirmed John
[30:40] the Baptist is the Elijah he's he's that
[30:44] Elijah of Malachi 3 he's also the first
[30:48] Elijah of Malachi 4 6.
[30:53] and Jesus confirmed that he was
[30:56] so in the days of this first Elijah
[30:59] Matthew 11 is where Jesus tells us that
[31:03] the white horse rider began his right
[31:05] that's where I get this thought that's
[31:07] where I get this Revelation with the
[31:09] pain that that the white horse rider
[31:12] began in the Days of Elijah it's Jesus
[31:14] himself that holds them can the pale
[31:17] horse rider
[31:19] began in the Days of Elijah but not John
[31:22] the Baptist the Elijah to the second
[31:24] coming of Christ a Prophet by the name
[31:27] of William Miriam Branham why because
[31:30] it's the pattern of God's word because
[31:33] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[31:36] and forever so if the white horse rider
[31:39] began in the days of Elijah's on the
[31:42] Baptist then when would the last writer
[31:44] begin
[31:45] in the Days of Elijah once again
[31:49] the same God doing the same things so
[31:52] his children can catch the same
[31:54] Revelation it is said that if you say
[31:57] the truth once you will have no problem
[32:00] saying it again and repeating it because
[32:02] you're because it's the truth and the
[32:04] truth can be said over and over again
[32:06] without any compromises
[32:09] in Revelations 5 it has been spoke much
[32:12] on it because for me it's a key
[32:14] scripture of this great Plan of
[32:16] Redemption we're told that Jesus Christ
[32:19] there in Revelations 5 open the book in
[32:22] the days of the Earthly Ministry and he
[32:25] did this throughout his Earthly Ministry
[32:27] and in Matthew 24 in a parable as Isaiah
[32:31] had prophesied and other scriptures
[32:33] tells us he loosed the Seven Seals Jesus
[32:37] Christ of Nazareth
[32:39] our Lord and savior in his Earthly
[32:42] Ministry he's the one that opened the
[32:45] book first
[32:47] and he's the one that loosed the Seven
[32:49] Seals Seven Seals seven parts to one
[32:52] Plan of Redemption to whom did he opened
[32:56] the book of redemption in the New
[32:57] Testament to Israel
[33:00] to the firstborn son he loosed the Seven
[33:02] Seals that means the Redemption plan was
[33:07] put in motion
[33:09] that's what it means that's what this
[33:11] book
[33:12] of this Seven Seals is all about brother
[33:15] Madam said that seven seal book it's not
[33:18] just the last book in the Bible
[33:20] it's the entire Bible
[33:23] it's the entire Bible that was sealed
[33:27] Isaiah even speaks of that book that was
[33:31] sealed and the Learned man said I cannot
[33:33] understand it it's clothed it's open and
[33:36] can the unlearned and ignorant said I
[33:37] can't understand it I can't read I can't
[33:39] write no one could understand it the
[33:42] prophets couldn't understand that God
[33:43] didn't give it
[33:46] but God rich in Mercy
[33:49] unfolding his word but even before Jesus
[33:53] loosed the Seven Seals in Matthew 24
[33:56] he identifies in his day the beginning
[33:58] of that white horse rider in the opening
[34:01] of the first seal
[34:02] part one to take his family back to Eden
[34:06] to take his family back to the beginning
[34:09] before the fall to take his family where
[34:12] Adam and Eve were were being mentored by
[34:16] the father where they had a relationship
[34:19] like no other had ever had has ever had
[34:23] since
[34:24] and they fell from that close
[34:27] with the father but it's that but that's
[34:31] where God wants to take us back to
[34:32] that's where we're actually standing
[34:35] today by the revealed word of God we're
[34:38] standing in the same spot before the
[34:41] father like Adam and Eve being mentored
[34:44] being tutored
[34:46] the The Works that he did
[34:49] shall we do also and greater than these
[34:51] shall we you know he said because I go
[34:53] to the father and I come back as the
[34:55] Holy Spirit
[34:57] and it's by and and and by the Holy
[35:00] Spirit I can live in each and every one
[35:03] of you can be with you daily even with
[35:06] you and in you to the ends of the Earth
[35:09] So the plan of Eden God's original plan
[35:12] is back and forth enforced today in 2023
[35:16] by the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit
[35:19] that's amongst us
[35:20] when the lamb died was slain
[35:24] Revelations 5 you go back and read it
[35:26] can I saw a lamb as though it had been
[35:28] slain said
[35:30] it had seven horns it had seven eyes the
[35:33] Lamb of God
[35:35] where did God go from that spot
[35:40] he went back to Revelations one where
[35:43] John said can I seen one like unto the
[35:46] son of man walking in the midst of this
[35:48] seven candlesticks the sevens for
[35:50] changes in what form the Holy Ghost the
[35:54] Holy Spirit
[35:55] the Son of God is what the holy spirit
[35:59] is called
[36:00] so
[36:02] brother Branham
[36:05] learned in his early Ministry
[36:08] that to see a vision come to pass it all
[36:11] the components of the vision must unfold
[36:14] they must be present even if it's just
[36:17] the last step maybe a hat being moved
[36:20] somewhere before he could pronounce the
[36:23] conclusion of that Vision before he
[36:24] could say thus saith the Lord you're
[36:26] healed can in a message wisdom versus
[36:29] Faith paragraph 33 is one of those
[36:31] places where brother Branham says this
[36:33] where he gives us more details
[36:36] is in the message where he tells us the
[36:39] importance of staying exactly with the
[36:42] vision because speaking of his own
[36:43] Ministry in the message God revealing
[36:46] himself to his people is where brother
[36:48] Brown speaks again Prince talks about an
[36:51] experience that he had where he got
[36:54] ahead of the vision
[36:55] and there were still lacking a hat that
[36:58] had to be moved from one spot in the in
[37:00] the room to another spot in the room he
[37:03] couldn't move it it had to be someone
[37:05] else that would walk in and do that and
[37:08] that was a sign that this is the moment
[37:11] this is the spot now you enter in and do
[37:15] the and and do the prophetic work and
[37:18] say thus saith the Lord
[37:21] she says got to be exactly with the
[37:23] vision
[37:25] and with that said
[37:27] we want to read in Revelations chapter
[37:29] six one and two again we did Wednesday
[37:32] and we'll do again now
[37:34] and it says this and I saw verse 1
[37:37] revelation 6. and I saw when the lamb
[37:41] opened one of the seals
[37:43] and I heard it was the noise of thunder
[37:46] all symbols they all mean something one
[37:49] of the four be sane come and see it was
[37:52] to be a teaching for come and see it is
[37:57] not a rebuke come and see his is is not
[38:02] an Evangelistic message come and see
[38:05] just come and see something and you're
[38:08] going to learn this was a Teaching
[38:10] Ministry and in this Teaching Ministry
[38:12] the lamb had to be present the vision
[38:15] the vision says and I saw when the lamb
[38:18] opened one of the seals so the lamb must
[38:20] be present for this to come to pass
[38:23] then there was a noise of Thunder one of
[38:25] the four beasts saying it was a teaching
[38:28] he was about to bring pertaining that
[38:32] day they were living in
[38:33] which one of the four beasts was present
[38:36] because it
[38:38] because because
[38:40] it says here in Revelation 6 2
[38:44] and I saw him Behold a white horse and
[38:47] really six one I'm sorry
[38:49] and I heard as it were the noise of
[38:51] Thunder one of the four be saying come
[38:53] and see
[38:54] it was to be a teacher so which one of
[38:57] the four beasts was present because it
[38:59] doesn't tell us here in this scripture
[39:01] which one of the four beasts it was so
[39:03] then you have to go to another place in
[39:06] the Bible because the prophetic word
[39:09] something is spoken in this prophecy and
[39:11] something is spoken in this prophecy and
[39:13] something spoken this prophecy can you
[39:15] kind of blend them together with all the
[39:18] details to see this great Plan of
[39:20] Redemption if you stop with one
[39:22] scripture and put a period you're not
[39:24] really seeing anything
[39:26] it forces you to interpret that
[39:29] scripture then where do you place
[39:31] yourself if you're not a prophet to do
[39:33] so
[39:35] then you're bringing confusion to the
[39:36] people
[39:38] so
[39:41] so which one of the four beasts was
[39:42] present Revelations 4 gives us the order
[39:45] and it says Revelations 4 and verse 7
[39:48] and the first Beast was like a lion and
[39:51] the second beast like a cat can the
[39:54] third Beast had the face of a man can
[39:56] the fourth Beast with like a flying
[39:58] eagle so the lion must be present
[40:00] because he was the first and this was
[40:03] the first seal and this is the unfolding
[40:06] of the word and Jesus at the time of his
[40:10] characters coming was the lion of the
[40:12] tribe of Judah and he was the Lamb of
[40:14] God so both lion and lamb are present in
[40:17] this prophecy and and not only in the
[40:20] prophecy but in the reality when it
[40:22] comes to past
[40:23] lion and land must be present and yet
[40:26] lion and lamb were one man
[40:29] Jesus of Nazareth
[40:31] he was present
[40:33] so lion and lamb is a Ministry
[40:37] of one man and these four living
[40:40] creatures he's the ministry of one man
[40:43] Jesus Christ the son of man throughout
[40:46] seven Church ages the grave Holy Spirit
[40:49] these four living creatures is the
[40:52] ministry of Christ to his people
[40:55] throughout the ages for Redemption
[40:58] because part one had begun
[41:02] and part one was the Plan of Redemption
[41:05] put into motion
[41:08] so that you and I could be born again
[41:10] so true and I could be justified by
[41:13] faith so June I could be Sanctified by
[41:15] the spirit so June I could receive the
[41:17] baptism of the Holy Ghost so that you
[41:20] and I in great trials we go through
[41:23] could have a refilling of the Holy
[41:26] Spirit and as I shared before it formed
[41:28] the refilling of the holy spirit it's
[41:31] not a reward for being good that you did
[41:34] everything right the refilling of the
[41:36] holy spirit is power to overcome great
[41:39] trials you're going through in life
[41:41] because that's when you need the
[41:43] refilling that's when you're feeling
[41:45] empty Lord why me
[41:48] why is this trouble coming to me why
[41:50] does my car have to break and all four
[41:52] tires go flat what about the neighbor
[41:55] he's not even a believer nothing happens
[41:57] to him but it's God knowing you you
[42:00] you're you're you're you've been you're
[42:02] you're empty maybe you haven't been
[42:05] reading the word like you should maybe
[42:06] we haven't been praying like we should
[42:08] he knows you're kind of empty now but he
[42:11] wants to feel you he wants to give you a
[42:13] refilling because he's already given you
[42:16] the Holy Ghost it was already giving you
[42:18] a small measure in your cup now he sees
[42:21] the cups for going low he says I need to
[42:24] refill this person till this till the
[42:27] cup is overflowing
[42:32] he says you need to refill it
[42:35] we tell the angel go down and touch
[42:38] those four tires as they're going down
[42:39] I-17 it's 117 degrees
[42:44] refilling time
[42:46] of the Holy Spirit
[42:49] it's not a reward
[42:51] it's a need and he sees your name
[42:56] so Revelations
[42:58] The Lion and the lamb present verse 2
[43:02] and I saw him Behold a white horse can
[43:04] he that sat on him had a bow
[43:06] and a crown was given unto him he went
[43:08] forth conquering and to conquer
[43:10] Revelation 6 1-2
[43:13] was the vision that John thought was a
[43:16] future event
[43:17] when in fact
[43:19] the vision he was seeing of Revelation 6
[43:21] 1-2 was present tense and was happening
[43:25] even as he was seeing this vision and
[43:28] would continue to unfold for the next
[43:30] 300 years
[43:32] you see the mind of God in two verses of
[43:36] Revelation 6 1-2
[43:37] in the mind of God was 300 years of
[43:41] unfolding of this vision
[43:44] and he was going to tell us a little bit
[43:46] at a time
[43:47] when was he going to tell us when the
[43:49] seven seal opened
[43:51] when the Elijah Ministry came
[43:54] when the pale horse rider began his ride
[43:56] he was going to this prophetic Ministry
[43:59] he was going to fill in all the details
[44:01] that were in the mind of God in these
[44:03] two verses of the opening of the first
[44:06] seal of part one of redemption to get
[44:09] you and I back into his presence
[44:12] not just here
[44:14] from time to time but eternally and
[44:17] forever
[44:19] so Revelation 6 1-2 was this Vision John
[44:24] thought was a future event when in fact
[44:27] it was present tense and happening
[44:30] as a matter of fact it started even
[44:32] before the Book of Revelations was
[44:35] written
[44:37] because before the Book of Revelations
[44:40] was written it was a spoken word and a
[44:43] plan in the mind of God
[44:46] it was present tense and was happening
[44:49] even as he was seeing the vision and
[44:51] would continue to unfold for the next
[44:53] 300 years because the first seal
[44:57] was from the church age of Ephesus all
[45:01] the way to perdimist part one the first
[45:04] seal covered three churches a prophet
[45:07] Senate who will touch it and share those
[45:10] quotes with a little later
[45:12] but it isn't one seal for church age no
[45:15] no
[45:16] that's not the way it is it's one living
[45:19] creep and even the living creatures
[45:22] travel with each one of those seals
[45:25] even the white horse rider
[45:27] so four seals really were unfolding
[45:31] throughout seven Church pages
[45:34] the firstborn
[45:38] and the first four writers
[45:40] rode
[45:42] the Antichrist throws seven through
[45:44] changes can the four living creatures
[45:46] from the minister the first The Pale
[45:48] Horse Rider and the horse riders were
[45:50] the ministry of Lucifer
[45:53] to try to to destroy the plan of God and
[45:57] God's children
[45:58] to give them eternal life
[46:01] because Satan the Bible says is a liar
[46:04] and a murderer from the beginning
[46:07] so here we have it
[46:10] 300 years this first seal this part one
[46:13] see Visions have a life span Revelations
[46:17] 5 when John saw it it had been unfolding
[46:21] for four thousand years
[46:23] and it has not expired it God still has
[46:26] a representation like a lamb slain
[46:29] forever interceding for our sins our
[46:32] healing our Salvation our joy our body
[46:35] change Revelation 6 is the vision
[46:39] but Matthew 11 is where the vision began
[46:42] to unfold in its reality
[46:45] which was more than 30 years prior to
[46:47] John seeing the vision of these events
[46:50] so
[46:51] in Matthew 11 was A.D 30-31
[46:56] John was on the Isle of Patmos on
[47:00] ad67-69.
[47:04] so that means
[47:05] that when this first sealed part one of
[47:08] redemption begun to unfold
[47:10] The Book of Revelations was not even
[47:12] written yet
[47:17] what is what is the thunder of God
[47:20] president a thunder
[47:22] is the voice of God when the seal is
[47:25] open
[47:26] not when it's written
[47:28] when it opens a thunder is the voice of
[47:32] God
[47:33] when the seal is open God come on the
[47:37] scene
[47:37] Jesus of Nazareth God and flesh the son
[47:40] of God
[47:41] and he began to speak about his plan to
[47:45] redeem okay and when he spoke it opened
[47:48] that seal when he spoke it opened part
[47:50] one
[47:52] it didn't have to be a written word
[47:55] in Genesis
[47:57] when God created the heavens and the
[47:59] Earth
[48:01] you realize that it wasn't even written
[48:04] for almost 2500 years later when Moses
[48:07] God gave Moses the vision to write the
[48:10] Book of Genesis
[48:11] he didn't have to write it first to
[48:14] create heavens and earth no he had to
[48:15] speak it and if the spoken word that we
[48:19] have yet today that's the one that
[48:21] speaks to our hearts that's the one that
[48:23] gives us Revelation that's the one that
[48:25] changes Our Lives it's not the written
[48:28] word
[48:29] I think the Bible it may still be the
[48:32] most sold book in the world
[48:35] and the most misunderstood book in the
[48:38] world
[48:40] but though it's the most soul I don't
[48:42] think it's the most read
[48:44] and it certainly is the least understood
[48:47] because it requires a revelation
[48:50] Matthew 11 and verse 1.
[48:54] this is the beginning
[48:57] this is the opening for the first seal
[48:59] part one of a Plan of Redemption
[49:03] Jesus Christ the son of God
[49:07] opening the word opening this great Plan
[49:10] of Redemption to restore us
[49:13] to give us a different kind of birth
[49:17] of birth like his birth the born-again
[49:20] experience is a supernatural experience
[49:22] with the father
[49:24] and when you're born again of the spirit
[49:26] of God your appetite changes the way you
[49:30] talk changes the things the music you
[49:32] listen to Changes Everything Changes
[49:35] because you've been born again of the
[49:37] spirit God and you put the carnal and
[49:40] flesh things you push them to one side
[49:43] and you say I'm following Jesus from
[49:45] this day forward
[49:47] so Matthew 11 1 it says and it came to
[49:51] pass when Jesus had made an end of
[49:53] commanding his 12 disciples
[49:56] he departed then to teach and to preach
[49:58] in their cities the Teaching Ministry
[50:02] of the Seven Seals had begun and Jesus
[50:05] with the teacher
[50:07] here he is both The Lion and the lamb
[50:10] and his Thunder is that he is now going
[50:14] to teach them by the spoken word
[50:16] because the things he's going to start
[50:18] teaching were not written yet
[50:21] he is teaching by the spoken word
[50:25] before it had not been written yet he's
[50:28] teaching them how to recognize their day
[50:31] and and the message of Elijah in Matthew
[50:33] 11. oh you'll have to go back and make
[50:37] time to read it slowly verse by verse
[50:40] and recognize that's the opening of the
[50:42] first seal that's the beginning of part
[50:45] one there's the lamb and the lion right
[50:47] there there's the Thunder of God going
[50:50] forth what is the thunder but it says a
[50:53] thunder
[50:54] is the voice of God so let me ask you is
[50:57] was Jesus the voice of God
[51:00] he was gone
[51:02] the Thunder is the voice of God
[51:05] when a seal is open
[51:07] the Thunder is the voice of God when
[51:09] part one started unfolding
[51:12] for our salvation for our healing for
[51:15] our deliverance for our strength
[51:18] to live a life worthy of the Gospel a
[51:20] Christian Life
[51:22] thank you
[51:23] so here Matthew 1 11 1 and it came to
[51:28] pass when Jesus had made an end of
[51:30] commanding his twelve disciples he
[51:33] departed then to teach and to preach in
[51:36] their cities in other words Jesus the
[51:39] line of the tribe of Judah he said he's
[51:42] telling everybody
[51:43] come and see
[51:47] come and see I'm in Biden this morning
[51:50] come into the word come and see
[51:52] here he's both The Lion and the lamb
[51:56] and his Thunder is because he's now
[51:58] going to teach by the spoken word
[52:01] for as I said it hadn't even been
[52:04] written yet the things he was going to
[52:06] teach he's teaching them how to
[52:07] recognize their day their message of
[52:11] Elijah and Elijah who was to introduce
[52:14] to them Christ
[52:16] and yet here he is Jesus himself is
[52:20] going to introduce Elijah
[52:22] because they missed it
[52:25] they didn't know who John was
[52:28] but Jesus is going to make it plain and
[52:31] yet the Bible says and the multitudes
[52:33] walked away and they didn't get it
[52:36] what was Jesus speaking of in Matthew 11
[52:37] his first coming
[52:42] and tell me as he spoke about his first
[52:44] coming was it a future prophecy
[52:48] what is it was it a past prophecy it was
[52:51] happening right as he was speaking about
[52:54] it it was present tense this prophecy
[52:57] that this teaching he was teaching them
[52:59] about it was happening right in front of
[53:01] their eyes
[53:02] and they couldn't get it
[53:06] so Jesus is teaching
[53:08] here in Matthew 11.
[53:10] on Malachi 4 5 and 6.
[53:13] he's connecting it to Malachi 3. he's
[53:16] connecting so many scriptures here
[53:19] showing them that this day this
[53:21] scripture is fulfilled that John is this
[53:24] Elijah and that the Lord Of Glory has
[53:26] come this is Revelation 6 1-2 unfolding
[53:31] Jesus patting more detail to the opening
[53:35] of this verse Seal because when John saw
[53:37] the vision
[53:38] it was just two verses
[53:40] where did he say there was going to be a
[53:42] forerunner where did he say there was
[53:44] coming in Elijah in Revelation 6 1-2 it
[53:47] didn't say it but when Jesus grabbed the
[53:50] hold of that scripture and pulled it
[53:52] down from his mind now he begins to add
[53:55] to it when this first seal opens it's
[53:58] going to open because a forerunner is
[54:00] coming
[54:01] behold I'll send you lies with the
[54:03] prophet for the great and terrible day
[54:05] of the Lord and He will turn the hearts
[54:08] of the fathers to the children the
[54:10] ministry of John
[54:11] comma
[54:13] and turn the hearts of the children to
[54:15] the father and that comma represented a
[54:17] time of tooth over 2 000 years
[54:21] from his first coming to the second
[54:23] coming from the first Elijah to the
[54:25] second Elijah
[54:27] from from part one the first seal to
[54:29] part seven the seventh seal in a single
[54:31] comma he divided it oh it takes
[54:35] Revelation and Upon This Rock I'll build
[54:38] my church and the Gates of Hell will not
[54:40] Prevail it'll take a revelation it'll
[54:43] take you having a conversation with
[54:46] almighty God
[54:49] on a regular basis
[54:52] at home
[54:55] when I'm washing dishes
[54:57] of course I've only done that like four
[54:58] times in 40 years since I got married
[55:03] but some of you wash dishes more often
[55:05] and it's right there where he can speak
[55:07] to you and bring down Revelation to your
[55:10] hearts that not even theologians and
[55:14] doctors of divinity come this close to
[55:17] understanding what God can give you
[55:21] so Jesus Matthew 11 he begins teaching
[55:25] on Malachi 4 5 and 6. he connects it
[55:28] with Malachi 3
[55:30] showing them this day these scriptures
[55:34] I'm talking about are happening right
[55:37] now
[55:37] that John is this Elijah and that the
[55:40] Lord Of Glory is come him
[55:44] the Lord Of Glory has come
[55:48] whisper he probably said me
[55:54] so Revelation 6 1 is unfolding in
[55:57] Matthew 11. it's happening in real time
[56:00] can Jesus is adding more detail to the
[56:04] opening of part one of seven parts of a
[56:07] great Plan of Redemption
[56:12] verse 2 of Matthew 11
[56:14] now when John had heard
[56:17] in the prison
[56:18] The Works of Christ he sent two of his
[56:21] disciples
[56:23] the ministry of John had ended he had
[56:26] fulfilled everything he needed to
[56:27] fulfill
[56:29] God could have let him die a simple
[56:33] death out in the woods go off and lean
[56:35] against a tree in his heart stopped
[56:38] but John died a Vine of death
[56:41] but John died for the gospel that he
[56:43] preached
[56:45] now when John had heard in the prison
[56:47] The Works of Christ
[56:49] he sent two of his disciples
[56:51] true he knew Christ he knew that that
[56:55] was his cousin
[56:57] they had met they had talked
[57:02] they've had private conversations that
[57:04] aren't read that aren't that aren't
[57:05] written in the Bible
[57:08] John knew him well
[57:10] John saw the mighty works that he did
[57:13] and the Miracles of his first full
[57:15] ministry as an evangelist praying for
[57:17] the sick but now John's thrown into
[57:19] prison
[57:21] a prophet tells us
[57:22] the eyes of this Prophet had dimmed over
[57:26] he was feeling rejected
[57:29] he was feeling alone he was doubting his
[57:32] own Ministry who he was attending when
[57:34] he would doubt when you doubt yourself
[57:36] you start doubting who others are in
[57:38] your life
[57:41] but when the Holy Ghost comes into our
[57:43] lives and starts lifting us up when we
[57:45] see who we are then once again we can
[57:48] look around and see who our friends and
[57:50] brothers and sisters in the Christ
[57:51] really are
[57:54] that's a refilling of the Holy Ghost
[57:57] when we once again see I'm a Son of God
[58:00] I'm A Daughter of Zion that's who I am
[58:03] plan seven of the Seven Seals revealed
[58:06] it to me that's where I'm living I'm
[58:09] being mentored by the Father the holy
[58:11] spirit being prepared for Rapture in
[58:14] faith
[58:17] Matthew 3.
[58:19] after after John who's in the prison he
[58:22] sent two of his disciples and in Matthew
[58:24] 11 3 and said unto him
[58:27] to Art Thou he that should come or do we
[58:30] look for another
[58:33] a prophet
[58:35] a mighty prophet
[58:37] but he's just a prophet who's just a man
[58:40] he was having doubts because he would
[58:43] because he was in a tough situation
[58:47] he knew his days were numbered maybe two
[58:50] or three days maybe a day maybe the next
[58:52] 24 hours maybe another week in prison
[58:54] and they'd behead him
[58:57] in verse 4 Jesus answered and said unto
[59:00] him go and show John again those things
[59:03] which you do here
[59:06] and see
[59:07] take John a testimony
[59:10] tell them this is what we heard this is
[59:14] what we saw with our own eyes
[59:16] details that are under the opening of
[59:19] the first seal take John these details
[59:22] it's the same things that would repeat
[59:24] under the opening
[59:26] of the seven seal the pattern of God's
[59:29] word God's word has a pattern in
[59:32] everything because Jesus Christ is the
[59:35] same yesterday today and forever because
[59:37] God is unchanging in all of his ways oh
[59:41] if you catch the pattern from Genesis
[59:43] you'll see it all the way to the end
[59:45] and you'll see the pattern of how he's
[59:47] working in your own life
[59:49] and how he's working in my life
[59:51] verse 5
[59:53] Jesus said this is what I want you to
[59:56] tell John
[59:57] it'll wake him up it'll encourage him
[1:00:00] it'll know he's he's done everything
[1:00:02] correctly and right and his reward
[1:00:04] stands before him
[1:00:06] the blind received their sight
[1:00:09] the lame walk
[1:00:11] the lepers are cleansed
[1:00:13] the deaf here the dead are raised up
[1:00:16] it's almost like we're talking of the
[1:00:20] ministry of this end time Prophets
[1:00:23] but he wasn't the first to display this
[1:00:25] it was this Prophet the prophet of
[1:00:28] prophets a god Prophet Jesus Christ so
[1:00:31] the pattern had to follow it's the
[1:00:34] pattern
[1:00:36] the blind received their sight the lame
[1:00:38] walk the lepers are cleansed and the
[1:00:40] death here
[1:00:42] the dead are raised up and the poor at
[1:00:45] the gospel
[1:00:46] preached to him
[1:00:47] Jesus is now adding detail again to the
[1:00:51] opening of the first seal and detailed
[1:00:54] to the opening of the seventh Year ah
[1:01:02] they can't miss it doesn't miss
[1:01:06] but men trained in seminaries and Bible
[1:01:09] schools
[1:01:11] they're not taught the pattern of God
[1:01:13] they're taught propaganda they're taught
[1:01:18] they're taught Church catechisms
[1:01:22] they're taught Godless
[1:01:24] and when presented with this message
[1:01:27] they go where in the world
[1:01:30] we say we get it from the Bible the word
[1:01:34] they can't see it because what they
[1:01:37] received is dogmas and propaganda of
[1:01:40] denominations from the Catholic to the
[1:01:42] Pentecostal
[1:01:44] but God has taken us back into his room
[1:01:51] the blind received their sight the lame
[1:01:53] walk the lepers are cleansed the death
[1:01:56] here the dead are raised up and the poor
[1:02:00] have the gospel preached to them when
[1:02:03] at the opening River seal
[1:02:06] at part one of seven parts of a Plan of
[1:02:10] Redemption to redeem Israel the Fig Tree
[1:02:13] and to redeem the bride tree of gentile
[1:02:16] people you and I
[1:02:18] this happened at the opening of the
[1:02:20] first seal so it's the pattern of
[1:02:22] redemption at the opening of The Seven
[1:02:24] seal and we can say we saw it we believe
[1:02:29] it it happened
[1:02:32] God rich in Mercy
[1:02:37] Jesus
[1:02:40] Matthew 11 preaching
[1:02:43] of his first coming
[1:02:45] giving us detail
[1:02:48] opening the first seal here part one
[1:02:51] it's opening right here before our eyes
[1:02:55] is adding detail telling us the the
[1:02:58] process of the opening of this seal part
[1:03:01] one of the Plan of Redemption salvation
[1:03:05] restoration healing virtue
[1:03:10] Minds being healed
[1:03:13] hearts that are hard being softened
[1:03:16] salvation being extended to all in this
[1:03:19] great plan
[1:03:21] Elijah
[1:03:23] the Forerunner
[1:03:25] Messiah the king of the Jews and the
[1:03:28] Antichrist ride has begun
[1:03:31] right here in Matthew
[1:03:33] this is where it started we can put our
[1:03:36] finger on it now where it started it's
[1:03:39] right here in the word and it's right
[1:03:40] here in the Bible
[1:03:42] verse 6 of Matthew 11.
[1:03:46] and blessed is he
[1:03:59] magazine or the sports page or
[1:04:03] some form of entertainment don't read it
[1:04:07] like a non-fiction book
[1:04:10] because as you read one verse you don't
[1:04:13] understand it many times you know where
[1:04:15] the answer and Revelations for that
[1:04:17] please
[1:04:18] in the next two or three verses
[1:04:19] sometimes in the very next verse
[1:04:22] so Jesus is speaking to the people
[1:04:27] and in verse six he said
[1:04:30] and blessed is he
[1:04:33] whosoever shall not be offended he's
[1:04:36] speaking to a multitude of people you
[1:04:37] know what he's doing he's earning the
[1:04:40] hearts of that crowd
[1:04:42] knowing that many are being offended
[1:04:45] with what he is saying
[1:04:47] can you catch that he caught that spirit
[1:04:49] and he says okay
[1:04:52] let me say
[1:04:54] let me exhort and rebuke you in a
[1:04:56] positive way how shall I start this yes
[1:04:58] I know how because he's God he said and
[1:05:01] blessed is he
[1:05:03] takes the pressure up okay oh he's
[1:05:05] blessing us now and blessed is he
[1:05:08] whosoever shall not be offended why he's
[1:05:12] even teaching us how to talk in tough
[1:05:14] situations
[1:05:17] when people offend you at work
[1:05:21] say something nasty to you
[1:05:26] can tell them
[1:05:28] you know what blessed are you
[1:05:34] if you could understand what I
[1:05:36] understand instead of misinterpreted
[1:05:44] all the things that God teaches us in
[1:05:47] every verse verse 8
[1:05:49] he said
[1:05:51] about what verse 7 and as they departed
[1:05:54] Jesus
[1:06:05] and as they're getting up and leaving
[1:06:07] Jesus begins to send to the multitudes
[1:06:10] that are all walking away from me
[1:06:12] concerning John
[1:06:14] what went into the Wilderness to see
[1:06:16] because
[1:06:18] for people that have followed John in
[1:06:21] these multitudes were people that John
[1:06:23] were people that John had baptized
[1:06:27] but now they're walking away from the
[1:06:29] Living Word they're walking away from
[1:06:31] from the one that John identified as the
[1:06:33] Lamb of God
[1:06:36] and as they departed Jesus began to
[1:06:39] begin to turn you John what went ye out
[1:06:42] into the Wilderness to see
[1:06:44] a reed shaken With the Wind
[1:06:47] he's and he's speaking all of this in
[1:06:50] parables
[1:06:51] this is the parable of the first coming
[1:06:54] of Christ this is the parable of the
[1:06:57] opening of the first seal this is the
[1:06:58] parable of part one
[1:07:02] of a plan to redeem it to save you
[1:07:06] to baptize you with his holy spirit a
[1:07:09] plan to offer you the born-again
[1:07:11] experience
[1:07:13] you need only say I accept it Lord
[1:07:16] if you need only repent and be baptized
[1:07:19] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:07:25] and as they departed Jesus began to say
[1:07:27] unto the multitudes concerning John what
[1:07:30] went me out to the Wilderness to see
[1:07:32] a reed shaken with the wind but what
[1:07:35] when you out for you to see a man
[1:07:37] clothed in soft Raymond behold they that
[1:07:39] wear soft clothing are in King's houses
[1:07:43] but what when you're out to see a
[1:07:45] prophet yes he says a prophet and I say
[1:07:49] unto you more than a prophet
[1:07:52] the Elijah of the first coming
[1:07:55] he was a prophet
[1:07:57] but he was more than a prophet before he
[1:07:59] was a forerunner to the first imminent
[1:08:01] person so what about the Elijah of the
[1:08:03] second coming
[1:08:04] will he be a prophet he'll be a prophet
[1:08:07] and he'll be more than a prophet it's
[1:08:10] because he will be a forerunner to the
[1:08:12] second coming of Christ
[1:08:14] verse 10. for this is he of whom it is
[1:08:17] written behold I send my messenger
[1:08:21] before thy face which shall prepare thy
[1:08:23] way before thee
[1:08:26] now
[1:08:28] he's sharing with them
[1:08:30] a revelation he's unfolding the word
[1:08:35] right Revelation 6 1 the lion said come
[1:08:39] and see
[1:08:41] we're going to have a teaching
[1:08:43] a Teaching Ministry
[1:08:46] for this is Hume king of whom it is
[1:08:49] written behold I send my messenger
[1:08:51] before thy face which shall prepare thy
[1:08:53] Wayne before thee now he's going to
[1:08:56] connect John to this prophecy of Malachi
[1:08:59] 3. Jesus was quoting The Book of Malachi
[1:09:02] Jesus is quoting the prophet Malachi
[1:09:04] because it was God that gave Malachi
[1:09:07] these words to say and put in a book of
[1:09:10] Prophecy
[1:09:12] Malachi 3 1 said
[1:09:14] behold I send my messenger and he shall
[1:09:17] prepare the way before me can the Lord
[1:09:20] whom ye seek shall suddenly come to his
[1:09:23] Temple
[1:09:25] even the messenger of the Covenant whom
[1:09:28] he Delight in behold he shall come saith
[1:09:31] the Lord of hosts
[1:09:34] hmm
[1:09:36] Jesus was identifying John
[1:09:40] in the scriptures Jesus was saying to
[1:09:42] this to to
[1:09:44] Israel
[1:09:46] who believed the Old Testament
[1:09:48] who believed Malachi 3 1 he's saying
[1:09:51] Malachi 3 1 behold I send my messenger
[1:09:53] you know who that is
[1:09:55] that that Malachi spoke of 400 years ago
[1:09:59] it's this man John that's sinning in
[1:10:02] herod's prison cell waiting to be
[1:10:04] executed he is this man
[1:10:07] and this day this scripture is fulfilled
[1:10:11] unfolded it's finished and John
[1:10:14] fulfilled it all all the things that he
[1:10:17] was revealing to the multitudes
[1:10:20] and the multitudes has just gotten bored
[1:10:23] we liked you better
[1:10:26] when you were evangelist just praying
[1:10:28] for the sick
[1:10:29] and the dead were being raised and the
[1:10:31] blind eyes were seen my cousin who was
[1:10:34] deaf he can hear again
[1:10:37] and my mother's best friend Rosie
[1:10:40] who had terminal cancer and a lump on
[1:10:43] her neck
[1:10:45] and the doctors had given her up go home
[1:10:47] and die you might have a week two weeks
[1:10:49] three weeks
[1:10:51] and she got a prayer card
[1:10:55] in California
[1:10:57] they went to the service
[1:10:59] and a prophet and more than a prophet
[1:11:01] prayed for Rosie
[1:11:04] and the lump fell off
[1:11:07] when the cancer was gone
[1:11:12] and yet that was just to catch the
[1:11:15] attention
[1:11:17] of the honest and hard
[1:11:21] of sons and daughters that were lost in
[1:11:24] the world lost in denominations
[1:11:27] Creeds Darkness
[1:11:31] Seminary teachings
[1:11:35] with no hope
[1:11:37] till God opened part seven
[1:11:40] because in the Days of Elijah the pale
[1:11:43] horse rider began and part seven opened
[1:11:46] the seventh seal
[1:11:50] Matthew 11 verse 11 11.
[1:11:54] Verity I say unto you
[1:11:57] he's emphasizing the ministry of John
[1:12:00] he's identifying who John is
[1:12:03] because John publicly identified who he
[1:12:06] was
[1:12:08] if they can believe that John is this
[1:12:11] Malachi 3 if they can believe that John
[1:12:13] is the Elijah the first Elijah of
[1:12:16] Malachi 4 5 and 6.
[1:12:19] then they will believe him
[1:12:21] he's trying to get the people to see the
[1:12:23] ministry of John that believed in John
[1:12:27] because if they believed in John then
[1:12:29] they'll believe one said but this man
[1:12:30] behold Jesus Nazareth he's the Lamb of
[1:12:34] God you see it
[1:12:36] verily I say unto you among them that
[1:12:39] are born of women verse 11. there have
[1:12:41] not risen a greater than John the
[1:12:44] Baptist notwithstanding
[1:12:46] he that is least in the Kingdom of
[1:12:48] Heaven is greater than he as we've said
[1:12:51] before
[1:12:52] Lord Jesus is he the greatest or he's
[1:12:55] not the greatest just tell us one thing
[1:12:57] which one is he
[1:12:59] he told us both he's the greatest and
[1:13:02] he's the least
[1:13:04] watch how he said it
[1:13:07] barely I sent you among them that are
[1:13:09] born of women
[1:13:10] everyone on planet Earth
[1:13:13] is born of a woman
[1:13:14] amongst them that are born of women
[1:13:17] there had not risen a greater than John
[1:13:19] the Baptist
[1:13:21] Sinners and Saints alike's presidents
[1:13:23] and and the bums on the street
[1:13:27] it says amongst them that are born of
[1:13:30] women there had not risen a greater than
[1:13:32] John the Baptist
[1:13:33] notwithstanding
[1:13:35] he that he that is least in the Kingdom
[1:13:39] of Heaven
[1:13:40] is greater than you he's speaking of two
[1:13:43] kingdoms the Earthly carnal Kingdom
[1:13:47] and the family of God
[1:13:49] in this Earthly carnal Kingdom there's
[1:13:52] not a greater man than than John he's
[1:13:54] the greatest
[1:13:55] but in the Kingdom of Heaven John was
[1:13:58] called to be a servant to God's people
[1:14:01] and he said and he said and he that is
[1:14:04] least in the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:14:07] is greater than he
[1:14:09] for I've sent this faithful Ministry to
[1:14:13] serve my people
[1:14:14] and not be Lords over them for they for
[1:14:17] my children my family has one Lord one
[1:14:20] Christ one savior one Redeemer one
[1:14:23] Healer and it's not the ministry of
[1:14:26] faithful Ministry they are the sermons
[1:14:28] to God's people
[1:14:30] and we are the least
[1:14:33] so when you see someone acting contrary
[1:14:35] to that
[1:14:36] you know
[1:14:38] you know where they are spiritually
[1:14:41] you know the condition of their hearts
[1:14:45] verse 12. and from the days of John the
[1:14:49] Baptist until now
[1:14:52] the Kingdom of Heaven set for the
[1:14:54] violence
[1:14:55] and the violent take it by force
[1:15:00] if you grew up Pentecostal you grew up
[1:15:03] in the Apostolic Church
[1:15:05] the Jesus name denomination
[1:15:08] they all taught this
[1:15:10] that this scripture was the followers
[1:15:14] and Believers of Jesus that were rising
[1:15:17] up with great Valor and courage and
[1:15:19] they're going to fight for what they
[1:15:21] believe in
[1:15:22] that is wrong
[1:15:26] that is a denominational dogma and not a
[1:15:30] scriptural truth
[1:15:34] I know it's hard to hear
[1:15:37] because I heard it all my life as a kid
[1:15:39] too that's what it meant
[1:15:41] I've heard I've heard people ministers
[1:15:46] who were in apostolics all their lives
[1:15:49] come into the message and they still say
[1:15:51] it that way
[1:15:53] but it's not true
[1:15:55] that's human reasoning
[1:15:57] and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:16:00] until now the Kingdom of Heaven the
[1:16:03] Kingdom of Heaven God's kingdom God's
[1:16:05] children are suffering violence
[1:16:08] and the violent take them by force
[1:16:12] taku
[1:16:15] the children of the Kingdom
[1:16:17] in other words Israel was in a great
[1:16:19] persecution everyone that was following
[1:16:22] Jesus of Nazareth was being persecuted
[1:16:24] at this time
[1:16:27] by the Jewish Orthodox church and by the
[1:16:30] Pagan Roman government
[1:16:33] everyone had their guns set on the
[1:16:37] believer
[1:16:38] that was following John it was following
[1:16:40] Jesus
[1:16:42] remember Isaiah 53
[1:16:45] which Isaiah 53 is also
[1:16:50] a scripture that adds detail to the
[1:16:52] opening of the first seal it's an Old
[1:16:55] Testament Prophecy of the opening of the
[1:16:58] first seal part one
[1:17:00] hmm
[1:17:02] showing us more detail to the same event
[1:17:05] let's read Isaiah 53
[1:17:08] and verse 9.
[1:17:10] because it's going to connect us with
[1:17:12] what we just read in verse 12. it's
[1:17:14] going to give us understanding
[1:17:18] and verse 9
[1:17:20] of Isaiah 53 it says
[1:17:23] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:17:26] talking about Christ because Isaiah 53
[1:17:28] is all about Christ
[1:17:30] from the first verse to the last
[1:17:33] Isaiah 53 starts talking about Jesus
[1:17:36] when he's a 12 year old boy all the way
[1:17:38] to the time he's crucified
[1:17:41] so let's read it it's Isaiah 53-9 can he
[1:17:44] made his grave with the wicked that was
[1:17:46] Jesus
[1:17:47] it was a prophecy and with the rich in
[1:17:51] his death remember it was Joseph of
[1:17:54] aramethia that would take him a rich and
[1:17:57] prominent man in Israel at the time and
[1:17:59] a follower and believer of Christ asked
[1:18:01] for the body of Jesus from Pontius
[1:18:03] Pilate
[1:18:05] an influential man Pontius Pilate knew
[1:18:09] him this man's got money okay what's it
[1:18:11] worth to you arametha you just say the
[1:18:14] price you just tell me what it's worth
[1:18:16] to you Pontius Pilate and it's I'll give
[1:18:18] it I'll give it to you right now they
[1:18:20] made a deal he said he's the body's all
[1:18:22] yours taken so that prophecy could be
[1:18:25] fulfilled
[1:18:27] and he made his grave with the wicked
[1:18:29] and with the rich in his death because
[1:18:31] he had done no violence
[1:18:34] neither was any deceit in his mouth
[1:18:42] no bidens
[1:18:45] Matthew 11 verse 13.
[1:18:48] it says for all the prophets and the law
[1:18:52] prophesied until John
[1:18:55] so then what should we expect after John
[1:18:59] verse 14 says and if you will receive it
[1:19:03] this is Elijah which was to come
[1:19:07] he plainly puts in John in the prophecy
[1:19:11] this is Elijah John which was to come
[1:19:15] Malachi 4 1-6 you should expect this
[1:19:19] Elijah John to turn the hearts of the
[1:19:22] fathers to the children
[1:19:24] and he did
[1:19:27] in verse 15.
[1:19:29] he said he that hath an ear
[1:19:33] to hear Let Him hear
[1:19:36] this statement is used at the end of
[1:19:40] every Church age
[1:19:42] in the Book of Revelations
[1:19:45] but The Book of Revelations hadn't been
[1:19:48] written yet
[1:19:49] so this was the spoken word
[1:19:52] that would be written seven times in
[1:19:55] every age
[1:19:57] so what was beginning
[1:19:59] the first church age
[1:20:01] an overlap of Jewish age and Gentile
[1:20:04] ages
[1:20:05] what was what was unfolding the first
[1:20:07] steal part one of redemption
[1:20:11] and the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:20:13] extended
[1:20:14] the open book
[1:20:16] and the revelation of the of these Seven
[1:20:19] Seals seven parts of redemption first to
[1:20:22] Israel
[1:20:24] he ordained his ministers the twelve go
[1:20:28] only to the house of Israel
[1:20:31] and when Israel rejected
[1:20:33] at the cross of Calvin
[1:20:36] the open book
[1:20:37] and the revelation of the Seven Seals
[1:20:39] was given to a gentile bride but was
[1:20:43] given to a New Testament Church was
[1:20:45] given to you and I
[1:20:48] it's the parable of the Old Testament
[1:20:50] we've said it many times we'll say it
[1:20:52] again
[1:20:53] when Joseph came to offer his two sons
[1:20:56] to Jacob that he would pray for them
[1:20:59] and give the patriarchal oh patriarchal
[1:21:01] blessing to the two boys
[1:21:04] so he put his eldest boy at Jacob's
[1:21:06] right hand between the youngest has his
[1:21:08] right
[1:21:11] the boys
[1:21:12] not two girls the boys in this instance
[1:21:15] represented two churches
[1:21:18] the Jewish orthodox
[1:21:20] and the Gentile Church a New Testament
[1:21:23] Church
[1:21:26] but the eldest son to him belonged The
[1:21:30] Lion's Share of all the inheritance of
[1:21:32] his father
[1:21:33] and Jacob knew this well and he was
[1:21:36] supposed to give it all to the eldest
[1:21:38] boy and just pronounce a blessing on the
[1:21:40] youngest
[1:21:42] he was blind he's dying
[1:21:46] what does he do he's going to do what he
[1:21:49] knows is the custom in Israel now when
[1:21:52] he goes to put his hands on the boys who
[1:21:54] already placed
[1:21:56] perfectly placed by his son Joseph
[1:22:00] he crosses his hands
[1:22:02] and he gives the Lion's Share
[1:22:05] to the youngest boy the New Testament
[1:22:08] Church
[1:22:10] because the Elder boy
[1:22:13] was going to reject it
[1:22:15] at the coming of Christ
[1:22:19] the two boys were two churches
[1:22:22] the hands were the cross of Calvin and
[1:22:25] at the cross of Calvary The Lion's Share
[1:22:28] that was first shared with Israel would
[1:22:30] be given to this New Testament Church
[1:22:33] called The Bride of God Jesus Christ The
[1:22:36] Lion's Share will be given
[1:22:39] to a man called Kenny and a sister
[1:22:41] called Rachel The Lion's Share would be
[1:22:43] given to a man called Orly
[1:22:47] and sister Orly
[1:22:50] The Lion's Share would be given to us
[1:22:54] for a chance of redemption salvation to
[1:22:57] be able to be changed in a moment in the
[1:23:01] twinkling of an eye the lion shall be
[1:23:03] given us before we could have Rapture in
[1:23:05] faith in this last hour this last day
[1:23:09] seven parts of a Plan of Redemption
[1:23:14] because the only way for his sons and
[1:23:17] daughters to be born now
[1:23:19] is through a woman
[1:23:21] it was going to take time for his
[1:23:24] millions and millions of children to be
[1:23:27] born on the Earth
[1:23:28] but God said I can wait
[1:23:31] and as each one is born
[1:23:34] I'll pluck them up
[1:23:35] and no one will take him out of my hand
[1:23:39] I'll wait for this slow process till
[1:23:42] they're all born
[1:23:45] but when the last one comes in
[1:23:48] I'll wrap this whole world up and as
[1:23:50] I've been cleansing your lives with Holy
[1:23:52] Fire I'll clean this Earth with Holy
[1:23:55] Fire and we'll all come back one day and
[1:23:57] divine
[1:23:58] indeed amen God
[1:24:01] the rich in Mercy
[1:24:04] verse 14 Matthew 11 and if you will
[1:24:07] receive it
[1:24:09] this is Elias John the Baptist which was
[1:24:12] for it to come
[1:24:13] and John fulfill this ministry and he
[1:24:17] turned the hearts of the fathers
[1:24:19] to the children
[1:24:21] verse 15.
[1:24:24] he that hath hears to hear him let this
[1:24:28] statement is used at the end of every
[1:24:31] Church age and he uses it here for it's
[1:24:34] the opening of the first seal
[1:24:36] and it's the overlap of the Ephesian
[1:24:38] Church age
[1:24:39] and the white horse rider in its reality
[1:24:43] form begins his ride in the Days of
[1:24:46] Elijah John the Baptist now the pattern
[1:24:49] is set now we understand
[1:24:51] one seal doesn't open
[1:24:54] for each Church age
[1:24:56] but instead the first four seals and
[1:25:00] Riders unfold throughout seven Church
[1:25:03] ages
[1:25:11] God
[1:25:13] rich in Mercy his word unfolding
[1:25:18] before our very eyes
[1:25:21] and where did we see it unfold
[1:25:27] and God is speaking here of John the
[1:25:29] Baptist
[1:25:33] I want to just pick up this one
[1:25:34] scripture
[1:26:10] just one moment
[1:26:20] so Matthew 11.
[1:26:23] is Jesus speaking on his first coming
[1:26:27] but it isn't prophecy no more as he's
[1:26:30] speaking to them on this first coming as
[1:26:33] he's speaking on the Elijah Ministry
[1:26:35] because he's speaking on the right of
[1:26:37] the Antichrist the white horse rider as
[1:26:41] he's speaking about it it's happening
[1:26:44] right as he's saying it
[1:26:46] it's not something future and yet the
[1:26:50] entire multitude walked away from him
[1:26:53] offended
[1:26:55] because they couldn't understand
[1:26:59] and yet
[1:27:01] there must have been someone
[1:27:04] when the multitudes walked away
[1:27:07] I don't doubt for one minute that of
[1:27:10] those thousands as Jesus seen him walk
[1:27:12] away and everyone pulled away from him
[1:27:15] that maybe there was
[1:27:17] five six seven left standard
[1:27:24] and Jesus might have told them
[1:27:27] you go also
[1:27:30] and maybe some little fella said to him
[1:27:32] Lord
[1:27:34] whom will we go to
[1:27:37] although we can't understand all your
[1:27:39] telliness
[1:27:40] we believe only you have words of
[1:27:44] eternal life
[1:27:46] and in due time we are sure that you'll
[1:27:50] reveal it to us
[1:27:51] if we keep pressing if we keep reading
[1:27:54] if we keep asking if we keep praying if
[1:27:58] we keep believing
[1:28:01] Uber partakers
[1:28:04] of this seventh seal
[1:28:06] part seven
[1:28:08] on how to get out of this world and how
[1:28:12] to live a life
[1:28:14] Victorious
[1:28:16] while we're here
[1:28:18] and when the trials just seem too heavy
[1:28:23] we know a refueling is promised
[1:28:27] because of refills you
[1:28:28] is for the hard trials we go through
[1:28:33] it's not a reward for being being a good
[1:28:35] boy
[1:28:37] yeah I I couldn't even be a good boy
[1:28:40] when I was just a boy
[1:28:43] they took Jesus and the refilling to
[1:28:47] assure me that despite my shortcomings
[1:28:49] and complexes I'm a son of God
[1:28:53] despite your shortcomings you're a
[1:28:55] daughter of God
[1:28:58] rich in Mercy
[1:29:21] first
[1:29:24] we read Isaiah 53 verse 9 where we're
[1:29:28] setting he made his grave with the
[1:29:29] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:29:32] because he had done no violence neither
[1:29:34] was any deceit in his mouth
[1:29:38] okay
[1:29:40] because verse 12 of Matthew 11 says and
[1:29:43] from the days of John the Baptist until
[1:29:45] now
[1:29:46] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[1:29:49] and the violence take it by force but
[1:29:53] Isaiah 53 says this Christ this Lord
[1:29:56] Jesus
[1:29:57] it said it said and he made his grave
[1:30:00] with the wicked
[1:30:01] and with the rich in his death
[1:30:03] because he had done no violence neither
[1:30:06] was any deceit in his mouth so the
[1:30:09] followers of Jesus
[1:30:12] were not violent people
[1:30:15] neither did they do violence
[1:30:18] John the Baptist when he was when he was
[1:30:20] baptized in there on the Jordan and the
[1:30:23] people would come and be baptized they
[1:30:24] would repent and be baptized that their
[1:30:27] sins might be forgiven that their sins
[1:30:29] might be remitted
[1:30:31] and as he was baptizing people came to
[1:30:34] him publicans
[1:30:37] publicans were Jews who had forsaken
[1:30:41] their religion
[1:30:42] For the Love of Money and got a job with
[1:30:45] the Roman government
[1:30:47] to attack to be to be the tax collectors
[1:30:49] for Rome they were hated of the Jewish
[1:30:52] people
[1:30:53] absolutely hated because they were Jews
[1:30:55] to as far as they were concerned were
[1:30:57] blasphemers Republicans
[1:31:00] Matthew
[1:31:02] was a publican
[1:31:03] and yet God changed his life
[1:31:07] gave him a Supernatural Ministry
[1:31:12] and the pumpkins came to John they and
[1:31:15] said
[1:31:17] Republicans
[1:31:19] you know you know what what all our
[1:31:21] Jewish people think of us
[1:31:23] we got a lot of enemies in Israel
[1:31:26] what can we do to be saved
[1:31:30] do we have to quit our job
[1:31:33] he says
[1:31:35] take only the taxes and the amount that
[1:31:39] Rome tells you to charge
[1:31:42] and don't take any more extra and put it
[1:31:45] in your pocket stop doing that
[1:31:48] stop doing that
[1:31:52] then the soldiers came to him Roman
[1:31:55] soldiers
[1:31:57] Temple guards
[1:32:00] and they and the Roman soldiers said
[1:32:02] what can we do to be saved
[1:32:05] we're soldiers of Rome
[1:32:09] he says
[1:32:10] this is what you do he says uh be happy
[1:32:14] with the wage they give you and do harm
[1:32:16] to no man
[1:32:19] how do you do that and remain a soldier
[1:32:22] of Rome
[1:32:24] you've got to quit
[1:32:26] you've got to walk away
[1:32:30] so what was John saying John was not a
[1:32:33] vine man of violence
[1:32:35] neither did he want men to be violent
[1:32:38] he wanted you rather to be a man who was
[1:32:40] willing to give his life for the gospel
[1:32:43] and for truth
[1:32:45] so this here where the Bible speaks
[1:32:51] that in the Days of Elijah
[1:32:54] what would take place
[1:32:57] let me just find that I keep touching
[1:33:00] the screen and it grows all over the
[1:33:01] place
[1:33:04] verse 12 and from the days of John the
[1:33:07] Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven
[1:33:09] suffeth violence
[1:33:10] and the violent take it by force
[1:33:13] the followers of Jesus were not by new
[1:33:16] people
[1:33:17] the followers come John the Baptist
[1:33:20] were not lighted people
[1:33:22] but the Jewish Orthodox Church was
[1:33:25] violent man
[1:33:28] and Rome was a nation of violence
[1:33:34] so this isn't believers they were
[1:33:36] bringing this persecution on the Kingdom
[1:33:38] of Heaven God's children
[1:33:41] this was the ride of the Antichrist
[1:33:44] anointing Israel and anointing Rome to
[1:33:49] persecute the Believers in Christ
[1:33:52] remember the second part
[1:33:55] of Revelation 6
[1:33:58] 1 and 2.
[1:33:59] how it read let's read it together
[1:34:02] Revelation 6
[1:34:17] the first seal we read the first one
[1:34:20] first seal the first verse and I saw
[1:34:23] when the lamb opened one of the seals
[1:34:25] and I heard as it were the noise of
[1:34:27] Thunder one of the first be sane come
[1:34:30] and see fulfilled in Matthew 11.
[1:34:34] fulfilled in Matthew 11. again in
[1:34:37] Matthew 11 Jesus adds more detail to
[1:34:39] this verse now verse 2 the second part
[1:34:42] and I saw and behold a white horse can
[1:34:45] he that sat on him had a bow and a crown
[1:34:48] was given unto him and he went forth
[1:34:50] concrete and to conquer
[1:34:54] he went forth
[1:34:56] creating violence
[1:34:59] and with violence taken by force
[1:35:03] Matthew 11.
[1:35:06] this scripture opened up in reality
[1:35:11] the white horse rider began
[1:35:15] in the days
[1:35:17] of
[1:35:18] John the Baptist the first Elijah
[1:35:24] God
[1:35:25] rich in Mercy
[1:35:30] Matthew 11.
[1:35:32] Jesus speaking in his first coming
[1:35:35] not that it was passed not that it was
[1:35:37] future it was happening right then as he
[1:35:41] was speaking about it
[1:35:42] the first seal opening the ephesianage
[1:35:45] unfolding
[1:35:47] and in our day and Elijah come on the
[1:35:50] scene speaking of the second coming like
[1:35:53] it was future
[1:35:54] but you know what
[1:35:56] it was happening
[1:35:57] as he was speaking and it's happening
[1:36:00] today
[1:36:01] there is prophecy and word of God
[1:36:03] unfolding as we're speaking this morning
[1:36:08] hmm
[1:36:10] his angels are encamped upon us
[1:36:13] giving us strength
[1:36:15] for this journey
[1:36:18] we'll stop there
[1:36:20] and I just want to say
[1:36:24] God's plan is taking us back
[1:36:28] God's plan is turning our hearts
[1:36:34] God's plan is working
[1:36:36] God's plan is changing us day by day
[1:36:39] God's plan is increasing our faith
[1:36:45] God's plan
[1:36:47] is to be the family of God together with
[1:36:50] him again eternally
[1:36:52] we thank you for coming to stand to our
[1:36:55] feet this morning
[1:37:03] we we tried something new we were doing
[1:37:08] the zoom for a few families that are
[1:37:10] listening
[1:37:11] I think this morning uh who I know this
[1:37:14] morning Joshua had changed it over to uh
[1:37:16] working through YouTube to broadcast the
[1:37:18] services
[1:37:20] and I hope it was a blessing to those
[1:37:22] that are listening
[1:37:24] um I hope it was got over nice and clear
[1:37:27] they've all expressed their desire to
[1:37:30] hear the services and and I pray it was
[1:37:32] a blessing for them and this is just
[1:37:34] part one of many parts of this this
[1:37:37] message
[1:37:38] the white horse rider in the Days of
[1:37:40] Elijah
[1:37:42] and because it's a pattern of God's word
[1:37:44] the pale horse rider in the Days of
[1:37:47] Elijah we stay with the pattern of the
[1:37:50] word and we can make all the Bible
[1:37:51] scriptures come together
[1:37:54] and it blesses our heart to see that
[1:37:56] this book is a book of Truth and a book
[1:37:59] of salvation
[1:38:02] and a book of eternal life
[1:38:04] we thank you for coming home as we pray
[1:38:07] Heavenly Father we thank you this
[1:38:09] morning
[1:38:11] we ask your blessings Lord Upon This Day
[1:38:15] and upon everyone who is present
[1:38:18] Lord everyone here was predestinated
[1:38:21] before the foundation of the world to be
[1:38:23] here
[1:38:24] you they were in your mind that they
[1:38:27] would be here and even hear this message
[1:38:30] surely it's because everyone here is a
[1:38:33] son and daughter of God at different
[1:38:36] stages we know at different levels we
[1:38:39] see it some 30 some 60 some 100. but
[1:38:43] every one of us ordained to grow in
[1:38:45] Christ to come to the Statue of a
[1:38:48] perfect man Lord the foundation
[1:38:50] statement of this seven seal is this
[1:38:54] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:38:57] the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall
[1:39:00] receive the gift of this Holy Ghost and
[1:39:04] Fire
[1:39:05] Lord we thank you for bless your
[1:39:07] children here now each and everyone the
[1:39:10] remainder of mistake
[1:39:11] and Lord to me the things I've said only
[1:39:15] urge them to go and have a personal
[1:39:18] experience with you
[1:39:20] to get back into this blessed book
[1:39:23] called The Bible where you can give them
[1:39:25] more Revelation at home that I could
[1:39:27] ever give them in a week
[1:39:29] open to them this open book in Jesus
[1:39:33] name we pray
[1:39:34] amen
[1:39:36] God bless you all this morning the Lord
[1:39:38] be with you but can you take this place
[1:39:59] thank you
[1:40:04] mm-hmm
[1:40:12] I just wanted to say that um
[1:40:19] I I believe that with brother Daniels
[1:40:22] was saying this is the truth and how
[1:40:25] that um
[1:40:27] the Lord
[1:40:29] wants to reveal himself to us on a daily
[1:40:31] basis
[1:40:33] and you know this came across my heart
[1:40:36] and I'm sure I'm human I'm sure it may
[1:40:39] have maybe come across yours but
[1:40:42] you know we I believe that we're a
[1:40:45] special people upon the face of the
[1:40:47] highest not that we're something but
[1:40:49] just because the Lord called us and that
[1:40:52] I just want to say that
[1:40:54] we
[1:40:56] Are Who We Are by the grace of God and I
[1:40:58] I believe that if we're not careful
[1:41:02] we can
[1:41:04] forget that you know it's a relationship
[1:41:09] we we are a special people are called
[1:41:12] people
[1:41:13] and so we don't want to fall into that
[1:41:15] that rut that you know the Lord has
[1:41:18] revealed himself to us that's true and
[1:41:21] he's made himself to us but we want to
[1:41:22] we want it to be a constant
[1:41:25] a revelation because the Lord is
[1:41:29] continually revealing himself
[1:41:32] and we want to we want to be sure that
[1:41:34] make our calling and election sure on a
[1:41:37] daily basis
[1:41:38] and uh
[1:41:40] the Lord just spoke to my heart saying
[1:41:42] you know
[1:41:44] you are a special people but
[1:41:47] we need to be seeking his face daily
[1:41:51] not it isn't just the Lord is revealed
[1:41:54] itself to you and and
[1:41:56] we've received the message of the hour
[1:41:59] and we know what we know and that's it
[1:42:01] nope then we put a period on it right we
[1:42:04] don't want to do that I'm just I'm I'm
[1:42:07] just sharing this from my heart because
[1:42:08] I I believe
[1:42:10] I've experienced that and I don't want
[1:42:13] to experience that no more I want to I
[1:42:15] want to I want the Lord to reveal
[1:42:17] himself to me on a daily basis because
[1:42:19] that's what we're called for it's a
[1:42:22] revelation that's the church built upon
[1:42:24] Jesus said Upon This Rock although my
[1:42:27] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:42:29] Prevail against
[1:42:30] so God bless you and we just want to
[1:42:34] sing a couple songs
[1:42:36] um
[1:42:37] I've just been thinking about a touch
[1:42:40] from the Lord
[1:42:42] you know
[1:42:43] when I first came to the Lord
[1:42:45] I remember before I come to the Lord and
[1:42:48] I he allowed me to come into His
[1:42:50] presence
[1:42:51] you know
[1:42:53] I've always desired to be in his
[1:42:56] presence
[1:42:58] I believe any son or daughter of God
[1:43:01] once you he allows you to be in his
[1:43:04] presence that's the greatest thing and
[1:43:08] and I just feel that
[1:43:12] I desire a touch
[1:43:15] so let's just sing this little song
[1:43:18] Just Another Touch Lord
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:23] oh just
[1:43:25] Another Touch Lord
[1:43:29] from you

[1:45:27] you know
[1:45:30] man can encourage you
[1:45:33] but God Only God can lift you up
[1:45:36] I believe that because we there's
[1:45:39] there's many men that have words of
[1:45:41] encouragement
[1:45:45] God lifts you up
[1:45:47] he not only does he encourage you but he
