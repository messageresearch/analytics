[1:14:29] 5 Esa es la profecía de esos problemas
[1:14:31] en cu
[1:14:34] se ese es el problema que llegó a
[1:14:40] israelí en la primera venida de
[1:14:44] Cristo todo hasta la gran
[1:14:50] tribulación Esos son los siete trompetas
[1:14:52] de revelaciones capítulo 88
[1:14:56] con más
[1:14:59] detalle que se puede ir
[1:15:04] agregando de las profecías de las
[1:15:06] visiones de
[1:15:08] Juan cuando vio a
[1:15:10] Israel en los tiempos de
[1:15:14] problemas Ezequiel
[1:15:18] 51 vamos a estar leyendo un poquito aquí
[1:15:21] de Ezequiel
[1:15:36] y tú hijo de hombre Tómate un cuchillo
[1:15:38] agudo toma una navaja de barbero y alza
[1:15:41] y hazla pasar sobre tu cabeza y tu barba
[1:15:43] toma después una balanza de pesar y
[1:15:46] divide los
[1:15:48] cabellos esa es
[1:15:50] profecía el profeta y su cabello
[1:15:55] hizo
[1:15:56] navaja y la balanza para
[1:15:59] pesar todo
[1:16:02] símbolo cómo Dios iba a juzgar a
[1:16:06] Israel cómo iba a esparcir losos a
[1:16:09] través del
[1:16:11] mundo y cómo iba a rejuntar losos otra
[1:16:14] vez en este en este tiempo final que
[1:16:18] vivimos esa es una
[1:16:20] alegoría esa es una
[1:16:23] metáfora su cabello de este
[1:16:25] profeta que iba a ser cortado y
[1:16:30] Pesado con
[1:16:33] Israel
[1:16:45] Vero una tercera parte quemarás a fuego
[1:16:48] y en medio de la ciudad cuando se
[1:16:51] cumplan los días del asedio
[1:17:00] la primera treta que empezó
[1:17:04] sonar ahora estaba
[1:17:07] sonando y lo que estaba se estaba
[1:17:12] diciendo lo que se
[1:17:15] esta de lo que se estaba
[1:17:18] hablando jerusal
[1:17:25] ciudad que iba a ser rodeada por el
[1:17:32] general El general Tito
[1:17:37] Romano llegó para purgar toda la
[1:17:42] tierra los
[1:17:45] mató quemó la ciudad H hasta
[1:17:50] cenizas es fue la primera trompeta
[1:17:55] bi las
[1:17:57] trompetas trompetas
[1:18:00] representan guerras y rumores de
[1:18:03] guerras Cuando llegamos a las últimas
[1:18:06] tres
[1:18:10] trompetas les mostraré cómo esos
[1:18:14] trompetas la quinta sexta y
[1:18:17] séptima conectada con los tres
[1:18:23] alles Qué quiere decir que conectado con
[1:18:26] tres alles Y
[1:18:30] Trompetas trompetas ya representa Las
[1:18:33] Guerras
[1:18:36] civiles persecuciones violentas de
[1:18:41] Israel cuando usted agrega un alles en
[1:18:44] la
[1:18:49] trompeta toma Esa esa guerra a otro
[1:18:52] nivel
[1:18:54] y al al nivel que lo
[1:18:57] lleva el de los tres
[1:19:00] alles fueron guerras
[1:19:06] mundiales Entonces el profeta en la
[1:19:09] Biblia hablando de los tres
[1:19:11] alles tres guerras
[1:19:16] mundiales 2000 años antes de que
[1:19:20] sucediera pero Dios sabía que es lo que
[1:19:23] se iba a tomar
[1:19:25] para traer esos hijos al regreso con
[1:19:29] él verso
[1:19:31] 2
[1:19:42] deel una tercera parte quemarás a fuego
[1:19:45] en medio de la ciudad y cuando se
[1:19:47] cumplan los días del
[1:19:52] asedio Tom una tercera parte y la
[1:19:55] cortará con espada alrededor de la
[1:20:01] ciudad y una tercera parte esparcirá al
[1:20:08] viento y yo desar espada en Pos de
[1:20:16] ellos Israel en el tiempo de Jesús iba a
[1:20:20] ser dividido en tres partes
[1:20:24] aún el pueblo gentil fue dividido en
[1:20:27] tres partes un creyente el
[1:20:32] manufacturado y el
[1:20:34] creyente tres clases de creyentes
[1:20:38] Israel cayendo en el
[1:20:42] patrón puede ver el patrón de la palabra
[1:20:44] de
[1:20:45] Dios entonces podemos ver la palabra de
[1:20:49] Dios desenvolviéndose
[1:20:50] para
[1:20:52] Israel para su salvación
[1:20:56] para el pueblo gentil para nuestra
[1:20:59] salvación verso
[1:21:05] 3 tomarás también de allí unos pocos en
[1:21:09] número y los atars en la falda de tu
[1:21:23] Man a través de ellos y los echarás en
[1:21:26] medio del fuego y en el fuego los
[1:21:28] quemarás de allí saldrá el fuego a toda
[1:21:31] la casa de
[1:21:33] Israel Israel ha sido
[1:21:36] esparcido la primera venida de
[1:21:41] Cristo y van a ser esparcidos en ese
[1:21:44] mismo
[1:21:45] día Esta es la séptima
[1:21:48] trompeta Esas son las siete
[1:21:51] trompetas de revelaciones capítulo o
[1:21:56] Esa es la profecía del Antiguo
[1:22:00] Testamento y conecta perfectamente con
[1:22:02] revelaciones capítulo
[1:22:08] 8 Así ha dicho Jehová el señor est es
[1:22:14] Jerusalén es de eso se está tratando de
[1:22:17] los últimos
[1:22:18] cuatro esto es Jerusalén
[1:22:25] la puse en medio de las Naciones y de
[1:22:27] las tierras alrededor de
[1:22:34] ella y ella cambió mis decretos y mis
[1:22:37] ordenanzas en Piedad más que las
[1:22:45] naciones Jehová estaba diciendo ella
[1:22:48] están viviendo más impi que las otras
[1:22:51] naciones
[1:22:57] porque a ella se le dio más palabra que
[1:22:59] las naciones paganas se les había
[1:23:05] dado Entonces nos damos cuenta que en
[1:23:08] este mensaje viven más piadosamente que
[1:23:10] el mundo por por esta
[1:23:17] razón a ella se le da más gracia que
[1:23:21] todas las denominaciones
[1:23:25] entonces Dios demanda más de
[1:23:28] nosotros a qui se le ha dado
[1:23:32] más más se le va a requerir en ese
[1:23:38] [Música]
[1:23:53] día Jehová por haberlos multiplicado más
[1:23:56] que las naciones que están alrededor de
[1:23:59] vosotros no habéis andado en mis
[1:24:01] mandamientos ni habéis guardado mis
[1:24:03] leyes Ni aún según las leyes de las
[1:24:06] naciones que están alrededor de vosotros
[1:24:08] habéis
[1:24:10] andado lord behold even
[1:24:19] am así pues ha dicho Jehová el señor He
[1:24:22] aquí yo estoy contra ti
[1:24:25] yo y haré juicios en medio de ti antes
[1:24:28] los ojos de las
[1:24:31] Naciones son las siete
[1:24:34] trompetas de
[1:24:36] revelaciones y
[1:24:38] nu y
[1:24:42] 11 Israel iba a ser
[1:24:45] esparcido como el
[1:24:49] viento esparce las hojas
[1:25:05] verso y en lo que nunca hice ni jamás
[1:25:09] haré cosa semejante a causa de todas las
[1:25:12] de todas tus abominaciones
[1:25:27] por tanto los padres comerán a los hijos
[1:25:29] en medio de ti y los hijos comerán a sus
[1:25:32] padres y haré en ti juicios y esparciré
[1:25:35] todos los vientos todo lo que quedar de
[1:25:41] ti en ese día cuando el general Romano
[1:25:49] Tito sitió la Ciudad de Jerusalén
[1:25:55] estaban
[1:25:56] bien estaba cercado con el pueblo
[1:26:02] judío el último judío que quedaba en
[1:26:08] Israel y sitio la
[1:26:12] ciudad no me acuerdo cuántos
[1:26:16] meses la historia
[1:26:19] dice los que estaban ahí en las paredes
[1:26:24] empezaron a comerse unos a
[1:26:27] otros mientras se
[1:26:32] muan fue hablado que iba a ser de esa
[1:26:35] manera 10
[1:27:00] por tanto vivo yo dice Jehová el señor
[1:27:02] ciertamente por haber profanado mi
[1:27:04] santuario con todas sus abominaciones te
[1:27:07] quebrantaré Yo también mi ojo no
[1:27:10] perdonará ni tampoco tendré yo
[1:27:15] misericordia un día Jesús caminaba en el
[1:27:24] ahí cambiando animales y

[1:31:56] en represión de ira yo Jehová he

[1:32:19] perniciosas saetas del hambre que serán
[1:32:22] para destrucción cuales enviaré para
[1:32:26] destruir en todos aumentaré el hambre
[1:32:29] sobre vosotros y quebrantaré entre

[1:32:44] pan enviaré pues sobre vosotros hambre y
[1:32:48] bestias feroces que que te destruyan y
[1:32:51] pestilencias y sangre pasarán por el
[1:32:55] medio de ti y enviaré sobre ti espada yo
[1:32:58] Jehová he
[1:33:02] hablado la gente dice Por qué Dios hace
[1:33:05] esto a la
[1:33:09] gente porque antes que el juicio
[1:33:13] pegue Dios les
[1:33:16] ofrece un libro
[1:33:19] abierto y la revelación de los siete
[1:33:22] sellos primeramente fue a
[1:33:25] Israel viniendo Dios en
[1:33:27] carne viniendo Dios a
[1:33:30] descender Dios vino a ser
[1:33:33] hombre para poder ser
[1:33:36] Redentor un un
[1:33:39] [Música]
[1:33:41] Redentor
[1:33:42] pariental un pariente
[1:33:47] Redentor
[1:33:50] ve esos juicios fueron profetizados
[1:33:56] Pero antes de que Dios pudiera traer
[1:33:59] esos juicios a la
[1:34:01] gente les
[1:34:04] dijo el hombre no puede vivir de pan
[1:34:08] solamente pero de toda palabra que sale
[1:34:10] de la boca de
[1:34:14] Dios y Dios les trajo la palabra
[1:34:19] revelada empezaron a leer entre líneas
[1:34:23] antig
[1:34:27] test empezó a revelarles
[1:34:31] elos en que Todos nacimos en
[1:34:38] pecado y la manera de escapar de estos
[1:34:42] juicios es
[1:34:44] arrepentirse Y ser
[1:34:46] bautizado en el nombre del señor
[1:34:49] Jesucristo y Israel rechazó eso
[1:34:55] no solamente Israel
[1:34:57] rechazó El libro de la vida del
[1:35:02] cordero no solamente rechazó el libro de
[1:35:09] redención rechazó la apertura de los
[1:35:11] siete sellos las siete
[1:35:16] partes lo cual Dios iba a redimirlos y
[1:35:19] salvarlos
[1:35:23] de que estos juicios cayeran sobre
[1:35:26] ellos ellos iban a rechazar a
[1:35:33] Jesucristo esos juicios no iban a
[1:35:36] pasar esos juicios eran para el
[1:35:39] futuro y cuando ellos
[1:35:41] rechar El Príncipe de
[1:35:44] Paz El rey de
[1:35:46] vida
[1:35:49] Je quien vino a ser Cordero de Dios
[1:35:54] que tomó sus pecados sobre
[1:35:59] él y ofreciendo su
[1:36:02] justicia dijeron No
[1:36:06] no es un cambio muy
[1:36:11] grandioso no iban a cambiar por El poder
[1:36:14] del espíritu santo y esos
[1:36:17] juicios estaba esperando para ellos
[1:36:26] Parece que son las tres
[1:36:28] partes
[1:36:31] cabell Parece que son tres partes de
[1:36:35] cabello que representa
[1:36:39] Israel que todo eso iba a ser
[1:36:43] destruido aú la última
[1:36:46] parte que iba ser esparcido al viento
[1:36:53] IB
[1:36:56] escapar pero Ezequiel
[1:36:58] dice eso que fue esparcido por el
[1:37:03] viento el señor iba tomar una espada y
[1:37:07] iba trás
[1:37:09] ellos Entonces todos esos fueron
[1:37:11] perdidos
[1:37:12] entonces verso 6 de
[1:37:17] Ezequiel vino palabra de Jehová
[1:37:20] diciendo hijo de hombre
[1:37:25] pon tu rostro hacia los montes de
[1:37:28] Israel y profetiza contra ellos y
[1:37:33] dirás Montes de
[1:37:35] Israel oí la palabra de Jehová el
[1:37:39] señor Así ha dicho Jehová el señor a los
[1:37:43] montes y a los collados y a Los Arroyos

[1:38:43] nuestra
[1:38:45] religión por
[1:38:48] rechazar pues para traer los
[1:38:51] juicios y dice
[1:39:02] verso y pondré los cuerpos muertos de
[1:39:05] los hijos de Israel delante de sus
[1:39:06] ídolos y vuestros huesos esp en derredor
[1:39:09] de vuestros altares

[1:40:02] Jehová rechazaron la misericordia de

[2:15:52] ese
[2:15:53] libro primero fue ofrecido a
[2:15:56] Israel no a
[2:16:00] nosotros los siete
[2:16:03] sellos los siete partes de El libro de
[2:16:06] la vida del
[2:16:07] cordero primero fue ofrecido a
[2:16:11] Israel porque él se les ofreció la
[2:16:15] oportunidad de
[2:16:18] cambiar escuchen esto
[2:16:21] el Ministerio de
[2:16:25] Juan el el Ministerio del Espíritu Santo
[2:16:29] obrando en en profeta
[2:16:31] Juan eso es lo que iba a
[2:16:34] suceder todo V iba a ser
[2:16:38] exaltado todo monte y collado iba a
[2:16:43] serado y baj todo y lo
[2:16:48] torcido y lo áspero se allane
[2:16:53] y se manifestará la gloria de
[2:16:57] Jehová traer revelación a
[2:17:02] ellos y toda carne juntamente la verá
[2:17:06] porque la boca de Jehová
[2:17:09] hablado
[2:17:11] minister para

[2:17:21] IB a ser
[2:17:24] baj todo camino torcido se iba a ser
[2:17:28] enderezado y todo lo torcido lo áspero
[2:17:34] allanado y cuando va al Nuevo
[2:17:37] Testamento y lo
[2:17:42] lee usted no encuentra en donde ningún
[2:17:51] un valle o Monte iba a ser
[2:17:53] bajado nocar algo que iba a ser
[2:17:59] enderezado y los lugares
[2:18:02] ásperos como
[2:18:04] Nazaret ese era un lugar
[2:18:07] áspero es como judea
[2:18:13] naz usted no ve donde Juan hizo alguna
[2:18:17] cosa de
[2:18:19] eso Y a hizo todo
[2:18:21] eso porque la
[2:18:24] Biblia es un libro de símbolos
[2:18:27] alegorías metáforas parábolas
[2:18:32] proverbios tipos y
[2:18:35] Sombras Y
[2:18:38] esto no se puede tomar
[2:18:41] literalmente o nunca entenderá la
[2:18:45] Biblia todo vaya yba a ser exaltado
[2:18:50] si pudiéramos hacer tal
[2:18:54] cosa sería una cosa
[2:18:57] tremenda el valle de
[2:19:00] maricopa bajarlo hasta
[2:19:06] abajo Cómo usted y yo pudiéramos
[2:19:13] hacerlo no
[2:19:16] es imposible posible
[2:19:22] todo monte y
[2:19:26] Valles es otro
[2:19:30] cambio Es humanamente
[2:19:34] imposible todo torcido se
[2:19:37] enderezado es otra
[2:19:39] cosa es humanamente imposible es un
[2:19:43] cambio grandes
[2:19:46] cambios pero es son cambios imposibles
[2:19:49] para hombr
[2:19:51] todo áspero se ha
[2:19:56] allanado yo lo he leído desde que era
[2:20:03] niño todasas
[2:20:07] Cos Qué es lo que está tratando de
