[32:17] Lord so that I might be
[32:20] changed from Glory GL unto Glory glor
[32:26] being changed by the very Holy
[32:31] Spirit he who who he who made us a
[32:36] promise I'll be with
[32:38] you even in
[32:40] you even to the ends of the
[32:44] world he he was with Moses and the
[32:47] children of
[32:50] Israel he he was with Adam and Eve in
[32:53] the
[32:56] beginning he was with the prophets
[32:58] throughout the
[33:01] ages he was with the high priest of
[33:05] Israel in order for them to be able to
[33:08] enter behind the
[33:11] curtain into the holies of
[33:14] holies but one
[33:16] mistake it was death for them to
[33:21] enter they entered with
[33:23] great with great
[33:25] respect
[33:28] they entered with great
[33:30] fear they had to be dressed a certain
[33:35] way they they they had Bells On The
[33:38] Fringe of their
[33:40] garment
[33:46] bells and as they walked those bells had
[33:49] to make a certain
[33:54] sound one mistake as they were entering
[33:59] in and they were really walking into
[34:01] their
[34:05] death one
[34:07] mistake they entered with indeed with
[34:10] fear and
[34:14] tremble but only the high
[34:18] priest and only once a
[34:21] year I'm sure the high
[34:25] priest didn't design desire it to be
[34:27] once a
[34:30] month the tension was too
[34:33] great the stress was
[34:36] terrible the fear of being struck dead
[34:39] was
[34:42] real they certainly didn't want that
[34:44] experience every
[34:47] day no no man could bear that
[34:53] pressure so once a year
[34:57] and he thought about it all year
[35:02] long when that day would
[35:06] come and he would prepare
[35:09] himself he knew he couldn't enter there
[35:12] with the wrong
[35:15] thoughts he knew he couldn't enter there
[35:17] if he hadn't been conducting his life
[35:25] correctly he knew any little thing was a
[35:28] Death March for
[35:33] him once a year to enter into that
[35:38] presence was all a man could
[35:42] take and amongst the millions of the
[35:45] tribe of
[35:48] Israel no one else could
[35:51] enter just
[35:54] him it was indeed
[35:58] and when he came out of
[36:01] that that the holies of
[36:05] holies you could you could see the man
[36:08] coming out pale
[36:13] white no pale
[36:17] white because of the
[36:20] stress of being in that
[36:23] presence and yet the day would
[36:28] come when when our high
[36:31] priest the Lord
[36:33] Jesus would rent The
[36:36] Veil and invite all the generation of
[36:39] Jesus
[36:43] Christ to come into His
[36:45] presence so he made us a
[36:48] promise I'll not only be with
[36:51] you as I've been with
[36:54] Israel but now I promise I'll be in
[37:00] you it won't be the experience that the
[37:03] high priest
[37:06] had no no it'll be a greater
[37:13] experience it'll bring an experience
[37:16] that brings you
[37:19] peace not
[37:21] Terror love not
[37:25] fear
[37:28] to enter into his
[37:29] presence he says I I ripped the veil and
[37:35] two that day on
[37:37] Calvary he did it
[37:40] naturally and the people were
[37:46] shocked they didn't
[37:49] realize that he didn't only do it
[37:53] naturally that what happened that day
[37:55] was just a symbol
[37:59] of something Supernatural that he had
[38:03] done that once again you and
[38:07] I can have a relationship with a
[38:12] father in our prayer
[38:15] closets where we can meet him
[38:18] daily we can talk to him we can share
[38:22] our burdens with
[38:25] him we can ask for his healing virtue
[38:30] there we can ask for the Salvation of
[38:33] our children
[38:36] there oh when he
[38:39] came everything
[38:41] changed Nothing Was the
[38:44] Same because a new book had been
[38:48] opened a new
[38:52] book it was the Lamb's
[38:55] Book and the Lamb's
[38:58] Book began with the
[39:01] lamb being
[39:04] born for the for the life story of
[39:08] almost every
[39:10] person for the
[39:14] life usually
[39:17] begins with someone
[39:20] telling of when that person was
[39:24] born and when that person person
[39:28] died and all that that person did in
[39:32] between the
[39:35] impact that they were that they
[39:38] had on their
[39:41] families on their friends on the people
[39:44] they work
[39:46] for so this Lamb's Book of
[39:50] Life actually set the
[39:55] pattern for how people write books of
[39:58] people's
[40:00] [Music]
[40:04] lives and and almost every
[40:09] book of a book of
[40:13] life of someone's life begins with their
[40:19] birth tells the things that they did in
[40:25] life the effects they had on every
[40:28] person they
[40:32] met and then their
[40:35] death and that ends The
[40:38] Book of Life of that
[40:42] person except for this
[40:47] person the lamb who had a book written
[40:51] of the Lamb's Book of
[40:55] Life
[40:57] and when he
[40:59] died the writers of the
[41:05] gospels they
[41:07] wrote of that death it was a sad
[41:11] day it was a day of confusion for
[41:15] them it was a day that shattered all
[41:17] their
[41:20] hopes where this when this Jesus of
[41:23] Nazareth died on the cross of
[41:25] calvary
[41:28] but this is the only
[41:29] book of a man's
[41:35] life that didn't end with his
[41:39] death because as he told
[41:41] us unlike all other men that have
[41:46] died on the third
[41:48] day he rose
[41:51] again to give us the
[41:54] victory to to to to to give us a
[41:56] welcoming
[42:00] call come unto
[42:02] me all ye that are heavy
[42:06] burdened I'll lift that
[42:09] burden I'll break that
[42:13] complex I'll take away that fear and
[42:16] give you
[42:20] courage for this is the Lamb's Book of
[42:24] Life he was born
[42:27] he he lived he died but then he rose
[42:33] again and he took death in
[42:37] hell he took the keys away from
[42:40] the from
[42:43] Satan and he's handed you the
[42:47] key now you hold the
[42:50] key of life of the Lamb's Book of
[42:54] Life as stand to our feet this
[43:01] morning and before we read the
[43:04] scripture I'd like to have a a special
[43:06] prayer for
[43:10] someone and uh my son-in-law
[43:16] reuben reuben uh his father brother
[43:20] Glenn
[43:22] tamlins
[43:23] Glen he's in a hospital here in in
[43:28] Phoenix Pho I believe the Banner
[43:33] Thunderbird Banner and the doctors have
[43:35] diagnosed
[43:38] him or at least they're pretty sure of
[43:40] it
[43:43] now of uh what they call I think it's
[43:47] pancreatic cancer
[43:49] perhaps uh
[43:51] pancre the pancreas cancer cancer the
[43:55] pancreas
[43:56] and of course uh he has a growth that's
[44:00] grown very
[44:03] large and they don't give him a a lot of
[44:07] um the doctors don't give him a lot of
[44:13] Hope their their hope is maybe a few
[44:16] months of
[44:20] Life they they told them if they do
[44:25] surgery
[44:27] to remove it
[44:29] immediately it's so
[44:32] large and it's so close to major
[44:35] arteries in the
[44:38] body that he probably wouldn't survive
[44:40] the
[44:44] surgery so uh he sent me a
[44:48] text and he his
[44:52] desire is that God would heal
[44:54] him
[44:59] he said my My Hope and he's a man my age
[45:03] a little
[45:06] older but his desire he
[45:09] said is
[45:15] Lord I Need a
[45:18] Miracle or I need your healing
[45:23] touch so he asked us if we would pray
[45:25] that way
[45:31] I said if that was his
[45:34] desire that's exactly how we would
[45:39] pray we know God has a time for all of
[45:44] us and when that time
[45:47] comes we shall
[45:50] go but we also know we have a
[45:54] promise his stripes we are
[45:59] healed and his desire at this
[46:03] moment he didn't say uh I'm ready to go
[46:06] I want to
[46:10] go that would have been
[46:14] fine uh but his desire was that God
[46:17] would give him a
[46:21] miracle or a healing
[46:24] touch to recover erate from
[46:27] this so we want to pray according to our
[46:30] brother's
[46:34] desire and ask with
[46:38] him for a
[46:40] miracle because truly he needs
[46:43] one and that's his
[46:46] desire so many
[46:49] times when someone would ask you to pray
[46:52] for
[46:54] them
[46:56] and and they request something like
[47:00] [Music]
[47:02] this sometimes we're sometimes we're too
[47:07] quick to
[47:09] say uh no you are if God's going to take
[47:12] you God's going to take you and you got
[47:13] to be happy with that too
[47:18] and we're we're quick we're quick to try
[47:21] and maybe balance their statement
[47:24] out
[47:29] which I'm as guilty as
[47:34] anyone but slowly I'm
[47:38] learning to
[47:41] listen here what the person's desire
[47:47] is and and and and ask
[47:50] myself is there anything wrong with what
[47:53] they're
[47:54] asking
[47:56] do I not do I need to try and balance
[47:59] their statement out and
[48:03] more and I realize
[48:06] that what he's
[48:09] asking there's absolutely nothing wrong
[48:11] with
[48:13] it I don't need to try and balance him
[48:16] out and let him know but but God may be
[48:18] wanting to take
[48:24] you I heard his
[48:29] request I it's a worthy
[48:32] request it's certainly
[48:36] something that's
[48:38] possible it's certainly something that
[48:40] God can
[48:45] do and he's asking for
[48:48] that so that's what we'll pray for as we
[48:51] bow our
[48:53] heads Heavenly Father we come before you
[48:56] this
[48:58] morning asking for his brother Glenn
[49:04] tamlins Lord and you we have heard the
[49:08] desire of his
[49:10] heart and you have heard it
[49:14] too and Lord we
[49:17] pray and unite our faith with our
[49:21] brother he's Desiring a few more years
[49:24] of life
[49:29] so in the name of Jesus
[49:32] Christ we ask you to grant our brother
[49:35] his
[49:38] desire in Jesus Christ's
[49:41] name amen amen let's read in the Book of
[49:48] Matthew uh Matthew 1 and verse
[49:53] one we've been speaking on a on a
[49:57] subject
[49:59] Jesus
[50:01] evangelist Prophet Lamb of
[50:04] God this is uh part
[50:09] six and we'll begin in Matthew 1 and
[50:14] one the book of the generation of Jesus
[50:18] Christ the son of David the son of
[50:24] Abraham
[50:26] so this book of the generation of Jesus
[50:31] Christ just didn't begin when Jesus was
[50:36] born because th this book began way way
[50:40] at the
[50:43] beginning matter of fact it was way back
[50:45] in
[50:49] Eden it it was a book that had been
[50:52] written in the mind of God
[50:56] not in paper and
[51:00] ink it was it was a plan of
[51:04] God God being
[51:07] Sovereign knowing all
[51:10] things knew that Adam and Eve would make
[51:12] the wrong
[51:17] choice and yet he wanted them to be able
[51:19] to choose for
[51:23] themselves God has never never been a
[51:27] dictator so his ministers shouldn't
[51:32] be God has never been a
[51:35] dictator he's always given his children
[51:38] a
[51:41] choice and and he knew they would choose
[51:45] wrong and he knew he would have to come
[51:47] down on the
[51:49] scene to lift up his
[51:52] children and help them in their bad
[51:58] choices that's a deep
[52:02] Revelation for every
[52:04] father that is or is going to
[52:11] be verse two of Matthew
[52:15] 1 Abraham beg got Isaac Isaac begat
[52:19] Jacob Jacob begat Judas and his Brethren
[52:23] ABR is
[52:30] let's pray Heavenly Father we are
[52:33] reading this
[52:35] morning out of the Lamb's Book of
[52:38] Life and we ask Lord that you the Lamb
[52:41] of
[52:44] God the revealer of the
[52:47] word the author and revealer of this
[52:51] book that you would Open the Eyes of
[52:54] understanding
[52:58] uh of every person
[53:01] here give us all
[53:04] Revelation in Jesus name
[53:08] amen you may be
[53:11] seated Matthew 1 and
[53:15] one begins by highlighting the
[53:17] generation of Jesus
[53:24] Christ
[53:28] and but but the generation of Jesus
[53:32] Christ that came through
[53:37] Abraham in Matthew
[53:39] 1 it's going to highlight one particular
[53:46] tribe it's not speaking of all the
[53:48] tribes of Israel
[53:51] here though though in every tribe
[53:56] there are there are those Jews who are
[53:58] the generation of Jesus
[54:02] Christ but what it's going to highlight
[54:04] here in in the first
[54:08] chapter you can go back and study it at
[54:12] home but it's only speaking of One
[54:17] Tribe the tribe of
[54:19] Judah because this is the
[54:22] opening of the Lamb's Book of
[54:26] life this is the
[54:28] opening of the first
[54:31] seal this is the opening of part
[54:35] one of seven
[54:37] Parts called in the Bible Seven
[54:42] Seals this is part one of this
[54:48] unfolding of the Lamb's Book of
[54:52] Life the the the Old Testament spoke of
[54:56] it in in types and
[54:59] shadows in the
[55:01] prophecies but this is the book opening
[55:04] and unfolding right
[55:09] here no more
[55:12] prophecy it's becoming
[55:16] history because it's unfolding right
[55:20] here in Matthew
[55:22] 1 the only tribe that's high
[55:28] Ed or and and
[55:30] emphasized is is the tribe of
[55:34] Juda and it's and the reason it begins
[55:36] this
[55:38] way because now it's it's
[55:42] fulfilling all that the prophets had
[55:45] said of this great one that would
[55:49] come of this Prophet that Moses spoke
[55:53] of of this prophet Prophet that that
[55:56] that that that that that even uh even in
[56:00] in Genesis
[56:05] 48 let's turn to Genesis
[56:10] 48 and it was a prophecy of another
[56:13] Prophet
[56:16] Jacob Genesis
[56:18] [Music]
[56:19] 48 beginning vers verse verse
[56:23] eight
[56:25] excuse me Genesis
[56:28] 49 and verse 8
[56:34] 498 and it begins like this it was
[56:39] Jacob both blessing and and bringing
[56:41] curses to his own to his to his own
[56:45] [Music]
[56:47] children giving them
[56:51] warnings and giving them
[56:53] blessings
[56:55] both but this was all
[56:59] prophecy Jacob was prophesying over his
[57:05] children and when he gets to Judah his
[57:08] son he says Judah is a lion's
[57:14] welp a lion's
[57:17] welp uh
[57:20] uh Judah is allance
[57:23] well
[57:25] verse
[57:26] 9 Judah is a lion's
[57:30] welp 499
[57:36] oh a lion's
[57:38] welp is the son of a
[57:41] lion so you can't be a little lion
[57:49] cub and and and your father be a
[57:53] giraffe
[57:55] this was
[57:56] prophecy so this Lion's
[57:59] WEP his father was the
[58:03] lion his father was the
[58:06] king and this is this is the heir to
[58:09] that
[58:10] King this is a prophecy of Christ
[58:14] himself he says from the
[58:18] prey my son Thou Art gone
[58:22] up in other words he been training this
[58:27] son from the time he first taught him
[58:29] how to
[58:33] hunt he's been training him
[58:36] up he said from the prey my son Thou Art
[58:40] gone
[58:43] up he stooped
[58:46] down he couched as a
[58:49] lion now he now the prophecy is saying
[58:52] he's learning well from his father
[58:57] he's doing everything a lion should do
[58:59] the son of a
[59:02] lion read it
[59:05] again from the prey my son Thou Art gone
[59:10] up it was his training
[59:13] time it was the character building
[59:19] time he says this little
[59:23] lion this
[59:25] this this Lion's
[59:27] welp he stooped
[59:31] down just like the big lion taught
[59:35] him he couched as a
[59:41] lion and as an old
[59:46] lion he was learning the ways of his
[59:48] father this little
[59:52] lion who shall R him
[59:56] up is
[59:58] it prophecy will rise him
[1:00:01] up thus sayth the Lord will him the
[1:00:06] scepter shall not depart from
[1:00:10] Judah this new king coming up this this
[1:00:14] Lion's
[1:00:16] welp nor a lawgiver from between his
[1:00:21] feet saying in other words he is great
[1:00:24] than the
[1:00:27] law this this great
[1:00:30] king this Old
[1:00:33] Lion and the Bible says the scepter
[1:00:36] shall not depart from
[1:00:40] Judah the scepter has remained in the
[1:00:43] hands of
[1:00:45] God The Old
[1:00:49] Lion nor a lawgiver from between his
[1:00:53] feet
[1:00:59] telling us that throughout the Old
[1:01:03] Testament almighty god king with a
[1:01:06] scepter in his
[1:01:09] hand at that at his
[1:01:12] feet would he have a lawgiver a prophet
[1:01:21] Moses the scepter shall not depart from
[1:01:25] nor a
[1:01:26] lawgiver between his feet so
[1:01:30] God throughout the Old
[1:01:33] Testament King of Kings between his
[1:01:39] feet there would be a
[1:01:41] Moses there would be there would be the
[1:01:45] prophets they would remain the people
[1:01:47] living under this
[1:01:53] law until Shiloh
[1:01:59] come Shiloh was the Lion's
[1:02:03] welp Shiloh was the Lion's
[1:02:09] welp the Le it's a
[1:02:12] prophecy and unto
[1:02:17] him unto the lion of the tribe of
[1:02:21] Judah unto the Lamb of God
[1:02:26] unto him shall be the Gathering of the
[1:02:30] people when he comes the law will be no
[1:02:34] more between the
[1:02:37] feet of the king of kings that created
[1:02:41] heavens and
[1:02:42] earth now his son stands in that place
[1:02:45] where the law once
[1:02:51] was now grace and mercy is being being
[1:02:54] delivered to the
[1:02:59] people it was a
[1:03:01] prophecy verse
[1:03:03] 11 binding his fo unto the
[1:03:09] vine and his asses and his asses cult
[1:03:12] unto the choice
[1:03:17] Vine it was talking of
[1:03:20] Jesus At The Cross of
[1:03:23] calvary both both a f a
[1:03:26] fo in verse 11 a fo and a
[1:03:33] cult is a young
[1:03:37] animal it's a yearling as they call
[1:03:42] it it's a
[1:03:45] lamb which is only Lambs are only a year
[1:03:48] to two years
[1:03:50] old it's a young
[1:03:53] animal
[1:03:56] like maybe 33 and a half years
[1:04:03] old that he would be bound to a
[1:04:09] cross the Bible
[1:04:11] says and he washed his garments in
[1:04:16] wine wine represents the
[1:04:20] blood or
[1:04:22] Revelation whyne here here he and he
[1:04:26] washed his garments in
[1:04:29] wine and his clothes in the blood of
[1:04:34] grapes
[1:04:37] wine is the blood of
[1:04:41] grapes but it was a
[1:04:43] prophecy of
[1:04:45] Christ that God would take and and and
[1:04:49] and and bind him to the cross of
[1:04:53] calvary
[1:04:56] the Romans may have nailed the
[1:05:01] nails but the nails didn't hold him on
[1:05:04] the
[1:05:06] cross he
[1:05:08] stayed his own free
[1:05:11] will he made a choice for you and
[1:05:15] [Music]
[1:05:16] I they told him if thou be the Son of
[1:05:20] God come off of that cross as a man for
[1:05:25] a
[1:05:27] moment he
[1:05:29] thought I could come off this
[1:05:32] cross but then he began to
[1:05:35] think he said but what about
[1:05:38] Leo what about
[1:05:40] ISO what about Elmer what about orley
[1:05:45] what about Carmen and Kenny and Rachel
[1:05:48] what about Joseph no I cannot come off
[1:05:52] this cross I have the power to do it but
[1:05:56] I will use this
[1:05:58] power to stay on this
[1:06:01] cross and spill the blood of the grapes
[1:06:04] the very blood of God I will
[1:06:08] redeem I will
[1:06:11] save I will give my life a living
[1:06:17] sacrifice the nails didn't hold him
[1:06:22] there you held
[1:06:25] there his love for
[1:06:28] you held him on the
[1:06:30] cross and for you he rose the third
[1:06:36] day so now you
[1:06:39] see how you are part of this Lamb's Book
[1:06:42] of
[1:06:45] Life Matthew 1 highlighting the tribe of
[1:06:53] Judah
[1:06:56] because it was it was Bible prophecy
[1:06:58] coming to
[1:07:02] pass for Jesus was Lamb of
[1:07:07] God but first he was going to come and
[1:07:09] unfold the ministry as king of the
[1:07:18] Jews first he was going to offer this
[1:07:21] book of
[1:07:22] life
[1:07:25] this Lamb's Book of
[1:07:28] Life first he was going to offer it to
[1:07:30] Abraham's
[1:07:33] children the Jewish
[1:07:36] people so he would have to be a
[1:07:41] Kinsman he would have to be a
[1:07:45] Kinsman in order to redeem
[1:07:48] them in order to be part of
[1:07:51] them a human being
[1:07:55] and he came down fulfilling
[1:07:59] prophecy beginning in Genesis
[1:08:02] 49 and the many hundreds more Through
[1:08:05] the Bible of the Old
[1:08:09] Testament so we read in Matthew 1 and
[1:08:12] chapter
[1:08:15] 1 and Matthew 1 and chapter
[1:08:20] one this day all those hundreds of
[1:08:26] prophecies were coming to
[1:08:28] pass this day all that
[1:08:32] prophecy was becoming
[1:08:35] history even to the highlighting of the
[1:08:38] tribe of
[1:08:43] Judah it was
[1:08:46] prophecy he was to be the king of the
[1:08:50] Jews he was to be the lion of the tribe
[1:08:53] of of
[1:08:54] Judah he would fulfill the prophecy that
[1:08:58] Jacob is the father of Judah had
[1:09:07] spoken God rich in
[1:09:11] Mercy so chapter
[1:09:14] one goes all the way down the
[1:09:17] lineage of the tribe of
[1:09:20] Judah because the book The Lambs
[1:09:26] book is
[1:09:28] unfolding if you've been wondering where
[1:09:30] is the Lamb's Book of
[1:09:34] Life if you've been
[1:09:36] wondering
[1:09:38] what and if you've been wondering what
[1:09:40] is written in the B Lamb's Book of
[1:09:46] Life we're told our names are in that
[1:09:52] book not only are our names in the
[1:09:58] book but a character building
[1:10:07] process of
[1:10:10] Christ because the Lamb's Book of
[1:10:14] Life if you've been wondering where it's
[1:10:20] at at one
[1:10:22] time it sat on our
[1:10:28] shelves collecting
[1:10:34] dust and someone might ask
[1:10:38] you where's the Lamb's Book of
[1:10:41] Life you'd say I don't know but I
[1:10:44] believe
[1:10:45] it and all the time when you said
[1:10:48] it the book was in your
[1:10:51] home the book was on your
[1:10:55] shelf the book you used to carry it to
[1:10:58] church when you
[1:11:01] went it's been with you all the
[1:11:04] time but what we lacked was a
[1:11:09] revelation to pick up the
[1:11:11] book and meditate on it day and
[1:11:15] night so we could
[1:11:17] grow unto the stature so we too could be
[1:11:22] born
[1:11:24] like this lamb was
[1:11:26] born with a supernatural
[1:11:30] birth that that that that would overcome
[1:11:33] the natural
[1:11:40] birth and give us the
[1:11:44] victory over this
[1:11:47] flesh all of that and
[1:11:50] more is
[1:11:52] written in in this Lamb's Book of
[1:11:56] Life it's called the New
[1:12:01] Testament and this Lamb's Book of
[1:12:06] Life
[1:12:07] began talking about the
[1:12:10] lamb about his
[1:12:13] lineage about his
[1:12:16] father you see he was a lion's
[1:12:22] welp
[1:12:24] so that means his father was a
[1:12:27] lion his father was the great
[1:12:31] lion his father was the creator of
[1:12:33] heavens and
[1:12:35] earth he was the
[1:12:38] son and one day the father would pass
[1:12:41] his scepter to his
[1:12:46] son in the beginning was the
[1:12:51] word and the Word was with God
[1:12:54] God and the word and the Word was God
[1:12:58] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[1:13:00] Among Us what happened the great lion
[1:13:05] father pass the scepter to the Lion's
[1:13:11] we Jesus
[1:13:13] Christ the son of
[1:13:16] God this new
[1:13:18] testament
[1:13:20] begins this is the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:13:25] it speaks of his
[1:13:28] genealogy because that genealogy was
[1:13:31] prophesied to
[1:13:35] be that it was through
[1:13:38] Judah that Shiloh would
[1:13:41] come Shiloh
[1:13:45] means to whom it
[1:13:50] belongeth the
[1:13:52] scepter
[1:13:57] in Matthew
[1:14:00] 1 and verse
[1:14:04] 18 in this book of the
[1:14:08] Lamb it tells us his
[1:14:11] genealogy then it tells us about how his
[1:14:14] birth was going to
[1:14:17] be this is how he'll be
[1:14:21] born this is to whom whom he will be
[1:14:24] born
[1:14:26] to he said now the birth of Jesus
[1:14:30] Christ was on this
[1:14:33] wise Verse 18 of Matthew 1 verse
[1:14:38] 18 when as his mother Mary was espoused
[1:14:42] to
[1:14:44] Joseph before before they came
[1:14:47] together she was found with
[1:14:51] child of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:54] and yet a prophet told
[1:14:57] us that Mary was just the
[1:15:03] incubator that neither Mary or
[1:15:07] Joseph had anything to
[1:15:10] do with the
[1:15:12] seed that was
[1:15:15] created by the spoken word of
[1:15:18] God Mary did not
[1:15:22] contribute 23 chromosomes to
[1:15:26] Jesus Joseph did not
[1:15:30] contribute 23 chromosomes to
[1:15:35] Jesus neither one had anything to do a
[1:15:39] contributing anything to this little
[1:15:41] body that was this
[1:15:46] seed it was simply placed a complete
[1:15:50] total
[1:15:52] seed
[1:15:56] by the spoken word in the womb of
[1:16:02] Mary it had to be placed
[1:16:05] there because it was a
[1:16:08] prophecy all the way from
[1:16:11] Genesis in chapter
[1:16:13] 3 let's read
[1:16:17] that Genesis chapter
[1:16:22] 3
[1:16:27] and verse
[1:16:32] 15 God almighty
[1:16:35] God the great
[1:16:38] lion the great
[1:16:40] Creator speaking to the
[1:16:42] serpent he say and the Lord God said
[1:16:45] unto the serpent because thou has done
[1:16:47] this Thou Art cursed above all
[1:16:52] cattle
[1:16:58] and above every beast of the field and
[1:17:00] upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust
[1:17:03] shalt thou eat all the days of thy
[1:17:10] life he in verse 15 he says and I will
[1:17:13] put enity between thee and the
[1:17:18] woman and between thy
[1:17:22] seed
[1:17:23] that's the serpent
[1:17:25] seed that's where the term the serpent
[1:17:28] seed is ever first heard or
[1:17:35] used you might say it doesn't say
[1:17:37] serpent
[1:17:43] seed he's speaking to the
[1:17:46] serpent and he says I'll put and I will
[1:17:48] put Amity between thee and the
[1:17:52] woman
[1:17:54] verse
[1:17:56] 15 and between thy
[1:17:59] seed and he's speaking to
[1:18:01] who the serpent so whose seed is
[1:18:06] this the seed of the
[1:18:09] serpent the
[1:18:11] serpent anointed of
[1:18:14] Satan had been
[1:18:17] successful in genetically
[1:18:21] modifying
[1:18:24] the human
[1:18:25] race and hybriding
[1:18:28] it and that's
[1:18:30] why I must be born
[1:18:33] again and that's why you must be born
[1:18:40] again and between and I will put Amity
[1:18:44] between thee and the woman between thy
[1:18:47] seed and her seed and it shall bruise
[1:18:50] thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel
[1:19:03] her
[1:19:04] seed the woman's
[1:19:07] seed was a
[1:19:09] prophecy for the woman
[1:19:13] naturally doesn't carry the
[1:19:17] seed so this was a
[1:19:20] prophecy this was the prophecy of
[1:19:24] Christ that would take
[1:19:27] place this was the
[1:19:29] prophecy but as we were reading in the
[1:19:31] Book of
[1:19:35] Matthew there in chapter
[1:19:44] one this was a
[1:19:51] fulfillment
[1:19:57] now the birth of Jesus
[1:20:01] Christ the woman's
[1:20:03] seed now the birth of the woman's seed
[1:20:06] was in this
[1:20:13] wise when as his mother Mary was
[1:20:17] espoused to
[1:20:21] Joseph
[1:20:28] before they came
[1:20:31] together
[1:20:33] intimately
[1:20:35] sexually she was found with child of the
[1:20:38] Holy
[1:20:42] Ghost this was God's
[1:20:45] lamb this
[1:20:47] lamb had was without spot and without
[1:20:51] wrinkle
[1:20:54] because it wasn't
[1:20:56] connected by any
[1:20:58] means to any Fallen human
[1:21:03] being both Mary and
[1:21:06] Joseph they they had been born in
[1:21:11] sin shaped in
[1:21:13] iniquity coming to this world speaking
[1:21:17] lies just as every one of
[1:21:21] us the curse
[1:21:24] upon the human
[1:21:26] race was that we would all be
[1:21:29] born through a sexual
[1:21:33] birth that was introduced by The
[1:21:37] Serpent and his seed that gen that that
[1:21:41] that genetically
[1:21:45] modified every human being on the face
[1:21:48] of the
[1:21:50] Earth it's what separates
[1:21:54] us and wouldn't allow us to walk into
[1:21:57] the holies of
[1:22:02] holies because we're Fallen
[1:22:07] creatures but this Jesus
[1:22:11] Christ wasn't Joseph's biological
[1:22:18] son this Jesus
[1:22:20] Christ was not married biological
[1:22:27] son they were just a chosen
[1:22:32] vessel to carry this
[1:22:36] seed unto
[1:22:45] adulthood and the
[1:22:46] seed was placed in
[1:22:50] Mary and a prophet tells us Mary was
[1:22:53] just an
[1:22:57] incubator and I've shared my opinion
[1:23:02] before and it's still my just my
[1:23:07] opinion and some people find it
[1:23:14] offensive but I have said that I don't
[1:23:18] believe that this seed I believe that
[1:23:21] Mary was absolutely just an
[1:23:27] incubator that this seed was not
[1:23:29] connected to Mary in any
[1:23:34] way through an umbilical
[1:23:39] cord for then the Blood of Mary a fallen
[1:23:51] person would have flowed through this
[1:23:56] child and this had to be a
[1:23:59] lamb without spot or
[1:24:02] wrinkle I believe that would have put a
[1:24:07] wrinkle that that would have put a
[1:24:11] wrinkle on this Supernatural
[1:24:17] seed for God to be dependent on the
[1:24:20] human race
[1:24:24] to give this seed
[1:24:30] life and this
[1:24:32] lamb would no longer have been
[1:24:36] worthy the natural
[1:24:39] type you go read it in the Old
[1:24:41] Testament The Book of
[1:24:44] Leviticus once a year the high priest
[1:24:48] would have to sacrifice a
[1:24:51] lamb
[1:24:53] it was to be a sin
[1:24:56] offering for all the people once a year
[1:24:59] all of
[1:25:02] Israel and they would gather Lambs all
[1:25:08] together and the high priest and his
[1:25:13] sons they had to go and and and and and
[1:25:16] and check these Lambs out
[1:25:20] they they had to make sure there was no
[1:25:22] defects on
[1:25:25] them a lamb who had a ear that had been
[1:25:28] bitten off wouldn't
[1:25:34] qualify they couldn't have
[1:25:36] scratches they couldn't have
[1:25:41] Cuts they'd even lay them down and start
[1:25:44] looking through the
[1:25:48] wool make sure that under all that wool
[1:25:51] there wasn't an old cut an
[1:25:56] old and when they found a
[1:25:59] lamb without spot or
[1:26:02] wrinkle that would be the lamb that that
[1:26:06] they would offer up to the father to
[1:26:11] God it was just a prophetic
[1:26:15] word in a symbol of what God would do
[1:26:19] one
[1:26:20] day when a man would be God's
[1:26:24] lamb without spot without
[1:26:30] wrinkles he had to be a human
[1:26:33] being it had to be a man a
[1:26:39] Kinsman to redeem all of
[1:26:45] mankind but it couldn't have one spot or
[1:26:48] wrinkle on
[1:26:51] it
[1:26:54] and I Know It shakes
[1:26:57] people to
[1:26:59] say I don't
[1:27:02] believe that this
[1:27:04] seed
[1:27:06] required to be connected to
[1:27:10] Mary in any
[1:27:13] way to
[1:27:14] live to be
[1:27:16] born because what caused this seed to
[1:27:19] live and be
[1:27:21] born
[1:27:25] was thus saith the
[1:27:27] Lord and the Prophecies of the
[1:27:32] prophets she was just an
[1:27:36] incubator the Catholic
[1:27:40] teachings if you're familiar with them
[1:27:42] at
[1:27:44] all the Virgin Mary is one of the
[1:27:48] greatest
[1:27:50] Saints she is
[1:27:55] that the Catholic people pray
[1:27:59] to because she
[1:28:01] is in their
[1:28:04] doctrines she is the biological mother
[1:28:07] of Jesus
[1:28:10] Christ she is the mother of Jesus in
[1:28:12] every way shape and
[1:28:21] form
[1:28:23] a a Catholic um Adventure
[1:28:30] archaeologist
[1:28:35] AR uh who who over the years and I don't
[1:28:39] even know if the man is still
[1:28:42] alive and he spent most of his life in
[1:28:49] Israel uh looking for for for for for
[1:28:54] all the artifacts of the life of
[1:29:00] Jesus he made a video you could see it
[1:29:02] if you find
[1:29:06] it and in this
[1:29:08] video he said he got permission from the
[1:29:11] Jewish
[1:29:14] government to go and dig in some
[1:29:20] caves not already to go in some caves
[1:29:24] that were there
[1:29:27] already uh that were directly under
[1:29:31] Mount
[1:29:35] Calvary directly under where Jesus had
[1:29:38] been
[1:29:41] crucified so him and his group of
[1:29:46] helpers went down into these
[1:29:49] caves and I don't know with what kind of
[1:29:55] equipment they claimed they were
[1:29:57] directly under where Jesus had been
[1:30:04] crucified he says and as they were
[1:30:07] looking they found all these blotches
[1:30:09] and stains below these in these
[1:30:14] rocks so Mount Calvary is on top where
[1:30:17] Jesus
[1:30:20] crucified and I don't many how many
[1:30:22] under how many feet of rocks is these
[1:30:25] caves down
[1:30:31] below and and and he says they take they
[1:30:34] take these
[1:30:37] samples he says and I took these samples
[1:30:40] to a
[1:30:41] laboratory in
[1:30:43] isra and some some some some Jewish lab
[1:30:50] technicians he said said I want you to
[1:30:52] do certain test on this
[1:30:59] samples he says I think it's blood he
[1:31:02] said old
[1:31:06] blood he said they did some
[1:31:09] test and they said yes this is Old Blood
[1:31:13] this is his
[1:31:16] story and he says I want you to do
[1:31:18] another test on this
[1:31:20] Blood and he gave the name of
[1:31:24] it and and and and these lab
[1:31:29] technicians they told them you're
[1:31:31] wasting your
[1:31:33] time this is old
[1:31:37] blood it's there it's there's no life in
[1:31:39] it it's dead old
[1:31:42] blood and he says do the test anyways he
[1:31:44] says nothing will come of it it won't
[1:31:46] show
[1:31:50] anything so his test testimony was
[1:31:53] this that when they did that
[1:31:56] test he says these these these these uh
[1:32:01] scientists they came back and told
[1:32:04] him he said this blood is still
[1:32:10] alive and he says and the astonishing
[1:32:13] thing
[1:32:17] is is that this
[1:32:19] Blood only contain ains 23
[1:32:26] chromosomes the the Y right the the man
[1:32:29] gives the X the woman the
[1:32:33] why and then he said he says you know
[1:32:37] who's blood that
[1:32:39] is they said no he says and it's a very
[1:32:42] emotional video he says this
[1:32:46] blood is the blood of your
[1:32:50] Messiah
[1:32:53] he's a Catholic man they're looking for
[1:32:56] something to establish their Catholic
[1:33:03] Doctrine but if that
[1:33:06] blood was the blood of a
[1:33:09] man with only 23
[1:33:14] chromosomes that he got from his
[1:33:18] mother then that
[1:33:20] man is not the Lamb of
[1:33:24] God for that
[1:33:26] lamb was now a
[1:33:28] lamb with
[1:33:30] spots with wrinkles isn't worthy to be
[1:33:34] the
[1:33:38] sacrifice for you and
[1:33:40] I you
[1:33:46] see Mary
[1:33:49] Maria was the mother
[1:33:52] in the sense that this child came from
[1:33:54] her out of her
[1:33:58] womb but Mary was not the biological
[1:34:04] mother in any
[1:34:06] way shape or
[1:34:12] form Mary was the
[1:34:17] incubator and the seed of
[1:34:19] God could not be comp
[1:34:23] compromised and that day at at at at the
[1:34:26] court of ponus
[1:34:30] pilot that
[1:34:33] tribunal after Jesus had been four
[1:34:39] days they had beat
[1:34:41] him they had slapped
[1:34:44] him they had mocked
[1:34:50] him
[1:34:52] they had interrogated
[1:34:54] him and the Bible says he never said a
[1:34:59] word like a lamb he was
[1:35:05] silent except when they told
[1:35:07] him don't you know I have the power to
[1:35:10] put you to
[1:35:16] death he couldn't be silent
[1:35:19] then I'm sure he smiled
[1:35:22] and he said no you have no power over
[1:35:28] me I'm not here because of the power of
[1:35:32] Rome I'm not here because the power of
[1:35:35] the Jewish
[1:35:38] church I'm not here because of the false
[1:35:41] accusations of the high
[1:35:44] priest what has me here
[1:35:47] today is thus sayith the Lord I had an
[1:35:53] appointment to be here to fulfill a
[1:35:58] Ministry to bring
[1:36:00] Salvation to my
[1:36:02] daughters to my sons to my children to
[1:36:07] those who are
[1:36:08] lost to those who are blind to those who
[1:36:12] are sick to those who are
[1:36:15] afflicted it's the power of God that has
[1:36:18] me
[1:36:20] here
[1:36:23] Pontius
[1:36:24] pilot his wife has a
[1:36:28] dream she's a
[1:36:30] Roman she ain't
[1:36:33] Jewish they have they don't have much
[1:36:35] religion they're just
[1:36:39] pagans but she has a
[1:36:41] dream and in that dream it shakes her so
[1:36:46] much she goes to her
[1:36:48] husband tells him the dream
[1:36:53] she says have nothing to
[1:36:56] do with crucifying this
[1:36:59] man nothing good will become of
[1:37:04] it when when Pontius
[1:37:07] pilot after four
[1:37:09] days stands on the outer
[1:37:14] court and tells all of
[1:37:18] Israel this man Jesus
[1:37:22] King of the
[1:37:23] Jews we've interrogated him for four
[1:37:28] days he says and
[1:37:31] I find no fault in
[1:37:35] him how many days in the Old
[1:37:39] Testament did the lamb the natural
[1:37:43] Lambs had to they had to search for
[1:37:46] anything wrong with them the high
[1:37:50] priest four days they had four
[1:37:54] days to find a perfect
[1:37:57] lamb for this
[1:37:59] sacrifice that would be a sacrifice for
[1:38:03] the sins of all the
[1:38:09] people this
[1:38:11] day at this
[1:38:14] tribunal Pontius
[1:38:17] pilot a pagan
[1:38:20] man not a
[1:38:23] Believer he's Anointed with a prophetic
[1:38:28] word and he said this
[1:38:31] man Jesus of
[1:38:33] nazare King of the
[1:38:35] Jews I find no fault in
[1:38:40] him he was the most powerful
[1:38:45] person more power than the high priest
[1:38:48] himself
[1:38:50] Israel
[1:38:51] and he
[1:38:52] declared and he
[1:38:55] declared Jesus
[1:38:57] Christ the
[1:38:58] lamb without spot without
[1:39:06] wrinkle and the Book of the Lamb's Book
[1:39:09] of
[1:39:11] Life is
[1:39:15] unfolding in chapter two of
[1:39:19] Matthew it says now when Jesus was born
[1:39:22] in Bethlehem of
[1:39:28] Judea in the days of Herod the king
[1:39:31] behold there came wise men from the East
[1:39:33] to
[1:39:38] Jerusalem verse one that was a
[1:39:42] prophecy being
[1:39:45] fulfilled of where he would be
[1:39:47] born and these wise men came saying
[1:39:51] where is he where is he that is born
[1:39:54] King of the
[1:39:55] Jews for we have seen his star in the
[1:39:58] east and are come to worship
[1:40:03] him that was a prophecy of the prophets
[1:40:07] coming to pass verse three when Herod
[1:40:10] the king heard these things he was
[1:40:12] troubled and all Jerusalem with him and
[1:40:16] when he had gathered all the chief pre
[1:40:19] all the chief priests and scribes of the
[1:40:22] people together he demanded of them
[1:40:25] where Christ should be
[1:40:28] born and they said unto him in Bethlehem
[1:40:30] of
[1:40:32] Judea for thus it is written by the
[1:40:35] prophets and this was Prophecies of the
[1:40:38] Bible five verses five verses and
[1:40:43] prophecy after prophecy after prophecies
[1:40:48] unfolding and they read the prophet of
[1:40:50] Hosea
[1:40:54] and thou Bethlehem verse 6 in the land
[1:40:56] of
[1:40:58] Judah art not the least among the
[1:41:00] princes of
[1:41:02] Judah for out of thee shall come a
[1:41:05] governor that shall rule My People
[1:41:08] Israel we've only entered into six
[1:41:11] verses and every one of Prophecy is
[1:41:18] unfolding then Herod when he had private
[1:41:21] called the wise men verse
[1:41:23] S inquired of them
[1:41:26] diligently what time the star
[1:41:30] appear and he sent them to
[1:41:33] Bethlehem and said go and search
[1:41:36] dig for the young
[1:41:39] child when you have found him bring me
[1:41:42] word again that I may come and worship
[1:41:45] him
[1:41:46] also when they had heard the king they
[1:41:49] Departed
[1:41:52] Lo the
[1:41:54] star which they saw in the
[1:41:56] East went before them till it came and
[1:42:00] stood over where the young child
[1:42:03] was at this
[1:42:06] time when the when these three kings
[1:42:10] came they say Jesus was a two or
[1:42:12] threeyear old
[1:42:16] boy he wasn't a
[1:42:18] baby in a crib no more
[1:42:22] that's how the Shepherds saw him they
[1:42:24] first
