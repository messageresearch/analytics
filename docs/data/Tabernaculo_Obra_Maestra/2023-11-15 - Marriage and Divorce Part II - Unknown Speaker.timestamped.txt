[42:48] evening it's good to be here once
[42:52] again glad to see everyone back home
[42:55] safe
[43:00] and
[43:01] um and even though it sounds like we all
[43:03] were
[43:07] sick um the main thing isn't that we got
[43:13] sick but the main thing is that God once
[43:15] again he kept his
[43:17] [Music]
[43:21] promise and that is by his stripes we
[43:23] are
[43:25] healed
[43:26] sickness
[43:28] comes but he sends
[43:31] healing sadness can
[43:34] come but he'll send
[43:37] Joy anxiety can
[43:40] come but he'll send
[43:43] peace and all these things we are
[43:45] subject
[43:48] to we we we go out on a hot summer
[43:53] day we we go out on a hot
[43:59] summer day and and we get
[44:03] hot we go out on a cold winter
[44:07] day and we get
[44:10] cold so we are subject to everything
[44:13] that every other person on the planet
[44:15] Earth is subject
[44:21] to every human being passes through
[44:24] these things
[44:27] but as a believer in
[44:29] Christ we have a
[44:32] hope if we weren't
[44:35] Believers I would have no
[44:38] hope that I'd ever see my son or my mom
[44:40] and dad
[44:43] again death would have become a very
[44:46] final
[44:50] thing
[44:53] but but but because of the hope we have
[44:56] in
[44:59] Christ because we can be serve him by
[45:03] faith because we believe everything he
[45:05] said is
[45:08] true and he told us that one
[45:12] day the Trump of God shall
[45:14] [Music]
[45:16] sound the dead in Christ shall
[45:19] rise and we which were alive and
[45:24] remain believing for this event to come
[45:28] to
[45:30] pass then it will come to
[45:32] pass and we will be part of that
[45:36] event we're already part of the the
[45:39] event the preparation
[45:45] part I I heard um there was a young boy
[45:50] asking his
[45:53] dad and he he heard in church about the
[45:57] coming of the
[46:02] Lord and he asked his
[46:05] dad he says Dad the coming of the
[46:10] Lord when is it going to
[46:13] happen uh what day is
[46:15] that is it
[46:18] tomorrow he says well son he said I
[46:23] don't
[46:24] know what day it is
[46:27] is because you see I'm not on the
[46:30] planning committee for
[46:35] that I'm not in the group of men that
[46:38] are planning I'm not on the planning
[46:45] committee no he says I am just on the
[46:48] welcoming
[46:51] committee so so so so my
[46:54] job to be
[46:57] ready heart soul mind and
[47:01] body to well to welcome
[47:05] him and you can welcome him
[47:08] now because he's come to our hearts and
[47:11] to our
[47:12] [Music]
[47:13] lives so we're not on the planning
[47:19] committee but but we are on the
[47:21] welcoming
[47:24] committee
[47:27] and that's what we want to do tonight as
[47:28] we stand to our feet we want to make
[47:31] him we don't want to leave him Jesus
[47:34] with dirty
[47:39] feet no we we want to we want to wash
[47:42] his
[47:44] feet with our
[47:47] tears and and wipe them clean with our
[47:50] with our
[47:53] hair just like that little woman
[47:57] who who snuck into into that dinner that
[48:00] they were having a
[48:05] Pharisee she had to break all the rules
[48:08] to do
[48:11] it all the church
[48:17] rules but she she took the
[48:20] risk because she was getting going to
[48:22] get close to
[48:24] Jesus and she had something in her
[48:28] heart of which she needed and wanted an
[48:34] answer yeah can let's turn with me in
[48:37] your
[48:39] Bibles first Thessalonians chapter
[48:44] 4 and as you're turning
[48:47] there we just like to remind you that uh
[48:50] this coming
[48:53] Saturday this Saturday uh Saturday at
[48:56] 6:00
[48:58] p.m. uh we'll be having a
[49:01] service and Sunday
[49:04] also same morning same time on
[49:08] Sunday our brother uh our brother Raul
[49:11] Gonzalez will be here with
[49:15] us uh his s uh the sister's wife sister
[49:20] Maria I believe their daughter and her
[49:23] two boys are coming sister Arana coming
[49:25] with with him
[49:27] also so you'll get to meet our brother's
[49:30] daughter
[49:31] also we're in expectation for
[49:35] it I was thinking of calling him
[49:40] today and just that I was going to call
[49:42] him my phone
[49:46] rings and it's uh and and on the read
[49:49] out on the screen it says Raul
[49:53] Gonzalez I said oh look at that we're
[49:56] thinking the
[50:00] same but then when I greeted
[50:04] him I I I realized no one was
[50:09] talking so they must have bumped the
[50:11] phone number in their
[50:15] pocket I said no problem I'll just call
[50:18] him
[50:20] back so I just hit redial on that phone
[50:24] there
[50:27] and brother Raul Gonzalez
[50:31] answers but it turned out to be brother
[50:33] Leo's
[50:37] brother-in-law so we got to talk in a
[50:40] little
[50:41] bit we had a nice time of
[50:45] Fellowship so we may have a double
[50:47] portion this
[50:50] weekend because we invited him to come
[50:54] also so there may be two rul Gonzalez's
[50:58] this
[50:59] weekend I I think that's a good
[51:02] thing somehow God's wanting to say
[51:04] something to
[51:07] us and as soon as I get the
[51:14] answer you'll be the first to
[51:17] know first Thessalonians chapter
[51:23] 4 verses 1-7
[51:27] we've read it uh when we preached the
[51:28] other two
[51:32] services so verse one furthermore then
[51:36] we beseech you Brethren and exhort you
[51:39] by the Lord Jesus that as you have
[51:41] received of us how ye ought to walk and
[51:44] to please God so ye could abound more
[51:47] and
[51:54] more
[52:04] for you know what Commandments we gave
[52:07] you by the Lord
[52:13] Jesus for this is the will of God even
[52:16] your sanctification that you should
[52:18] abstain from
[52:24] fornication
[52:26] that every one of you should know how to
[52:29] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[52:40] honor not in the lust of concupiscence
[52:43] even as the Gentiles which know not
[52:49] God that no man go beyond and defraud
[52:52] his brother in any matter
[53:02] because that the Lord is the Avenger of
[53:04] all such as we also have forewarned you
[53:08] and
[53:12] testified for God ha not called us unto
[53:16] uncleanness but unto
[53:22] Holiness but God hath not called us unto
[53:26] uncleanness but unto
[53:36] Holiness as we had mentioned
[53:40] before in this teaching of marriage and
[53:45] divorce there is a natural and a
[53:50] spiritual how God wants us to live in
[53:53] the
[53:54] natural
[53:56] the best plan for our
[54:00] lives and and also in the
[54:03] spiritual and one is a type and Shadow
[54:06] of the
[54:08] other but but they they they they the
[54:13] they they they don't they are not the
[54:16] same because because Jesus said that
[54:18] which is born of the flesh is
[54:22] flesh and that which is born in the
[54:24] spirit is
[54:27] spirit so so there is a difference
[54:30] between the
[54:31] natural marriage between a man and a
[54:34] woman and the supernatural between God
[54:36] and his
[54:42] bride so so so they're they're they're
[54:45] not the
[54:47] same not even close to being the
[54:52] same there is a small shadow that one
[54:55] Shadows the
[54:59] other but one is
[55:01] natural and one is
[55:04] Supernatural and there's a great
[55:08] difference but but go but but but God
[55:11] wants you to learn to be
[55:16] faithful in
[55:19] both in both
[55:21] commitments in both
[55:24] marriages both
[55:27] natural and
[55:29] Supernatural let's pray Heavenly Father
[55:32] we thank you and ask Lord that you're
[55:35] the revealer of the
[55:39] word that you would once
[55:42] more go from Heart to
[55:45] Heart from youngest to
[55:48] oldest and bless us once
[55:51] again in Jesus
[55:53] name amen amen you may be
[56:00] seated there are three Witnesses in in
[56:03] this great
[56:06] truth and if you don't bring all three
[56:08] Witnesses
[56:13] together you'll you'll never have the
[56:15] complete
[56:18] truth first
[56:20] Moses gives us an
[56:23] account
[56:27] of what he
[56:28] saw by
[56:30] vision of what God
[56:33] did and said in
[56:36] Genesis then Jesus Christ
[56:41] himself and Jesus Christ himself
[56:46] El uh and he spoke in his Earthly
[56:53] Ministry
[56:56] of what this truth
[56:58] was so he added more details to
[57:03] this then in the form of the Holy
[57:06] Spirit he gives
[57:10] Paul a prophet and
[57:13] Apostle another
[57:16] portion then once again in the form of
[57:19] the Holy
[57:21] Spirit he shows William
[57:23] brandham
[57:25] how to bring all these loose ends
[57:30] together brother Bram was not one of the
[57:33] three
[57:35] [Music]
[57:37] Witnesses it was
[57:39] Jesus it was Moses it was Apostle
[57:43] Paul what what what the prophet in this
[57:46] last day
[57:49] did is what he told us that was the what
[57:53] was the ministry of the the seventh
[57:57] angel and it was to bring all the loose
[58:00] ends
[58:03] together so we could so we could
[58:06] see that the
[58:08] Bible is hidden in the mouths and and
[58:16] testimonies of of of God's
[58:20] prophets because Moses was a
[58:23] prophet Jesus was a
[58:26] prophet Paul was a
[58:28] prophet the prophetic
[58:31] word so to bring all these loose ends
[58:35] together it would take a prophet
[58:38] again to tie them all together for
[58:42] us then when a prophet brings it all the
[58:45] prophetic word
[58:48] together then God Can Open the Eyes of
[58:51] our
[58:53] understanding
[58:56] and we're not looking just for a
[58:58] definition in a
[59:01] dictionary but we're looking for
[59:03] patterns and examples in the
[59:08] Bible three
[59:10] Witnesses we read in Matthew 19 and
[59:17] 19 and or Matthew 19 is where Jesus was
[59:23] speaking
[59:26] and the Pharisees tried to Corner him on
[59:28] this
[59:34] subject on on on this teaching of
[59:37] marriage and
[59:40] divorce because they thought they had
[59:42] the answer from
[59:47] Jehovah through the mouth of
[59:50] Moses a Great and Mighty
[59:53] prophet they didn't realize they didn't
[59:56] have the
[59:59] answer they didn't realize that what
[1:00:01] they
[1:00:05] had they what what they had was not thus
[1:00:09] sayith the
[1:00:13] Lord no what what they had was something
[1:00:17] that
[1:00:21] Moses because of the hardness of their
[1:00:24] hearts
[1:00:27] you remember there in Matthew
[1:00:29] 19 Jesus was
[1:00:33] teaching he finished up these
[1:00:36] teachings and there were great
[1:00:38] multitudes that followed them there was
[1:00:40] a great healing
[1:00:44] campaign and despite all the healings
[1:00:46] the supernatural Miracles that the
[1:00:48] Pharisees
[1:00:53] saw all the great
[1:00:56] Miracles the Pharisees saw them
[1:01:00] also they were in that
[1:01:02] multitude but they were looking for an
[1:01:06] opportunity to find fault in
[1:01:10] him that the people would abandon
[1:01:15] him their hearts were so
[1:01:20] hardened it they it didn't matter to
[1:01:23] them
[1:01:25] that their
[1:01:27] moms their dads their
[1:01:30] cousins their
[1:01:33] grandchilden were being healed
[1:01:39] supernaturally it didn't
[1:01:42] matter so the law that they
[1:01:46] had was given to them to Israel as a
[1:01:52] nation because of the hardness of their
[1:01:54] heart
[1:01:56] and and the teachings of marriage and
[1:02:01] divorce laying within the within the
[1:02:06] law was also part of
[1:02:09] that given to them for the same
[1:02:14] reason because of the hardness of their
[1:02:17] hearts go through the through the
[1:02:20] prophet Moses god allowed Moses to tell
[1:02:23] the people
[1:02:29] to give them Ten
[1:02:32] Commandments Thou shalt not
[1:02:35] kill do you know why he gave them
[1:02:38] that because of the hardness of their
[1:02:41] hearts they were
[1:02:44] intent every time they became
[1:02:48] angry to kill
[1:02:50] somebody it might even be their own son
[1:02:55] it could be one of their
[1:02:57] wives because of the hardness of their
[1:03:01] hearts God gave them that
[1:03:04] commandment Thou shalt not
[1:03:06] kill Thou shalt not commit
[1:03:10] adultery it was given to
[1:03:12] them because of the hardness of their
[1:03:15] hearts Thou shalt not covet Thy Neighbor
[1:03:18] House no uh I shall not
[1:03:23] cover
[1:03:28] he said you know why he gave him
[1:03:32] that because of the hardness of their
[1:03:35] heart The Ten
[1:03:38] Commandments from Thou shalt not
[1:03:41] kill to the Commandments on marriage and
[1:03:46] divorce were all given to
[1:03:49] Israel for this one key
[1:03:53] principle
[1:03:55] the
[1:03:56] hardness of the hearts of
[1:04:02] mankind and Jesus told
[1:04:05] them it wasn't so in the
[1:04:09] beginning in the
[1:04:11] beginning when it was just Adam and
[1:04:14] Eve they didn't need a
[1:04:17] commandment Thou shalt not
[1:04:20] kill they they didn't they they couldn't
[1:04:22] even spell the word much l do
[1:04:29] [Music]
[1:04:33] act so here we
[1:04:35] are in Matthew
[1:04:39] 19 Jesus is speaking with the
[1:04:44] Pharisees they're trying to find fault
[1:04:47] with
[1:04:48] him they they they think they know
[1:04:53] something but but what blinded
[1:04:56] them to make them think they knew
[1:05:01] something was the hardness of their
[1:05:06] hearts
[1:05:12] Amen in verse n Jesus
[1:05:15] said and I say unto you whosoever shall
[1:05:19] put away his wife except it be for
[1:05:22] fornication and shall Mar another
[1:05:25] committeth
[1:05:37] adultery and whosoever Marth her which
[1:05:40] is put away do commit
[1:05:45] adultery so this is where where
[1:05:48] God once again remember how he was
[1:05:53] speaking
[1:05:55] in a parable even this was in Parable
[1:06:00] for he mixed the word
[1:06:05] wife with the word
[1:06:08] fornication and it brought all this
[1:06:11] confusion that we have yet
[1:06:14] today because fornication we we
[1:06:19] understand is is something that is a is
[1:06:22] an immoral act between two single
[1:06:32] people whereas
[1:06:35] adultery is the same
[1:06:38] act but when it you that but it's you're
[1:06:41] in adultery when you are married and are
[1:06:47] Unfaithful so but here Jesus uses the
[1:06:51] word
[1:06:53] wife
[1:06:55] and he mixes it with the word
[1:06:58] fornication and then he says this is the
[1:07:01] only
[1:07:03] reason for which a man could leave his
[1:07:07] wife divorce
[1:07:10] her and marry
[1:07:14] another now he could divorce
[1:07:17] her two people can
[1:07:21] separate even two people who call call
[1:07:24] themselves
[1:07:27] Christians but for the man except it be
[1:07:30] for this one
[1:07:35] reason he might leave his
[1:07:37] [Music]
[1:07:38] wife but he claims to be a believer in
[1:07:41] Christ a
[1:07:45] Christian the Bible says you cannot
[1:07:52] remarry because because though you get
[1:07:58] divorced by the
[1:08:01] law before God you're still a married
[1:08:06] man you have a wife and your wife is
[1:08:09] still a married
[1:08:12] woman she has a
[1:08:14] husband and as long as her husband
[1:08:18] lives she's bound to the law of her
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:22] husband but it's no longer that a man
[1:08:25] can divorce for any
[1:08:28] [Music]
[1:08:31] reason and
[1:08:33] remarry just
[1:08:36] one and and and when Jesus is bringing
[1:08:39] this
[1:08:43] mystery he mixes the word
[1:08:49] wife with the word
[1:08:52] fornication and everybody's saying well
[1:08:54] what does that
[1:08:59] mean in Matthew 5 and verse
[1:09:05] 32 remember Matthew
[1:09:08] 5 it was Jesus speaking on
[1:09:14] Perfection telling us where we
[1:09:18] start in our Christian
[1:09:20] walk and he said blessed are the poor in
[1:09:23] spirit
[1:09:27] we we all start in the same
[1:09:31] place
[1:09:33] broken
[1:09:35] Sinners and needing Christ to lift us
[1:09:41] up and then the promise and the goal
[1:09:43] from that first
[1:09:48] step is is to arrive and be be just like
[1:09:51] the
[1:09:52] father
[1:09:55] remember what Jesus
[1:09:57] said be ye therefore
[1:10:01] perfect even as my Father which is in
[1:10:04] heaven is
[1:10:07] perfect so we begin sinners in a fallen
[1:10:13] condition and the goal that God promises
[1:10:16] to take us
[1:10:20] to is perfection is a perfection and the
[1:10:24] world
[1:10:25] says we can't be
[1:10:29] perfect it's not
[1:10:31] possible but to to the
[1:10:33] believer everything that Jesus
[1:10:36] said is possible but it was a parable
[1:10:43] also and
[1:10:45] Perfection doesn't mean what we think it
[1:10:49] means Perfection the
[1:10:52] goal as our father is
[1:10:56] perfect is to be as Eternal as he is
[1:11:02] eternal potentially we are Eternal
[1:11:07] already but there's a
[1:11:10] preparation that's what we need to
[1:11:13] do we need to get into this
[1:11:17] preparation we need to become part of
[1:11:19] this welcoming
[1:11:22] committee
[1:11:28] that's what God is calling us to so here
[1:11:30] in in Matthew 5
[1:11:35] 532 Jesus was
[1:11:37] speaking in verse
[1:11:40] 27 he tells us
[1:11:43] this and even in this Parable as he's
[1:11:47] speaking he's making things known to
[1:11:51] us ye have heard that that it was said
[1:11:54] by them of old
[1:11:59] time verse
[1:12:07] 27 ye have heard that it was said by
[1:12:10] them of old time Thou shalt not commit
[1:12:16] adultery in English in English it it
[1:12:19] says ye have heard that it was said by
[1:12:22] them of old
[1:12:26] time you notice Jesus didn't
[1:12:30] say thus saith the
[1:12:34] Lord no no no he gives credit where
[1:12:37] credit was
[1:12:41] due he said them of old time said
[1:12:45] this I allowed them to say
[1:12:49] that because of the hardness of their
[1:12:52] hearts
[1:12:54] but now that I've
[1:12:56] come they said don't commit
[1:13:00] adultery but a New
[1:13:03] Covenant is
[1:13:06] coming God came down in
[1:13:11] flesh died on the cross and paid the
[1:13:16] price so that we could be born
[1:13:19] again to take away
[1:13:22] what to Deliver Us from the hardness of
[1:13:25] our
[1:13:28] hearts the thing that's plagued the
[1:13:30] human race since
[1:13:35] Genesis it was a
[1:13:38] plague Cain killed his
[1:13:42] brother why because of the hardness of
[1:13:46] his
[1:13:48] heart and God allowed Moses to give them
[1:13:51] a
[1:13:52] commandment
[1:13:56] Thou shalt not
[1:13:58] kill because of the hardness of your
[1:14:01] heart thou shal not commit
[1:14:04] adultery because of the hardness of your
[1:14:07] heart Thou shalt not cover thy
[1:14:09] neighbor's house because of the hardness
[1:14:12] of your
[1:14:15] heart th thou shall have no other God
[1:14:19] because of the hardness of your
[1:14:22] heart
[1:14:25] so you see what was taking place
[1:14:29] here the law was given to
[1:14:32] man because of the hardness of his
[1:14:36] heart Jesus told him it's written thou
[1:14:39] shall not commit
[1:14:43] adultery because of the hardness of your
[1:14:46] hearts that takes you to
[1:14:50] adultery that takes you to be covetous
[1:14:55] the hardness of the hearts takes you to
[1:15:00] fornication hardness of their hearts
[1:15:02] takes you to
[1:15:05] adultery the hardness of your heart
[1:15:07] takes you to other
[1:15:12] gods but I say unto you verse
[1:15:17] 28 so verse
[1:15:19] 28 is now
[1:15:22] becoming thus saith the
[1:15:25] Lord Jesus is
[1:15:27] speaking Jehovah is
[1:15:31] speaking but I say unto
[1:15:33] you thus saith the Lord that whosoever
[1:15:38] lookth on a woman to lust after her has
[1:15:40] committed adultery with her already in
[1:15:44] the hardness of his
[1:15:52] heart
[1:15:56] H how did he commit
[1:16:00] this through the eye
[1:16:08] gate Jesus Jesus knew he discerned the
[1:16:15] hearts and when he discerned the
[1:16:18] hearts all them men around there
[1:16:22] saying
[1:16:24] he says what what what do you want us to
[1:16:26] do we can see these people we have eyes
[1:16:29] to see don't
[1:16:32] we Jesus discerns their thought their
[1:16:37] thoughts and he looks to the
[1:16:38] congregation looks to the crowd and he
[1:16:41] says If thy right eye offend
[1:16:45] thee conviction strikes him
[1:16:48] whoa he knows what we're
[1:16:51] thinking he said if I right eye offend
[1:16:56] thee he said pluck It
[1:16:58] Out cast it from
[1:17:00] thee for it is profitable verse 29 for
[1:17:04] it is profitable for thee that one of
[1:17:06] thy members should perish and not that
[1:17:08] thy whole body should be cast into
[1:17:22] hell so Jesus tells us whosoever lookth
[1:17:25] on a
[1:17:26] Woman verse
[1:17:29] 28 then he catches their thoughts in the
[1:17:32] in amongst the amongst the
[1:17:37] multitude and they're thinking how how
[1:17:40] can we do that if we've got eyes to see
[1:17:42] don't
[1:17:44] we so he discerns what they're thinking
[1:17:47] in their
[1:17:49] hearts and he addresses that issue
[1:17:56] and he says If thy right eye offend thee
[1:17:58] pluck it
[1:18:00] out he says it's more profitable for
[1:18:03] thee that one of thy members should
[1:18:08] perish and not that thy whole body
[1:18:10] should be cast into
[1:18:12] hell and his ministry was
[1:18:16] how in
[1:18:18] Parables he was speaking again in
[1:18:21] parables
[1:18:25] then he
[1:18:26] says If thy
[1:18:28] right I If thy right hand offend thee
[1:18:31] cut it
[1:18:35] off in other words he's telling don't
[1:18:38] look after them
[1:18:45] lustfully don't put your hands on a
[1:18:48] woman that's not your
[1:18:51] wife and the men are thinking yeah how
[1:18:55] do we do
[1:18:58] that Jesus catches through discernment
[1:19:01] once
[1:19:03] again and he says If thy right hand
[1:19:05] offend
[1:19:07] thee cut it
[1:19:09] off and cast it from
[1:19:12] thee for it's profitable for thee that
[1:19:15] one of thy members should perish and not
[1:19:17] that thy whole body should be cast into
[1:19:21] hell
[1:19:25] and men don't want to preach on
[1:19:28] it because they take it
[1:19:31] literal and they and they they they
[1:19:33] don't know how to how to relate to
[1:19:36] this they don't realize it's a
[1:19:40] parable there's a supernatural there's a
[1:19:42] mystery laying in
[1:19:46] it and If thy right hand offend thee cut
[1:19:48] it off and cast it from thee for it's
[1:19:51] profitable profitable for thee that one
[1:19:54] of thy members should perish and not
[1:19:55] that thy whole body should be cast into
[1:20:06] hell then he
[1:20:08] said because this is rolling around in
[1:20:11] the heads of the
[1:20:15] people he said it hath been
[1:20:19] said not not God told us in the old
[1:20:25] Testament not thus sayith the
[1:20:28] Lord no Jesus didn't say
[1:20:30] that do you think if if God would have
[1:20:34] said it Jesus would
[1:20:39] know because Jesus of the New
[1:20:42] Testament is Jehovah of the
[1:20:45] old he knows just what he
[1:20:49] said this is something he allowed Moses
[1:20:52] to to give the
[1:20:56] people because of the hardness of their
[1:21:00] hearts not just for a
[1:21:04] divorce but all Ten
[1:21:07] Commandments have been given to
[1:21:10] Israel because of the hardness of their
[1:21:14] hearts thou shallal not
[1:21:18] kill because of the hardness of your
[1:21:21] hearts
[1:21:24] and Jesus said in verse 31 it has been
[1:21:29] said whosoever shall put away his
[1:21:33] wife let him give her a writing of
[1:21:38] divorcement But A Change Is
[1:21:42] Coming the New
[1:21:44] Testament was a testament and a covenant
[1:21:47] of
[1:21:50] change how many changes
[1:21:53] five of
[1:21:55] them change change change change
[1:22:00] change everything was going to
[1:22:03] change the church worship was going to
[1:22:07] change the way we approached God was
[1:22:10] going to be
[1:22:12] changed the way we the the way we live
[1:22:14] at live at peace with our husbands and
[1:22:16] wives was going to
[1:22:20] change because under the old Old
[1:22:24] Testament all the Commandments had been
[1:22:27] given because of the hardness of the
[1:22:29] hearts of the human
[1:22:34] race but but the New
[1:22:37] Testament the promises that were given
[1:22:41] now and the requirements upon your
[1:22:46] life was because now you and I could be
[1:22:49] born
[1:22:51] again and Purge the hardness of our
[1:22:57] hearts and never be the same
[1:23:02] again and Jesus said but I say unto
[1:23:08] you uh verse
[1:23:13] 32 so Jesus speaking in Matthew
[1:23:17] 5 here in verse
[1:23:21] 27-32 is now
[1:23:24] Jesus making a
[1:23:27] distinction between the laws the the and
[1:23:31] the doctrines and rituals of
[1:23:36] men
[1:23:38] doctrines and teachings of
[1:23:41] men and what is now thus sayith the
[1:23:47] Lord do you see what we received in this
[1:23:50] last
[1:23:51] day
[1:23:54] the son of man coming to tell
[1:23:57] us you it has been said by old time
[1:24:05] Pentecostals if you speak in tongues
[1:24:08] you've got the Holy Ghost but
[1:24:11] now thus saith the
[1:24:14] Lord the baptism of the holy
[1:24:18] spirit is not an
[1:24:20] emotion it's the very life of God
[1:24:24] in and when you receive it you'll never
[1:24:28] be the same
[1:24:30] again
[1:24:32] Hallelujah you see how it repeats the
[1:24:36] pattern from you have
[1:24:41] heard what is said by them old time
[1:24:47] Pentecostals but God in this age
[1:24:50] came through the mouth of the seven
[1:24:53] angel with thus sayth the Lord but now I
[1:24:57] say unto
[1:25:00] you all that I allowed it because of the
[1:25:04] hardness of their
[1:25:06] hearts but I'm going to pull you
[1:25:09] out of
[1:25:13] denominationalism and bring you into the
[1:25:15] bride of
[1:25:17] Christ where you have thus sayith the
[1:25:20] Lord and by a born again
[1:25:25] experience now I'm going to purge
[1:25:29] you of the
[1:25:32] hardness of our
[1:25:34] hearts of my heart of your
[1:25:38] heart that's why we must be born
[1:25:45] again some of us were too long in a
[1:25:48] Catholic
[1:25:51] Church
[1:25:53] some of us were too long in an Apostolic
[1:25:58] Church some of us were too long in a
[1:26:01] Pentecostal
[1:26:05] Church some of us were way too long in a
[1:26:08] so-called message
[1:26:16] church and now God
[1:26:19] comes to pull us out
[1:26:23] of the hardness of our
[1:26:26] hearts so we won't
[1:26:28] say but that's the way they taught
[1:26:34] me but Jesus now is
[1:26:37] saying but I say unto you there's a
[1:26:40] better
[1:26:41] way but I say unto you verse 32 that
[1:26:44] whosoever shall put away his wife saving
[1:26:48] for the cause of fornication causes her
[1:26:50] to commit adultery
[1:26:52] and whosoever shall marry her that is
[1:26:54] divorced committeth
[1:27:08] adultery so once again Jesus puts
[1:27:13] together the the word
[1:27:17] wife with a word
[1:27:19] fornication and the world is confused
[1:27:25] Jesus said father I thank
[1:27:28] you that you've hidden these
[1:27:31] things the eyes of the wise and
[1:27:34] prudent but you're revealing it unto
[1:27:38] babes such as would
[1:27:41] learn it takes a born again
[1:27:45] experience to put off the hardness of
[1:27:48] our
[1:27:51] hearts and the hardness of our hearts
[1:27:53] won't go away
[1:27:57] easy we've got to pray
[1:28:00] through we got to push it
[1:28:03] away we got to understand there's a
[1:28:06] hardness
[1:28:08] there and be born
[1:28:11] again and and have a baptism with fire
[1:28:15] take
[1:28:18] place then we're ready then we have have
[1:28:22] an ear to
[1:28:25] hear what Jesus is
[1:28:28] saying in this day now we're recognizing
[1:28:33] our
[1:28:35] day now we're recognizing our
[1:28:39] message our message isn't William
[1:28:42] brandham William brandham William
[1:28:44] brandom William Bram William Bram
[1:28:47] William brandham no it's what William
[1:28:48] brandham told us it was William br
[1:28:52] it's all about
[1:28:55] Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus
[1:28:59] Savior Lamb of
[1:29:01] God our
[1:29:05] bridegroom the lover of our
[1:29:08] soul the changer of Our
[1:29:11] Lives he through he through a born again
[1:29:17] experience who has taking away the
[1:29:19] hardness from our hearts
[1:29:24] the
[1:29:25] message we read it last time I like to
[1:29:28] read it
[1:29:30] again marriage and
[1:29:33] divorce paragraph
[1:29:37] 57 Jesus brother brandham says
[1:29:40] this this
[1:29:42] scripture this
[1:29:45] question confronted Jesus at the very
[1:29:47] beginning of his
[1:29:50] ministry
[1:29:53] and it confronted
[1:29:55] Moses at the very beginning of his
[1:29:59] ministry it's it's it's a question in
[1:30:01] believer's
[1:30:05] Hearts The Sinner doesn't
[1:30:09] care but
[1:30:11] Believers because the
[1:30:13] believer is trying to do all that he
[1:30:17] knows to do to live right before
[1:30:24] God he says
[1:30:26] therefore if any question comes up on
[1:30:32] religion then the marriage and divorce
[1:30:34] case comes
[1:30:38] up then he asked
[1:30:41] why he said because it's the cause of
[1:30:44] the original
[1:30:48] sin so what's brother brandham telling
[1:30:51] us
[1:30:53] that the
[1:30:55] answer in a real live
[1:31:01] example of how a
[1:31:05] wife can commit
[1:31:09] fornication is laying in
[1:31:13] Genesis the
[1:31:15] answer why Jesus used the word
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:20] wife with the word
[1:31:23] fornication the
[1:31:26] answer is laying in
[1:31:28] Genesis because it is the
[1:31:31] cause of the original
[1:31:43] sin paragraph
[1:31:45] 84 of marriage and
[1:31:49] divorce brother Bram says Jesus in our
[1:31:54] text he was referring to Matthew
[1:31:58] 19 and and Matthew 5 invites us to go
[1:32:03] back to the
[1:32:05] beginning for the true scriptural
[1:32:10] answer let me read that
[1:32:12] again Jesus in our
[1:32:15] text he had read Matthew
[1:32:19] 19 he says invites us to go back to the
[1:32:23] beginning for the true scriptural
[1:32:29] answer what was the
[1:32:31] question what was the
[1:32:33] answer brother brandom tells us it's
[1:32:36] laying in
[1:32:38] Genesis he said Jesus invited us to go
[1:32:42] back
[1:32:44] there to find the
[1:32:46] answer to this
[1:32:48] question he said now when he was
[1:32:51] confronted with
[1:32:54] this there was two things in
[1:32:58] view the priest the priest said to
[1:33:02] him can a man put away his wife and
[1:33:05] marry another for any
[1:33:19] cause m
[1:33:22] and Jesus
[1:33:23] said he he put it as a
[1:33:27] question to Jesus even though they felt
[1:33:31] they knew the answer
[1:33:34] already because Moses that's the
[1:33:36] Commandment that Moses had given
[1:33:40] them they liked it but they didn't know
[1:33:44] why he had given it to
[1:33:49] them because it eased for a
[1:33:56] moment because it it eased for a moment
[1:33:59] the hardness of their
[1:34:06] hearts under the Old
[1:34:10] Testament a a Jewish man he could be
[1:34:14] married for 24
[1:34:16] hours and he could
[1:34:19] say I'm not living with this woman for
[1:34:22] one more
[1:34:24] hour what do I
[1:34:26] do remember Moses said you could you
[1:34:30] could divorce
[1:34:32] her for any
[1:34:34] reason oh
[1:34:37] great the hardness of his heart all of a
[1:34:40] sudden he felt
[1:34:45] relief it was
[1:34:47] given to bring down the the the action
[1:34:50] of the heart Ness of their
[1:34:54] hearts to help them so they could keep
[1:34:58] the other
[1:35:01] commandment Thou shalt not kill
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:05] her see you see what Ten Commandments
[1:35:08] were
[1:35:11] for you think it's great
[1:35:14] now when you understand the reason why
[1:35:17] they were
[1:35:19] given because of the hardness of the
[1:35:21] hearts of the human
[1:35:23] race especially the
[1:35:31] man the book is
[1:35:33] open the lamb is revealing
[1:35:37] it details we never saw
[1:35:41] before today the
[1:35:44] world is still so
[1:35:48] happy for the Ten Commandments
[1:35:52] they they put them on the
[1:35:56] walls of Judges rooms and and cour
[1:36:02] houses they they they want it they want
[1:36:04] to have it in the halls of Congress and
[1:36:10] Senate they say oh look at these Ten
[1:36:13] Commandments that God gave
[1:36:17] us and when Jesus
[1:36:19] came he said I never gave you
[1:36:23] that I allowed Moses to give you
[1:36:27] that and there was a reason
[1:36:30] why because when they're hanging on the
[1:36:33] wall of your
[1:36:36] house or in your
[1:36:39] office or in the president's
[1:36:43] office it's to remind us of one great
[1:36:48] truth God had to give us that
[1:36:52] because of the hardness of our
[1:36:54] hearts that's what Ten Commandments
[1:36:57] should remind you
[1:37:00] of how hard and wicked the human heart
[1:37:03] can
[1:37:07] be but Jesus said If thy eye offend
[1:37:12] thee pluck it
[1:37:14] out if thy right hand offend
[1:37:18] thee cut it
[1:37:20] off
[1:37:24] and no one wants to preach on
[1:37:27] it they can't explain
[1:37:29] it it sounds too
[1:37:35] radical and yet it was the mercy of
[1:37:40] God calling
[1:37:42] us through a born again
[1:37:47] experience for a total
[1:37:50] separation
[1:37:52] from all
[1:37:54] unbelief that we could be
[1:37:57] purged of the hardness of our
[1:38:01] hearts when does it
[1:38:04] begin the hardness of a person's
[1:38:09] heart believe it or
[1:38:13] not about the time you change the first
[1:38:15] diaper in that little cute little
[1:38:20] baby
[1:38:24] because until that child is born
[1:38:28] again there's a hardness building
[1:38:32] up oh we're different
[1:38:36] personalities different levels of how we
[1:38:40] react but unless until you've been born
[1:38:45] again there is a hardness that's
[1:38:50] growing and the
[1:38:52] government by taking our boys into the
[1:38:58] Army and the
[1:39:00] navyy and the
[1:39:02] Marines and the Air Force and all the
[1:39:05] Special
[1:39:07] Forces you know what they're doing to
[1:39:09] men and
[1:39:12] women training them to be harder and
[1:39:15] harder and
[1:39:18] harder taking them farther and farther
[1:39:21] from the promise of God
[1:39:25] today and then they tell
[1:39:27] them you're
[1:39:29] Patriots you're
[1:39:33] Heroes but you know what you also become
[1:39:39] murderers and killers and
[1:39:42] adulterers and
[1:39:45] fornicators because all Ten
[1:39:48] Commandments were given
[1:39:51] because of the
[1:39:53] hardness of our
[1:39:55] hearts but Jesus
[1:39:57] came and told
[1:40:00] Nicodemus
[1:40:02] Nicodemus you must be born
[1:40:06] again you must be born
[1:40:09] again in Malachi chapter
[1:40:13] 2 and verse
[1:40:15] 14 we'll be closing
[1:40:18] here Malachi
[1:40:21] with thus sayith the
[1:40:24] Lord speaks to
[1:40:27] Israel he speaking mainly to the
[1:40:33] priesthood and to the head of every
[1:40:36] home and Malachi 2 and
[1:40:41] verse4 he says this to the men of
[1:40:46] Israel he said yet ye say
[1:40:49] wherefore because the Lord ha been
[1:40:52] witness between thee and the wife of thy
[1:40:57] youth against whom thou has dealt
[1:41:00] treacherously verse 14 Malachi 2 and
[1:41:04] verse
[1:41:17] 14 through the mouth of Malachi
[1:41:22] change was
[1:41:25] beginning change was
[1:41:27] coming and God rebukes
[1:41:33] Israel for the hardness of their
[1:41:44] hearts he says yet she is thy companion
[1:41:49] and the wife of of thy
[1:41:58] Covenant and then verse 15 he says and
[1:42:01] did not he make
[1:42:05] one now now Malachi has taking them back
[1:42:09] to
[1:42:13] Genesis in the beginning God said let us
[1:42:15] make man in our
[1:42:19] image
[1:42:21] and he made them and he and he and he
[1:42:24] made Man In His
[1:42:28] Image male and
[1:42:31] female made he
[1:42:35] them and he called them
[1:42:38] Adam he said and did not he make
[1:42:42] one one what in the beginning one
[1:42:46] Adam yet in this Adam yet had he the
[1:42:50] resid do of the
[1:42:57] spirit speaking of the feminist
[1:43:01] spirit that was already in
[1:43:05] Adam that was part of
[1:43:08] him they were not Twain They were one in
[1:43:11] the
[1:43:14] beginning he saids yet had he the
[1:43:16] residue of the spirit and wherefore one
[1:43:20] this is
[1:43:25] why did he make them one in the
[1:43:29] beginning that he might seek a Godly
[1:43:35] seed therefore take heed to your
[1:43:40] spirit because your spirit is hard he's
[1:43:43] telling
[1:43:44] [Music]
[1:43:45] Israel and let none deal
[1:43:49] treacherously
[1:43:51] against the wife of his
[1:43:54] youth what's God telling
[1:43:56] them I hate the putting
[1:44:01] away I hate
[1:44:05] divorce verse
[1:44:06] 16 for the Lord for the Lord the god of
[1:44:10] Israel saith that he hateth putting
[1:44:18] away this was the sayith the Lord
[1:44:22] now he's bringing the
[1:44:25] change that's been
[1:44:28] promised a new testament a New Covenant
[1:44:32] to make you a new
[1:44:36] people to make you and your
[1:44:39] wife the wife of thy
[1:44:42] youth one
[1:44:44] again like it was in the
[1:44:48] beginning for the Lord the God of Israel
[1:44:51] saith that he hateth putting away for
[1:44:54] one
[1:44:57] coverthe of hearts for one
[1:45:01] coverthe the Lord of hosts therefore
[1:45:05] take heed to your spirit that ye deal
[1:45:07] not
[1:45:19] treacherously
[1:45:25] Malachi told them take heed to your
[1:45:32] spirit because your spirit is full of
[1:45:36] hardness and if you lean to the
[1:45:41] hardness you will deal
[1:45:47] treacherously you'll be you'll deal
[1:45:49] treacherously with your wife of your
[1:45:55] youth you'll deal treacherously with
[1:45:57] your
[1:45:59] children you'll build treacherously at
[1:46:02] your
[1:46:05] jobs all because of the same
[1:46:09] reason because of the hardness of the
[1:46:12] hearts of this human Fallen
[1:46:18] race then verse 17 says
[1:46:21] ye have wearied the Lord with your words
[1:46:25] yet ye say wherein have we wearied him
[1:46:29] when ye say everyone that doeth evil is
[1:46:32] good in the sight of the Lord and He
[1:46:35] delighteth in in them or where is the
[1:46:39] god of
[1:46:49] judgment
[1:46:58] you
[1:46:59] see Ten Commandments were
[1:47:03] given because of the hardness of their
[1:47:07] hearts that wasn't thus sayith the
[1:47:10] Lord Jesus told us you have heard them
[1:47:14] of Old Times
[1:47:19] say
[1:47:21] Thou shalt not commit
[1:47:24] adultery but I say unto
[1:47:27] you thus sayith the
[1:47:29] Lord had come at the first coming of
[1:47:34] Christ thus sayth the Lord had
[1:47:38] come at the first coming of
[1:47:41] Christ and in closing
[1:47:44] tonight and putting a
[1:47:46] comma thus saith the Lord again has has
[1:47:51] come at the second coming of
[1:47:54] Christ to help us put
[1:47:58] away the
[1:48:00] hardness of our
[1:48:02] hearts we're living in the
[1:48:07] day of a personal
[1:48:10] experience and it's the only
[1:48:13] thing that can take you and
[1:48:16] I to be
[1:48:19] quickened
[1:48:23] changed and
[1:48:26] translated by the power the holy
[1:48:29] spirit so we stand to our feet we
[1:48:36] continue Ten
[1:48:40] Commandments they're not as wonderful as
[1:48:42] they might
[1:48:47] seem because they were only given
[1:48:52] because of the hardness of our
[1:48:57] hearts we
[1:49:00] thought that when we tell our
[1:49:04] children Thou shalt not
[1:49:07] kill that we were sharing a great
[1:49:12] Revelation but we
[1:49:15] weren't we were just
[1:49:18] repeating what other men had said
[1:49:21] said and and until we came to this word
[1:49:25] and got a
[1:49:29] revelation we were repeating a lot of
[1:49:31] things that men
[1:49:33] said but but God now has brought us thus
[1:49:36] sayith the
[1:49:39] Lord so when you tell someone thou
[1:49:41] shallal not
[1:49:46] kill what you're really
[1:49:49] saying
[1:49:52] is the hardness of your
[1:49:55] heart was this commandment
[1:49:59] given by Moses
[1:50:04] indeed all Ten
[1:50:07] Commandments were
[1:50:09] given because of the hardness of men's
[1:50:14] Hearts the practice of marriage and
[1:50:18] divorce as it still is amongst the
[1:50:21] Jewish
[1:50:25] people was given to
[1:50:28] them because of the hardness of their
[1:50:31] hearts Malachi made it
[1:50:35] known and he told them he said the Lord
[1:50:39] have been a
[1:50:42] witness between thee and the wife of thy
[1:50:49] youth your first
[1:50:51] wife your only wife your true
[1:50:55] wife and then he told them against
[1:51:00] whom you
[1:51:02] priest you heads of your
[1:51:05] home you have you have dealt
[1:51:08] treacherously with
[1:51:16] her yet he
[1:51:18] says yet
[1:51:20] she is thy
[1:51:23] companion the wife of your
[1:51:26] youth your first wife she is thy
[1:51:30] companion and the
[1:51:33] wife of th
[1:51:35] covenant not the
