[42:37] in
[42:45] [Music]
[42:49] love
[42:51] be in
[42:55] my
[43:00] me I
[43:08] see
[43:10] [Music]
[43:25] see
[43:33] [Music]
[43:49] I just wanted to
[43:52] uh read this
[43:54] scripture um
[43:58] you know it's amazing how the Holy
[44:06] Spirit forget about doing that um it's
[44:10] amazing how the holy spirit is you know
[44:14] brother Jonathan is talking about the
[44:16] love of God and you know I that's what's
[44:19] been on my
[44:20] heart you know except today I I was just
[44:23] thinking about Lord How can I
[44:26] how can I have more of your love you
[44:28] know and I
[44:29] was and I and I started to hear this
[44:31] song and I
[44:32] [Music]
[44:34] was and it talks about you know
[44:37] nothing's
[44:38] impossible with God and I I said Lord I
[44:42] I need more of your faith because
[44:47] sometimes I mean in my heart I believe
[44:49] that with God everything is
[44:52] possible but sometimes the flesh you
[44:55] know we all go through different things
[44:57] and whatnot
[44:58] but you know I just I was thinking
[45:02] thinking about just faith and how
[45:06] powerful faith
[45:08] is not just any faith but the faith of
[45:11] God and that
[45:15] faith we don't I don't think we
[45:18] understand how how great it
[45:20] is that it's so great
[45:23] that when a son or daughter of God God
[45:26] is thinking on the
[45:28] Lord and no matter what they're going
[45:31] through they
[45:35] believe and you know that's what that's
[45:37] what makes the difference you know we're
[45:44] Believers I want to read this scripture
[45:46] first and then we're going to praise the
[45:48] Lord and the Book of Luke it says Luke
[45:52] 17:5 it
[45:54] says and the apostles said unto the Lord
[45:57] increase our
[46:00] faith and then in the Book of Mark
[46:03] chapter 11 I believe it's
[46:07] 11 um it says uh verse 22 to 24 it says
[46:12] and Jesus answering said unto them have
[46:15] faith in God for verily I say unto you
[46:18] that what who soever shall say unto this
[46:21] mountain be thou removed be thou cast
[46:24] into the sea and shall not doubt in his
[46:27] heart but shall believe that those
[46:29] things which he saith shall come to pass
[46:32] he shall have whatsoever he
[46:34] sayth therefore I say unto you what
[46:38] things soever you desire When you pray
[46:42] believe see what it says there
[46:45] believe that you receive them and you
[46:48] shall have
[46:51] them praise
[46:53] [Applause]
[46:54] God we've sang this song many times but
[46:58] I believe there's something about this
[46:59] song at least for
[47:02] me when I when I start to sing this song
[47:05] I just I just feel God's presence and we
[47:09] just pray that it'll be a
[47:13] [Music]

[1:01:28] Grace God once
[1:01:31] again he sweeps
[1:01:34] down and he supplies our
[1:01:37] needs sometimes we just ask him just
[1:01:40] just Supply the needs
[1:01:45] Lord but in most cases we've always we
[1:01:48] always find we always find
[1:01:53] out
[1:01:55] that he did more than just Supply the
[1:01:59] need he went above and
[1:02:02] beyond and and I believe we could all
[1:02:05] have this
[1:02:08] testimony that whatever we've
[1:02:12] asked he's always given
[1:02:15] more you can't out give the Lord the
[1:02:17] song

[1:03:57] theme
[1:03:59] Jesus
[1:04:00] evangelist prophet and Lamb of God if
[1:04:05] you'll turn with me to Matthew chapter
[1:04:10] 8 and we'll begin reading at verse
[1:04:15] 28 we began in Matthew
[1:04:19] 4 and the ministry of Jesus
[1:04:22] Christ he began as an
[1:04:26] evangelist praying for the
[1:04:28] sick doing
[1:04:31] Miracles healing people with
[1:04:36] diseases healing people from being demon
[1:04:46] possessed he he healing people who were
[1:04:49] vexed with a a lunatic
[1:04:53] spirit
[1:04:57] and so he
[1:04:59] began and he and and and he didn't
[1:05:01] Minister and preach
[1:05:06] much he simply said
[1:05:10] repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:05:14] hand but more would be
[1:05:18] added every the people needed to put a
[1:05:20] comma on that
[1:05:23] repent
[1:05:25] and those that went on to the next
[1:05:29] level they were looking for
[1:05:32] more so when he said
[1:05:36] repent the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[1:05:39] hand there was always a little
[1:05:42] group a little
[1:05:45] Remnant that said but is there
[1:05:49] more Matthew
[1:05:52] 8:28 and when when he was come to the
[1:05:54] other side into the country of the ganes
[1:05:58] there met him two possessed with Devils
[1:06:00] coming out of the tombs exceeding Fierce
[1:06:03] so that no man might pass by that
[1:06:18] way and behold they cried out saying
[1:06:22] what have we to do Jesus thou Son of God

[1:06:35] time let's pray Heavenly

[1:07:04] more please let me see
[1:07:08] more we ask all this in Jesus
[1:07:12] name amen amen you may be
[1:07:16] seated Matthew
[1:07:19] 28 Jesus an
[1:07:22] evangelist praying for the
[1:07:25] sick Healing The
[1:07:28] Sick the blind
[1:07:30] seen the the deaf
[1:07:34] hearing those that were crippled
[1:07:39] walking he got to a place where not only
[1:07:42] did he heal the
[1:07:47] sick not only did he rebuke
[1:07:50] devils and
[1:07:52] sicknesses
[1:07:55] uh but he got to a place where was he
[1:07:58] was in a boat with the
[1:08:02] disciples in a
[1:08:06] boat and a and a storm began to
[1:08:10] blow a storm so so
[1:08:13] [Music]
[1:08:15] Fierce that that that that even these
[1:08:18] these experienced seamen were
[1:08:22] scared
[1:08:24] these
[1:08:28] experience these
[1:08:33] experience they even they were scared of
[1:08:36] this
[1:08:40] storm but he he rose up from the
[1:08:44] ship he made like he was
[1:08:49] asleep but the Bible says that God
[1:08:51] neither sleeps nor slumbers
[1:08:55] [Music]
[1:09:01] he says and they thought he was
[1:09:05] asleep but he was testing
[1:09:08] them he says and they and they and he
[1:09:10] they called for him to rise
[1:09:13] up and he says why are you
[1:09:19] fearful oh ye of little
[1:09:22] faith then he arose and he rebuked the
[1:09:24] winds and the Sea and there was a great
[1:09:31] calm then then he arose and rebuked the
[1:09:37] wind and there was a great
[1:09:41] calm and the men
[1:09:45] marveled though they had seen him healed
[1:09:48] the
[1:09:51] sick though they had seen him give sight
[1:09:54] to the
[1:09:58] blind though they had seen him raise up
[1:10:01] those that were
[1:10:06] crippled and when they seen him speak to
[1:10:09] the
[1:10:10] storm the Bible says they marveled at
[1:10:14] him what manner of evangelist is
[1:10:20] this that even the winds and the waves
[1:10:22] of the sea obeys
[1:10:28] him then then it's in verse 28 when he
[1:10:30] said he came to the other side of the
[1:10:35] country and there he met with two
[1:10:37] possessed with
[1:10:41] Devils coming out of the
[1:10:44] tombs
[1:10:48] Fierce
[1:10:52] fears
[1:10:55] so that no man might pass by that
[1:10:58] way he said and they and when they saw
[1:11:03] him those demons recognized
[1:11:06] him most of the people weren't
[1:11:09] recognizing
[1:11:12] him they didn't really know who he
[1:11:15] was they thought he's just an evangelist
[1:11:18] doing great
[1:11:21] Miracles but when the dis IES saw him
[1:11:24] speak to the
[1:11:28] storm and the storm
[1:11:32] stopped it was like a waking
[1:11:36] up this is this is more than just an
[1:11:40] evangelist this is more than just a man
[1:11:42] that prays for the
[1:11:44] [Music]
[1:11:45] sick and is trying to lift up our
[1:11:51] faith these two demons
[1:11:54] these two men possessed with
[1:11:58] Devils the Devils recognized them
[1:12:02] immediately he said what have we to do
[1:12:05] with with thee Jesus thou Son of
[1:12:12] God they didn't have any
[1:12:15] theology they didn't have any teachings
[1:12:17] of a
[1:12:19] denomination that they didn't have a
[1:12:21] problem calling him the son of God
[1:12:25] they recognized him
[1:12:28] immediately you see you you might say
[1:12:31] well didn't he look like a common
[1:12:34] Jew he
[1:12:36] did but that's not what they
[1:12:40] saw they they saw the inner
[1:12:43] man they saw it was Jehovah God
[1:12:48] [Music]
[1:12:49] himself he said Art Thou come to torment
[1:12:52] us before the time
[1:12:55] and there was a good way off from them
[1:12:57] and heard of swine of many swine feeding
[1:13:00] verse
[1:13:06] 30 so the Devils besought him saying if
[1:13:10] thou cast us out suffer us to go away
[1:13:13] into the herd of
[1:13:21] swine in other words they they they
[1:13:24] didn't know what he was going to
[1:13:27] do they just knew what he was capable
[1:13:32] of they knew he had the power to do
[1:13:36] it and they knew when God comes down
[1:13:39] walking in our
[1:13:42] midst that he's come walking for a
[1:13:46] purpose it's not a
[1:13:49] vacation it's not a time of
[1:13:52] rest he's putting footprints on the
[1:13:55] earth for a
[1:13:59] purpose they didn't know what it
[1:14:02] was they just
[1:14:05] knew that if he commanded
[1:14:09] them they had to
[1:14:11] move verse 32 and he said unto them go
[1:14:14] and when they were come
[1:14:17] out and when they went into the herd of
[1:14:20] swine and they went into the herd of
[1:14:22] swine
[1:14:26] and behold a whole herd of swine ran
[1:14:28] violently down a steep Place into the
[1:14:33] sea and perished in the
[1:14:37] waters and they that kept them
[1:14:42] fled and went their ways into the
[1:14:46] City and told everything and what was
[1:14:49] befallen to the possessed of the devils
[1:14:57] the people of the city had long known
[1:14:59] about these two
[1:15:02] men
[1:15:05] and the whole city knew of these two men
[1:15:09] that they were possessed with
[1:15:11] Devils that they couldn't pass by that
[1:15:15] way for those for those men would surely
[1:15:18] do them
[1:15:21] harm because were possessed of demon
[1:15:27] power and the and and and the people who
[1:15:29] were taking care of this herd of
[1:15:36] swne they told them the
[1:15:39] story of what had
[1:15:42] happened and verse
[1:15:45] 34 and after they heard the
[1:15:50] testimony the whole city came out to
[1:15:52] meet
[1:15:56] Jesus everybody wanted to see
[1:16:00] him but they too had a purpose once they
[1:16:03] had heard the
[1:16:06] testimony and when they saw him they
[1:16:09] besought him that he would depart out of
[1:16:13] their
[1:16:21] Coast while healing and Deliverance was
[1:16:25] free while while healing and deliverance
[1:16:28] was
[1:16:31] free that costed them
[1:16:35] nothing they welcomed
[1:16:37] it they welcomed
[1:16:41] it but once there was a a price to
[1:16:46] pay they said we can't have you in our
[1:16:51] city your marri
[1:16:54] Miracle you may have delivered two
[1:16:58] men but you know what you cost our city
[1:17:04] economy you have cost us hundreds of
[1:17:07] thousands of dollars with this
[1:17:13] miracle they were business
[1:17:16] people though they were
[1:17:18] religious but they weren't really
[1:17:20] interested in seeing God do things
[1:17:26] not if there was a price to be
[1:17:29] paid not if there was a life to be
[1:17:33] lived not if there was convictions to
[1:17:36] have in our
[1:17:40] hearts no that's too much religion for
[1:17:42] this city
[1:17:45] here that's too much religion for the
[1:17:47] City of
[1:17:49] Phoenix but yet there's Believers here
[1:17:54] in this city God has a
[1:17:59] bride a many membered
[1:18:01] body the the mystical body of Jesus
[1:18:06] Christ in verse 10 in verse
[1:18:11] n it says and he entered into a ship and
[1:18:14] passed over and came into his own
[1:18:18] City chap Matthew chapter 9
[1:18:21] verse1
[1:18:27] and behold they brought him a man sick
[1:18:29] of the py laying on a bed and Jesus
[1:18:33] seeing their faith said unto the sick of
[1:18:35] the py son be of good cheer thy sins be
[1:18:40] forgiven
[1:18:51] thee
[1:18:54] Jesus the
[1:18:55] Evangelist was about to have a
[1:18:57] ministerial
[1:19:03] change from
[1:19:04] evangelist to
[1:19:07] Prophet verse three and behold certain
[1:19:11] of the scribes said within themselves
[1:19:13] this man
[1:19:20] blasphemeth and Jesus knowing their
[1:19:25] thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in
[1:19:27] your
[1:19:31] hearts for whether is easier to say thy
[1:19:34] sins be forgiven thee or to say arise
[1:19:36] and
[1:19:41] walk Jesus was
[1:19:44] entering Jesus was
[1:19:47] entering to the second pole the second
[1:19:51] phase of his ministry
[1:19:55] the prophetic
[1:19:56] part Discerning the thoughts and in and
[1:19:59] intents of the
[1:20:02] heart just four Jesus knowing their
[1:20:05] thoughts say where say said wherefore
[1:20:08] think he evil in your
[1:20:11] hearts verse
[1:20:13] four of Matthew
[1:20:21] 9
[1:20:24] turn with me to Hebrews chap chapter
[1:20:29] 4 and verse
[1:20:34] 12 Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is
[1:20:38] quick and powerful and sharper than any
[1:20:41] two-edged
[1:20:47] sword piercing even to the dividing of
[1:20:50] suer of Soul and Spirit
[1:20:56] and of the joints and
[1:20:59] Marrow and is a discerner of the
[1:21:01] thoughts and intents of the
[1:21:05] heart that's what the word of God
[1:21:08] is so who was this in Matthew chapter
[1:21:12] n Discerning the hearts of these
[1:21:17] men it was
[1:21:19] Jesus Jesus the word in the beginning
[1:21:22] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:21:26] and the Word was God Jesus is that word
[1:21:29] he's the Living Word in verse four of
[1:21:32] Matthew 9 and Jesus knowing their
[1:21:36] thoughts said wherefore think ye evil in
[1:21:38] your
[1:21:40] hearts he had entered he was now
[1:21:43] entering into the second pole of his
[1:21:47] ministry from evangelist to a
[1:21:50] prophet or whether is he easier to say
[1:21:54] thy sins be forgiven thee or to say
[1:21:56] arise and
[1:22:02] walk they didn't know what to
[1:22:05] say because they they would neither say
[1:22:08] thy sins are
[1:22:14] forgiven neither could they say because
[1:22:16] they didn't have the faith arise and
[1:22:18] walk to
[1:22:21] anyone
[1:22:23] he said but that you might know that the
[1:22:25] son of man ha power on Earth to forgive
[1:22:34] sins you see the son of
[1:22:38] man a prophet
[1:22:40] Ministry had
[1:22:42] begun from
[1:22:44] evangelist entering out to the prophetic
[1:22:49] Ministry going higher all the time
[1:22:55] to draw us closer all the
[1:22:59] time but he would just be drawing closer
[1:23:01] a little
[1:23:05] flock because because as as his ministry
[1:23:08] went
[1:23:10] higher as his ministry went
[1:23:15] deeper the crowds would get
[1:23:21] smaller and smaller and smaller till
[1:23:25] that day on
[1:23:27] Calvary it was as small as it had ever
[1:23:32] been and there was only one man on that
[1:23:35] day on
[1:23:38] Calvary who with his
[1:23:42] mouth stood up for
[1:23:44] him you know who it
[1:23:46] was the thief on the
[1:23:51] cross he was the last
[1:23:54] one he had nothing to
[1:23:57] lose he had everything to
[1:24:00] gain and in him was a seed of
[1:24:06] God and he rebuked the other Thief he
[1:24:10] rebuked the other
[1:24:17] Thief he said he said you ought to be
[1:24:19] ashamed of
[1:24:21] yourself
[1:24:23] you and I are here because we deserve to
[1:24:25] be
[1:24:27] here but this man has done
[1:24:31] nothing he said Lord remember
[1:24:35] me he said this day you'll be with me in
[1:24:49] Paradise verse
[1:24:51] six
[1:24:53] but that you may know that the son of
[1:24:55] man hath power on Earth to forgive sins
[1:24:58] then saith he to the sick of the py
[1:25:00] arise take up thy bed and go into thy
[1:25:13] house and he arose and departed to his
[1:25:17] house but when the multitude saw it they
[1:25:21] marveled
[1:25:24] but this time they glorified
[1:25:28] God remember the disciples in the
[1:25:31] ship it says they
[1:25:34] marveled but it didn't say they
[1:25:36] glorified him at that
[1:25:39] time they just marveled that he could
[1:25:42] speak to the storm and the storm would
[1:25:46] obey but the multitude when they saw
[1:25:50] this they said they Marvel and glorified
[1:25:55] God which had given such power unto
[1:26:00] men and as Jesus passed from forth from
[1:26:04] thence he saw a
[1:26:07] man verse nine of
[1:26:11] Matthew named
[1:26:14] Matthew at the second poll of his
[1:26:17] ministry Jesus begins to set the church
[1:26:20] in order
[1:26:21] now
[1:26:23] this happened at the first
[1:26:27] coming but I'll also tell you this
[1:26:29] happened at the second
[1:26:33] coming that at the second poll of the
[1:26:36] ministry of a of a god-sent
[1:26:41] prophet the prophetic Ministry began
[1:26:44] setting the church in
[1:26:51] order
[1:26:53] not as an
[1:26:54] evangelist but as a prophet now just as
[1:26:58] it happened at the first
[1:27:03] coming and as he says sitting and as
[1:27:07] Jesus passed from then he saw a man
[1:27:09] named Matthew sitting at the re seat of
[1:27:11] custom and he saith unto him follow me
[1:27:14] and he arose and followed
[1:27:17] [Music]
[1:27:21] him
[1:27:28] he was beginning to set the church in
[1:27:32] order a new testament
[1:27:35] church he was going to establish a new
[1:27:39] ministry the old priesthood would be
[1:27:49] annuled and God would raise up a new
[1:27:51] ministry
[1:27:54] it would be a fful
[1:27:57] Ministry but the restoration of
[1:28:01] God began with the apostolic
[1:28:05] Ministry of
[1:28:08] Apostles the rest would follow
[1:28:12] later and it came to pass as Jesus said
[1:28:14] at meet in the house Matthew 10 not
[1:28:17] verse Matthew 9:10 it came to pass that
[1:28:20] Jesus sat at meat in the house behold
[1:28:22] many publicans and sinners came and sat
[1:28:26] down with him and his
[1:28:38] disciples and when the Pharisees saw it
[1:28:40] they said un to his disciples why eateth
[1:28:43] your master with publicans and
[1:28:51] sinners
[1:28:53] in other
[1:28:55] words we would never do what he's
[1:28:59] doing we would never preach the way he
[1:29:06] preaches and when Jesus heard
[1:29:10] that he said unto them they that behold
[1:29:14] need not a physician but they that are
[1:29:20] sick always speaking in
[1:29:24] Parables and in the
[1:29:26] parable lay a
[1:29:30] mystery in the parable lay a
[1:29:34] prophecy in the parable lay lay a new
[1:29:38] testament
[1:29:44] admonition verse 13 but go ye and learn
[1:29:47] what that
[1:29:49] meanthe and not sacrifice for I am not
[1:29:53] come to call the righteous but Sinners
[1:29:55] to
[1:30:06] repentance they never did understand it
[1:30:09] because it was going to require a
[1:30:13] revelation from the Holy Spirit himself
[1:30:15] to reveal these
[1:30:19] Parables then came to him the Disciples
[1:30:21] of
[1:30:24] John the men that were following the
[1:30:26] Elijah
[1:30:29] Ministry
[1:30:30] elas saying why why do we and the
[1:30:33] Pharisees fast off but thy disciples
[1:30:37] fast
[1:30:44] not why don't you do it the way we do
[1:30:48] it because that's the way we've done it
[1:30:50] for hundreds of years
[1:30:53] years why are you doing it so
[1:30:57] differently because something very
[1:30:59] different was happening upon the face of
[1:31:01] the
[1:31:04] Earth the old Covenant would be un
[1:31:09] olded the old priesthood would be
[1:31:13] aned the old ways were going to be
[1:31:18] unowned the way they raised their kids
[1:31:20] was going to be changed
[1:31:25] the way they treated their wives was
[1:31:26] going to be
[1:31:29] different it was now going to be better
[1:31:32] and greater and more righteousness and
[1:31:34] in
[1:31:38] Holiness because under the law they
[1:31:40] didn't have any of
[1:31:43] that Jesus said in verse
[1:31:47] 15 can the children of the Bride chamber
[1:31:51] mourn as long as the bridegroom is with
[1:32:00] him but the days will come when the
[1:32:02] bridegroom shall be taken from
[1:32:07] them and then shall they
[1:32:11] fast verse
[1:32:13] 15 is a
[1:32:16] prophecy in a
[1:32:18] parable concerning
[1:32:20] Israel the Jewish
[1:32:23] people you
[1:32:24] see Jehovah
[1:32:29] God came down in
[1:32:31] flesh and he first
[1:32:36] offered to
[1:32:38] Israel to be
[1:32:40] wife to be his
[1:32:43] bride and Israel
[1:32:46] rejected Jesus said unto them can the
[1:32:49] children of the Bride chamber mourn as
[1:32:51] long long as the bridegroom is with
[1:32:58] them what he was saying
[1:33:01] is when a woman becomes a
[1:33:08] bride and and the bride under this
[1:33:11] Jewish
[1:33:12] [Music]
[1:33:14] culture she was the wife
[1:33:18] already but the bride was a wife
[1:33:22] [Music]
[1:33:24] adorning
[1:33:26] herself and preparing her her her
[1:33:28] wedding
[1:33:31] dress for that wedding
[1:33:34] day when the husband would
[1:33:37] come they would unite together and he
[1:33:40] would carry her
[1:33:42] away to live
[1:33:45] together
[1:33:47] eternally with your heavenly
[1:33:50] bridegroom no celes no Cel and Jesus
[1:33:55] said unto him can the children of the
[1:33:56] Bride chamber mourn as long as the
[1:33:59] bridegroom is with
[1:34:06] them no she she will not
[1:34:09] mourn because for the
[1:34:11] bride it's a Time who is who is the
[1:34:15] wife is a time of adorning and
[1:34:20] preparation
[1:34:22] and thinking of that
[1:34:24] day he's he promised
[1:34:27] me to be his wife I am his wife and he
[1:34:32] said on such and such a
[1:34:34] time and such a day he's coming back to
[1:34:38] take me
[1:34:42] away so can the can the bride chamber
[1:34:46] mourn it's not a time of
[1:34:50] mourning as as long as the bridegroom is
[1:34:52] with
[1:34:56] him but the days will
[1:35:01] come when the bridegroom shall be taken
[1:35:04] from
[1:35:05] them on the cross of
[1:35:08] Calvary and they'll have them no
[1:35:11] more then shall they
[1:35:14] fast they'll
[1:35:17] fast throughout seven Church
[1:35:20] ages
[1:35:22] they'll they'll
[1:35:23] fast through the Dark
[1:35:27] Ages they'll fast for 2,000
[1:35:33] years and be scattered the world
[1:35:38] over this Jewish
[1:35:41] people when one
[1:35:43] time God offered to offered
[1:35:47] them to be
[1:35:49] bride and they rejected
[1:35:52] that's why you and I are the bride
[1:35:55] today because what they
[1:35:58] rejected was given to
[1:36:01] us to be the bride of Christ so what are
[1:36:05] we as the
[1:36:07] bride what are we as the
[1:36:14] bride we are the
[1:36:17] wife we are already his
[1:36:20] wife
[1:36:22] because the bride is just his
[1:36:27] wife the bride is his
[1:36:31] wife
[1:36:32] preparing for her catching
[1:36:36] away
[1:36:37] preparing change after change after
[1:36:41] change adorning
[1:36:43] herself with the character of Jesus
[1:36:46] Christ adorning herself with a born
[1:36:49] again
[1:36:50] experience
[1:36:52] adorning herself with the baptism of the
[1:36:54] Holy
[1:36:55] Ghost adorning herself with refilling
[1:36:58] after
[1:37:00] refilling adorning herself and all of
[1:37:04] these
[1:37:05] adorning makes up her wedding
[1:37:09] dress and when her bride is fully
[1:37:11] dressed in the
[1:37:14] word the groom who has made her a
[1:37:20] promise I shall
[1:37:22] return and I'll catch you
[1:37:27] away the wedding
[1:37:30] day is the catching
[1:37:33] away when the
[1:37:35] bridegroom is now
[1:37:38] husband and the bride is now
[1:37:42] wife and he
[1:37:44] descends Catches Us
[1:37:46] away he takes us to live with him
[1:37:50] eternally
[1:37:55] then Jesus
[1:37:57] says because they didn't understand it
[1:38:00] they didn't get it they they didn't get
[1:38:02] the revelation of these
[1:38:04] Parables so he continues in another
[1:38:08] Parable he said if you didn't understand
[1:38:12] that let me say the same thing this
[1:38:16] way no man putteth a piece of new cloth
[1:38:19] into an old garment
[1:38:28] for that which is put in to fill it up
[1:38:30] taketh from the
[1:38:35] Garment and the rent is made
[1:38:40] worse in other words this Old
[1:38:45] Testament these Ten
[1:38:47] Commandments all of these Proverbs on
[1:38:50] how you should conduct yourself in the
[1:38:52] Book of
[1:38:53] Leviticus
[1:38:57] Deuteronomy I'm going to add nothing to
[1:39:02] it I'm not going to put a a a a new
[1:39:05] piece of cloth on an old
[1:39:09] garment no it's just going to make
[1:39:11] everything
[1:39:15] worse I'm going to make you new
[1:39:19] again you're going to be a new creature
[1:39:21] in Christ
[1:39:25] Jesus no longer the Old
[1:39:29] Testament no longer Ten
[1:39:32] Commandments but with a revelation we'll
[1:39:35] take one of
[1:39:38] them Thou shalt love the Lord thy God
[1:39:41] with all thy heart and all thy
[1:39:45] soul and the
[1:39:47] next love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:39:52] and Jesus said on these two
[1:39:54] Commandments I hang all the
[1:39:58] law and give you a new
[1:40:04] covenant then he
[1:40:07] said he says you didn't catch that did
[1:40:10] you let me give you another
[1:40:13] Parable verse 17 he says neither do men
[1:40:17] put new wine into Old
[1:40:19] bottles
[1:40:22] else the bottles break and the and the
[1:40:26] wine run out and the bottles
[1:40:30] perish but they put new
[1:40:33] wine into new
[1:40:35] bottles and both are
[1:40:39] preserved here the English put down
[1:40:44] bottles but in the original Greek in
[1:40:48] Hebrew it wasn't a bottle
[1:40:52] what they used were animal
[1:40:57] skins it was
[1:41:01] skins and an old
[1:41:04] skin would get old and
[1:41:07] hard and
[1:41:08] crack so they have to discard it at some
[1:41:13] time they understood this
[1:41:17] concept but they thought it was just
[1:41:19] something natural
[1:41:23] no neither do men put new wine into Old
[1:41:33] skins else these old skins will
[1:41:39] break and the wine runneth out and the
[1:41:43] and the Skins
[1:41:45] perish but they put new
[1:41:48] wine into new bottles and both are
[1:41:54] preserved God was going to bring
[1:41:59] Revelation but he couldn't put
[1:42:05] Revelation in a man under the
[1:42:09] law it had to be a man or a woman who'd
[1:42:12] been born
[1:42:15] again that that that the soul was now a
[1:42:18] living
[1:42:19] soul
[1:42:22] because now you had broken out of your
[1:42:27] Amnesia now you've been born
[1:42:30] again now God is going to fill you with
[1:42:34] a new wine of
[1:42:40] Revelation you said but this skin of
[1:42:42] Flesh this is this is the old
[1:42:49] skin won't it Bur verse
[1:42:52] fourth it will that's the whole purpose
[1:42:56] of God
[1:42:58] now because he's provided for you a new
[1:43:03] body and the
[1:43:05] revelation will cause this whole flesh
[1:43:08] to fall
[1:43:10] away and be changed in a moment in the
[1:43:13] twinkling of an
[1:43:15] eye if this Earthly
[1:43:19] body
[1:43:21] Fall Away Paul said he has one already
[1:43:25] waiting for
[1:43:27] us and it's the
[1:43:30] Revelation that'll break away this Old
[1:43:35] Shell and it's already preparing for you
[1:43:38] a new
[1:43:40] body a new skin that that's that's
[1:43:45] what's holding the Revelation
[1:43:48] today it's your the offer
[1:43:52] growing within
[1:43:54] you a prophet of God
[1:43:57] said one day you'll
[1:44:00] realize that that
[1:44:03] Soul was your
[1:44:06] theophany is your
[1:44:08] theop how can it
[1:44:10] be because that soul is the
[1:44:14] seed and in that seed is everything you
[1:44:19] need not only the very nature of
[1:44:24] God but a new
[1:44:28] body already being
[1:44:32] formed you get a
[1:44:34] seed an app an apple
[1:44:37] seed and you plant
[1:44:41] it your son might
[1:44:44] say Dad you put a little seed in the
[1:44:49] ground
[1:44:52] where will the tree come
[1:44:55] from from the seeds
[1:44:58] H what about the leaves where are the
[1:45:02] leaves they're in the
[1:45:04] seeds what about the
[1:45:08] branches they're in the seed
[1:45:11] too are you going to tell me the fruits
[1:45:14] and the seed already
[1:45:18] also it's all there
[1:45:21] when God sees the
[1:45:23] seed he sees a man he sees a woman he
[1:45:28] sees a son he sees a
[1:45:31] daughter already standing in His
[1:45:35] image statures of a perfect man Christ
[1:45:41] Jesus Verse
[1:45:43] 18 while he spake these things unto them
[1:45:46] these
[1:45:49] parables
[1:45:51] behold there came a certain
[1:45:55] ruler and the first thing he
[1:45:58] did is he worshiped
[1:46:03] him then he
[1:46:06] said after he had worshiped
[1:46:09] him see how important worship is before
[1:46:12] the word
[1:46:17] comes then he said you know what my
[1:46:21] daughter is even now
[1:46:27] dead but come and lay thy hand upon her
[1:46:31] and she shall
[1:46:35] live and Jesus arose and followed
[1:46:40] him and so did his
[1:46:44] disciples so as they're
[1:46:47] going focused following this man
[1:46:52] going to go to his
[1:46:53] house they know that little girl's
[1:46:55] already

[1:47:16] Hem of His
[1:47:19] Garment touch Touch the Hem of His
[1:47:22] Garment not his hand not his foot Touch
[1:47:27] the Hem of His
[1:47:29] Garment for she said within
[1:47:32] herself this is why she did
[1:47:36] it this was her
[1:47:39] hope this was her faith if I may but
[1:47:43] touch His Garment I shall be
[1:47:48] whole I'll give you a little
[1:47:52] testimony very
[1:47:53] simple years ago we were in South
[1:47:57] Africa AFA and uh the pastor a very fine
[1:48:01] man going on to be with the Lord going
[1:48:04] on to be with the
[1:48:06] Lord our brother Gideon
[1:48:10] r r he had told me brother
[1:48:14] Daniel take a few extra
[1:48:18] days because when when you're done
[1:48:21] ministering and
[1:48:24] preaching I want to take you to Krueger
[1:48:27] National Park he
[1:48:28] said krer National Park it's a 3 million
[1:48:32] acre
[1:48:36] Reserve where no hunting is
[1:48:41] allowed and all the big five animals and
[1:48:44] all the African animals run wild in this
[1:48:49] Reserve
[1:48:53] and they've created roads through all
[1:48:55] this through through all of this
[1:48:58] jungle and you can
[1:49:00] drive and once you go through the main
[1:49:05] gates they tell you don't get off your
[1:49:07] cars for any
[1:49:11] reason because many people have been
[1:49:14] eaten by
[1:49:17] lions
[1:49:19] leopards killed by
[1:49:22] elephants this is a wild
[1:49:27] country African animals run wild
[1:49:32] here so as we go
[1:49:35] driving there passes of hyenas and
[1:49:38] circle around the
[1:49:42] car we keep driving
[1:49:44] more we're surrounded by baboons look
[1:49:47] like a hundred of
[1:49:49] them
[1:49:53] [Music]
[1:49:55] baboon the male baboon was almost as big
[1:49:57] as brother
[1:50:01] Leo and they're three and four and five
[1:50:04] times stronger than a
[1:50:07] man we'd pass by little
[1:50:12] ponds and and and alligators would come
[1:50:15] out of the
[1:50:18] water then we would go through another
[1:50:20] one and a hippopotamus came
[1:50:24] out a big
[1:50:26] male opened up his Jaws big and wide
[1:50:29] because we had gotten too

[1:50:56] lion behind the car they open the
[1:50:59] windows and a lion has reached in and
[1:51:01] grabbed them and pulled them
[1:51:05] out I said I'm not doing
[1:51:09] that the we had seen every animal you
[1:51:13] could

[1:51:40] little
[1:51:44] Rhino so the trip went
[1:51:48] on we never saw r
[1:51:52] big or
[1:51:53] small and the brother just kids with
[1:51:58] me he says where's your faith for a big
[1:52:05] Rhino I said no no it say my faith is
[1:52:07] just in a little one I
[1:52:11] said so later that day we pulled into
[1:52:14] this
[1:52:18] reserve a private private
[1:52:21] reserve called
[1:52:26] mahaha and and there was a brother who
[1:52:29] was the who was the chief manager of
[1:52:31] this
[1:52:36] reserve and he says brother
[1:52:39] Daniel I'd like to take you behind the
[1:52:45] scenes where no visitor
[1:52:48] goes and he takes us into this enclosed
[1:52:52] all fenced
[1:52:56] area we walk into
[1:52:59] it and then he says on the other side
[1:53:02] he's about 100 feet away you see those
[1:53:07] Gates he says we're going to let a rhino
[1:53:10] come out of

[1:53:52] him and I tell brother
[1:53:55] Gideon you see brother
[1:53:58] Gideon there's my baby
[1:54:01] rhino seeing and touching is
[1:54:06] believing and this woman in verse
[1:54:09] 21 for she had said within
[1:54:13] herself if I may but touch His Garment I
[1:54:17] shall be
[1:54:18] whole but Jesus turned about
[1:54:22] him verse
[1:54:26] 22 and when he saw her he said daughter
[1:54:29] be of good
[1:54:30] Comfort thy faith ha made thee
[1:54:34] well and the woman was made whole from
[1:54:36] that
[1:54:38] hour she had said within
[1:54:41] herself she hadn't told
[1:54:44] nobody if I can just touch His Garment
[1:54:47] I'll
[1:54:48] behold
[1:54:50] Jesus turned to
[1:54:52] her he said that was
[1:54:54] Faith that's what did it for you your
[1:54:58] faith has made you
[1:55:00] whole and when Jesus came into the
[1:55:02] ruler's
[1:55:04] house verse
[1:55:08] 23 and saw the minstrels and the people
[1:55:11] making a
[1:55:14] noise this is Jesus in his second
[1:55:18] pool this is Jesus the prophet
[1:55:23] now verse
[1:55:25] 24 and he said unto them give Place
[1:55:28] verse 24 for the maid is not dead but
[1:55:35] sleepeth and they laughed him to
[1:55:40] scorn but but when the people were put
[1:55:48] forth

[1:55:54] outside you see the second
[1:55:57] pool it was getting

[1:56:30] put forth he went in and took her by the
[1:56:37] hand and the maid

[1:57:46] tonight we're letting our fingers do the
[1:57:48] walking
[1:57:52] Through the Bible
[1:57:55] Pages oh and the things that God has
[1:58:00] there I've read it over and over since I
[1:58:03] was a
[1:58:06] boy I I I didn't understand
[1:58:09] it but now God is opening the eyes of
[1:58:12] our
[1:58:15] understanding I never knew he was
[1:58:17] speaking in parables
[1:58:20] I always tried to take it figure it out
[1:58:25] literally I I I even took an old cloth
[1:58:28] one time and sewed a piece of good cloth
[1:58:30] on
[1:58:33] it I even took an old
[1:58:36] cloth and and and put on a piece of new
[1:58:39] cloth to
[1:58:43] it then you pull it
[1:58:46] apart and I thought okay I guess that's
[1:58:48] what he meant
[1:58:51] okay oh because it was just taking it
[1:58:55] natural it was just taking it
[1:58:58] lital but it was so much
[1:59:01] deeper it turned out I was the old cloth
[1:59:04] that he was making
[1:59:07] you it turned out I was the old skin
[1:59:10] that was going to be made a new
[1:59:14] skin it was a
[1:59:16] parable it was a prophecy it was thus
[1:59:20] saith the Lord it was the second pole of
