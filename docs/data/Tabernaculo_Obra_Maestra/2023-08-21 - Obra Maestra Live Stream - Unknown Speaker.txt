Precious faces so make everybody Welcome this morning want to especially make welcome my cousin this morning Reuben Ferreira oh may God Comfort his heart and that's why we come to God's house we're just looking for one more touch foreign we had coming in September it was I think it was the ninth and the 10th uh our brother Rafael Cabello from uh from Congo Africa the Africa Del Congo but they had a sudden death in their family I believe it was uh his wife sister God live it was her her brother and uh he he didn't die he didn't die a natural death and so it kind of took them all by surprise he was her brother was a general in the Congolese Army so he held a high ranking position so it was a bit of a shock not only for the family it was a bit of a shocking joke not just for the family but uh for the government there in Congo so they they had to leave and go back to Congo and Lord willing sometime in the future you'll be able to be back here um this this next week here is Mr Karen leave Thursday through some dedicational services [Music] in Albuquerque New Mexico so they're having a Friday service Friday night Saturday morning and evening they leave Sunday morning and evening everybody and uh to we are we we will be ministering the Saturday night and Sunday services and Friday Saturday morning there's a couple of other brothers ministers it'll be Ministries and we look forward to be able to sit down in the benches there and listen also I'd like to think I'm still a teachable students but I do enjoy sitting down and hearing the word preached when we have that opportunity and we've been ministering on a on a subject the white horse riders in the Days of Elijah and the pale horse riders in the days of our lives and we come to find out it was a profit to see in the Book of Revelations the white horse rider Blanco is spoken of in the first seals and the pale horse riders was actually was also the last writer for there was only four Riders and we realize it's just one great big Plan of Salvation this uh this new testamento so we're coming to to realize also that this new testamento is is the Lamb's Book of Life because the lamb was the is the savior of the whole world he's the Savior it gives salvation to all and it was the lamb who opened this great Plan of Salvation plan and we realized the plan that he opened is this new testament book it says formado and I came into this world speaking lies so he realized David realized that he needed a change but that's the old nature of the curse and the curse that falls on every human being is that we're born through a sexual relationships that was that was given down to the human race called the serpent in the garden so how can we escape it if we're born in this flesh bodies the DNA the characteristics of the serpents characteristics but Jesus gave us an answer he says it's easy he says you simply must be born again that's the answer is so this morning continuing on this same subject because because the ride of these horse riders and the presence of the four living creatures underneath those two Ministries the ministry of Christ and the ministry of Lucifer Lucifer is a great Plan of Salvation and the rider of these horses is trying to keep as many people as possible from surrendering their lives to Jesus Christ and experiencing this born-again experience but there is a plan that I plan there is a planet and and God has unfolded that plan he had it written in a book it was in the Old Testament but it was in types and shadows and then he wrote it in a new testamento to make the types and shadows clearly and yet he said it first in Parables but in this plan he promised the second coming of Christ he would make this Plan of Salvation he would give us not only the understanding but he would give us the personal experience so we could really understand the value of this quickening power to give us an overcoming life through Jesus Christ it would turn in our Bible to Revelations Revelations 5. is this story of Salvation with just mentioning the major parts for us but but throughout the Bible at the prophets of old the disciples the men like the Apostle Paul they added more details to this plan as a matter of fact the new the Bible itself fills the gaps here in Revelations because Revelations it begins in Genesis and where it comes to an end is for a gentile bride is raptured where it comes to an end that's where the prophecy that Paul spoke to us is it the dead in Christ shall rise first and we were sure alive and remains so so this this is a brief summary is and the New Testament adds details between the lines so when we're reading when you when you've heard the term you have to learn to read between the lines that doesn't mean we're putting something into the Bible that isn't there that means you're taking all the scriptures from the Old and New Testaments and you're finding their place between these verses it's called Revelations it's called having an ear to hear it's called like Paul said may God Open the Eyes of our understanding yes so Revelations 5 1. we've shared it with you before so and today this morning once again by remembrance we'll bring it all back again Revelations 5 1-9 that's a date back in Eden [Music] and it goes beyond 2023.3 that goes beyond December that's coming up these nine verses and the rest of the details between the verses from Genesis to the last book in the Bible revelations and I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with Seven Seals Heavenly Father Celestial you alone can open the book you're the revealer of your own words go from heart to heart and Open the Eyes of our understanding amen you may be seated Revelations 5 1 . and I saw on the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals counting from the birth of Christ that day in Genesis chapter 3 and verse 21. where the father is dressing Adam and Eve [Music] in Lamb skins Revelations 5 1. begins about 4000 BCS that's that day in Genesis God was dressing Adam and Eve because they had chosen something to cover their themselves the Bible said it was fig leaves covering just the most personal Parts but God who's a god of Holiness he says I won't have my children dressing that way in public and he created the Bible says he created skins and he covered them completely because God from the beginning in Genesis was a god of Holiness and he wants his children to live in Holiness Revelation 5 1. begins about 4 000 BC comments this is John having a vision and see him all the way back to Genesis a vision of that day in Eden unavision when Adam and Eve were put out of the presence and as you know when you read the last chapter of Revelation that was in the hands of Adam and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof is what's happening here this is the ministry of the Lion of the tribe of Jews and this ministry of the line of the tribe of Judas was all the way from the beginning and would be with Israel for four thousand years but there would be a change when Israel would no longer take the kingship it says and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice there were seven seals on this book it was all it was it was all in types and shadows it's not it's not literal though it's written and it sounds like it's something literal foreign Revelations 5 2 says and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who's worthy to open the book and to loose the seals thereof is foreign a pale horse rider is given a name he's always been there so the pale horse rider sweeps through Egypt and everything that isn't under the blood of the Lambs all the first born women the angels of the Covenant a strong Angel Fuerte now leads them out of bondage and Israel has entered into a journey but this journey is not a journey just to get from point A to point Bunch this journey isn't just to leave Egypt and get into a Promised Land Journey it's a character building process this journey it's Jerusalem or Bust it is over and over again the children of Israel but remember you're recording it was a character building process and there was an entire generation of those that had come out of Egypt who would not accept change they brought all the Pagan ways of those old denominations with them could it be happening again today but the angel of the Covenant was looking for a worthy one how long was he looking for brother Daniel from Genesis until the first coming of Christ Angel The Covenant was looking for a worthy one for four thousand years one who could open the book that Adam lost that God had written and loose the seven Parts the Seven Seals Revelations because God had changed forms from God on the throne Miranda no we have just fast forwarded in this Vision to another time zone here to this next verse it's about 60 years after the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ and that this Mighty Angel said that no man has been found worthy then the Bible says in verse 4. John says I cried like I've never cried before John was already a man about 80 90 years old he said he said have I labored all my life preaching the gospel that Jesus taught me in Tennessee house have I done it in vain because no man is to open and to read the book not even to look Revelations 5 4. is John imprisoned on the idol of Patmos and the year is about 90 A.D yeah you could say brother Daniel you're putting gears on this is no man knoweth the date or the time not the future but modern events that have passed already in our history have been made clear to us and the things that have happened and put our finger on a day and say this day yes So Not only was this strong Angel leading Israel out of Egypt he was also simultaneously looking for a man who is worthy foreign for you and me and this Mighty Angel yes proclaims I've been looking for four thousand years and found no man who was this Mighty Angel it was almighty God which was changing forms and looking for a kinsman redeemer and loose the seven parts that we might be cleansed and washed now to open the book and to lose the Seven Seals it's not two separate things no it sounds that way but even though it uses the word book in the English it was really a scroll for at the time of the writings they didn't have books as we have them today they didn't have a book like this that would that would open up everything was written it might have been an animal skin of some kind they would write messages in it then they would take they would seal that scroll up they might take another piece of leather and tie around it if I was Kings of the earth they would take and and put wax all over that leather leather string then they would take their rings and press it into the wax and it was death for anybody to open that scroll unless you were the one the message was foreign to get to to open it up to see what's written within there was a process to get [Music] of Jesus Christ continue [Music] but when no one was found worthy to open the book and God in the form of the Angel of the covenants he testified he said I've been looking since Adam and Eve all the way to this time that is the curse on Mankind and that's why we must be born again for that for that curse to be washed away for that curse will lose its control over our mortal bonds Psalms chapter 8 verses five through nine and it reads like this for thou has made him a little lower than the angels and has crowned him with Glory and Honor now matters him to have dominion over the works of thy hands thou has put all things under his feet all sheep and oxen and the Beast of the field yes and whatsoever passes through the paths of the scene oh Lord how excellent is thy name in all the Earth do you see it here and within the words of the Old Testament Jesus Christ now inherits all dominions so the first Adam lost where did we hear these words God spoke them to Adam and Genesis [Music] no no Hebrews and verse 9. Hebrews 2. [Music] who was this but we see Jesus Jesus Remember verse 5 of Psalms but thou has made him a little lower than the Angels it didn't mention the name of Jesus but now we're going to read between the lines and between verse 5 and 6 of the Psalms we're going to place Hebrews 2 9. now we're reading between the lines and Paul says but we see Jesus who was made a little lower than the angels He by the grace of God for every man that means from the time we're born we're on death row from the time but by the grace of God foreign [Music] and one of the elders said unto me weep not no yores Behold The Lion of the tribe of Jesus was written a plan of God this book was called the Lamb's Book of Life and then it was seven parts of how we would be restored how he would bring Salvation to all his children salvation to the wheat seed salvation but judgment to the seed of the serpente and one of the elders verse five and five and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David have prevailed to open the book and loose the Seven Seals around he salvation to that great denomination and when Israel rejected then this great Plan of Redemption the seven seal books this book with seven parts from the days of Jesus to the day we're living now seven parts so the first time the book was opened the Lamb's Book it was open to Israel to the Jewish people to them alone but when they rejected it once again the word of God says my word shall not return unto me voice everything that I wanted to fulfill in your life because you realize the Lamb's Book of Life is a book written to individuals it's a book written is the revelation of this Bible wasn't given to any denomination it's given to individuals who will be born again and the born-again children of God [Music] to them it gives Revelation Jesus told Nicodemus unless you be born again you cannot see this Plan of Salvation you cannot see it is and one of the elders saith unto me verse 5. we've not behold the line of the tribe of Judah ese had prevailed to open the book that's true and to lose the Seven Seals verse five and five verse 5 of Revelations the year in this verse is about 30 A.D is Jesus begins his ministry at 30 years of age as the lion of the tribe of Jesus as king of the Jews and the lion first takes the Lion's Share Israel Israel the Fig Tree the Jewish people and he's opening the book and he's losing the seals to Israel yes but Israel rejected will be given to a gentile church at the cross of Calvary Revelations what Israel rejected would be given to a gentile church and the Old Testament shared that many times held the the allegory to the the shadow La Sombra that this would come to pass in the life of Joseph in the life of Jacob and Joseph's two sons go back and read it in the Old Testament the story very clear in your mind because there was a prophetic Shadow what would happen thousands of years later when Jesus would come when Israel would rejected the seven part is to restore them again where they were going to be scattered esparcidos for his father the old patriarch Jacob would give them the patriarchal blessings Jacob being a prophet and Joseph also Jose tambien brings his two sons now the custom was that the Elder son would be put at Jacob's right hand and the youngest son at his left then Jacob was to pray for the two boys but the eldest son would get the Lion's Share of all the wealth of the father and the youngest one he would just ask a blessing the Elvis would get everything your dad has one million dollars that's yours son your dad has 1 000 head of cattle you're the firstborn that's yours son if your dad has ten thousand acres of land that's yours the son the Elder son goes thank you I like it me gusta and then to the younger son he would say younger son your dad loves you and uh he knows you're a smart intelligent young man and you'll make it out in life and uh good luck that was it so Joseph lines up his two boys remember these two boys represents the eldest boys represents the Church of Israel the Jews the youngest boys represents a younger Church because his father Jacob is blind he don't know who is who Joseph knows that so no worries I got this taken care of they're here go ahead yes and as Joseph goes to pray for them [Music] Jacob goes to pray he crosses his hands and he gives the Lion's Share to the younger boys this was custom and rituals do you realize what Jacob did was binding that Joseph would have to live by this that the two boys would have to go with this plan old patriarch was doing and Joseph said Dad don't do it I've already put the elders at your right hand Jacob said no Joseph don't you get it Hallelujah [Music] so Revelations the years 30 ads Jesus begins his ministry Stadium at 30 years of age as the lion of the tribe of Jews King of the Jews and the lion is taking the Lion's Share which is Israel because it's Israel the fig tree and is opening the book and loosen the seals to Israel Israel and what Israel rejected it will be given to a gentile Church because though Jesus was the line of the tribe of Jews he changed Ministries when Jesus walked into the Garden of Gethsemane to pray for one hour he walked in King of the Jews he was now the Lamb of God the Savior Salvador changed but the plan hadn't changed that was a plan in the mind of God since the foundation of the world Revelations 5 6. and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne represents the prophetic Ministries that God rose up in every age and it says the seven eyes which are the seven spirits in other words the Holy Spirit working in every messenger and every age Revelations 5 6. is about three and a half years later from Revelations three and a half year difference watch how God wrote his book from verse it is over 2500 years and all the details of that lays in the Old Testament then from the angel of the Covenant to the days of Jesus is about another 2 000 years then from the days of the ministry of Jesus is the line of the tribe of Jews enters into the lamb Ministry it's only about three and a half years later verse 5 and 5 verse 5 of Revelations 5. the beginning of the Ministries verse six Mexico says this is Ministry finishing up is the Lamb of God and he's going soon to die on the cross cross of calves to give his life foreign God has accepted the life of Jesus Jesus and his death is he was only thinking about you so I mean this is in his mind was a plan he spoke his plan was the spoken word he wrote it in the book that he might reveal it to us later but he doesn't have to write things down to bring it to pass I've given you the example in the Book of Genesis Genesis 1 begins with in the beginning he did but you know when that was written about 1400 years after it was done so God brought this Earth to pass by his Spoken Word by his written word he let you know what happened and some people without Revelations they still don't know what happened living in 2023 but his children because the god that created Heavens through a born-again experience Revelations five and six and I beheld and low in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth now prophecya isn't always future neither is Visions sometimes God allows us to see things that have already passed when John was seeing this Vision Revelations it was about 60 years after the death burial and resurrection of Jesus Christ you understand what that means that means what he was seeing is history it had already happened he was also there when it happened but though he was there okay between what he saw and experience and the vision he was seen he couldn't put them together he had been there in reality he was been given the vision but he thought the vision was something Future No John no one you were living the vision yourself as we are this morning right now in your life we can see ourselves repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive yes or Can someone say that's me it's right now it's all that means I am a manifestation of that spoken word so Revelations five and five Revelations five and six it's three and a half years later after Revelation is Jesus is now in the Garden of Gethsemane to pray for one hour he entered the garden as king of the Jews and in one hour he came out the Lamb of God it was God in morphine it's a Greek word it means changing forms but he was not changing forms as before [Music] to a seed that was placed in the womb of a virgin and God created a body to live he was not changing forms but here he was changing Ministries from here is taken to Calvary to crucifixion days he rises the third day as it was spoken in the mouth of the prophets and is amongst his disciples for 40 days Revelations is about the year 33 34. and we now have a symbol yeah with seven horns seven spirits it's a symbol it's a symbol of a sacrifice don't sacrificial a slain lamb before the altar of God they're in that Dimension where God Alone dwells for the symbol of the lamb now lays is where for 4 000 years Lucifer would come into the presence of God and would stand to accuse the sons and dogs he was cast down never again to enter the Before the Throne of God never again to bring accusations about URI before the father and in that spot where the devil once stood now lays the Lamb of God a healing bomb um perfection [Music] and the year was about 35 A.D foreign Israel Revelations 5 7. reads like this and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne Revelations 5 7. I'm going to dare to say is the year 1963. between verse 6 and 7. it's over 1900 years we're now in the 20th century he took the book it's now February the 28th 1963. in a mountain called Sunset that's where it was opened not the first time not that it was closed in between either but what was open in this 20th century it's our understanding of this divine plan that got lost for for about over 1500 years you realize from the days of the crucifixion that the New Testament didn't even get written for 50 or 60 years later and it didn't stay in the hands of God's children very long because then there began to rise up Constantine a pagan Roman Emperor um who wanted to merge Pagan Rome with this new release and make it work better for him and it finally came to be the Roman the Roman Catholic Church took away the writings they took away this new testament writings Peter and John de Pablo John had given his life to put together this new testimony this Lamb's Book of Life is [Music] when Rome became a powerful Church they gave them creeds they gave him one little verse and said it means this is and for 1500 years God's children had no books throughout those Dark Ages when they were being fed to the Lions when they were being sawn in half when they were being killed is how did they make it they were born again they received the baptism of the Holy ghosts because being born again and receiving the Holy Ghost doesn't require you to even know how to read it just requires um blessed are the poor and Spirits in Matthew 5. the blessed are they that mourn International for they shall be confident IAL inherit the Kingdom of Heaven it's good to know how to read and write is but as Jesus was preaching here in Matthew 5. and you know it was his teaching on how to get to Perfection blessed are those who learned how to read and write because they will what I don't know I haven't read that in the Bible yet now there is a scripture in Revelations and read the Prophecies of this book but when they didn't have a bookness Peacemaker Pacifica and when your troubles bring great grief to you he said that's okay I don't know how to read Lord you don't have to you just know how to lay down you just have to know how to lay down quietly in my presence here you just have to know how to open the door Revelations 5 and 8. the years 1963. and when he had taken the book The Four beasts this is the Lambos and the 420 Elders fell down before the Lambs having every one of them Harps and golden vials full of Voters which are the prayers of the Saints did you notice Revelation 5 8. repeats again this time it's the lamb who's taken the book the years 1963. lamb is once again opening the book revealing the Seven Seals so between verse seven Ocho verse seven we read verse and he came and took the book even in the right hand of him that sat upon the throne verse 8 says Los Santos so between verse 7 and verse 8. about 17 days passed come on see how this Bible's written between verse close to 2500 years but what what happened in between you have to go back regular I'm sorry reading from Genesis on between verse two and three and four four all the way to verse five another almost 2 000 years Revelations and they sung a new song saying Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals you know who that is essay once the book was opened again in this 20th century and they sang a new song Thou Art Worthy to take the book and to open the seals around the Bride of Jesus Christ they not only see that the lamb has taken the book but they believe is able to open this Plan of Salvation there's seven part plans because that was slain and has redeemed us and people with revelation we believe there's power okay we believe it's wonderful working power milagross and we believe that there isn't anything that God can't do he says and the Bible says then he has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred tongue and people and Nations it's Revelations 5 9. is 2023. yes I know the day is a Sunday and it happens to be 11 48 now in Revelations we are in a bribery someone would say no no no no no brother Daniel there's only seven churches Philadelphia [Music] to a bright age in a message called modern events with patience we have to wait for this for the prophecies that's promised foreign and write it in a book for us he says the author has done this before we wait to see him do it again you look at the calendar to find out the day of year you're living at what age we're living here we're living in the brightness second hand is the blood that was shed for us and sending Daughters of God if you have Revelations are saying Worthy is Jesus Christ not worthy is any man not worthy is the man not worthy is a prophet God has called has called men to these to these Ministries Worthy is the Lamb of God Jesus Christ Our Lord savior Salvador baptized he was lying he's King of Kings indeed has sent us as Paul thought as taught in Ephesians 4. and God didn't make the Apostle Paul didn't make up this fightful ministry he saw these characteristics in the life of Jesus Christ and he said these are the gifts that God has that
