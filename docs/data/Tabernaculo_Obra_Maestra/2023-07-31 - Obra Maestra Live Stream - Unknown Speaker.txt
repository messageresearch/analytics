we worship to to make the atmosphere right correct we worship to to let them know that we're waiting on him to come amongst us we worship adoramos so that he can bless us like when Jesus went he was invited by a Pharisee Jesus and he went to this to this Feast that they were having and the custom was when he arrived at this at this priest home they would have someone to wash the feet of the guests but when he walked intro they had no one to wash his feet and he went into the feast and sat down they hadn't washed his feet they haven't they hadn't refreshed him as all the others so he sat there in the midst of this Feast this party and everyone could see that though he was there he had not been he was not a welcome guest but a woman looking through the fence a woman with a bad reputation but though she had a bad reputation she had the right Revelation and she said it's not right the way they're treating him his testimony the life he lives and the Bible says she snuck in yes and she took a little pan of water [Music] and though she knew everyone would would be looking at her and and laughing at her okay she washed his feet she made him welcome the Bible says she dried his feet with her hair why today oh even if they stood on their head they wouldn't have enough hair to do that she made him welcome she worshiped and she was blessed yeah it was Mary of Magdalene yeah Seven Devils including the non devil so we're happy this morning you'll be worshipers of that same Lord Jesus we want him to know that we're prepared to even fall on our knees and wash his feet if he'll just come and speak to us this morning we want to continue on this theme we've been speaking on it is we're in part three we entitled it the white horse rider in the Days of Elijah and the pale horse rider in the days and you might say well which one is it on the days of Elijah it's both because one is the first coming of Christ and when is the second coming of Christ Our subject who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed so we're going to repeat much this morning we're going to background on the other side and we want to bring it all again to you by way of remembrance and we've placed a few little extra things within within what we've already said yes and we have placed a few things in in many much of what we'll be repeating is just like Malachi 4 5 and 6. it says Elijah would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and then it says of the children to the fathers so it kind of sounds like he's having to undo something he already did or you asked the question well which one are you going to do and once again the answer is both because one is the first coming of Christ the Forerunner to the first coming John the Baptist and the second is but it's a forerunner to the second coming of Christ when we believe God sent in our day siete Saint John 10 verses 1 through 7. yes then Saint John 10 verse 1 barely verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door into the Sheepfold but climeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber is and every time we approach the word we're approaching this door it's the only way we can come in through the reading of the word sure otherwise you're reading the Bible as a thief and a Robert verse 2 but he that enters in by the door is The Shepherd of the sheep to him the Porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calls his own Sheep by name and leadeth them out yes he's calling us all by name this morning that's the way he Reveals His word because he doesn't reveal his word to everyone just to a Chosen Few call the mystical body of Jesus Christ if he's called you he knows your name he knows where you live he knows what you did yesterday he knows where you are this morning and you're here because he wants you to be his worshiper yes and when he verse 4 and when he puteth forth his own sheep he'd goeth before them and when sheep follow him for they know his voice in verse 5 and a stranger they will not follow that's a powerful statement they will not follow um but we'll flee from him this Parable speak Jesus unto them but they understood understood not what things they were which is fake unto them this year this morning we're speaking on Parables out of the Book of Revelations out of the gospels out of the New Testament for it was all written in Parables that they wouldn't understand if you've had a personal experience with Jesus Christ verse 7 then said Jesus is done to them again barely barely I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep ovejas in Jesus name I mean you may be seated we're going to almost start from the beginning again we spoke on Revelations 5. how they were told that Jesus Christ opened this book is this book that we're speaking of this morning and when Jesus opened this book it was in the days of this Earthly Ministry that was the time of the opening of the book and he continued to open the book throughout his Earthly Ministry and in Matthew 24 in a parable just as in just as Isaiah also had prophesied and other scriptures tells us that he loose the Seven Seals what is Seven Seals it's seven parts to one Plan of Redemption and to whom did he open the book of redemption are called a New Testament called a New Covenant to Israel Israel the lion took the Lion's part Israel Israel to whom he opened the Lamb's Book of redemption it was never called the Lion's book of redemption there is no book like that in the Bible it's the Lamb's Book of Life it's a Lamb's Book of redemption but it was the lion who was going to deliver that book that the lamb opened to Israel Israel and that means the redemption's plan when Jesus comes was put in motion it's it was the first coming of Christ but even before he loosed the Seven Seals in a parable for sure in Matthew 24 he identifies in his day foreign [Music] is the vision of the opening of the first Uno of the book of redemption of the Lamb's Book of Life and Matthew 11 verse 1 through 30. is the first seal the first coming of Christ and John is the first Elijah Forerunner of Malachi 4 6. part 1 of redemption has begun so in the days of the Lion of the tribe of Judah and then Jesus Christ Luke 1 verse 13 to 17 Lucas the angel Gabriel who stands in the presence of God he declares that John the Baptist zechariah's son will be this first Elijah out of the book of malachias and in Matthew 11 14 and 15 Jesus affirms Jesus what Gabriel told Zachariah said that John is Elijah which is to come okay for in the mouth of two and three Witnesses let everything be established Jesus what a book of Visions but remember this and and brother Branham also learned early in his ministry that you see a vision come to pass yes to all the components of the vision be present even if it's just the last step um even if the last step is is just a hat being moved um even if the last step is just a hat being moved and I use that example because if you listen to the message of brother Branham in the message wisdom versus Faith he speaks about this because he had a vision when he was a young man I believe it was a young girl or a young woman going to be healed and he saw himself in a certain person's home this is and going into the home and seeing certain people come in out of the home [Music] and then he saw someone move a hat from one spot to another spot and he knew that was the timing to be able to say thus saith the Lord your child is healed and the child was dying suffering so he went to the home and he waited there yes if I remember correctly he waited hours but he got ahead of the vision and he tried to declare the child healed and the hat hadn't been moved and the people say that's okay brother random like they said and he left he said and he felt horrible and God told him you didn't wait for the vision God gave him Grace [Music] and when he went back a certain person walked in the house and he said this is the person and he couldn't tell the person to do it the person had and then they moved into place and that person for whatever reason took that hat and moved it then he declared thus saith the Lord and the healing came immediately in the message wisdom versus Faith he speaks on this and in the message God revealing himself to his people yes it gives more detail about the event with that said let's turn to Revelations chapter 6 verse one and two again says verse 1 and 2. and it speeds like this John seen this vision and he is writing down what he sees and he's writing down what he's hearing is and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the four be sane come and see you Vivian s and I saw him Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer yeah one of the four beasts said come and see it was to be a teaching the lamb must be present the noise of thunder must be there and one of the four beasts saying come and see it was a teaching that he was about to bring to pertaining to that day that day that very day he was ministering this was unfolding it was present tense prophecy happening so there must be one of these four beasts present also it doesn't tell us which one which one of the four beasts was present if you're looking for a Bible answer see you'll find you'll find the answer in the Bible and Revelations 4 gives us the order Revelations 4 reveals which was the first in in Revelations this first Beast so in Revelations 4 7 the answer to the question is and the first Beast was like a lion so the lion of the tribe of Judah would bring the Plan of Redemption to Israel the Fig Tree the Jewish people for this lion is King of the Jews Revelation 6 1 and 2. was the vision of what John thought was a future event when in fact it was present tense and what's happening even as he was seeing the vision and would continue to unfold please for the next 300 years Visions have a life span and Revelations when John saw it it had been unfolding for 4 000 years and today this day yeah it has not expired yet God still has a representation like a lamb slain forever interceding for our sins for our healing foreign [Music] the vision begins to unfold in its reality which was more than 30 years before John saw the vision of this modern event so the first seal was unfolding in Matthew 11. even before it was written in Revelation 6. it must have been wait it must have been uh the Thunder of God for a prophet told us a thunder is the voice of God when a seal opens and Matthew 11 and Matthew was the first still open because the vision said of the first sealed that means that means when John saw the vision it was the opening watch this Jesus in another Parable Jesus it's Saint John 12 and 28. uses the example when he preaches the first seals [Music] go back and hear it but this is what we're focusing on this morning so Jesus in a parable in Saint John 12 and 28 six days before the Passover before and before he's going to be crucified says yes verse 28 says father glorify thy name [Music] saying I have both glorified it and will glorify it again what does that mean S I have both glorified it is the first coming of Christ the first seal opened and we'll glorify it again the second coming of Christ and the seventh seal open so what happened in between the first and the seventh seals the name wasn't glorified the name was lost the Roman Catholic Church pushed the name of Jesus in a back corner Iglesia Romana they raised up the name to pray to the Saints pray to pray to Mary Maria pray to James even pray to Leo if you want but don't pray to Jesus they pushed the name into the Dark Ages they took the book away from the people raise up the name of the Pope the Viper of Christ and when you get baptized do it in titles in the name of the Father the Son the Holy Ghost no they took the name away from the people but Jesus said here when the seventh seal is open I'll glorify that name again I'll give my people the Revelation under the opening of that seventh seals we'll lift up the name of Jesus again will not be ashamed of the names don't be ashamed to this to say this seven seal is open has begun and I mean it is I think John 12 28 29. the people therefore that stood by and heard it said that it thundered that's all they heard but others said no no an angel spake to him it started opening up to somebody someone was getting the Revelation the Thunder of God it was the voice of God answering Sid I guess it was contest ideas Jesus answered and said those of you that said an angel spake no those of you that said an angel spoke you're right and the voice came not because of me for me but for your sakes The Voice came out of me the Thunder of God the voice of God but it was for your sakes you they can say an angel to me I mean the seventh angel except the monkey I heard an angel speak in the days of the voice when the seventh angel when he should begin to speak the mysteries of God will be finished because he'll speak the spoken word in the message the first seal brother Branham says this is now let us find the symbols now let us find the symbols muchos symbols we found out what the thunder means he said that's perfectly yes we know that see so we don't even have to tell you what that is because he says we know that already I was sitting in Florida years ago and I mentioned this quote and we're talking is and I did it purposely of course all at this table we we read the message so we know what a thunder is perfectly we can see that and everybody's quiet no one says a thing and then a brother next to me goes and history tells us about A.D 67 to 69. so long before the Book of Revelations was a written word so long before the Book of Revelations was a written word it was a spoken word and Jesus was unfolding he is and losing the first seal and the Book of Revelations wasn't even written the book is a result of God sharing his mind and thought with us [Music] so now Revelation 6 foreign this is the Lamb's Book of Life and and and Revelation 6 1 says the lamb opened the book the Lamb's Book of Life was opened by the lamb the liberos but the lion said let me first Give It To My People Israel Israel the victory and yet The Lion and the lamb are just ministries of the same person oh how God hides himself from the wise and prudence and reveals it unto born-again Believers is Jesus is teaching here in Matthew 11 1. and we'll read it again once again and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed then to teach and to preach in their cities there is the come and see there is Matthew 11 1. Mateo Mateo San Mateo Saint Matthew 11 and verse 1. this is here he is both The Lion and the lamb and his Thunder is that he is now going to teach them by the spoken word for it had not been written yet oh this is the thunder That Shook the world in that day I was going to create a new generation just like in the beginning he said let there be Southwest let there be light loose and there was yeah and it wasn't even written it was just a spoken word alone so he's now going to do what he did again in Genesis he's going to bring forth the family of God and give them a Plan of Redemption by the spoken word it had not been written yet this is the thunder that John heard in the in Revelation 6 1. what was that Thunder it was the voice of God when this first seal was opening part one to save you to change you to mold you into His Image into the stature of a perfect man Jesus Christ Jesus thank you he's teaching them in Matthew 11. how to recognize their day and their message of Grace no more under the law no must because the lawn the prophets or until John foreign he would say repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the same yes every day and forever oh once you see him in his word you can look every time and you can see him doing the same thing so Jesus Jesus was teaching on Malachi 4 5 and 6. here in Matthew 11 again connecting it with Malachi 3 showing them this day these scriptures were fulfilled that very day he was preaching these scriptures are being fulfilled that and it's and that John is this Elijah that the angel Gabriel declared and that the Lord Of Glory is come and it's him this is all present tense right now the Thunder of God is bringing the word present tense this is happening right now folks this is Revelation 6 1 and 2. and Jesus added more detail Jesus to the opening of the first seal at one time you and I you say yo you thought there was only two verses now in Matthew 11 hours Jesus adds 30 more verses of details of what is happening under the opening of the first seal which is part one of redemption can there is yet so much more by the spoken word represented in scripture by the noise of a thunder boss Revelations and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals John said I saw it I actually saw it I am an eyewitness it happens he really did see a lamb he saw a real lamb somehow with a scroll foreign thought it would be nice and quiet because I've seen the priests pull off seals on on Scrolls and you can't unless you're close you don't hear nothing but this caught my attention he said when the lamb took the seal off of this scroll [Music] you know what it was it turned out uh civil bill it turned out that it was one of the four be sane come and see what is the thunder okay it's the voice of God what was happening in Matthew 11 a teaching had begun come and see that's the first thing that the Jesus that Matthew declares in discussion Jesus was going to go and teach and preach Revelation 6 1. one of the beasts what is a thunder it's the voice of God what was happening in Matthew 11. okay the first one redemption's plan unfolding for the Fig Tree Israel Israel and the bride a gentile Church the mystical body of Jesus Christ you can say in your heart that's me hey so I'm in this message this morning Matthew 11 2. let's read it now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples Hillary told the people I must decrease [Music] so he sent two of his disciples as he's in Lane inherits prison yes John was inherited to prison verse 3 says and said unto him for thou he that should come or do we look foreign Jesus answered and said unto them Go and show John again these things which you do hear and see yes what things that cost us these details that are under the opening of the first seal the details we're going to start reading on because it's the same things that would repeat under the opening of the seventh seals because first seal is his first coming because first seal is his first coming is [Music] and as the seventh seal is his second coming now watch the pattern here that will repeat in our days which is history for us already it's happened the seven seal has opened or we wouldn't be seeing these same details so Jesus says in Matthew 11 5 [Music] that he did bring Revelation okay that he was that he was part of the first seal he said tell John this start with this so he'll understand here tell them the dead are raised up and tell them that the poor have the gospel preached to them my parents were in some of the meetings [Music] the healing campaigns of William Branham they told me you know what son the blind song you know what son the lame walk OS you know what son I the deaf heard you know what son the dead were raised up I shook the hand of one of those men uh English who dropped dead in the meetings his wife sister Ruth when you was a registered nurse [Music] and brother Wade dropped brother Edmond when he dropped on the ground she checked his vital signs pull back the eyelids but then says his eyes were gone it was just all white she says he's dead he says calm down he says if you're going to die there ain't no better place in the house of God just let God work see what he's going to do and he walked down off the pulpit he is I believe it was in Branham Tabernacles he said he said I've seen many people die he said he was dead then he laid his hands upon him ask God to bring back his life he said brother we opened his eyes you say did it happen you say it did it happen I shook his hand what was it Jesus told these two disciples go tell John so he'll know that it's the opening of the first seal the blind received their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the deaf here and the poor had the gospel priests sounds like a 20th century Ministry to me as say oh yeah sounds like the opening of The Seven Seals because this was the opening of the first seal okay and if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's the way he'll open the seventh one yes Jesus Jesus now adding details to the opening of the first seal telling us the processos of the opening of the seal part one of the Plan of Redemption salvation salvation and restoration Elijah the Forerunner Messiah King of the Jews yes and the Antichrist ride verse 6 of Matthew 11. because as Jesus is bringing this Revelation to the people revelation they're resenting it they're resenting it they don't like it and he catches he discerns that spirit and rather than rebuke those that don't want it He blesses those few that do want it that's a principle we can use ourselves in our lives rather than think that you got to push someone down because they're not they're not liking what you say he wasn't going to inject something negative in his sermon here instead he makes it positive to end and he said you know what it's all these people but he says and blessed is he is quiet amen Jesus two those one in a million Matthew 11 7. and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John Jesus you see they were leaving foreign as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes that were offended concerning John a prophet yes he says and more than a prophet because this Prophet is a forerunner to the first coming of Christ this Prophet is the prophet is Elijah who will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children [Music] verse 10 for this is he of whom it's written behold I send my messenger before thy face which will prepare thy way before thee is if they were Bible readers they would know that Jesus was quoting Melody if they weren't Bible readers but if they weren't they would say who gives you a right to say that's John I don't I don't see the name John written in Malachi 3. [Music] I'll give you power to overcome everything on barely I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than him you is he greater or is he the least is both is because he said amongst them that are born of women that's everybody but he says but now we're standing he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven we must verse 11. this is now he's talking about the mystical body now he's talking about the born-again Believers now he's talking about the wheat and not the tares because now John has come to be a servant to those people the faithful Ministries there has an amongst men born or women there's no one's greater than the faithful Ministry but the faithful Ministry when it comes to the kingdom of God we are the least senor the same Lord we all have as is that Jesus Christ Matthew 12. and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force there's that Rider who went forth conquering and to conquer okay he's causing the Kingdom of Heaven to suffer violence Lucifer the white horse rider Lucifer and his Generations are taking it by force it's the white horse rider of Revelation 6 2 the Corona the Jewish or Orthodox priesthood is and Caesar of pagan Rome is this white horse rider Lucifer is a Lucifer is anointing them both to go out conquering with violence this little flock called The Bride of Jesus Christ the pattern of Genesis repeats what is the pattern and Cain killed his brother that's right Kane went out and he calls Abel because to suffer violence and with violence Valencia he took Abel by force and he killed him you see the pattern of God's word and all our lives in the Apostolic Church they told us this was the Christians of that day and they said and you can be that too and guess what a lot of us were much religious apostolics religious apostolics with a violent convulencia character character religious Pentecostals with an arrogant and violent nature so who was riding in the in the lives of these religious men not the Holy Spirit and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force verse 12. this is the White Horse the ride of the white horse rider Blanco remember Isaiah 53 which is also the opening of the first seals the first coming of Christ showing us more details to the same event but in verse 9 of Isaiah 53 the it says this about Jesus and he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death because he had done no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth Isaiah 53 and verse 9 for real they say is in him was no violence and in his in in his followers was no violence for they believed him they believed on his message of perfection Perfection they believed on his message of perfection where he said blessed are the peacemakers that blessed are the violent no so it wasn't Jesus as followers Jesus what about John's followers who were repented and baptized in the River Jordan and after they repented they wanted to know what else can we do to make our lives right to be better fathers to be better mothers Republicans we feel our sins have been cleansed but the people ask them they were baptized what shall we do then okay everyone baptized if you've truly repented it's the question now what's the next question on your heart is Lord what would you have me to do now he answered Jesus Jesus or John the Baptist he answered saith unto them foreign he answered and said unto him he that had two coats or two shoes or those Zapatos for two ten dollar bills let him impart to him that hath none and he that has meat let him do likewise verse 12 of Luke of Luke 3. this is Luke chapter three we started in verse 10 now we're in verse 12. then came also the publicans to be baptized they were tax collectors they were Jews they were hated by their people because they felt that they had turned their backs on them because then came also the publicans to be baptized and repent the Clinton said unto him Master what shall we do it you see genuine repentance it makes you ask the question Lord have been baptized in your name now what do you want me to do what's next in my Christian walk and he said John said unto them exact no more than witches appointed you in other words okay if your job requires you to ask five dollars from every person don't ask for 10. and put five in your pocket amen because that's what they were doing the spirit was Discerning them and the soldiers likewise who had been baptized saying we're soldiers in Rome what shall we do okay and he said unto them as the spirit discerned their hearts he said You Soldiers this is a device I'm going to give you yes this is the advice do violence to no man how do you do that as a Roman soldier you gotta say I quit I'm now a soldier for Jesus wait a minute you signed up to be a marine for four years yes but I just got baptized and now I'm a soldier for Jesus and the advice for a soldier is you is don't do violence but get the Marines to do violence the army trains you to do Finance the Navy trained you the Air Force trains you to jump into an F-35 and drop bombs that kills hundreds of thousands in a moment but one of those soldiers gets baptized the Holy Spirit advises now that you're in my army army do not as well [Music] neither accused it's verse 14. of Matthew 11. and as the people were in expectation verse 15 of Luke 3. verse 15 of Luke 3. and as the people were in expectation and all men must in their hearts of John whether he were Christ or not where were they asking this question is the Holy Spirit discerned them the spirit of discernment in John Christ they didn't ask him right out no no no no in their hearts they were thinking the Holy Spirit and without them even saying it John answered their question John answered saying unto them all I indeed baptize you with water and I know that's been something great in your in in your life now but one mightier than I cometh the latchet of her shoes I'm not worthy to unloose in other words I'm not even I'm not even a foot wash flunky uh yes yes correct he says the latchet of shoes I'm not worthy turn loose he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire so now we sing that these that came who suffered the kingdom of God to suffer violence and now we see verse 12. where it says from the days of John the Baptist until now verse 12 of Matthew 11. the kingdom of God suffereth violence and the violent take it by force that this was not John's followers this was not Jesus's followers who are causing the Kingdom of Heaven to suffer violence no this was the White Horse who had begun his ride [Music] Matthew 11 13 Matthew 11 13 says for all the prophets and the law prophesied until John they say for all the prophets so then what should we expect after John okay we should expect the Elijah Ministry and verse 14 says exactly that if you will receive it this is Elijah which was to come in other words five and six simply says you should expect this Elijah and you should expect John to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and he did verse 15. Jesus saying Jesus he that hath ears this statement is used at the end of every Church age and it's the opening of the Ephesian Church age it's the overlap of the Ephesian Church age with the Jewish age and the white horse rider yeah in its reality in its reality form and so former real begins his ride in the Days of Elijah John the Baptist now the pattern is set now we're also understanding that one seal all right does not open for each Church age throughout seven churches we're going to close with this one quote brother Brandon says in the second seal he tells us when the white horse rider got off his White Horse says and in paragraph 280 of the second seal let me read you this quote and close it is brother Ram says look now look notice when Satan cuando satanas now everybody that realizes that Satan controls all political powers of the world he said so excuse me in Matthew the fourth chapter and the eighth verse all the kingdoms belong to him that's the reason they fight War that's the reason they do everything with violence isn't that strange they was given this sword to kill one another yes now when he did he didn't have the ecclesiastical power yet but he started in with the demon of a false teaching which was the Ephesian Church age and that teaching became a Doctrine in the Smyrna churches and that Doctrine became incarnate in a in a false prophet yes and when he went just to the right place he never went to Israel now Israel he went to Rome for Aroma nicero that's where the council was held and they elected a head Bishop no reason and then by doing this the United church and state together then he dropped his bow the Jews because he didn't need them no more and he's scattered in the world over and he got off his White Horse and he got on his red horse for he can kill anybody that don't agree with him when did he get off his White Horse when they had this Consul in nice what year was that 325 A.D president when did the first first church age begin says about ad 50 he said she said but at the first coming of foreign and when did he change onto his red horse almost 300 years later and if you read your church age 325 is the age of pergamus the third the third church so he says he says the council was held foreign watch him ride on into eternity with it see he unites both his powers together the same thing they're trying to do right now unite church and state 1963. it was it was in 1963. and brother Brahm says they're trying to do the same thing now Rome Roma trying to gather all her daughters together but it'll get even more than that because Rome again okay we'll try and make a deal with the Jews at the end what happened at the beginning the Jews entered into a union the high priest because he wanted an arrow okay because they were the Bow they couldn't put Jesus to death Rome prohibit them no one no one but Rome was allowed to crucify but but the religious priest of Israel they wanted him dead but the religious priest of Israel wanted Jesus did but they needed Rome to give them the area so Lucifer give words to give to Pontius Pilate so that Pontius Pilate the second highest office in Rome would give them the arrow to crucify Jesus and as the high priest is wondering what to say to get this job done he hears Pontius Pilate from his throne there at that open tribunal in Jerusalem and punches pilate was already warned of his wife have nothing to do with this righteousness and Pontius Pilate walks out before the mall Jesus at his side and he tells him what will I do with Jesus king of the Jews they said crucify him he says I find no fault in this man they said don't call him King of the Jews but the Holy Spirit was anointing him he says I will call him King of the Jews and then Lucifer Lucifer into the mind of the high priests he said the high priest of Israel now he says we have no King but Caesar you see where Israel was at now you see what he did Pontius Pilate goes how do I get out of this he says uh he was a very intelligent man he says well then it's the custom that we give you the people an opportunity to vote every year when something like this happens to let one man go free and there's there's other men that were crew today so I'm not gonna choose who to crucify so you choose shall I give you Jesus king of the Jews they said crucify Jesus give us Barabbas set him free that was the arrow of the invisible Union of Rome and they crucified the Son of God it's a pattern it repeats again Israel and he'll go down and make a deal with Israel [Music] it'll be the last deal they make but this time will bring down the nation of Israel but not the remnant 144 000. they'll catch a revelation that Jesus was Messiah that he was King of the Jews and a faithful little remnant of Believers feel foreign [Music] it'll keep you solid on the word of God you'll know his voice and you won't hear anyone else's voice William Brando has to return and have a personal Resurrection Jesus even said in a parable in parabola of the rich man who died and went to hell and of the bigger Lazarus that died and the Bible says Angels Came and packed them away to Adam's bosomes Deborah Paradise and he said the rich man burning in hell this is he said please send someone to tell my family so they can escape this hell that I mean send send back one of the prophets caused them to come back from the dead and they'll hear him Jesus said though one of the prophets raised from the dead they will not believe they have Moses let them read their Bibles and get a revelation because once someone has died they will not come back again to this world no the promises of rapture and we go to meet them they that have died and gone on will never come back here no the promises stay in the pattern of his word and remember Jesus Christ it's the same yesterday today and forever always come in by the door and Jesus that's why Jesus said to Nicodemus you must be born again that's when Revelation begins to
