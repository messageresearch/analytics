[56:48] [Music]
[57:04] [Music]
[57:09] foreign
[57:15] [Music]
[58:34] they would be repeating the lives of the
[58:37] human race
[58:40] it has repeated in our day
[58:44] in this 20th and 21st century
[58:48] let's read once again in Genesis
[58:53] go read the first three verses
[58:58] in the beginning
[59:00] God created the heavens
[59:05] okay
[59:13] [Music]
[59:19] but watched verse 2.
[59:21] verse 1 in the beginning God created the
[59:24] heavens and the earth
[59:27] and the next statement is
[59:30] so strange to me
[59:32] that this God of creation
[59:35] made the heavens
[59:39] the universe
[59:44] but then verse 2 says and the Earth as
[59:49] opposed to Jupiter and Pluto and Saturn
[59:55] the Earth
[59:57] in particular was without form
[1:00:00] foreign
[1:00:30] so so I say between verse 1 and verse 2.
[1:00:35] there's something between the lines
[1:00:38] that the heavens and the Earth that God
[1:00:41] created
[1:00:43] there was something in between verse one
[1:00:45] and two
[1:00:47] that brought it to this Fallen condition
[1:00:51] and darkness was upon him
[1:00:53] and God came back and visited
[1:00:57] and he said this is not how I made it
[1:01:02] so what I'm going to do now
[1:01:04] I'm going to go back
[1:01:06] to my original plan original and the
[1:01:10] Bible says and the Earth was without
[1:01:13] form and void and darkness was upon the
[1:01:16] face of the deep can the spirit of God
[1:01:18] moved upon the face of the waters
[1:01:26] and God said let there be light and
[1:01:29] there was light
[1:01:31] this this Earth was a Fallen Earth
[1:01:35] it had fallen apart again
[1:01:39] verse 4 says and God saw the light that
[1:01:42] it was good
[1:01:44] because when he saw it in this dark
[1:01:47] conditions
[1:01:50] that's it this isn't good because
[1:01:54] he said I'm going to bring the light and
[1:01:58] God saw the light that it was good
[1:02:00] and God divided the light from the
[1:02:03] darkness
[1:02:04] he still does that today
[1:02:06] is
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:31] and when he sees that you surrender to
[1:02:34] the light
[1:02:35] he says Hey listen that's good it says
[1:02:39] let's pray heavenly father thank you
[1:02:42] gracias give you honor and glory glory
[1:02:45] in Jesus name add your blessings to your
[1:02:49] word
[1:02:50] go from bench to bench from heart to
[1:02:53] heart
[1:02:59] we went through
[1:03:02] foreign
[1:03:03] the Book of Genesis the first chapter
[1:03:06] into the second
[1:03:07] Premiere
[1:03:10] and this is really a pre-figure this is
[1:03:13] a this is a shadow a type yes
[1:03:18] it's a pattern that would repeat
[1:03:21] throughout the history of the human race
[1:03:25] we saw that the first chapter of Genesis
[1:03:29] included six days of creation
[1:03:32] first God brought to life
[1:03:35] and separated from the darkness
[1:03:38] then he separated the water because the
[1:03:41] Earth was covered in water
[1:03:44] there was no oxygen that could be that
[1:03:47] could be
[1:03:48] breathedral he divided the ferment
[1:03:54] from the waters
[1:03:56] which were under the ferments
[1:03:58] [Music]
[1:04:01] that means that the hurricane Earth was
[1:04:04] covered in a water that it wasn't
[1:04:06] livable for a human being
[1:04:11] called The Firm in heaven
[1:04:15] and then he begins to tell us and mark
[1:04:19] the time that they started
[1:04:25] and when he made the light
[1:04:29] he said in the evening and the morning
[1:04:32] were the first things
[1:04:36] when he cleaned up the Earth and all the
[1:04:39] water separated
[1:04:43] he said as and God called The Firm in
[1:04:45] heaven and the evening in the morning
[1:04:47] were the second day
[1:04:50] then the Bible says once she cleaned up
[1:04:53] the Earth of that atmosphere
[1:04:59] he said then he began to bring forth the
[1:05:02] grass and Herb building seeds
[1:05:06] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[1:05:08] his kind yeah
[1:05:13] and he said in the evening in the
[1:05:15] morning were the third days
[1:05:17] then he went on to creating the lights
[1:05:23] the Stars
[1:05:25] signs and Seasons
[1:05:29] lights in the ferment
[1:05:31] I mean stars and meteorites and
[1:05:34] everything else in the heavens
[1:05:37] this is all every light no matter how
[1:05:41] small it was
[1:05:43] designed to give light upon the Earth
[1:05:48] the greatest like the sun
[1:05:53] lit up the entire world
[1:05:59] and people could walk in the days
[1:06:08] God also created another light
[1:06:12] it created what's called what we call
[1:06:14] the moon
[1:06:15] and the Moon in itself has no life
[1:06:19] but the moon has a characteristics
[1:06:24] it reflects the light of the flowers
[1:06:28] it's a perfect reflector
[1:06:32] something about the moon the way God
[1:06:34] made it
[1:06:36] to reflect light to the Earth
[1:06:40] with the fullness of the sun wasn't
[1:06:43] present
[1:07:40] [Music]
[1:07:42] the sentences spirit
[1:08:43] prophetica
[1:08:44] [Music]
[1:08:51] [Music]
[1:09:04] [Music]
[1:09:16] is
[1:09:27] because all of these prophets
[1:09:30] all of these signs we're going to follow
[1:09:33] us
[1:10:18] and all of this book of Genesis
[1:10:22] represents a great Plan of Redemption
[1:10:27] Genesis 1.
[1:10:29] with six days of creation
[1:10:32] the last day God makes man
[1:10:35] but God made the man a spirit man
[1:10:40] this woman was in the man
[1:10:45] so all of this prophecies he
[1:10:50] plays his son on this Earth
[1:10:53] that had been redeemed that had been
[1:10:57] cleansed
[1:11:00] with the light of God which is the
[1:11:03] pillar of fires
[1:11:12] and this was the prophetic word yes
[1:11:15] it hadn't come on Earth yet
[1:11:19] this one on the earth
[1:11:23] Adam wasn't on the Earth
[1:11:26] but that's what it was all waiting
[1:11:28] foreign
[1:11:42] [Music]
[1:11:59] first we bring you back to ask him
[1:12:03] who said and these times shall follow
[1:12:05] them
[1:12:10] who was the line of the tribe of Judah
[1:12:14] who was the Lamb of God
[1:12:16] who was Jehovah
[1:12:21] in other words the one in Genesis
[1:12:26] that's who this Jesus was
[1:12:30] the old town
[1:12:37] is his is the things that he says
[1:12:40] are some of them Old Testaments
[1:12:44] for is all of it
[1:12:46] saith Allah
[1:12:51] isn't everything he says an
[1:12:55] eternal thought um
[1:13:00] so God is waiting
[1:13:03] he's going to keep his own words
[1:13:09] because he's Hebrews 3
[1:13:11] 30.
[1:13:12] Jesus Christ
[1:13:16] [Music]
[1:13:19] in Glendale and and in the future the
[1:13:23] God is yours that's increasing our faith
[1:13:30] so he's waiting up and he's going to
[1:13:33] bring forth his son
[1:13:36] he's going to have a personal
[1:13:38] relationship with his son
[1:13:41] that's on the seventh day yes because
[1:13:44] the seventh day
[1:13:45] represents the seventh Church
[1:13:51] represents the seventh seal
[1:13:53] representation
[1:13:56] represents
[1:14:05] that those angels are pouring out okay
[1:14:59] God doesn't bring Darkness God is
[1:15:05] but sometimes he'll allow it to come
[1:15:11] by giving the human race
[1:15:15] free moral agency is
[1:15:30] so Genesis 1.
[1:15:36] in Genesis 2.
[1:15:38] Genesis 2 is all about our relationships
[1:15:48] so what would the seventh
[1:15:51] sea will be about
[1:15:55] the seven churches
[1:15:58] it would be about God
[1:16:01] wanting to have a personal relationship
[1:16:05] with you
[1:16:08] that's what he wants to take us back
[1:16:11] that's the promise
[1:16:15] that's our hope for today
[1:16:17] we read this
[1:16:20] so
[1:16:23] in the beginning
[1:16:30] Darkness was upon the face of the deep
[1:16:32] yes
[1:16:42] and the first thing God does
[1:16:44] he brings the life
[1:16:47] turn with me to Saint John
[1:16:50] Juan chapter one
[1:16:56] Saint John 1
[1:16:59] and verse 1.
[1:17:01] and it reads yes in the beginning and
[1:17:04] the principia was the word
[1:17:07] a new beginning
[1:17:11] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:17:14] was gone
[1:17:16] oh John was catching a revelation
[1:17:20] of what happened in Genesis is it the
[1:17:24] same was in the beginning with God
[1:17:27] that was when God said let there be lie
[1:17:32] that light was the pillar of fires
[1:17:38] clean up
[1:17:40] because it's in the next day
[1:17:43] God makes the sun it makes the Moon
[1:17:48] God makes meteorites
[1:17:51] that makes all kinds of celestial beings
[1:17:56] that will reflect light to the Earth
[1:18:02] God does that because God is not about
[1:18:05] darkness
[1:18:09] in the beginning
[1:18:11] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:18:15] and the Word was gone the same was in
[1:18:18] the beginning with God
[1:18:20] all things were made by him foreign
[1:18:40] nombre
[1:19:04] and then he called for that spirit
[1:19:07] that he had created and placed that
[1:19:10] Spirit man
[1:19:12] in this flesh body
[1:19:15] that God had created with his own hands
[1:19:18] that was the first Adam
[1:19:23] God does it again God creates a body
[1:19:27] but it must come through the woman
[1:19:30] so that that body can be Kinsmen to you
[1:19:33] and I but like I said
[1:19:35] because the law of redemption
[1:19:47] it had to be someone who had the means
[1:19:49] the money to to redeem
[1:19:54] maybe you had lost everything
[1:19:57] you had lost your land
[1:20:01] but there was a year that was called a
[1:20:04] jubilee year
[1:20:06] and after seven after 49 years
[1:20:12] the law of redemption
[1:20:22] to make his
[1:21:20] that was the
[1:21:47] de Cristo and what kind of condition is
[1:21:50] the world in yeah
[1:21:53] it's broken it's Darkness it's
[1:21:57] full of it's full of plagues it's full
[1:22:01] of murder it's full of Assassins it's
[1:22:05] full of men making other men and women
[1:22:06] they're slaves
[1:22:09] does that sound like America today
[1:22:12] does that sound like the world
[1:22:15] a world full of slaves
[1:22:18] when did you think such a modern times
[1:22:23] the most modern computer technology
[1:22:28] one of the biggest one of the biggest
[1:22:31] talking points in the news today
[1:22:38] human race on the increase
[1:22:42] all over the world
[1:22:44] women slaves children slaves
[1:23:17] God is here through Jesus Christ
[1:23:32] for All My Children
[1:23:34] here it is
[1:23:44] condos
[1:23:47] because he's the same yesterday today
[1:23:49] and forever
[1:23:51] all things were made by him foreign
[1:23:57] [Music]
[1:24:01] in him was life
[1:24:03] what do you mean
[1:24:05] and the life
[1:24:07] was the light
[1:24:09] and light lus evida completely
[1:24:14] one in the same
[1:24:18] and the light in China Square la Luz
[1:24:22] in darkness
[1:24:24] and the Darkness
[1:24:30] the darkness doesn't understand
[1:24:33] why in marriage
[1:24:50] light is life what kind of life
[1:24:54] God's life
[1:24:59] lose
[1:25:33] but they didn't go on to be partakers
[1:25:47] the first coming of Christ
[1:25:51] and
[1:25:53] the first thing he said
[1:25:59] what he said in Genesis
[1:26:02] to open our eyes
[1:26:05] and men who were faithful followers of
[1:26:09] the Jewish religions
[1:26:13] never miss the day in synagogue
[1:26:16] we're good friends with with the priests
[1:26:21] but when the light struck their hearts
[1:26:25] and the life changed their lives
[1:26:30] you know they changed their religion
[1:26:33] you know they changed the church
[1:26:40] you know everything they were doing
[1:26:43] was being changed
[1:26:48] it was the mystery of who
[1:26:53] are the first coming of Christ
[1:27:02] was a tremendous Ministry
[1:27:09] this ministry
[1:27:13] with complexes that it was a blessing
[1:27:17] God to come home
[1:27:23] was ordained to bring to Israel
[1:27:25] Israel remember what it was
[1:27:28] the five characteristics
[1:27:34] cambium
[1:27:40] how would you like to be the Prophet
[1:27:41] come on
[1:27:44] that goes to your family
[1:27:46] says God has called me he said
[1:27:49] um
[1:27:55] I'm gonna change how you think about the
[1:27:58] scripture scriptures
[1:28:01] I'm ordained to change how you treat mom
[1:28:06] I'm going to bring change so that Mom
[1:28:08] treats you better yeah
[1:28:13] so that the teenagers in the house will
[1:28:16] all be in in in in
[1:28:18] a better
[1:28:21] conditions
[1:28:23] I'm going to bring change as a matter of
[1:28:27] fact I'm going to speak about marriage
[1:28:30] and divorce here and I'm going to start
[1:28:33] talk to the highest leaders in the
[1:28:35] countries
[1:28:37] and he went up to Heritage who was
[1:28:40] called King of the Jews
[1:28:42] a great Roman Governor um
[1:28:48] it's not right for you to have your
[1:28:51] brother's wife
[1:28:54] he still lives and God says that this
[1:29:00] woman is his wife
[1:29:06] and foreign
[1:29:44] [Music]
[1:29:51] but not his wife
[1:29:53] who was a total unbeliever
[1:29:57] and she asked for the head of John yeah
[1:30:04] John gave his life
[1:30:09] who would desire that kind of ministry
[1:30:11] or we'd almost have to be crazy
[1:30:23] it wouldn't be easy
[1:30:26] but it would be John's Ministry there's
[1:30:29] things that God has called you yeah
[1:30:33] that haven't been easy
[1:30:36] but you know why God has let you go
[1:30:38] through it
[1:30:43] God wants you and I yes
[1:31:10] things have been practicing
[1:31:13] things I've been saying
[1:31:18] tomorrow I'll do it
[1:31:25] use this that thing you've been
[1:31:28] struggling with
[1:31:35] tonight
[1:31:40] this complex
[1:31:42] troubled me so much
[1:31:44] [Music]
[1:31:45] at the feet of Jesus
[1:32:06] a pattern of seven trumpets
[1:32:12] all a pattern of things to come
[1:32:18] and laying between the lines
[1:32:23] and if you can't see the
[1:32:26] oil
[1:32:33] so I say Lord Open the Eyes
[1:32:44] in Saint John 1.
[1:32:46] it was again A New Beginning
[1:32:50] the second Adam is
[1:32:56] to a darkened world
[1:32:59] and he would do it he would do it
[1:33:03] through a seventh fall plan
[1:33:10] called The Seven Seals
[1:33:13] it was just seven parts
[1:33:28] heal your body
[1:33:34] um
[1:33:40] if
[1:33:46] you get to study them
[1:33:53] it's the greatest love story is
[1:33:58] gifted value
[1:34:01] and God is the lover of your soul
[1:34:03] and you're the one
[1:34:07] that he wants to draw you closer
[1:34:11] with Islam or
[1:34:15] you want to draw someone closer
[1:34:25] who said
[1:34:31] Amazing Grace
[1:34:37] they were speaking of things
[1:34:44] we weren't born right the first time
[1:34:50] but God was going to have a family
[1:34:52] God was going to have sons and daughters
[1:34:55] that would be worthy of a god
[1:35:23] to take
[1:35:36] that is
[1:35:46] being cast forward to our days
[1:35:58] cannot see how God is
[1:36:03] Santa
[1:36:11] no no no no no no it's one guy yes
[1:36:17] many gods muchos is a pagan belief
[1:36:27] Israel the Lord thy God yes
[1:36:34] John said I saw one Central
[1:36:40] masuno but God changing foreign
[1:37:16] he's the same
[1:37:17] way
[1:37:20] you see the mind of God how is
[1:37:23] unchanging in all his ways
[1:37:26] oh once you see it
[1:37:29] becomes a newborn
[1:37:33] a book of life a book of life
[1:37:38] Revelations apocalypsies
[1:37:41] Revelations chapter one
[1:37:44] excuse me Revelations
[1:38:00] Revelations chapter 5 as we Minister on
[1:38:02] it many times because
[1:38:06] it's another it's a vision
[1:38:09] and between the lines
[1:38:13] is some great incredible truths and
[1:38:16] details
[1:38:18] what God did for us
[1:38:20] Revelations
[1:38:23] of one sitting on a throne
[1:38:26] that's a king and it speaks of a strong
[1:38:30] angel proclaiming with a loud voice
[1:38:33] and it speaks of a kind of one who's
[1:38:36] called The Lion of the tribe of Judas
[1:38:45] and it speaks of a lamb
[1:38:48] that had been slain and you see all
[1:38:51] these different characters
[1:38:54] but as you know by now
[1:38:58] all these different characters
[1:39:05] back in Genesis
[1:39:11] that's the same God
[1:39:14] who sat on the throne
[1:39:17] and John in his right hand saw him
[1:39:21] there was a book
[1:39:23] and it was a book that was written
[1:39:25] within yeah
[1:39:39] a plan to take Adam
[1:40:06] like it would have foreign
[1:40:22] [Music]
[1:41:01] and he's got that purpose here tonight
[1:41:11] because he wanted to get closer
[1:41:17] it's God on the throne
[1:41:19] no one could approach
[1:41:24] so God said I'll change foreign
[1:41:37] is
[1:41:51] but it wasn't close enough
[1:41:54] to save you um
[1:42:05] cuerto he creates a
[1:42:08] Jesus
[1:42:10] Maria
[1:42:28] [Music]
[1:42:35] that's it is
[1:42:41] history would call him Jesus
[1:42:46] foreign
[1:43:18] is
[1:43:21] your career
[1:43:23] yeah
[1:43:25] and yeah yeah when I see the healing
[1:43:28] campaigns that Jesus had last uh
[1:43:32] groups of five thousands yes
[1:43:40] for everyone to touch him
[1:43:45] so God changed forms again
[1:43:49] he wanted to change forms and
[1:43:53] foreign
[1:44:30] because
[1:44:32] is the savior of the whole world
[1:44:38] you know that there is no book sorry can
[1:44:42] I leave United
[1:44:46] the Lion's Book of Life
[1:44:51] there's only a book called the Lamb's
[1:44:53] books because
[1:45:04] hello
[1:45:23] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:45:26] God walked out of the garden
[1:45:29] to go to the Cross
[1:45:32] to be the same
[1:45:35] del Mundo
[1:45:37] foreign for everyone who could believe
[1:45:43] Jesus Jesus Christ
[1:45:48] he went to the cross
[1:45:51] shed his blood he died
[1:45:56] for one purpose
[1:46:00] take away the curse
[1:46:03] it's upon each and every one of us
[1:46:05] because we're born in Portland
[1:46:10] we come into this world
[1:46:19] I can almost remember the first lie I
[1:46:21] ever said
[1:46:23] my mom says
[1:46:25] who broke that lamp s
[1:46:35] that was Ruth my sister
[1:46:37] okay thank you okay no problem that's
[1:46:41] what I'm here foreign
[1:46:59] because I've been
[1:47:11] because God has been descended
[1:47:15] in Revelations
[1:47:18] John is telling us what he's saying
[1:47:21] and I be held and low in the midst of
[1:47:24] the throne and of the four beasts
[1:47:27] in the midst of the elders to the lamb
[1:47:30] as it had been slain
[1:47:32] this is a vision
[1:47:35] representative
[1:47:43] he knew Jesus of Nazareth very well
[1:47:48] he leaned his head
[1:47:55] is
[1:48:07] so when he's seen this here he didn't
[1:48:10] say I seen Jesus
[1:48:13] because you realize when he's seen this
[1:48:16] Vision
[1:48:17] this is about 40 or 50 years later
[1:48:21] after Christ's death burial and
[1:48:23] resurrection
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:27] and that most of what John is seeing in
[1:48:30] Revelations
[1:48:34] already history foreign
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:49:05] [Music]
[1:49:13] from all Darkness
[1:49:56] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[1:49:59] forth unto all the Earth
[1:50:04] he came and took the book out of the
[1:50:08] right hand of him
[1:50:09] remember Revelations
[1:50:13] it said that the line of the tribe of
[1:50:15] Jesus
[1:50:17] foreign
[1:50:58] so what is this now the lamb has taken
[1:51:02] the book
[1:51:04] see Revelations
[1:51:09] and Revelations
[1:51:18] as a matter of facto
[1:51:22] it's history it's historia
[1:51:24] we've already seen yes
[1:51:33] for most of us
[1:51:35] someone was weren't even born yet
[1:51:43] interest
[1:51:47] Revelations 5 and 5.
[1:51:53] the lamb being slain El Cordero in verse
[1:51:58] 6.
[1:51:59] that's the end of Jesus ministry
[1:52:03] on the cross
[1:52:04] from Revelations
[1:52:09] three and a half years
[1:52:13] who can read the Bible the way we read
[1:52:15] it today
[1:52:19] but God sent us his words
[1:52:29] now he came and took the book
[1:52:34] first the lion
[1:52:38] of Christ
[1:52:51] is
[1:52:56] because Jesus Christ
[1:53:02] foreign
[1:53:35] kindred
[1:53:37] people
[1:53:40] Revelations
[1:53:44] for the Redemption
[1:53:50] this is
[1:54:24] worship service for our foreign
[1:54:53] God change forms
[1:54:56] he went from the throne to the cross
[1:55:02] to the Grave
[1:55:06] is that all he did
[1:55:10] he rise again the third day
[1:55:22] where do you go
[1:55:25] I asked Josh I thought he would tell me
[1:55:27] but he just repeated what I said
[1:55:30] I get it that's his job
[1:55:33] where did he go
[1:55:36] turn with me to Revelations
[1:55:38] from chapter one
[1:55:46] Revelations one
[1:55:58] and we'll go to
[1:56:03] we'll start at verse 12.
[1:56:06] we'll pick up the other verses on our
[1:56:09] next service
[1:56:10] in closing tonight
[1:56:13] John is in this Vision it's Revelations
[1:56:18] but I want you to understand that
[1:56:21] Revelations
[1:56:22] and everything that happened in
[1:56:24] Revelations
[1:56:26] happened before Revelations
[1:56:33] see how God
[1:57:02] most of the time they're talking about
[1:57:04] things
[1:57:06] that happened after what he said in
[1:57:09] chapter one
[1:57:12] symbolo
[1:57:44] so where did Jesus go after
[1:57:47] Jesus
[1:57:57] because remember that body was glorified
[1:58:02] and when he went to Thomas Thomas saw
[1:58:06] Jesus Jesus
[1:58:11] he didn't have all the stripes on his
[1:58:14] back
[1:58:19] burial and Resurrection
[1:58:24] the body was glorified the only smart
[1:58:30] as Thomas had said
[1:58:34] that Jesus
[1:58:37] unless I can touch the scars
[1:58:48] and when Jesus Jesus
[1:58:56] I can see that
[1:58:59] but maybe you're just a twin
[1:59:03] you already knew what John was thinking
[1:59:06] yes
[1:59:07] John look at my hands is
[1:59:14] Thomas
[1:59:28] that's the only marks that were left
[1:59:38] so this bloody land here is
[1:59:41] a symbol
[1:59:42] it still lays Before the Throne of God
[1:59:47] interceding for you and I know
[1:59:50] but where's the man Jesus
[1:59:54] Where's God
[1:59:56] what form did he change
[1:59:59] he's now the great Holy Spirit
[2:00:07] now he's descended to a foreign
[2:00:11] he could touch everyone
[2:00:13] and everyone can catch him
[2:00:15] tonight God has taken a foreign
[2:00:50] what
[2:01:37] he says and in the midst of the seven
[2:01:40] candidates
[2:01:44] like Jesus
[2:01:49] El Ravi
[2:01:52] a friend mi amigo
[2:01:54] it had to be him it looked like him
[2:01:56] because he said and he was clothed with
[2:01:59] a garment to the footage
[2:02:11] no reason John said
[2:02:13] the reason Johnson
[2:02:16] there was there was one like unto the
[2:02:19] sun
[2:02:20] because he'd never seen him dress this
[2:02:23] way before
[2:02:24] he'd never seen him all with white hair
[2:02:27] like wolves
[2:02:30] never seen his eye is like a flame of
[2:02:33] fire
[2:02:34] he'd never seen his feet like until fine
[2:02:37] brass that burned in a furnace
[2:02:46] but the voice
[2:02:55] this is the form that he changed
[2:03:05] it's a symbol ism
[2:03:28] Jesus wants you Jesus
[2:03:35] when he preached on Perfection therefore
[2:03:44] okay
[2:03:59] because if God is asking him
[2:04:02] you know what he's prepared
[2:04:05] the way El Camino the truth remember
[2:04:08] that and the lies
[2:04:27] hmm
[2:04:29] what a book in this Bible
[2:04:33] as a prophet folders
[2:04:36] since almighty God has revealed these
[2:04:39] Seven Seals
[2:04:42] this book is
[2:04:50] because
[2:04:55] suvida
[2:05:03] it changes
[2:05:05] no surrender no Serene no change
[2:05:10] but surrender there are reindeers and
[2:05:12] he'll bring change yes
[2:05:17] until finally
[2:05:31] that have been allowing God to change
[2:05:41] um
[2:05:51] whatever
[2:06:00] and the price he paid
[2:06:03] and because he rose again
[2:06:07] he didn't fall and fail like the first
[2:06:16] and he wants to offer to you
[2:06:21] in suvida to be like Jesus
[2:06:25] Heavenly Father Celestial we thank you
[2:06:28] gracias from Earth's humble Shores
[2:06:32] and we ask one thing
