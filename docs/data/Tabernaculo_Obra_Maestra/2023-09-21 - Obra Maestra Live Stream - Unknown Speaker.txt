[Music] [Music] so so lost foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you [Music] [Applause] our brother Kenny has a special song this evening I'm coming [Music] I bless you tonight I want to read a scripture before we sing this song I don't know why but every time I sing a song Lord is always maybe not every time but I've always felt to read a scripture before I sing a song because I just feel that my life is tied to the word I feel like my heart is part of the word and uh it's a little bit nervous but I want to read this scripture because I feel that this scripture by God's grace he's allowed me to keep my mind on him and I remember years before I got converted my mind wasn't on the things of God and um but ever since the Lord changed my heart you know I may not there's there's times where I've you know I haven't been what I should be but my mind has always been on him I've always felt that my heart is only because of him because he put his mind in me That's why nothing of myself but I just want to read this scripture it's Isaiah 26 3. and it says thou will keep him imperfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in the so I truly believe that that when we keep our minds on him we we if we keep our minds stayed on him he'll give us that perfect peace and I believe in a world that we're living in today we need a peace and it's not the peace that the world offers but it's the peace that the Lord Jesus gives us thank you Restless Hearts trouble Minds I try hard to find answers to why it's turned out this way but while my heart gripped with fear I can feel him draw near [Music] gently I hear my Lord says [Music] keep your mind stayed on me [Music] Faithfully and I will give you perfect peace sweet release if you'll just keep your mind staying on me it's evening time the hours late there's a pressure so great everywhere Hearts failed because of but when I think of lovely things for the peace his word is still Small Voice I can't hear [Music] your mind [Music] [Laughter] [Music] and I will give you perfect peace thank you sweetie sweet if you don't you'll get on me I give my mind completely to you Lord fill me with your thoughts oh make it all brand new and change my life and let me live in all that's true I just want to be like I give my mind completely to you Lord fill me with [Music] me and change my life let me live in all that's true oh I just want to be like you so keep your mind stayed on me [Music] who who [Music] will be perfect peace be sweet [Music] if you'll just keep your mind stayed home me God bless you [Music] brother Jonathan [Music] God bless you all it's good to be here with you all amen the song that I'm about to see the work truck today and was listening to it and touched my heart you know you know that portion of scripture in John work Mary Magdalene as she sees Jesus and he tells her don't touch me because I haven't ascended but he says go tell my disciples I will I am going to ascend to the father and when she when he when they are all gathered together he came he came down with them and they saw the scars that are on his his uh hands and his side amen but when they told Thomas because he wasn't there he didn't he didn't believe them and he said unless I can touch his hands and decide but see God came down to Thomas because he wanted Thomas to have faith he wasn't mean to him because you didn't believe this is what you got no he said even for you Thomas I'll come down and I'll let you do this but I say that to say this is that the only scars in heaven I heard this song it's called the only scars in heaven and uh it says it won't belong to me or new when we go there we won't have any scars anymore amen [Music] if I had only known the last time would be the last time I would have put off all the things I had to do I would have I would have stayed a little longer held on a little tighter now what I give for one more day with you cause there's a wound here in my heart where something's missing [Music] it's gonna heal with time but I know you're in a place where all your wounds have been erased knowing yours [Music] is the only scars in heaven they won't belong to me and you [Music] there'll be no such thing as broken and all the old would be made new and the thought that makes me smile now even as the tears fall down is that the only scores in heaven or on the hands and hold you now [Applause] I know the road you walked on was anything but easy you picked up your shared scars alone but now you're standing in the sun you fought you're fighting the races run [Music] pain is all A Million Miles Away the only scars they won't belong to me and you there'll be no such thing as thing is broken and all the oil will be made new and the thought that makes me smile now even as a tears fall down is that the only scores in heaven are on the hands and hold you now there's not a day goes by that I don't see you you live on and all the better parts of me standing in the sun I'll fight this fight in this race I'll run until I finally see what you the only scars they won't belong to [Music] you'll be no such thing is broken [Music] foreign [Music] and as we have brother Leo coming pray for the needs and also for the offerings and tithes [Music] is beloved Heavenly Father [Music] as we come into these doors Lord [Music] we consider ourselves Overcomers as we hear these songs [Music] you give us more strength [Music] you take away our worry [Music] certainly our bodies are tired but there's something inside us that makes us renew the strengths we give you thanks for that Lord [Music] we asked for the word that's going to be preached tonight [Music] we ask that you place it in the bottom of our hearts let us come out better than the week we make it as if it was done foreign [Music] because we ask here in the name of Jesus Christ [Music] and I heard [Music] about it [Music] [Applause] [Music] be my savior forever [Music] [Music] preparing me [Music] [Music] somehow Victory in Jesus my [Music] life [Music] song is brother Daniel gets ready to bring us the word of God thank you hanging is known [Music] [Applause] [Music] imagine Jesus Christ [Music] and me [Music] has risen from the dead [Music] [Music] God bless you all this evening back once again and uh we just okay we're just kind of in an expectation also the trip we'll be taking the expected I think I'm starting to count to days now so next week will be the last week and then we leave the following Monday so keep us in your prayers and we really believe God opened the door so we could be a blessing to the folks there in Congo and um so you just remember us in that trip I know I'm going to have a good time but we've traveled before so I also know that 30 hours of travel one way is going to be kind of tough it's 30 to 33 hours from the time that we leave here to the time that we arrive in Congo Congo so we anticipated it and we get there I think the day before the services so it'll give us a little chance to rest up a bit but not much because the brothers already said that they'll be meeting us at the airport this is a folks want to meet you it might be difficult to get any rest even the day before but we're grateful to God that he has he has a bride there's a mystical body of Jesus Christ and she's worldwide yes and God's allowed us to go meet them in different places meet the Saints in South Africa I mean the Saints in Brazil Brazil meet the Saints in Venezuela meet the Saints from Argentina and many Believers around the world there of course in Congo the churches are some of the largest there with her brother the church will be dedicating it is now maybe about 5 000 people we prior to Landing in Brazil we land in the country of the Democratic Republic of Congo there's two Congos and we land in uh and and there there's a a few churches also a brother by the name of Brother Richard dioke he has a congregation about 16 000 Believers and yet these are some of the poorest countries in the world Congo has been uh the two nations of Congo have been in Civil War for years and years and years so so the people live uh under a great stress the they're not worried about what restaurant they'll go to on Sunday restaurants they're just concerned whether they'll have something to eat on Sunday and and yet that may be the very thing that creates their dependence on the word of God it doesn't have to be that way but yet as human beings we realize sometimes it takes a little squeeze something that for us is difficult and very hard to bring us to a place where we can say Lord I surrender all but that's what the Christian life is about to finally answer the call of God say Lord I Surrender yes I remember myself as a young and that's been many years ago now yes I never have one regret I was never sorry I did it I just wish I would have done it sooner but that was kind of the hard-headed kind but by the grace of God his Mercy never quit reaching down to us if you'll turn in your Bibles and we've been reading from The Book of Revelations last week we took from Genesis one and and merged it and typed it with uh Saint John the first chapter and then we also read from Revelations uh the way that scriptures come together showing how the New Testament what happened there in in the Old Testament what happened there in Genesis was a pattern and it was a reflection of even of this Plan of Redemption of This Book of Revelations Genesis was a pattern of this to come and and Revelations was also the plan the divine plan of God to restore back God Sons and Daughters in the very same relationship that Adam and Eve had with the father before they made that crucial mistake in their lives and get put out of the presence of God foreign [Music] [Music] and and that's what he's wanting to restore us back to yeah he's wanting to restore his back to have a relationship with the father where the father can instruct us and he's doing with us what he want to do with Adam he's teaching us how to handle and how to understand the spoken word the original series he's teaching us how to let our fingers do the walk into the Bible Pages so that all the symbols that lay in the Bible it'll come alive to us and we'll see how God chose to hide this book this Bible from the eyes of the wise they're not babes as in in small literal human children um adults that would be born again spiritual babes men and women Born Again baptized with the Holy Ghost and Fire because that is the beginning of our Christian world is a baptism in water it can that is an outward expression of an inward work of a baptism of fire that God is doing in our hearts that cleanses us from the old appetite of the things of the world and we say I won't partake of this world no more I don't grow up Desiring it every morning anymore no the flesh is tempted but the inner man who's been born again he mortifies the Deeds of the Flesh and begins to do the will of Revelations chapter one and verse one this is what the whole Bible is about and it consummates and it comes to a point here in this first chapter of Revelations and it says the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what's needed God has had many apostles because that had many prophets God has had many true evangelists at least faithful pastors God has had some teachers in the mix of it God has a faithful Ministry but what the faithful Ministry has come to teach us and those that are are born again those ministers who have the baptism of the Holy Ghost ministers you'll know them because they will want to instruct you and bring you to the feet of the Cross well you too can have a river but none of them gave their life on the cross of California but they all pointed us to him the Lamb of God Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and Sanctified it by his Angel unto his servant John Christ in you descended from the throne and you change forms many times and you change Ministries to get to this place tonight where you could have an encounter with us whereas the word is preached amen amen you may be seated we're just attempting here and maybe the next services to continue in This Book of Revelations and we will first kind of just go and and speak a general outline of it all um and and then later on back up again and and take each text more in great details the Lord willing so here in Revelations God is making himself known through his Apostle and profit also called John the Divine John was one of the 12 apostles John pastored the church in Ephesus but here as this Revelation is coming to him John was actually taken and put in prison in a remote island it was the Roman emperor that time they wanted to smash the influence of Jesus Christ they felt that this movement of this Nazarene was growing too big they found out that John is trying to compile all the writings of the New Testament author scribes Matthew Mark Luke and John Marcus wrote the Gospel and then all the Epistles pistols and of James and he was compiled them all together he had them all in his possessions but they had been written in in in the in the language of the Hebrews and John was trying to put it and translate it all into the Greek language because the Greek language was a universal language of that day no matter what language you spoke if you could speak Greeks you could always find someone somewhere because when the Greeks ruled the world they enforce the teaching of their language so the Greek was a universal language to everyone and that's why the original New Testament was originally placed in the Greek because John wanted to make it accessible to everyone but he was caught before but God needed to put him in a place because this was so sacred and so sovereign [Music] I'm going to reveal to you this great Plan of Redemption it's a plan of Seven Seals which really is a plan of seven parts that was going to unfold on the days of Jesus to this day we are in the seventh part we are in the seventh seals much of it is all history already but the fifth seal the sixth seals they are running in parallel there is no overlap in these seals there's no overlap in these parts because in the last days God would make a quick short work so all three of these last seals are traveling in parallel unfolding at the same time and it began here when John the Lord appears to him his Angel and speaks to him in verse 3 he says blessed is he that readeth and there you hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand and he knows that God has given him this Revelation in symbol forms unto these seven churches these were actual seven churches in the days of John and the Ephesian church was a church that John actually pastored they're at the end of time but these seven natural churches we're going to represent seven spiritual churches it was going to represent the Journey of a gentile people and the church in general from the days of Jesus to the end of a Great Tribulation and let me say again we're living in the last church [Music] and we're living under the message of the last seals you say the prince of the Kingdom this world is still in the hands of kings of the earth and he is the heir to everything that every King that every dictator that every Earthly ruler thinks they own um but they don't own it he is the prince to all of us because the prince is the air when the King dies so he is right now waiting to take this Earth back and he's the heir to all of it he's the prince of the Kings verse 6 says Kings and have made us Kings unto God and his father then verse 7 says behold he cometh with clouds the Bible says in the book of Acts that he was amongst the Believers for a period of 40 days and in those 40 days he was testifying to the to the children of God he was with his disciples he was confirming who he was Messiah he was risen he kept his word to them Israel had rejected it as a nation they had rejected him they're kings through the gospel and the Plan of Salvation part one the first seal you know what God had revealed to Israel was given to a gentile people this book of this Revelations here now we remember that when he talked to his disciples and he gave him a commission they're in the books he says and you'll be endured he didn't tell him how long to stay he didn't tell them how long it would take but they went they went because they were all so hiding they were being persecuted they were scared they were running from the Romans they were running from the Orthodox Jewish Church oh we're persecuting them the Bible says and the days of Elijah kingdom of God suffereth violence and the violent takes them by force that that was the church persecuted Believers in Christ that was Pagan Rome persecuting the Believers in Christ that was the ride of the White Horse Riders Revelation 6 2. that's when it began so now we can take Revelation 6 2. and we can plug that into the days of Jesus and prophecy became history in the days oh look at this book over here and Jesus when he gave the commission to the to the the apostles suppose and 120 Believers the Bible says as they talk I was caught up into the heavens and while they see him go he said there's two men behind him that they hadn't noticed before it was two angels and they said why look you up into the heavens as though something strange is happening he said but the way you see him go at the first coming is the way you'll see him come again he'll come with clouds again but those weren't regular clouds this is a book of symbols what caught Jesus away the first time it wasn't clouds it was a host of angels it was the term was used clouds even the pattern and it was called a mystery ring clouds it's Life Magazine March of 1963. I have an original copy and when you open it up it looks like a strange the the the the scientists that looked at it they said the cloud was about 30 miles 30 miles high about 20 miles in diameter or more he said but it was at a height that clouds do not existence this is a mystery clouds no clouds are formed at this height because it was a sign on to us in 1963. behold they cometh with clouds again and when you take that picture in Life magazine and you turn the magazine to the right it is exactly the face of Christ and in this silhouette of this Cloud you see the tips of the Angels Wings we didn't take the picture no church took the picture no no no no no uh men who are photographers for magazines it was unusual to them and they put it in life magazines God had him to put it there to fulfill this worship number seven when he comes again he'll come again the second time just like he left the first time that's what the Angels told the apostles they use that language no the first time it was Angels Jesus ascended on high glorified Lord Jesus and once again he told them the way you've seen him go the way you'll see him and John confirms what those angels and 40 50 years later you know what he said and they also which pierced him Israel the Jews and all kindreds of the Earth shall will because of him even so amen amen this is Jesus speaking John was watching this Vision unfold he was both seeing the things that he wrote and hearing the voice yes estabiendo God had that for His prophets long before Satan perverted him to steal your hearts and Minds away God still wants to give you a vision and open Our Eyes Open the Eyes foreign [Applause] and when he says he wants to change it and we know that that changes Oh Glory I am Alpha and Omega yes which is which words he wanted to put that book back in the hand of a Son of God can he created by your spoken word [Music] he created a spoken word a spirit man and he created a body from the clay for him now he come again and body [Music] he's the same yesterday today and forever John is watching all this unfold foreign for the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ so are we God has placed you where you are even tonight because he wants to bring you to a place to be a testimony of Jesus Christ then he says I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a great voice and he continues to say and the voice said I'm Alpha and Omega I'm the first and the last even John receives a commission now directly from almighty God the Visions I'm going to give you down to the very detail write it in a book and send it unto the seven churches which are in Asia and to Ephesus Philadelphia can you search the history you'll find that all of these churches existed in the days of Jesus Paul visited all these places took the gospel to a gentile people because he told Peter just as God has given to you this precious word to take to the Jews so God has called me to take the same gospel now that Israel has rejected to a gentile people to the Bride of Jesus Christ through the body of Christ I turned to see the voice that spake with me and being turned I saw seven golden candles it was a candle opera it was what the Jews called the menorah it had a basin of oil and it had seven branches and Israel had it since the beginning that God established the Jewish Church and then they'd blow it out and they would like another stick from the second lamp that was lit um the fire was lit for the next lamp from the previous land they didn't take the same the same the same fire that he split the first one with and then go live in all seven the fire had to go from one age to the next fire from one age I saw one like unto the son of man that John if you'll remember as an apostle he was the one that the Bible says that many times would lay his head in the bosomes of Jesus they were close he was the Beloved you might say he knew him very well his face his beard his his stature is he could spot him from from a mile away so that's Jesus over there he knew he was he knew Jesus was the ministry of the son of man the son of man represents a god Prophet a son of man represents a prophetic ministry that's the difference in the scriptures under the Jewish beliefs the Jews would turn their prophets call them son of man it was a title they had given them but in the judeo church it wasn't a title so much to lift them up but it was a title to remind the prophets that though they were born a prophet and God would use them to speak to Israel usually under the law it was for judgment and rebukes the term son of man that Israel and the priests used to them [Music] God may speak to you foreign John was saying here I saw someone I'm seeing someone in this Vision that looks like Jesus but this time he's clothed with a garment to the foot and he's Gert about the paps with the Golden Girls that means it was at the shoulders all wrapped around him as as a judge would wear the priest would wear the the Priestly and levite girdles around the waist it would show that they were in service for Ministry foreign represents that's why John was wondering the man looks just like Jesus but his hairs are white like wool his eyes are like a flame of fire he's never seen Jesus like this before it looks like him but he's dressed differently his hair is different and his feet like unto fine breasts he's seen Jesus in a way that he's never seen him before in this Vision he says in his right hand he has seven stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword its own symbols that would be revealed his countenance was as the sun shineth in his Straits and when he saw him I fell at his feet is dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear I jesus at this point I have the keys oh do we need to fear deaths no no not if you've given your life to Jesus Christ he holds those keys no man can put you in there he can take you there you come to be friend of Jesus and it's not a place you need to worry about it he said in verse 18. and behold I'm Alive forevermore and you have the keys then he goes on to tell him write the things which thou has seen and the things which are the things which shall be here after verse 19. and he begins to unfold some of the mysteries of these symbols this is the mystery of the Seven Stars which thou saw us in my right hand he said and the Seven golden candles first the Stars the stars are the Angels of the seven churches the word angel in the Bible means Messengers that's simply it means Messengers and the word angel in the Bible simply means a messenger so then you have to dig deeper is this a Heavenly Angel is this an Earthly messenger then you have to dig deeper and say Lord more Revelation please more detail please and he'll bring it because Upon This World in Matthew 16. I'll build this church of Hell will prevail against it it was when Jesus some think you're Jeremiah or one of the prophets because even if a prophet was to rise from the dead Remember The Parables of of that old beggar called Lazarus the Bible said he died in the streets and Angels came and picked him up and took him into the bosom of Abraham they also called Paradise also known as The Fifth Dimension because there's seven dimensions we live in the first three time matters the fourth dimension is the dimension elemention of Music a video the video of Internet the internet of all the I.T stuff that travels through the air Technologies the first part that was created for the devil in his angels there's a supernatural barrier for those who have rejected it's not the final judgment and people are there yet tonight awaiting a great white Throne judgment where the Bible says the bride and the groom the Bride of Jesus Christ the Bible calls the wise version those that are those that won't see death and be raptured those the queen will sit with the King and she'll judge the whole world so here it is which is the mysteries of the Seven stars without Solace and my right hand the Seven Stars are the Angels of the seven churches so these are Church age angels age Messengers these are these are these are are men these angels these Messengers and there's one to each Church age that was given yeah he said and the Seven Stars of the angels of the seven churches or The Messengers that God would say to each one of these ages and the Seven Candle ticks are there seven churches then the book goes into chapter two and here God begins speaking through every Church in Revelations 2 of the fall of this church it warns them of how Satan's trying to deceive them it tells them of the patients also that some are having because in the midst of this Ephesian Church there's a little group of Believers that have been holding to the words and then it then it announces a blessing as in verse 7 of Revelations to the Church of Ephesus he says he that had an ear let him hear what the spirit says unto the churches oh how we need to have an ear and be attentive to what the spirit says that's a that's a relationship that's a personal experience that we need that's what gives us an ear to hear it opens the eyes of our understanding when we're talking to Jesus every evening let him hear what the spirit saith unto the church will I give to eat of the tree it's what Adam and Eve is they should have eaten the Bible even said of Jesus in Isaiah 7. that God would send forth his son he would give them a sign he would send forth his son and he would eat only butter and honey it's symbols that he might that he might not know how to receive the goodness so you don't have to partake of the evil no no bring up the kids in the way that they should grow the Bible says teaching the good things of God give him the good of the land of this word of God righteousness and Holiness that's what we'll teach them God rich in Mercedes but the spirit saith unto the church if you want to overcome Eater of the tree of life and reject and reject the tree the knowledge that goes on to the second Church in Smyrna International and to the angel of the church in Smyrna yesterday or unto the messengers unto the prophet that God's going to send to them write this thing say it the first and the last which which was dead and is alive and it goes on in its Church age and at the end of every Church age like in verse 11. of the age of Smyrna he says he didn't have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches he says shall not be foreign and God told them he that overcome it the second death will not touch you because when you leave this whole body I'll Grant you eternal life and the second death will never touch it to leave this body is but do not come to a place where you've lived a life worthy of the gospel and worthy of that Celestial body that's the second day the Third Church to the angel to the messenger to the prophet of the church which had the sharp sword with two edges that represented the word of God that represented God's Plan of Redemption two-edged sword represented the revelation of these Seven Seals which is the revelation of Jesus Christ these seven Parts these Seven Seals it's the revelation of Jesus Christ that's what the book The Bible is all about that's why God has sent Faithful Men you might say well there's not a lot of them well the bride is not a big number in closing tonight turn with me to Ephesians Ephesians chapter four after Jesus is death burial and Resurrection yes let's re let's begin reading at verse 9. or verse speaking of Jesus now wherefore he saith when he ascended up on high he led captivity captive foreign higher [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign he set them free took him from a Fifth Dimension a waiting place to a sixth Dimension beyond the curtain of time because they're in the fifth Dimensions they could see the torment happening on those that had forsaken God that's why Lazarus could see that that rich man suffering in hell and that rich man could see Lazarus in the bosom in the arms of Abraham yes he said he said Lord let him dip his finger and just give me a little water to drink he was suffering in torments and now Lazarus was blessed No More Pain No More Death no more suffering now the rich man was suffering another rich man was in torment he says let him dip his finger and give me a little bit to drink no he said you cannot cross over to paradise and they cannot cross over into your toes but they could see each other they could see the great mistake they had made and those on the paradise side could see the great reward greater than all the suffering they suffered what's this reward foreign for a resurrection to go talk to my brother he said no no he's even if a prophet was to resurrect they would never believe him if they didn't believe him when they were on Earth I won't do that no no way I said I won't do it now I won't do it tomorrow I won't do whatever the only need for this private resurrection of one man there's a resurrection of Jesus Christ because that would mean he would he had overcome death he rose the third day to take a hold of this couldn't hold him he said now that he unto men now that he ascended what is it but that he also descended first into the lower parts of the earth you see where Jesus went you see where the father went as the body of Jesus the spirit of God and he went down into the lower parts of the earth to preach to the laws and to bring out the righteous of the Old Testament to give them an old-fashioned camp meeting with the Holy Ghost to give them a born-again experience they're in that Dimension so that from there he could pull them out because now it wasn't the blood of bulls and goats and washes away [Music] descended is the same also that ascended or Above All The Heavens that he might feel and when he ascended these are the gifts that he sent down to the church he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some pastors and teachers it's called the faithful Ministry of Jesus Christ the law and the prophets but God wasn't annulling the prophetic Ministry God was going to change the way they preached he wasn't going to use the prophetic Ministries to bring judgment and Damnation no no they were going to come now and preach the kingdom of heaven and you shall receive the Holy Ghost on Fire and so were the apostles yes yes and so are the evangelists in the New Testament and so should the pastors and the teachers oh thou preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand the foundation stone in your life and it's guaranteed I'll give you the Holy Ghost on Fire you'll never be the same
