I'll be preaching English so brother Leo come up right okay thank you amen God bless you all this morning it's good to be back in this house of God and what makes it a house of God it's his presence but what also makes it a house of God is your presence and when we gather together and his presence and our presence together then it makes it the house of God God with his family once again we ministered on uh behold what manner of love and we read out of First John chapter 3 and we want to read that scripture once again as we open up this part two this morning first we want to read the scripture Rec cap on what we spoke and then Lord willing God will help us to finish this thought here this morning first John chapter 3 verse one behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not [Music] behold now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is I want to read it one more time verse two it says beloved now are we the sons of God right now this morning this moment if we can recognize now we are the sons of God and then John says and he's connecting these two thoughts together it does not yet appear what we shall be we're going to be like Jesus but John is saying it's hard to see that right now because because we're being persecuted because we're being chased out of Jerusalem because everyone is against us the denomination the federal government everything's working against us so we're in a bit of a stage of spiritual amnesia we're we're we're we're we're feeling all these human emotions we're feeling fear we're feeling we have to run for our lives so he says and it does not yet appear what what we shall be then see it started out so positive verse two it said behold beloved now are we the sons of God positive and then it looks like he drops off a little negative and it does not get appear what what we shall be it's like he drops us back down oh then he's going to lift us up again know that when he shall appear he says we know this we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is remember as a gentile people as the bride of Christ he doesn't appear to us as a group think about that but when he shall appear not to a group but to you an individual so does that make his appearing now a personal experience with Jesus Christ where you as an individual you know he's appeared to you and yet then there's many that say but he hasn't appeared but many others might say he has not appeared and he hasn't to them but to those who believe but we know John said that when he shall appear to us personally then we personally shall be like him even if nobody else is we shall see him as he is in us the hope of glory verse three and every man that have this hope the hope of a born again experience of the love of God being bured in our hearts and every man that have this hope in him purifieth himself it takes a holy ghost experience to begin purifying ourselves he said even how pure even as he is pure how perfect even as he is perfect and verse n of 1 John 3 whosoever is born of God whosoever is born of God does not commit sin you might make a mistake then God will correct you and we repent again and you keep traveling in this journey Perfection he says whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God oh these are the kind of scriptures that you read over and over and over and each time it keeps connecting more and more with all that's written let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this morning for We Are beholding what manner of love that you that you the father have given us and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated behold what manner of love that the father has given us God's love as we spoke and the measure of his love is his longsuffering towards us in St John 3 and verse three we read where Jesus he he said you must be born again he told Nicodemus he says or you cannot see the kingdom of God we unless we be born again we cannot see why we must seek and look for Holiness for honesty for Fidelity for meekness to be merciful these are the things in our Christian walk that give us the victory over the flesh we read in Ephesians 4 and if you'll turn with me once again Ephesians 4 verse 30 Apostle Paul adding more detail to the to the love of God to the Born Again experience to the things that the baptism of the Holy Ghost takes from us and in verse 30 of Ephesians 4 Paul says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed until the day of redemption now verse 30 was a was a kind of a closing statement uh and and it had to do with the 29 verses before no with all the with all those 29 verses from 1 to 29 verse 30 was a kind of a closing statement so so in in verse 30 he Paul says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption this baptism of the Holy Ghost that doesn't come just once it's not not a onetime experience it is a first time experience it is a first time experience but it's not a one-time experience It's Time After Time After Time that this baptism of the Holy spirit with fire that is cleansing us it's cleansing us of this old nature the very reason we must be born again there is a reason it's because our first birth the natural birth is the curse that fell on the human race that fell on Adam's CH Adam's children that fell on Eve's children that also brought brought forth a Generation of Vipers the children of the devil so that's why we must be born again but if there is a teaching in the Bible that the that the religious World fights it's this teaching on the serpent seed it's this teaching that the good seed are the children of God and that the tears is the children of the devil and those are quotes from The Bible and yet they refuse to believe the religious World wants to believe we're all good we're all good we're all God's children and no matter how you die no matter how you die no no no matter how ungodly a life you lived at everyone's [Music] funeral you might have been a horrible gangster and they at your funeral they say he's resting now in the hands of Jesus I've been in those funerals but that's not the truth there are the children of God and they are children of the devil but the entire human race has been corrupted with the high breeding of the family of God Ephesians 4:30 says and grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption then he said then you might ask why he says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby you are sealed unto the day of redemption what are the ways we could grieve the holy spirit in our life what are the way bitterness verse 31 bitterness wrath anger clamor evil speaking Paul says put it away from you and all malice verse 32 then how do we keep the Holy Spirit close to us how do we keep his presence around us and in our Gatherings together and he says Be Kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you wow wow God rich in Mercy behold what manner of love that the father has given us in the beginning there in Eden Eve reasoned with the serpent uh on on the path or the way to bring forth the family of God the serpent didn't present a whole different plan to no he presented the same plan that they were to bring forth the family of God but he told her I've got a I've got a better way I've got a faster way and I've got a way that instead of Adam teaching you you'll be able to go teach Adam now so he reasoned with the serpent about the way that God's family would be to existence she should have known that that Adam had to be included in this way and to exclude her husband was a great mistake but the serpent inspired of Lucifer his way talk to Eve his way that was taught to Eve was a lie that brought death to every living thing on planet Earth Satan had a way he was a way but he was also the lie and he was death Jesus is is also a way Jesus is also the way but he's also the truth and he's also life Lucifer used the serpent to inject his seed into the human race to genetically modify it the natural man the family of God with the de with with the characteristics of this most subtile Beast most subal beast of the field this was The Missing Link in between the animal kingdom and man reasoned with the thought how that her and Adam would bring forth a generation of the family of God had Eve looked at the pattern had Eve looked see Eva of God's of God's word over the past six days of creation and now she was living in the seventh day she would have said okay now so far God has done everything he's brought everything to pass by the power of the spoken word that was the pattern had she stopped to look at the pattern in the word of God and she stopped to look at the pattern of how God was doing everything the creation she would have realized well that's the way God will bring it to pass that's how me and AD me and Adam will bring forth the family of God by the spoken word because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and surely if had she thought for a moment she would have said surely we will follow we will follow in his footprints that's how we must think today as we read the word what's the pattern how will we come to Perfection following his footsteps do what he did instead she took the devil's way a shortcut that was a line and brought death Eve gave her sacred virtue her virginity to the serpent another man but she did it but but she did it when she was Adam's bride Adam's wife but before the wedding day she gave her sacred virtue to another there is the fornication that Jesus spoke of in Matthew 19 when he said that when he gave only one reason why a man could could leave his wife and marry another and that reason was for fornication you see the answer this was the type of fornication he was speaking of when he said fornication Webster's Dictionary doesn't have the answer you if you can't you you can't look into the dictionaries and find the definition you've got to go back to the pattern of God's word and when you see the pattern of God's word then then God's word interprets its own word what happened in Genesis interpreted the word fornication for us you can't use human reasoning so it was fornication that Jesus said when a woman is engaged when when when a woman is betr as it says in the Bible then then there's a time that she prepares herself she's she is the bride once engaged she is the man's wife cuz she she's made a promise to him and he's made a promise to her and in the eyes of God they're husband and wife so she is the wife but she's also the bride because the Bride is a wife preparing herself the bride is is a wife the bride is the wife preparing herself for the wedding day but she still has her sacred trust until that day that the husband will take her to live with him forever but that's why why Jesus called what Eve did fornication because Eve though she was Adam's wife gave her sacred trust to another man but she was the wife but they but Adam and Eve had not come together yet so that's the fornication that Jesus spoke of that a man could divorce his wife and marry another outside of that there are no reason there is no Bible or scriptural reason for which a man can leave his wife divorce her and marry another oh they they they can separate they can divorce but he can't marry again unless it be for this reason of for this kind of fornication that the woman would commit so now so now it's no longer a man can divorce his wife and marry another for any reason he doesn't have any reason he wants anymore he has just one reason and if this isn't the reason once he marries he cannot remarry but but unless you be born again you cannot see this so you'll live like the rest of the world marrying and divorcing and marrying and divorcing oh brother Daniel you mean uh the the the Catholic people or or the Baptist people or the Pentecostal people no no no I I mean I mean the message people so Eve betrothed to Adam engaged to be married Adam's bride commits an act of fornication she gives her virginity to another man instead of her husband but she was already engaged she was Adam's bride Lucifer uses the serpent which the Bible says is a beast a mammal m not a reptile and he but he was the most subtile beast of the field the most subtle he was more subtle than the chimpanzee he was beyond that he was a man to look at the serpent was a one of a kind Beast the serpent was a the he was the only kind of his [Music] type there was no Mrs serpent you would say wait a minute brother Daniel the Bible says he he he made all the the the animals of the Kingdom male and female made he them and he did except for this one this one was made for a purpose so that when God gave his children free moral agency then there'd be something for them to choose between if I tell you I'm going to let you choose what you would like to eat for lunch today and here I've got a hamburger and here I got a hamburger they both got mayonnaise the meat a little bit of lettuce and tomato but I want you to choose what you want to eat so of these two which one would you like well I'm I'm telling you I'm giving you a choice but I'm but but in reality there is no choice but no but God said I'm going to give you a choice that we'll be able to choose between Good and Evil now this one of a kind Beast now this serpent who was a one of a kind with no Mrs serpent now you say where did God ever do that before because there must be a pattern of it then so we go to the Bible and we read on the about Jonah and Jonah is on a ship on his way to Tarsus and and the great storm hits them and the storm is so great that they know it's going to destroy the ship and kill all they began to say what's wrong who has sinned and Jonah stands up being an honest man he says I'm the one at fault he says if you cast me over he says this storm will be calmed they struggled with it a little but he said no you must for the rest of you to be saved and they throw him over the ship and they see a great fish come up and swallow him and they said and the and the storm calms down they said surely this man was the guilty one but Jonah lives in this fish for three days like because it was a type and a shadow of Christ that he would be three days in the earth and then rise up again Jonah was was a type of this the Bible says that God made this created this fish this was a special creation there was no other fish in the ocean like it there will never be another one like it it was a one of a kind of this species it was a whale that could swallow a man and the man would could was able to live inside of this fish for three days then the fish would be led of God to take the prophet to the beach of Nineveh open his mouth and the prophet walk out of the fish and when the people of Neva worshiped the fish God saw no saw Jonah walk out of this fish's mouth they said surely this is a prophet sent of God to us and whatever he tells us we're going to do it but this was a one-of-a kind fish there was no Mrs fish or maybe it was a Mrs fish but there was no Mr Fish this was a one of a kind fish for this event that would take place for prophecy to come to pass so here we have this serpent a one of a kind there was not two of them there was not a m one he said and the turent approaches Eaves and and brings forth so the serpent and brings forth a generation of serpents by planting his seed in Adam's virgin bride this was the fall of mankind this was the curse that Jesus died on the cross of calvary to give us the victory over through a born again experience because the natural [Music] birth was introduced to Adam and Eve through the serpent God wanted them to bring forth the family of God by the spoke spoken word like Jesus was born like he came into this world and when he came he gave us that that birth back again to every son and daughter of God to put away the curse of the natural so that so that he could change and mold us for us to become the clay in his hands and the Potter form us into his very image this was the fall of mankind the sex birth this continues to be the fall of every relationship between man and woman and the fall of every family for for the natural birth brings natural characteristics of the serpent this is why Jesus Jesus said in Matthew 13 and verse 38 he said the field is the world this say uh Matthew 13:38 he said the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom so there there is one seed and the good seed are the children of the Kingdom but the tears are the children of the wicked one two seeds two generations it's not just a metaphor it happened go the the the human race was mixed with the seed of the serpent the the family of God was mixed with the seed of the serpent that's why when we're born we suffer anger and wrath and lies and stealing and and and to be abusive with each other because we've been mixed with that seed that's why we must be born again to break the curse natural and spiritual verse 38 said but the tears are the children of the wicked [Music] one these this is Jesus speaking so who is the wicked one then all you have to do is read the next verse verse 39 Matthew 13:39 the Bible says the enemy that slded them is the devil it's his seed the seed of God and the seed of the serpent but only the seed of God only Sons and Daughters of God can be born again what happened in Eden God gave them a commandment on how to keep the victory instead they took the devil's lie my way is better he said my way is more fun he said my way will be faster than God's way but his way was a [Music] lie and his way brought death Jesus Jesus said I am the way but my way is the truth and my way is life God rich in Mercy behold what manner of love behold what manner of love that the father has given us so that we can have the victory in Christ Jesus we had read we read in the Book of Joshua of the story of Israel when they were getting ready to cross into the Promised Land and and Joshua begins to admonish Israel and Joshua 23 and verse one and it says then it came to pass a long time after the Lord had given rest unto Israel from all their enemies roundabout that Joshua waxed old and stricken and age ACC they they were experiencing a great peace because they experienced great victories because Joshua had kept them in the word he says and and verse two and Joshua called for for all Israel and for their elders and for their heads and for their judges for their officers and said unto them I am well stricken in age and ye have seen all that the Lord your God hath done unto all these nations because of you for the Lord your God is he that has fought for you in other words we've had great victories in verse six Joshua says be ye therefore very courageous to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses that she turn not aside from there from to the right hand or to the left he says that you come not among these nations verse 7 the these that remain among you he says neither make mention of the name of their gods nor cause to swear by them neither serve them no B nor bow yourselves unto them he said the Nations that are left the struggles that you have in your life need a total separation from every Temptation from every person who isn't who isn't helping you to grow in Christ and verse eight he tells them but cleave unto the Lord but cleave unto the Lord verse eight your God as ye have done unto this day Joshua 238 take good heed therefore verse 11 unto yourselves that you love the Lord your God as we told you last service that's how we keep the victory you don't let your love grow cold for God that's how you keep the victory you don't let your love grow cold for your wife you don't let your love grow cold for your husband you don't let your love grow cold for your children you don't let your love grow cold for your parents you don't let your love grow cold for the household of God in Matthew 24 and verse 12 as we read we'll read it again an an end time prophecy Matthew 24 and verse 12 and in the last days this is a revelation that was brought to us under the opening of The Seven Seals because a prophet taught us that here in Matthew 24 Jesus was preaching the Seven Seals in a parable and Jesus says in verse 12 and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold in this so-called message Joshua said you remember he said take heed to yourselves that you that she love the the Lord your God because that's how you're going to keep the victory in Joshua 24 and verse 14 Joshua continues to admonish Israel I'm going to start he says Joshua 24:14 now therefore fear the lord and serve him in sincerity and Truth in spirit and in truth that's how we say it today and put away the gods which your father served on the other side of the flood and in Egypt and serve ye the Lord then he makes this great statement that we've all read many times and if it seem evil unto you to serve the Lord choose ye this day whom ye will serve it's what happened in Eden CH Eve made a choice whom she was going to serve and the one she chose to serve brought death to her and the whole family of God through a lie that he told her he he said choose ye this day whom ye will serve whether the gods which your father served that were on the other side of the flood or the gods of the amorites in whom land ye dwell but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord hidden in the allegory of this of this of this book of Joshua is our lives also and as he said and he made this bold statement but as for me and my house we will serve the Lord It's what each and every one of us it's the Revelation and the conviction that we must have verse 16 of Matthew 24 listen to what the people said and the people answered and said God forbid that we should forsake the Lord to serve other gods that's what they said now the Book of Joshua as we as we mentioned it was a book of victory victory through love Victory through faith Victory through obedience but what followed This Book of Judges was a book of defeat that records Israel's defeat for over 300 years 12 men and one woman judges of Israel but nonetheless though they had men to judge them they didn't have a prophet to lead them so the result was not Victory but defeat after defeat Israel as we said was in a cycle and it just didn't start at this time no Adam and Eve fell into this cycle this very same cycle that's been that that that's with that's with the human race yet today it's a cycle of men both young and old the cycle is rebellion retribution repentance then God restores and then what does man do what then what does man do he falls again a week later a month later a year later five years later once again falls into Rebellion retribution repentance then God restores again and without the Born Again experience every man every woman we will live in this cycle it's a cycle of Fallen man under the law without a born again experience without the baptism of the Holy Ghost a cycle of mankind a cycle of a people lost in sin so judges a book of defeat and not victories remember what Israel said God forbid that we ever forsake Him we we'll follow him we'll stay with the word we'll do everything that what's written in the book of the law and in verse 21 of Judges it begins with the Tribe of Benjamin as remember Benjamin was the youngest and it says this in verse 21 of Judges one says and the children of of benj and the children of Benjamin did not drive out the jebusites judges 121 but they were supposed to but that's what God's word called for them to do and they said when Joshua was alive we will do it he said but the jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day this this day as in 2024 with Hamas in the holy land with Arabs in the holy land with with with with the great Muslim temple sitting where Solomon's Temple once stood Salomon is now a Muslim temple they did not put them out they're still in this cycle of mankind we go on to read verse 27 that Manasses did the same thing that Benjamin had done we read in verse 29 we read in verse 29 that Ephraim did the same thing they didn't drive out the Canaanites and and we read in verse 30th that neither did Zebulon drive out the inhabitants it said but the Canaanites dwell among them and became tributaries tributaries that means we have a I just came up with a better idea [Music] said we're going to do what Benjamin did because I went and talk to him and they've made tributaries of all the Canaanites in their land and he showed me the bank account they're making billions off of these people so it don't make no sense to drive these people out this is money we'll be able to make a better streets why we'll even have a social social security program for the old people but it wasn't God's way it was man's way in verse 31 it said neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants for they were seeing dollar signs also in verse 33 he says and naali it didn't he didn't drive them out either they all thought what Benjamin had done was was working great they said we'll watch Benjamin how it's going for him he said have you seen the car that Benjamin's driving now wow there's money to be made with these foreign Gods foreign Gods there's money to be made we don't have to serve their foreign Gods we just have to let them live in our homes and play with our children they were in total Disobedience they they were to thus sayith the Lord then in Judges chapter 2 a messenger was sent an angel of God and it says in verse one and an angel of the Lord came up from gilgal to Bim and said I made you to go up out of Egypt and have brought you into the land which I swear unto your fathers and I said I will never break my Covenant with you I won't break my Covenant with you but you have something to do ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land you won't cut any deals you you won't get up and you won't get involved in all their religious ceremonies you will you will live a life totally separate from them he said as a matter of fact ye shall throw down their altars but ye have not obeyed my voice you have made a you have made a league with the [Music] inhabitants you haven't thrown down their altars you've let them build those altars in your those Pagan altars in your hearts and Minds he said you haven't obeyed my voice for God always has a voice for his children and then he said why have you done this in verse three before they could answer they knew why they had done it because they had taken on a spirit of disobedience and in verse three God said the messenger to Israel says this Angel wherefore I also said I will not drive them out of your hearts or out of your minds because you're the one that's been inviting them to come in but they shall be thorns in your sides and their gods these serpents shall be a snare unto you they will hinder they will hinder your Christian walk and your personal relationship with with Jesus Christ your lord your savior but in the midst of this time of judges in Israel when the church was continually in this cycle of death when they couldn't keep the victory that they had when Joshua was alive in the midst of this time of Judges there was an NE lady whom the spirit of the Lord was moving upon not the church the bride her name was Ruth she was a moabit she was a gentile she wasn't coming in under the law but it was her love for Naomi remember Ruth lived during the time of the judges but she wasn't living in the cycle that they were living of death and through the troubles and trials the woes and misfortunes this little Ruth her love didn't wax cold it waxed stronger and stronger for the testimony of Naomi her mother-in-law and her love for Jehovah though she wasn't a Jew but she seen in Naomi a faithful Jewish woman that surely of a woman can have this kind of love only her God could give it and Ruth said I want that she's got something I don't have and I want that so Ruth was inspired by the love and the strength of this woman in the Book of Ruth chapter one in the Book of Ruth chapter one and verse 16 Ruth speaking to Naomi here Ruth and Ruth said entreat me not to leave thee or to return from following after thee for whether thou goest I will go and where thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people shall be my people and thy God my God then she goes on speaking even a stronger statement where thou dest will I die and there will I be buried the Lord do so to me and more also if if ought but death part Ruth wasn't living in the leodan cycle under death under Rebellion under retribution under repentance and then restoration again all this under this humanistic realm under the law Ruth was living in a bright age and yet she didn't know it but that's what was pulling her something was pulling her when she didn't even know where it was pulling her too but one day she'd see it she got pulled in to the presence of Boaz who would become her husband who would restore her and Naomi to everything things they had ever lost lost and even more Eve Ruth didn't know it that what was pulling her in was the groom to be her bride it was Supernatural Ruth was living in the bride age under the voice of the Archangel Under The Voice she had gone from Revelations 3:19 you go back and read it and she had gone and found herself in Revelations 32-22 go back and read it she had gone from Revelations 10:7 she'd moved up to Revelations 108 to1 people want you to believe ministers want you to believe that that that that your calling stopped at Revelations 10:7 but the Bible says that there's four more verses after the seventh angel leaves a scene it's the bride age it's Ruth entering into a marriage with the lamb Revelations 108 to1 is the is the bride age it's the marriage of the Lamb it doesn't end for us at Revelations 107 now it goes on to be a personal experience to bring forth the family of God for Adam and Eve fell short but this little bride will not fall short a second Adam will not fall short he will bring forth the family of God and he's bringing it forth one at a time by a born again experience by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Fire by refilling after refilling he has made a vow unto his bride I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you until I have made you perfect even as I am perfect Ruth was Liv living under an open book where there was plenty to eat when the book came open when the book came open for Ruth her days of famine were over Ruth found herself in Bethlehem at Harvest time you go back and read the book of Ruth Ruth would never again hunger and thirst for righteousness Ruth would never again Ruth hunger and thirst for righteousness and have to go away hungry little Ruth there's 66 books in the Bible there's over 1,200 recorded messages to help make clear how you can be perfect even as the father which is in heaven and look at the Modern events that we're seeing today through Bible prophecy and have no fear because we know that God's not trying to make America great again or any other Nation he is focused on one little lady you to make you great again and what could be greater and and what could be greater than for you to recognize that you are the bride of Christ in Ruth chapter 2 Ru verse 14 now we see Boaz in the picture and it reads like this in verse [Music] 14 and Boaz said unto her at Meal Time Come Thou hither and eat of the bread and dip thy morsel in the vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers and he reached her parched corn and she did eat and was sufficed and left and when she was risen up to glean Boaz commanded his young man the ministers the fful ministry saying to them let her glean even among the sheaves and reproach her not if she's seen more than you minister don't hold her back it's just her having a personal experience with me don't reproach her don't tell her wait a minute you can't get no higher than the pastor oh yes she can if the pastor won't go higher you can go higher get in the word you might have to find another Pastor if you want to keep going higher but you are an individual with Christ and if God's showing you more then to God be the glory I know that's very very different maybe what you've been taught before in verse 16 then Boaz tells the fful ministry and let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her and leave them that she may glean them and rebuke her not twice he commanded his young men twice he commanded the fful ministry don't rebuke the church for wanting to go higher and deeper Ruth had drink Ruth had drank her milk Ruth had done her ABC don't hold Ruth back she's going all the way this little bride in chapter three of This Book of Ruth this is unfolding during the time of the judges this is unfolding in 2024 this is unfolding when churches and people are falling apart this is a metaphor this is happening today it it may be happening in your life it should be happening in your life Ruth chapter 3 verse one then her mother-in-law said unto her my daughter shall I not seek rest for thee that it may be well with thee then she says and now is not Boaz our Kindred and who and whose maidens thou was behold he wioth barley tonight in the threshing floor he's going to be in the Garden of Gethsemane tonight and he's going to have you heavy on his heart and he's going to pray for you his little bride his daughter his son at this threshing Flor called Gethsemane and for an hour all he can think about is you and he and he's thinking I can't let her die I'll give my life for her verse two and now is not Boaz our kindred with who with whose handmaids thou was behold he went with barley tonight at the threshing floor he's going to pray all he's going to pray through the night at Gethsemane tonight and he's praying for you he's praying that you and him can have a union an invisible Union verse three wash thyself therefore in other words repent and be baptized and anoint thee with oil receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and put thy reignment upon thee all the word of God God and get thee down to the floor but make not thyself known unto the man until he hath done eating and drinking and it shall be when he lith down that thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie Mount Calvary Mark that spot everyone and go there and bow down before the cross of Jesus and look up into his eyes and behold see what love the father has given us and it shall be when he lith down Thou shalt Mark the place where he shall lie there at Calvary and thou shalt go in and uncover his feet and lay thee down and he will tell thee what to do this is what he told us what to do Revelations chapter 3yp and verse 19 this is Boaz telling us what to do little Ruth as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will s with him and he with me that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne bride and groom together even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne every little Ruth that has an ear let her hear what the spirit is speaking to her heart this morning what manner of love is this that he has given the bride these great promises unconditional promises Holy Ghost promises unfailing promises Eternal promises and then in our lives no more Rebellion no more retribution no more under the law but in Divine love and now even as Ruth Ruth found herself in Divine love she was deciding she was serving she rested and God rewarded her no law but love no book but the Bible no Creed but Christ why does Satan want you to live in the four hours four hours Rebellion repution repentance restoration a cycle of death because it is a cycle of death and iniquity we read Matthew 24 and verse2 and said because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold but for the bride not the church is something different 1 John 3:1 for this little bride of Christ for you and I for the spiritual Ruth root John 31 behold what manner of love the father has bestowed on you this morning that you and I could be called the Sons of daughters of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are you the sons of God and it do not yet appear what we shall be but we know that we know that we know that when he shall appear we're going to be just like him for we shall see him as he is we shall see him Jesus Christ God bless William brandom and he did but it's not him that we're looking to see again we're looking to see our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ verse three and every one of you this morning that have this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure and verse n whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he's born of God and the blood of Jesus Christ washes away every stain God is so good as we stand to our feet this morning let's pray Heavenly Father we can indeed see the love of God that you've given us and through a born again experience we are growing in Grace separating ourselves from the
