and bring to us God's [Music] word God bless you let's just bow our heads for a moment before we just get started I pray that you're you're happy to be in the house of the Lord I don't believe it's by chance but I believe that God had this in his mind before the foundation of the world our mind might not understand it but we understand that he's a perfect God and he has all things in his control amen amen let's just bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord I pray this morning Lord that you soften our hearts Lord that we would be able to receive your word seed good ground this is not something that man's done this is something that you by a Divine promise have come and performed this work and it's not man it's not made with hands of clay but it's your Eternal Word so Lord as we just sit together here as a family as a body Lord you're the one that could break the bread you're the one that could give us the wine Lord where we can have the stimulation of Revelation Lord where we would be able to just sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus and that where your name could be glorified where we could worship you Lord where we can recognize you by your attributes Lord we can see you in the beauty of your word oh Lord I pray you bless us tonight Lord Lord that you anoint the congregation Lord that you anoint Lord your servants Lord that you anoint my brother Lord a translator Lord and that the Holy Ghost and that the Holy Ghost would come and reveal the word to our hearts and that we would receive it with gladness and that we will rejoice Lord that the word of God changes our attitude our hearts and our Lord we invite you this morning we ask that you be with us in Jesus Christ name amen amen we greet you one more time in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's a privilege to be here and um I like Arizona you know Texas is a little colder now these days Arizona's got the sunshine we came with rain but now we're leaving with Sunshine God bless you um for the ones that weren't here yesterday my name is brother Cosman Stefan H Stefan we're from the Dallas Fort Worth area D Fort Worth we go to Christian Life Tabernacle Christian Life our pastor Brother David McGary David McGary and um we thank the Lord that he's United us as a family not just there but also here what unites us together what would be the purpose to even Gather in a place like this the things of man to talk about just what's going on with Santa Claus to just have a sticker on our chest to say that we can preach the gospel none of that will ever exist in the Lord It's the word of God that remain the word of God that has life and and when we gather together we eat out of the same bread we drink out of the same wine and now we're feeding each other we are sitting together we are fellowshipping on the things that God has opened to us in this generation privilege it's a privilege I'm here with my beautiful wife we we have four four daughters um and then she's she's conceiving and I'm having my promised son and we're really excited about that we just thank you again for brother Daniel and the invitation he's made for us and I'll say it this way let the word of God be the center of our life these meetings are beautiful and they're good but don't let it stop here don't let this be the end of it let this be something that would get you closer to the to the Lord where now you could search for him closer where now you can dig into the word deeper now your life could line up with the word of God amen amen amen let's just turn to our scriptures we'll just read Hebrews chapter 1 verses 1 through 4 and keep your Bibles out we we're just going to walk through scripture we're going to continue from last night and so we're just walking into this direction to us a son was given amen amen so let's just read verses 1 through 4 and you can have your seat God who has suned times and in diver manners spake in the time passed unto the fathers by the prophets had in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he had appointed Heirs of air of All Things by whom also he made the world who being the brightness of his glory and the expressed image of his person now think about this the express image of his person God and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high being made so much better than the angels as a as he had by inheritance obtained a more excellent Name than they Lord we just ask a blessing upon the word we ask for more time that you would be with us that you would have a special anointing on your word Jesus Christ name amen God bless you you can have your SE so as we were talking about last night just to just to uh come to an image to bring us up to where we were last night there was a promise that was given to Isaiah the word was spoken by a prophet the Prophet was able to prophesy what would come to pass and this word this logos started traveling and it traveled and there was a day when Christ decided for this word to take flesh and it took flesh in the virgin's womb now the love of the Virgin was let it be to me according to your will humility she wanted she wanted to know that this is what's happening I'm sure she knew the law I'm sure she read the law I'm sure she understood that something like this would probably take place so when the angel came to her she didn't question it she believed upon the word of God and she knew that if she believes on this word that the Holy Ghost will fulfill it she walked with her attitude knowing that it's not her but it's God that will send the holy ghost that would lead her okay okay so now this promised son has been given to us you know today's Eve you know the Christmas Eve is what people say tonight is the night where Santa Claus goes through the U the chimney I'm sorry this is this is what the world believes we just have to be honest so this man that's overweight tries to squeeze down this this chimney to bring gifts to our children right to give gifts so that way when they open the gifts they will feel happy they will feel rejoiced they would be they would be rejoicing we catch away their attention from the meaning of what life means substitut it to a worldly pleasure think about it a substitute to take away the joy in the Lord place it into something that has death now now of course it will make him happy but eventually they'll get bored eventually gets thrown away so what did that do you see the substitution you see the ways of man you see where it goes you see the direction that it's going and it's a story it's not a true story it's a f story it's something that has no life so now people are trying to teach our children that there's this this Santa actually if you turn the letters between them it's Satan they just have to put the a with the T and then it's right it's there but he comes as an angel of Light he wants to deceive he's he's he's a lie there's no truth in him he's an accuser he's a blamer he's the one that tries to get you to fall right amen and then there's a son that lifts you up that puts you in Heavenly places that gives you life amen amen so this is what people believe what Christmas is now just like we mentioned yesterday [Music] the prophet says that Jesus was not born in the month of December because it was too cold in Judea for that month to be able to be born in a barn like that but Jesus was born around April or May right because that's when the Shepherds were be on the field that's when the barn would be and it it wasn't cold so so now the son that came had a power and he created the world by this power so think about this the very word that was prophesied that came into Mary was a word but the word had to be anointed for it to take flesh the life of Jesus Christ had to be anointed by the Holy Ghost for it to take flesh so I want to continue tonight or this morning and talk to you about the anointed word the anointed word because the word of God will never remain dead when something that God had spoken has to come to pass right amen who it says verse two in in Hebrews we continue had in this last days spoken unto us by his son whom he had appointed heir of All Things by whom he also made the [Applause] world the son made the world Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever who be in the brightness of his glory Express image of his expressed image of his person upholding on things by the word of his power and he had by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high now when a man's born again he receives the spirit of Christ and now it's no longer him that live it but it's Christ that lives inside of him amen so now I have to die my burden my cross is to let go of all I have pick up my cross and follow him because the foot footsteps of the righteous they're ordered of the Lord so how do you know the Lord unless you walk in his footsteps what did he do he sacrificed himself he let everything go of what he desired and he had you in his mind and as he was walking his Road he was thinking about you because he knew knew that out of him had to come a bride so he suffered he let go of his selfishness he let go of his pride for me and you so we can take his footsteps walk only by what he shows us through his word amen amen now listen to what brother Braham says here 1964 and I want I want you to catch uh the vision here the anointed word the word was given it took flesh and then the word had to be Anointed The Same Spirit that was in Christ Jesus if he dwells in US mortal bodies that's what that word does Qui your moral body it takes us from death brings us into life every day every moment not just one time it's a process a masterpiece becomes more beautiful the more you work on it the more detail it has in its character the more he presents the image that was in the mind of God and Jesus Christ was the expressed image of God that came in a spoken word seed that would be perfect a spot with a wrinkle that would be an overcomer and live a perfect life so I can overcome so I can overcome because he's the only way to overcome now listen to this because sometimes people could take things out of context I want you to catch the humility of the prophet and how he tries to keep the balance of what's important my brother Bram could could Jesus look like you or you be Jesus or something like that he said says one sense of the word that's exactly the truth another sense of the word is an antichrist okay so in one sense of the word is true but on the other side of the sense the let's follow this that's the difference between right and wrong to make me the person of the Lord Jesus Christ that would be an antichrist for that person of the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of God of the right hand of the Majesty of on high and will come again in a great power and Glory but for his life that was in him being upon me and upon you who have him it's exactly the truth you become Christ remember my message on Messiah says the word Messiah means the anointed one now there you are if you have the Holy Spirit you become the anointed one amen amen amen amen amen now listen to this he keeps going then there's all kinds of anointed ones now watch if a Bible anointed one many of them are anointed the whole thing is in such a great conglomeration and every kind of mixup and Satan with all his cunningness they come in and impersonate it justed to the dot it says almost to the dot there's only one way you can absolutely be sure so remember this there's also impersonators around us they're also anointed they're anointed and so now because they're anointed we have to know the true from the false and how is it that we're going to do that now listen to The Prophet it says it says there's only one way you can absolutely be sure word by word word by word that's the only way you can you'll know them by their character you'll know them by their fruits and it's not just words it's not just saying it's not just testifying about it it's a way of living it's a way of life it's a way of how we carry our atmosphere now listen to this he says that's the only way word by word word by word it says say but to me as a person William Bram or any other man or woman to be the Lord Jesus Christ Our that is an error but to be Anointed with the spirit which brings his own person of his life into you amen amen he says let this life that was in Jesus Christ be in you this is the life that we carry this is the life that was restored into our generation the life of Jesus Christ the restoration of the Holy Ghost not only in spirit not only in the Pentecostal move I was the Pentecostal I'm sorry I was a Pentecostal and I grew up around Pentecostals and there's things that Pentecostal denominated on that that remained in the tradition of Pentecost but never wanted to move forward they received the word because what they did is they sold out for a sensation they sold out for a move I wasn't there I was involved I knew exactly what was happening and there was something inside my heart Lord there's something more than this came to the altar so many times I come out and I go out again something's not changing I keep I I'm come to the altar every service I find myself a sinner every service but Lord something's got to change me I keep I can't stay in this condition any longer and then the word came and the word changed me without sensation all all of a sudden one day this let go this let go this let go you just lose the taste because the more of him and the less of you the more you lose yourself but how is it that we can do that by watching television by being on Facebook Facebook by being on Snapchat by posting videos by losing our time and then here's God wanting to have a relationship with his bride we're too busy I'm too busy I never have that I I never have I never make time for the Lord I wake up in the morning I'm all stressed out all I start going to work things go wrong my attitudes gets bad all of a sudden I come home I'm disappointed and I just realized that my day didn't start right maybe if I would have got up and stayed on my knees for a little bit and ask the Lord for his Blessing and said Lord be with me today anoint me today what would you have for me today Lord what can I do for you today how is it that you can feed me today this morning this bread of life because we have to eat bread every day every day we have to eat if you don't eat every day let me ask you a question if we're soldiers in the army of God and we're supposed to be with faith muscles how are we going to overcome a battle when we're only eating twice a week and even then we don't really eat because we come for the entertainment I would be a skeleton the natural right if I will only eat twice a week on Wednesdays and I wouldn't even be able to I wouldn't even have the energy to stand up before you I wouldn't even be able to I mean if if this brother came to me and pushed me I would fall down so how can we fight in the spiritual how is it how is it that I can fight in all the battles that come across to me if I don't have the word if I don't have the sword if I don't have the shield I don't have the helmet of salvation if I don't have if I don't have the armor of God I I will never overcome that's why it's important to be constantly Fellowship Jesus Christ 1964 when Jesus was on Earth he said he was the word of God they condemned him he said why would you condemn me when I say I am the Son of God when you called those who the word came to God Abraham was considered a god Elijah was a god Isaiah was a God because the word of God came to them and they were in portion it says Gods Jesus said they were he said you call them Gods now you see when the man was was anointed like Joseph he portrayed Christ Moses was anointed he portrayed Christ when David was anointed he portrayed Christ all leading up to Christ and he was the fullness of the [Applause] word and the Word was made manifest in him and he was the complete anointed one they had it in portions we have it by portion he was the anointed one the entire plan of God laid in him so when the son was the entire plan of God Amen the fullness of the word it says God's plan before the foundation of the world to redeem a lost world it say was in him he was the word he still the word the same yesterday today and forever it says remember he came to the fathers for the prophets he made himself known through the prophets and in the last day through his son Jesus he was God made manifest am amen amen he was God's made promise and it was manifested not partial the fullness of the God had bodily in his son when he was on the cross he said it is finished and it truly was because he conquered the greatest thing that ever took place and that was death and death by Revelation to the Bride of Jesus Christ is life amen that's right but it takes Revelation to see that life you can't intellectually try to produce the life without dying death let's turn to First John verses 18 to 24 the anointed word there was a son that was given by a promise the promise came testified it was anointed and now he dwells Among Us is in us so listen to what John says here in first John my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but indeed and in truth so first John 3: 18 and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him now listen to this for if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our heart know all things beloved if our heart condemn us not then we have confidence towards God so if the heart condemn us then God is greater than our heart and he knowth all things but the beginning of Life comes with repentance the beginning of Life comes with death so yes we make mistakes and God is greater than our mistakes and he forgives our mist mistakes and we learn from our mistakes but don't do it again you know a mistake cannot be a mistake if you do it over and over and over sorry at that point it's it's no longer used by a mistake a mistake is when you do something and and you find yourself as as doing it without even realizing you're doing it and then God comes and condemns you and then you repent and you leave those things behind but when you keep doing the same thing over and over that's called iniquity amen so if your heart condemns you God is greater than your heart and he knows all things so therefore by repentance by by dying to ourselves God could God could give us the confidence but if our heart condemn us not if our life is lined with the word of God God is the center of my life if now I pray if now I eat if now I grow now we can have confidence now you can have confidence just like I could have confidence in my wife knowing that she would make the right choice I trust her she trusts me she knows that if I was to go across the sea that I wouldn't do something that would hurt her that I wouldn't be disobedient to her that I would keep to my veil all the days of my life I wouldn't go live against her and she would know that and she would know me that's the point of relationship the confidence the more that God can trust you with his word the more you can put your confidence in him and he comes upon the scene for you every time because his word is Everlasting Saints the word of God never changes people change things change atmosphere is changing God never changes his word never changes it's the same word it's the same word and this is how we walk by the word of God amen amen and this is his commandment 23 let's go 22 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him because we keep his Commandments and do those things that are pleasing in his sight and this is his Commandment that we should believe on the name of his son Jesus Christ and love one another as he gave us Commandments and he that keepeth his Commandments dwelleth in him and he in him you see the relationship the Union between the bride and the groom amen you respect him you reverence him your reverence is you he comes upon the Saints he brings your deliverance he brings your healing he brings all that you have need of all you got to do is seek the kingdom of God but how can you have confidence if you don't have a relationship amen amen it's all into the relationship and hereby we know that he abided in Us by the spirit which he had given us the spirit of Truth amen Amen brother Bram says this in the token it says now it says now you are his because he is we have the right to all that he had purchased for us the word of God it says every promise in the Bible is yours it belongs to you when this token is upon you and God has sealed you now it says we want to check oursel just for a moment when God has give you the true baptism of the Holy Spirit then the life of Jesus Christ is within you now that's true and every theolog will have to admit that to be yes sir it's a new birth you are born a new of the Holy Ghost and because that God had did this and you know you're no good in yourself and you accept what God has did then he seals you into his kingdom by the Holy Spirit and everything that Jesus purchased and promised you in the Bible is yours it's your property because it's paid for it says amen amen life is mine he paid for it life is yours he paid for it healing is mine he paid for it healing is yours he paid for it freedom is mine he paid for it Heaven is mine he paid for it he paid the price everything he purchase belongs to the man that holds the token he holds the token it says pass my token upon the street car on that Judgment Day it says on that day of the Judgment it says I'll come pass over you it says holding it in holding your confession in that word that Jesus Christ has died for you and when he does it he displays himself through you it says yes when you recognize the token the life that it took for the blood to speak it's the blood that spoke for Abel out of the ground the blood was speaking out of that son it's the blood that was shed upon this world that by the power of the Holy Ghost when a cleanse the born against believer now could could could could ask anything in go in in the name of Jesus Christ it's no longer the man that's speaking but it's the blood that's interceding and is speaking for you so what do you have need of today what do you have need of today apply the token the anointed word how are you approaching the word how is your reverence to the word time are you giving to yourself to the word amen amen our life should be a worship the service is not where we you know a lot of time in the church service we consider the worship service the song service but Worship Is A Life That's pleasing to God I can worship in my car I can worship in my bedroom I can worship at my job I can worship while I'm driving I can think about the Lord while I'm eating I can talk to the I can talk to the Lord anytime I want this is the relationship this is the worship when you start dying out to yourself and you continually introduce the word of God amen amen this is him the word amen amen the anointed word so Christmas brought a son there was gifts that was brought to him he was the life of God 100% man says 100% God God the fullness of the godhead bottle he died he resurrected he restor he He restored himself a bride we received the Malachi 45 Ministry re the Revelation 107 Ministry and now the word is continuing now the word is continuing to do what to redeem the bride to get her to the position that she needs to have amen amen because we have to go into a rapture we have to go to a body change that's the promise for this day this is the scripture that we're looking forward to because there's a bride that's going to be caught away and she'll be without spot she'll be without wrinkle she'll be word of his word she be flesh of his flesh should be the very identity of who he is she's not going to be any different the only difference is going to be this Corporal body but it's the same exact spirit it's the same Spirit that's why it has nothing to do with the flesh the flesh will never receive Glory because God does not share his glory with no man but when we recognize what he does he receives our worship so the word of God let's turn to Revelations 19 we're just going to go through the scripture brother Brandon brings some beautiful things out of this and he ties this brother BR ties Revelations 19 Isaiah 9 he takes Isaiah 9 unto us his son is born a child is given okay his name shall be counselor of Peace wonderful Mighty God Everlasting father and he ties this with Revelations 19 so let's see what Revelation 19 tells us the anointed word and after these things I heard a great voice of much people in heaven say saying hallelujah Hallelujah Salvation and Glory and Honor and power unto the Lord Our God for the true and righteous are his judgments for he had judged the great which did corrupt the Earth with her fornication and had Avenged the blood of his servants at her hand and they said again Allelujah Hallelujah and her smoke rose up forever and ever so you realize what the great harot did here she created the fornication okay okay and she Avenged the blood of his servants at her hand she was so deceiving that she was able to to to avenge the blood of his servants and listen to four and the four and 20 elders and the four beasts fell down and worshiped God at his throne on his throne saying amen Allelujah and a voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all his servants and ye that fear Him both small and great you see how important it is the fear of God the rence of the word of God how we handle the word of God how we handle the word of God in our midst and I heard as it was the voice of a great multitude and as the voice of many water and as the voice of Mighty thundering saying hallelujah hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent reth let us be glad and rejoice give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready you see what the word of God does It prepares us the marriage of the Lamb has come the marriage is happening the marriage of the Lamb is happening right now between the bride and the groom this is the union this is the Union I between the word and the word the Deep to the Deep the spirit to the spirit amen this is the union this is the invisible Union and the marriage of the Lamb is come his wife had met herself ready now there's a preparation what are we doing am I looking at my life and preparing my life or am I being dressed in the things of the world and I letting my Wick burn out amen this is the time of Separation this is a time of death this is a time where I have to die out to the things of myself because she has to be ready and just like he was without spot or wrink she also has to be without spot or wrinkle she has to be spot without spot or wrinkle because nothing that that's filthy nothing that's that's that's stain will be able to enter into the kingdom of God so that's why the blood of Jesus Christ is so important for us amen amen to cleanse us from constantly staying under the promised word being washed under the watering of the word so when he comes we're ready amen amen amen now listen to what brother brandham says here Christ is the mystery of God revealed it says then we can see that the marriage supper is at hand this was a very special service to brother brandham and here's what he says now if I never see you again remember the marriage supper is at hand and then the kingdom according to the promise is ready to be issued end the Great Millennium the taking up of the church and the destroying of the wicked and the world under the six seal to be purified by volcanic take over all the corruption sin of the world and to mold her out again again and and bring forth a bright New Millennium for the age that is to come okay are we following along when we see all these great threefold revelation God in Christ Christ in the church the kingdom coming this ISS the three purpose fold of of Christ Christ in his church Christ in God Christ in his church and then the preeminence back into man the restoration of the Kingdom the kingdom of God is within you okay Adam and Eve redeemed back to the Garden of Eden and and the representation of Christ and his bride and then the kingdom is going to be restored according to his promise praise be to God now by the revelation of the threefold mystery the secret and by the personal Vindicated word by his original headship amen by his original headship now listen to this verse eight and to her was granted that she would be a raid and fine linen clean and white for the linen is the righteousness of the Saints light has to shine in darkness there's no doubt about it this whole room could be dark pitch black you turn on the smallest light you can see you can see where you're going all you have to do is choose to turn on the light amen amen choose light the Bible says if I walk in the light as he is in the light we can have Fellowship one with another how can we have Fellowship by constantly sharing the light and the blood of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all unbelief because we're constantly applying the token constantly applying the word con washing we're constantly cleansing we we're constantly dressing we we're constantly dying and all of a sudden you're walking with the Lord and the things of the world just start fading away you start walking like Enoch did before you know you wake up and you're in heaven because it didn't matter if you died because you're going to resurrect anyway it's the spirit that was in Christ Jesus if that Spirit dwells in you it'll Quicken your bodies proving his word now we say he's raised from the dead I didn't say it the word here said it raised from the dead paragraph he said he's the same yesterday today and forever you believe that he promised these things would happen in the last days the same son of man would be made manifest now remember that was not Jesus talking to Abraham there that could discern the thoughts in Sarah's mind behind he says that was not Jesus he had not yet been born but it was a man in human flesh that Abraham called Elohim the great Almighty showing and Jesus said as it was in the days of s now watch close in the days of Sodom so will it be at the coming of the son of man when the son of man is being revealed not no more as a church not no more the bride is called see in that day the son of man will be revealed to join the church to the head to unite the marriage of the Bride the bride goom call will come right through this when the son of man will come down and come in human flesh to unite the two together amen amen the church has to be the word he is the word and the two unites together and to do that it will take the manifestation of the revealing of the son of man not a CL man those are Creeds and doctrines it's Amen the life of Jesus Christ it says do you see what I mean it's the son of man Jesus Christ will come down in human flesh Among Us and will make his words so real that it'll unite the church and him as one the bride and then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen amen she is already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage then she'll go home to the wedding supper amen she's already united we go to the wedding supper not to the marriage it says fill your flesh fill your flesh cuz the marriage of the Lamb has come it says but the Rapture is going to the wedding supper when the word here unites the person and they become one and then what does it do it manifests the son of man again not the church Theologian the son of man and the word and the church becomes one whatsoever the son of man done he was the word the church does the same thing she had made herself ready there was a preparation in the word of God God was wanting to show her the lovely secrets that no man could understand but him he himself can reveal to her a lot of people claim to know Jesus Christ a lot of people can talk to you about Jesus Christ but who is Jesus Christ to you what does he mean to you amen amen verse 9 Revelations 19 and he said unto me write blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he said unto me these are the true sayings of God so everything that God says is true everything that God says is true that's how you'll know them remember we read I quot earlier is by the word word of word by word because the word could only Testify the word a word will not testify of anything else of what the word is it say about the word amen and I fell at his feet to worship him look at 10 and he said unto me see do thou do it not now look at the humility here John is a type of the bride and here he is one the bow down to the angel and he says don't do it I am thy fellow servant and I it says and of thy Brethren that have the testimony of Jesus worship God now listen to this for the the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of Prophecy who is Jesus Christ to you the for the testimony of Jesus is a spirit of test is a spirit of Prophecy you know when the Lord called me to the message just a quick testimony I grew up in the Pentecostal Church my whole life I served since I was eight years old I used to travel with my father and go from church to church sing and sing and sing and play instruments the Lord had gifted me to play an instrument so since I was eight years old I was traveling with my father and I would miss school and just you know just what happens and 20 years I spent my life in the Pentecostal culture and the Lord came and spoke to me personally and he said you've been a religious person for 20 years but if you were to testify who Jesus Christ to you is you would have no you would have no words you wouldn't be able to testify who this person is and I said Lord that's true I may claim that I may know Jesus Christ a lot of people claim to know him but it's so different when he reveals himself and he gets to know you because it's that privilege that he gets to love us the only way I exist is because there was a love that was shed for me first and the only way I can recognize that accepting that love of God so now by the restoration of the word now it's being restored back pure and clearcut to us to receive that true word is the spirit of Prophecy Jesus Christ himself what are you feeding on what are you eating look at 11 and I saw heaven open and behold the White Horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true faithful and true and in righteousness that he judge and make war he eyes were as a flame of fire and his head were many crowns he had a name written that no man knew no man knew this name a lot of people like to point to a man no man knew this name but he himself and he was clothed with the vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God now remember Isaiah 9 was talking about a war and how with every remember it says with every word there's confusion how how their garments were dipped in Blood and it was only it was only by that blood that they were able to be redeemed follow this it says and his name is called the word of God and the armaments which were in heaven followed him upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean following the word of God following the truth the the faithful and trueu the faithful and true the word of God and out of his mouth go with a sharp [Applause] sword that with it he should Smite all the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he trended the white press of the fearness of the of the wrath of almighty God and he had on his vesture and on his tie a name written king of kings and Lord of lords and I saw an angel standing in the Sun and he cried with a loud voice saying to all the flows to the fowls that fly in the midst of Heaven Come and gather yourself together unto the supper of the great God the angel standing in the sun crying with a loud voice to all these Eagles that are soaring in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus calling them Gathering them mother Eagle coming by coming across that chicken coop and when you see her all you can do is recognize the ca because it's part of you and all of a sudden she just says s s start start SW start flying a little bit maybe just a little bit of a wing start start start using your faith because one day his wings is's going to come and we'll be right behind them now look at this it says come and gather yourself together unto the supper of the great God that ye may eat the Flesh of Kings and the Flesh of captains and the Flesh of Mighty Men and the Flesh of horses and to and of them that sit upon them and the Flesh of all men both free and born small and great and I saw the Beast and the great Kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army you realize what's happening S as as as Jesus Christ is having an invisible Union there's another Army that's rising up that wants to it wants to annihilate to destroy the very Army of the Living God but we know that she won't be deceived because she has the word of God and she has the faithful and true sayings of God and it's the only way that she'll be able to make it to that wedding supper is by the continuation of the word worshiping God worshiping god king of kings the Lord of Lord It's the transition to the millennium amen amen and the Beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought Miracles before him now watch the Saints which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshiped His image see the mark of the beast has an image and if if we don't if we're not careful in the proper way of our thinking we be deceived and receive that image but remember Jesus Christ was the image of God it's the only way there's only one mediator between God and man and Jesus right the son of man amen amen and to it says to them that worshiped His Image these gold were cast alive into the Lake of Fire Burning with Brimstone and the remnant were slain By The Sword of him that set upon the horse sword proceeded out of his mouth and all the fowls were filled with their flesh now look at what brother bam says here says now in Revelations 19 not only is he getting ready but Christ is getting ready to meet him catch this real carefully it says the battle is going to be hot and heavy Christ and revelation 19 Gathering his it says not it says not from all from the four corners of the Earth because they're going to be a little bitty Remnant what's he doing he's Gathering them from the four corners of Heaven he says we'll get to them Souls under the altar tomorrow night see whether it's right or not four corners of Heaven on a Snow White Horse he also has a name not death but the Word of Life the word of God life it says God I write down on his thigh here the word of God that's the only life because God is the only source of eternal life a zo life he's got life riding on a white horse and here's a man with three different powers Called Death the mark of the beast watch this Gathering his Earthbound delegates and Christ is gathering his heaven born subjects he God death wrote on him Christ is God life wrote on him these with him on white horses also called the before the foundation of the world Amen Hallelujah that makes me happy and they are faithful to the word I like that it is called chosen before the foundation of the world the faithful of the word by choosing all stimulated new wine and oil just riding Right Along coming down to meet him they know the Thunders will issue the thing pretty for soon now watch what he does so if he is the word and his name is the word word is life the Antichrist anything it says anything anti is against so anti is against Christ the word so it's got to be a Creed or denomination that is against the word of God that's why they're trying to take you away from the Life of Christ it's the only source of life it's the only source of true life was because of that life that came the one that was born out of a virgin the one that was without spot or wrinkle and because of that blood now we have the same opportunity to called the word of God because we're part of his we're part of himself so anything outside of the word of God is anti and you will be deceived and you'll catch the mark of the beast now watch what brother B says here 1964 the Feast of the trumpets notice while that group is writing making themselves ready to stomp out everything that won't agree with them this is beautiful listen there's another group being made ready after a while says Revelations 19 the next time the church is heard she comes also not upon exactly horses but the Bible said he was on a horse on a white horse the host of heaven was following him upon white horses says that's right while this group down here has got 2,000 years bound at the river Euphrates and has been bound for 2,000 years also that church has bound the Holy Ghost for nearly 2,000 years under Mar martyrum uh back there under the church ages has been bound not at the river Euphrates but at the doors of Creeds and dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work in the church because of a man-made system but she's going to be liberated she's coming back that's what the Bible says and two and it says when those two meet one another verse 8 paragraph 83 it says uh and those two meet one another on the Battlegrounds Lucifer and Michael again like in the beginning so remember the spirit's always been there the spirit of antichrist was always there to find the Christ like that from the beginning that's what Lucifer did he was anti the word he didn't want to Humble himself to the word he didn't want to listen to what the word said cast down it was always a battle from the beginning and let me tell you who won in the beginning hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah who won in the beginning it was God's Army the battles already won my all we have to do is be obedient to the word of God and walk into the footsteps that have been predestinated for us to walk into and catch the life of this hour amen he's the I am he's omnes if we can recognize him in our our mid they've been bound for 2,000 years almost almost 2,000 years it says not exactly 2000 because the Romans kept going on it says the that Titus in ad 96 and on down like that to kill the Jews the Romans he says who was it that killed the Jews who was Titus a Roman general and the blood rolled out of the gates down there slaughtered and women and children and everything didn't Ezekiel n say that they'll do go through the midst of the city and set a mark upon the people C the Holy Spirit and the rest of them the slaughtering come forth that that would have been bound to try to hold them hold them until they went forth and slaughtered everything that was in there Little Women children babies and everything else and they were all Slaughters now watch this exactly here it is again repeating itself and here is that ecclesiastical system coming right back tramping out everything that's called and they got their systems they got their systems organization and denomination but they have nothing to do with what the Bible says they'll tell you quick they don't even believe in it yes sir say what the church says it's what God says that's the word of God God Saints it's simple it's the word of God it says the bride is with the word they're one how can they be one when that word that's wrote in there becomes in you and you and the word becomes one then it interprets you're the inter interpreter of the word by bringing it to pass that's exactly what he promised God don't need an interpreter they say well we interpret it like this you've got no right to interpret nothing God does his own interpret God God said let there be life and there was life and who interprets that he said a virgin shall conceive and did that don't need any interpretation it's already interpreted God said that there's that these things would happen in this day and it is you don't need no interpreting it interprets itself amen amen the word of God always flesh praise God Amen he's the I am sir he's the same yesterday today and for don't ever count yourself short acknowledge the truth humble yourself to the truth receive the life of God by his promised son Jesus Christ and by the revealed word of the hour not another way you have to come by the revealed word of Malachi 45 it has to be Resto by the by the restoration of what that came from the seals have been opened has been open and now we have access to the literal life of Jesus Christ open to the bride of Christ to express his very image in this hour amen amen don't sell yourself short good amen let's turn to John 14 we're closing maybe we can stand the an anointed word unto us a son was given the anointed word of the hour for the Bride of Jesus Christ look at what John 14 says here is and we're closing if you love me keep my Commandments and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may

generation don't sell yourself short the word the anointed word the true word of God the very word of God wants to live inside of our hearts not just as law or tradition but truly as life amen amen let's bow our heads maybe if um you have it on your heart today we spoke about a life we spoke about this anointed word the season that people celebrate about Jesus Christ as a baby perverted into the Santa Claus but we just heard today that this is more than that this is a life this is the true word of God this word cleanses this word delivers this word is the same yesterday today and forever and I ask you this morning if you would want to know this word if you would want to know this Lord Jesus Christ more intimate this is not a rededication this is not just another repentance service let
