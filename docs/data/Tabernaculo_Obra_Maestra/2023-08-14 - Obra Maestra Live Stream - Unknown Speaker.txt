we're thankful for that this morning we wanna and we've been speaking on the white horse rider um and it isn't just one Elijah says only yes but it was too Elijah and the white horse rider wrote the first coming of Christ and The Pale Horse Rider riding at the second coming of Christ I'm not a different personally I'm trying trying to upset the plan of God's wanting to give his children life and Satan is wanting to bring death is done it since the beginning God wanted to give Adam and Eve the spoken words teach them how to use it to bring forth life and satanas same with his plan being a conso plan and he gave them a lie and and you've believed the lies and the LIE always brings death it brings chaos it brings destruction divides the family that's what happened at the beginning it's what's happening even today it's what's happening throughout the ages but God hasn't changed his mind about his words he is still the tree of life and Satan hasn't yeah entitling it this morning respuestas but and today we have the answers to many questions many questions that throughout the ages some questions for over 2 000 years that people had the same questions and today we have the answers by the grace of God second Peter 1. second Peter chapter one and verse begin at verse 19. though he was an uneducated man who couldn't even write his own name as God brought to him more Revelation Revelation he increased an understanding to the place where he brought us great truths by Revelation does it sound like another man in this day a man with numbers not only did he have a better command of the English language in English but of Revelation had increased tremendous from 1946. in 1965. God kept giving him word upon words here a little in this message to hide it from the eyes of the wise and Prudence who would get bored with with this little Kentucky and right about the time they closed that message when the Holy Spirit would drop something down in the mouth of a prophet is God give us Revelation and a Victorious life through Jesus Christ so Christian Peter chapter 1 verse 19. we have also a more sure word of Prophecy we're unto ye do well that you take heed as unto a light that shineth in a dark place until the day Dawn and the day star arise in your hearts knowing this first that no Prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation foreign by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost foreign and beginning at verse 8. Galatians but though we were an angel from heaven reach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we have said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you that ye have received let him be a curse or do I now persuade man or God or do I seek to please men forever yet please man I should not be the servant of Christ foreign but I certify you Brethren that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man Brian either received it of man neither was I taught it but by the revelation of Jesus Christ [Music] it's the only way it comes to you it's God's provided Beyond this rock I'll build my church it's Revelation just to the minister no to the believer to grandpas to young children to young and old men and women alive for ye have heard of my conversation and time past in the Jews religion how that beyond measure I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it yes and profited in the Jews religion foreign I persecuted the Church of God and wasted it and profited in the Jews religion above many my equals in my own Nation being more exceedingly zealous of the traditions of my father Yes [Music] who separated me when I was uh who separated me when on the road to Damascus no who separated me from my mother's womb and called me by his grace for one purpose and it's the purpose why he's called you yes to them which was Apostles before me Jerusalem because the apostles couldn't give him a revelation they could share their Revelations so he said I'll just skip that step then I'll go straight to the author but I went into Arabia and returned again unto Damascus then he says then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to see Peter and Abode with him 15 days then we all went on to say hello I had a good time of fellowship and some of the other Apostles including James the Lord's own brother but they didn't add anything more to my Revelation than what God had already it turned out that when we talked for the first time we had something in common that we had all been in a conversation with the Lord himself we realized we all had the same Revelations though we had never spoken because we were speaking to the absolute the author of the same books and we're speaking today questions May questions in our hearts truly be answered this morning you may be seated we'd like to do this morning we've done it once before I just have taken quotes of the Prophet but the universe and they're all on you could say different subjects different texts and even though it's all connected uh when you speak of justification and then you speak on Perfection they are absolutely linked together yeah even though you can speak of them individually but the greater truth always to connect these truths that's Revelations when you can see the bigger picture so we're going to start with a few quotes things that a prophet said speak a little bit on it and then go on to another quote can in can the message in the message God revealing himself to his people preached in 1950s Joshua and and it's it's an experience that he had yes when God called them to the ministry he says in an old traptor's cabin and I she said I seen the fear of a man walking in through a light you see me and beginning at verse paragraph 24 in that message he says now the night when it taken place when he called me to this ministry the year was 1946. I was sitting in the room being in prayer I've been praying all night burdened I got up I'd walk around the room again and I was a pretty successful Baptist preacher as Paul was a very successful Pharisee um that was a pretty successful Baptist priest I had audiences sometimes three thousand and had revivals thousands were saved at one time the early part of his ministry he was still claiming to be a Baptist I was sitting there can I seen a light flicker in the room I thought well where where I thought well here where I was going to pray and weigh in them Hills I know that no one was coming in there with a car I thought well where was that is I looked and here it was right up here above me was the same thing that you see in the picture he's talking about the light the pillar of fire that was photographed just above his head but now he said it was spread out on the floor yes getting larger and larger spreading out across the floor well I thought oh God and you know sometimes we get the idea that a Halo will only be seen over someone's head yes but he said no that same light now he was on the floor just imagine now how you would feel sorry now friends these things are not just something that you just imagined in your mind [Music] can he speaks to me just as I'm talking to you now not just imagination and I look and I've seen the feet of a man come walking in through that life come into my right always comes from my right that's the reason I have the prayer line coming this way always comes to my right you see the angel of the Lord when he prayed for the sick he told us the angel always stands to my right and the reason I have the people come around to the on the right side is because I want every one of them to walk past the presence of that angel and feel his presence is he was wanting to let you know it just wasn't him that can feel his presence of God he wanted everyone to be able to feel that presence to live in that presence to believe that he's real and he says and I looked and I seen his face his feet and when he got to me he was a tall man he was heavy set weighed about 200 pounds but at one one place brother Brown says he was about six feet tall 200 pounds just like I was 15 years ago [Music] looked like just as natural as I'm standing here his arms folded like this arms first time I've ever seen him in that formed walked right up to where I was he looked down he had a smooth face to his shoulders he didn't have beard on his face he had a smooth face and he walked and looked up to me he kind he looked pathetic to look at him can he look like he was a man of well I I just could not picture his characteristics of his face he looked like a man that was sympathetic kind-hearted but yet he looked like a man it would be that way so I looked at him and he looked at me you know I was so scared I was biting my thumb till I was almost bleeding listen friend is and he said fear not for he sense the fear in William Branham he said fear not I knew that was the same voice that spoke to me all along that was the first time I've ever I'd ever seen it like that but I know but I know that voice say we've never seen him there's something he wants you to know he wanted to know his voice he wants you to know when he speaks to you and when you read your Bible you can know when it's his voice that speaks to you know that an answer is he says I knew that was the same voice that spoke to me all along that was the first time I'd ever seen it like this but I knew that voice from the presence you know when Zechariah was in the temple there in Luke chapter one offering incense before the God for the people an angel came down I believe it was the angel Gabriel again it was good in the very presence of God he said fear not nothing I'm sent from the presence of almighty God tell you that your peculiar birth your life has been misunderstood with men he said your peculiar life and peculiar Birth has been to indicate that you're to take a gift a Divine Healing to the peoples of the world William Branham William brand was being given a commission for a worldwide Ministry to introduce Jesus Christ The Living Word to the people of the world again not to the denominations not to the systems but to the people in those systems yes see he was going to break the churches to pieces you said no no he came to draw make the circle bigger the time came at the end of his ministry of her he said I am sent to the elected come out of her my people not partakers he said and I said sir I'm uneducated I could not go education the angel had heard that statement before when Moses said it it wasn't unusual he said I'll be with you and I said sir I'm uneducated I could not go the people wouldn't believe me he said because the prophet Moses was given two signs so will you be given two sons verse will be that you'll be able to detect diseases by your hands and they shall lay hands on the sick and God will heal them he said take in the patient by the right hand in your left hand and if you'll be sincere when you praise can be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayers Corazon [Music] there's no sickness [Music] he said he said as the prophet Moses was given two signs so will you be given two signs first will be that you'll be able to detect diseases by your hands and if you'll be sincere when you pray get them to believe and be sincere when you pray she'll stand before your prayer not even cancer he spoke cancer that's the only disease he said is it will come to pass that you will tell them the secrets of their hearts those will be the two signs it was a sign of the ministry prophetic Ministry declaring God present Moses had those two signs Jesus had the two sons he started out as an Evangelista then he began to discern the hearts of the people their very thoughts a woman touched the Hem of His Garment she might have reached through the crowd to touch it when healing came to her she Drew her hand back and got in the crowd again he knew where it was but he was looking for a public confession just like he wants us to make a public confession break things he said he said and I said I will go and it gathered up to the angels and it got into the angels and the angel went up in that light Pillar of Fire that you've seen tonight brother Brandon has this great experience I don't know what to do hmm have you ever felt you've had a real genuine experience with the lord it's so real I mean it's all over you feel like I don't know what to do you're not the first even God's prophets God feels rich in Mercy I hope there was answers there in this testimony and the message is this a sign of the answer is this with us what is revelation is revelation is it only quoting what William Branham says or has God been opening more of this word to us since he's gone paragraph 63 of is this the sign of the answer is now we want to read a text or or read a scripture reading um out of the book of the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not though we call it the Book of Revelations e is though we call it the Book of Revelation it's really the book of the revelation of a person Jesus Christ and I believe that this is the revelation of Jesus Christ written in the book and any other Revelation that would be contrary to this Revelation foreign it can't be ten quotes of the Prophet no place that don't take you to the word and the word of Prophecy it must be quotes of the promise that point you to a more sure word of Prophecy um let him be a curse I wish to read the first few verses the first seven verses and listen close now and pray with me Revelations 10 1-70 this is so when you think of the scripture in Revelations 8 1. and when the seventh seal was open because there was silence in heaven if you say one little verse how can we possibly know what that means one verse and just a few words is yes this is the seventh seal so now we got 11 more verses to give us revelation of what's happening and when it was happening here in Revelations 10. so now we got 11 verses one verse in Revelations now we got 12 verses there's more than 12 verses foreign says this I said Lord what does that mean let me read it again if it if it be you see foreign but it's by faith that we believe it he was talking about the first coming of Christ he was talking about the opening of the first seal he was talking about of a Plan of Redemption he was talking about Jesus Christ who would come with a plan to to save us to cleanse US foreign [Music] [Music] you know here at the second coming of Christ of indicated messages and many are still trying to accept it by works we must take all the words you can't just take one quote just as the prophet said you just can't take one scripture in the message I've always taught I have always taught that in the mouth of two or three witnesses that every word be established because it's in the word it was an Old Testament principle and it continued to be a principle in the New Testament that makes it thus saith the Lord from Genesis to Revelations live this way now remember I've always thought that in the mouth of two or three Witnesses let every word be established and the scripture just like you can't take one scripture and prove nothing unless there's something else goes with it see I can take one scripture and say Judas went and hung himself then I can take another scripture and say you go do the same but it won't blend in with the rest of it Dios revealing his word to us answering our questions everything in the Visions a prophet Taurus must be just the way the vision was shown from Australia and in the message God revealing himself to his people it gives a example he said it's just like a while ago in my room and I can tell you something's going to happen tonight right here now it just come into my room a while ago [Music] while I was alone and then it says and then when I'll be going down where I'll be going out maybe I'll have a sick call or going somewhere I'll be walking I'll say oh here's that gate that's right there I'll walk right up to that place somebody's with me I say Good Eagle Watch see what happens okay now go into the room and I'll lay my hat down here now everything is in the room according to the vision he saw but there's no woman there with a red sweater see I can't say a word yet that woman has to be sitting there with a red sweater maybe when she comes in uh another lady goes out is there isn't time yet I just keep on talking then I wait until then here they they all are in the room everyone that I saw in the room but my hat hasn't been moved from the radio to the bed everything has to be perfectly the way he showed it then the way he shows me that is and everything comes in perfect then I'll stand by that baby I've never seen it it's perfect that's the first way it works the second way is here on the platform that's the way that that takes place that's the way it works and happens is you know there was a time he gives this example because in this example he actually got ahead of the vision [Music] and went to pray for the child foreign but he gives us a testimony of a hunting trip he went on [Music] um where God had told him he'd be killing a brown bear and he didn't go according to the vision and he lost an opportunity and he told us on tape you see he said you've got to stay with this is thank you the message and end signed as human beings we're always looking for a Superman always looking for a hero I was looking for someone to look up that's why sports and entertainment is such a big thing amongst the people that's why it's multi-billion dollar industry because of the spirit of idolatry foreign in the message and end sign says in paragraph 197. This is now friends on Divine Healing or Amigos there's no man that can heal you there's no more than any man can save you because both healing and salvation are past tense when Jesus Christ died at Calvary he was wounded for our transgressions the only thing that you have to do either your salvation or you're here it's that simple to send forth yeah through the blood of Jesus Christ in the message the super signal Branham says he says I know I'm emotional [Music] Lord as I see these things go the way they do it wears me let people get back to the word and forget all these fantastic things of the hour is [Music] in the hour now that we're living granted Lord and while we have our heads bowed I want each of you to pray don't just keep your heads say Lord help me now and if you have something on your mind that you want to pray foreign when that's the very sign that t that the teaching is Right according to the Bible and if you're a sinner the pool is waiting there [Music] if you've never been baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you haven't received the Holy Ghost yet foreign [Music] after his death burial and Resurrection uh Paul met him on the road going down to Damascus a great light struck him down that Hebrew would have never called him Lord if he didn't know that was the same pillar of five who are you Lord and out of that Pillar of Fire and here you are tonight with us and here he is this morning with us he said father now let it be known that I've told the truth that virgin conceding to bring man and God together is the same sign that's among us tonight at the end of their age he said he said let it be once more father I pray through Jesus Christ's name he says he said a member of Branham says now I take every spirit in here under my control in moments like that you can find Salvation or be eternally he says now if you want to pray continue praying do whatever you wish now hold in your testimony keep holding your face if you're praying see out in front of me now in his middle aisle here again sitting right back here that's just bringing up her head yes [Music] do you believe that God will heal your back he says all right that's what you were praying about it is the lady right next to her had a back trouble too but that's what was right if that's right raise your hand is it now is that super sign now it is and God is still Discerning hearts and you can accept what God is one how God's wanting to speak your life can be changed a Victorious Life In Christ in Christ it's very true that we fail him many times not only we as as people as ministers as lay members but even as as God's prophet and he shares that with us in a message called in 1961 he says this now in California here we have meetings or in California and here are some people been waiting as much as three years or more and then as soon as we can get to them we don't leave we stay right there until the Holy Spirit speaks and then they know what to do and tell them how to do it the way it is and it never has failed one time because we're gone we're thankful for that is and ministers by the hundreds so we we have a room we take them too and they know when that their their appointment is now sometimes I'll be walking around or maybe in prayer for somebody else and he'll show me a vision on where to go to find someone or do something then I take right off and do that right now because that's God speaking using it so I always do try to do as he tells me I'm sorry to say I failed him so many times I'm ashamed of myself before his church tonight [Music] [Music] yes see but not intentionally not willingly no at this point we say Lord I believe help now I do that help me in this great struggle are you them in Instagram as I move from a flesh body yeah oh help me step by step return back into your glory to go from this life help me to take each step walking into eternity [Music] God sent a prophet God sent reformers Through the Ages it wasn't to change the world just to call out the Believers in the message he says see that's the same thing speaking of his ministry Martin Luther had a real Revival when Luther was living he kept it straight keep that thought in mind when producer was living [Music] you know Martin Luther spoke in tongues yes sir and he had great signs but when Luther died the church organized and there she went another round come up through the incubator and all and and in all a way they went see Martin Luther Martin Luther he happened to see the great Pillar of Fire but what did he do or what did they do okay they organized right under this Lutheran movement foreign [Music] [Music] as few mistakes as human Jesus name then the Pentecostal saw it and the way they went after it what did they do the same thing the rest of them the same thing the West the the lutherans did the same thing the Wesleyan methodists with the very same thing moved away from the leading of the pillar of fires periods under Revelations he said but remember brother he said after the first round of the old fathers foreign and Men preaching this message that William Branham has to come back and and show this to the world when a prophet said this is only for the elected church and these signs and wonders they said it's supposed to change your life and mind not create another denomination but once again what the lutherans did okay there is another movement that's falling into the same track doing the same things she's a Missionary Alliance nomination and she was in one of the meetings she called brother Bros which was also of the Missionary Alliance said the thing of it is you're not letting that gift get started out he said what I seen last night it should be done in the capitals of the nation why said it would convert bring the whole world to Christianity but you see it's not sent to the capitals of the nation it's sent to the elected Church all they say put your name on great big they said all they say will put your name on great big signs and we'll hit the big nerve centers principales do you know men have said the same same thing in this message that when William come Branham comes back he'll fly around the country [Music] and hit the big Nerf centers something that came up today it's been around a long time and the devil uses the same language every time but they can't get a hold of Jesus Christ and they say put your name on great big signs and it can hit the big nerve centers we'll get you on television television it wasn't meant for that I was just sent to this he says they'll put your name we'll put your name on great big signs we'll pay the money so that you're going to hit the big great nerve centers of the world it wasn't meant for that I was just saying wait a minute in God's mind he sent a Vindicated prophecies someone said with me for me for me but I mean God sent a Vindicated Prophets own that is and it'll make the book The Bible yeah you'll turn to your wife you know who this book was written foreign [Music] [Music] a prostitute Sinners and to wash your sins away all you have to say is he said it wasn't meant for that I was just sent to you foreign plowing away and just letting it fall anywhere it wants to get it he's talking about the gospel he was preaching but just staying true to the words I haven't said one word that I back up on I haven't said one word that the Bible doesn't say that's right I can prove it by the scriptures what's been right with the words right along just exactly can you dear people has come every night and practice he said I appreciate that I pray that not one of you will be lost every one of you would be in the kingdom of God God rich in Mercy it said that brother Branham said that the angel told them if you can get the people to believe you and they've made doctrines from that statement you see we have to believe him what about believing in Jesus Christ let's read this he says he said Now quickly before the time gets away now notice all right nothing I have appeared to you I'll put it in my own words and as I was quoting his words he said fear not I am sent from the presence of God will tell you that your peculiar birth in life to indicate you're to take a gift of Divine Healing as Indica is to the peoples of the world you be sincere when you pray and get the people to believe and nothing will stand before your prayers now watch the order God sent that gift nearly 40 40 about 40 years ago [Music] now the thing I was to do was to pray for the sick and be sincere when I pray and nothing and nothing would stand before the prayers see the thing of it is the thing of it is to get the people to believe that this is the truth now he gave the interpretation many times he just said the angel said if you can get the people to believe and then two or three years later and another couple of years and here he was yes about five years later since he had that experience and he adds another detail yeah even everything he says he said the thing is he says you see the order now if you can get the people to believe you said see the order now see the thing of it is the thing is is to get the people to believe that this is the truth the message of Christ many times he would just say if you can get the people to believe and many people stop it and they put a period it's an error yes it's a human it's a human error Romano okay okay William Branham said Williams if you can get the people true what did that means is that drawing us away from Christ is then a few years later he says the angel said luckily if you can get the people to believe you see then he says see the order now well if I just say that no you don't see the order it's still an unanswered question what does it mean he says the thing of it is he said the thing is is to get the people to believe that this is the truth that's what the first statement meant yes if you can get the people to believe what does that mean and he finally gives us the answer years later it's written just like the Bible word upon words I can't believe people stay in the world if you don't understand but it all must be scriptures God is opened his word to us just like at the first coming of Christ again bring Salvation for all his elected from the days of Adam to our day today was the reason for the opening the opening of these seven seven parts from the first coming of Christ through the second coming of Christ it's a plan unfolding to save from the days of Adams to the days of when he goes to 144 000. it's a plan some plan in seven Parts but how how sure are you that it's open it's not revealed it's open but surely it's not revealed just because you wear a little pen pen on your ties a picture of the clouds that doesn't mean you have any Revelations that could mean significant that you're falling into the Trap that the lutherans is Revelation Revelation takes you back to the world Revelation is a personal experience and you appreciate your brother brother Branham and all the saints around but you worship one and one alone Jesus Christ Our Lord in this message ashamed of him will be closing with this it's 1965.
