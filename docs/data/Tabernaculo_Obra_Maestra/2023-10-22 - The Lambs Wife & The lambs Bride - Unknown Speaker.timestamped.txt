[1:05:56] and it reads like
[1:05:58] this he that hath the bride is the
[1:06:02] bridegroom but the but the friend of the
[1:06:04] bridegroom which standeth and heareth
[1:06:07] him rejoices greatly because of the
[1:06:10] bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore
[1:06:13] is
[1:06:20] fulfilled this
[1:06:22] was this was John the
[1:06:25] Baptist the Elijah to the first coming
[1:06:27] of
[1:06:28] Christ and he said he said he must
[1:06:35] increase John a prophet introducing
[1:06:39] Jesus
[1:06:40] Christ he had many
[1:06:43] followers for he was bringing change to
[1:06:45] Israel
[1:06:48] this but he told all his
[1:06:51] followers I've come to introduce you
[1:06:55] to the
[1:06:56] bridegroom and and as much as you
[1:06:58] appreciate the
[1:07:01] ministry and the prophetic
[1:07:03] word he says I'm just a vessel that God
[1:07:07] has used to bring you the
[1:07:11] changes but John was coming to the end
[1:07:13] of his
[1:07:15] ministry and he said he said he must
[1:07:18] increase before your
[1:07:19] eyes I must decrease he
[1:07:22] said every true prophet of
[1:07:26] God always pointed back to
[1:07:29] God always pointed back to
[1:07:33] Jehovah always pointed to the Lamb of
[1:07:37] God verse
[1:07:39] 31 he that Cometh From Above is above
[1:07:42] all he that is of the earth is Earthly
[1:07:46] and speaketh of the earth he that Cometh
[1:07:49] From Heaven is above
[1:07:52] all
[1:07:57] verse 29 once
[1:07:59] again he that hath the
[1:08:01] bride is the bridegroom but the friend
[1:08:05] of the
[1:08:06] bridegroom which standeth and heareth
[1:08:09] him rejoices
[1:08:11] greatly because of the bridegroom's
[1:08:14] voice this my joy therefore is
[1:08:19] fulfilled the
[1:08:21] bride is is a woman in the Old
[1:08:26] Testament under the under the Orthodox
[1:08:29] Jewish
[1:08:31] Traditions when a woman was betrothed to
[1:08:34] a
[1:08:36] man today we use the word uh being
[1:08:44] engaged and it's it's it is is in
[1:08:49] essence it is the same
[1:08:52] thing and yet it's not
[1:08:55] for under under the Jewish
[1:08:58] Traditions a woman betrothed to a
[1:09:02] man uh was a woman who was wife
[1:09:07] now and yet during the time from the
[1:09:10] time of
[1:09:13] betrothal to to the time to the time of
[1:09:16] a of a wedding
[1:09:21] ceremony that woman had to go through a
[1:09:28] process a process of
[1:09:31] [Music]
[1:09:32] adornment a process of CLE different
[1:09:35] rituals of
[1:09:39] cleansing a process to be prepared with
[1:09:41] a certain dress and gown for this for
[1:09:45] this
[1:09:47] event she was the bride and and the
[1:09:51] bride was already wife
[1:09:54] but she was being
[1:09:56] prepared for this for this time when
[1:10:00] they would be declared man and wife
[1:10:05] publicly but it was already a covenant
[1:10:07] that the woman could not walk away
[1:10:12] from now the man could divorce the
[1:10:17] woman even before the wedding ceremony
[1:10:20] took
[1:10:22] place
[1:10:25] because according to the law she was
[1:10:27] already
[1:10:29] wife you'll remember when
[1:10:32] Joseph when he realized that Mary with
[1:10:35] his
[1:10:39] child and the Bible says because he was
[1:10:43] a just
[1:10:45] man he was he was thinking about putting
[1:10:48] her away
[1:10:52] privately
[1:10:55] because she was already wife to
[1:10:57] him but yet they had not lived together
[1:11:00] as husband and
[1:11:03] wife but she was already
[1:11:06] wife so a wife to be was the
[1:11:13] bride and the bride was the wife
[1:11:16] preparing
[1:11:19] herself for a great public
[1:11:22] ceremony
[1:11:25] and she was a a woman being adorned and
[1:11:29] prepared for this
[1:11:31] Union and at and at the fullness and
[1:11:34] completion of this
[1:11:37] Union the husband would now take her as
[1:11:42] wife to live together
[1:11:46] spiritually live together
[1:11:49] eternally
[1:11:50] bride and
[1:11:52] wife Revelations 21 and verse
[1:12:05] 2 Revelations 21 and verse
[1:12:09] 2 and I saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[1:12:13] coming down from God out of Heaven
[1:12:15] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[1:12:22] husband
[1:12:25] bride was a woman being
[1:12:29] prepared bride was a woman betroth to a
[1:12:34] husband bride was the a wife
[1:12:38] already but bride was a woman being
[1:12:41] prepared and adorned for her
[1:12:46] husband going through
[1:12:50] cleansings being being dressed now
[1:12:53] different
[1:12:54] L now now she was being dressed in a way
[1:12:58] that her husband liked to see
[1:13:02] her so perhaps her old way of
[1:13:06] dressing it was all going to change the
[1:13:10] way she dressed the way she adorned
[1:13:13] herself cuz now she was adorning
[1:13:16] herself to to for one specific
[1:13:20] man because the bride this this ride
[1:13:23] this woman
[1:13:25] [Music]
[1:13:26] betroth was already wife to this
[1:13:30] man but now she was being
[1:13:33] adorned in a way to just please this one
[1:13:37] particular man and no
[1:13:43] other and I John saw the holy city New
[1:13:46] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:13:48] Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for
[1:13:52] her husband
[1:13:59] so this bride that's adorned here for
[1:14:01] her
[1:14:03] husband is is a woman ready to enter
[1:14:07] into the next stage of being a
[1:14:11] wife into a into a union with the
[1:14:15] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[1:14:17] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[1:14:20] God is with men and he will dwell with
[1:14:22] them and they shall be his people and
[1:14:25] God himself shall be with them and be
[1:14:27] their
[1:14:37] God this is now the
[1:14:40] wife dwelling with the husband
[1:14:43] Revelations 21 and verse
[1:14:47] 9 and there came unto me one of the
[1:14:50] Seven Angels which had the seven V
[1:14:54] full of the seven last
[1:15:04] plagues and talked with me saying come
[1:15:07] hither I will show Thee the bride the

[1:15:46] washed in a way that pleased the
[1:15:49] husband she was ready she entered in
[1:15:53] into this invisible
[1:15:55] Union and then it says in verse
[1:15:58] 10 and he carried me away in the spirit
[1:16:01] to a great high
[1:16:05] mountain and showed me that great
[1:16:08] City the holy
[1:16:10] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[1:16:13] God typing this holy
[1:16:16] Jerusalem the supernatural
[1:16:21] descending to the Bride of
[1:16:23] Christ the Lamb's
[1:16:26] wife Revelations
[1:16:36] 22 Revelations 22 and verse
[1:16:45] 16 and I Jesus have sent my angel to
[1:16:48] testify unto these things in the church
[1:16:51] I am the root and off spring of
[1:17:00] David and the bright and morning
[1:17:04] star and the spirit and the bride say

[1:17:13] come and let him that is a thirst
[1:17:17] come and whosoever will let him take the
[1:17:20] Water of Life freely
[1:17:25] what time is it it's a time of a bride
[1:17:29] being united to the
[1:17:31] groom it's the time of the wise virgin
[1:17:35] being
[1:17:38] raptured the rapturing of the
[1:17:42] Bride is a transition from bride to
[1:17:47] wife where now God is gathering his
[1:17:52] bride
[1:17:53] who's been
[1:17:54] washed who's been
[1:17:58] cleansed who's been
[1:18:00] adorned who has changed the way she

[1:18:17] been she she has been
[1:18:20] changing to please her her
[1:18:24] husband so that when he comes to take
[1:18:26] her
[1:18:28] away she is just exactly the apple of
[1:18:32] his
[1:18:33] eye she does everything the way he likes
[1:18:38] it she has read in the scriptures how to
[1:18:42] please
[1:18:44] him and now she's
[1:18:47] following this process of being born
[1:18:51] again of receiving the Holy
[1:18:53] Ghost of being sensitive to the
[1:18:56] refilling of the holy
[1:18:58] spirit this is the bride being adorned
[1:19:01] for her husband and the rapturing time
[1:19:06] is when the husband

[1:19:15] way this I Won't Wait Another

[1:19:22] together together
[1:19:24] eternally oh the word
[1:19:27] bride is mentioned in the
[1:19:31] scriptures including in the Old
[1:19:34] Testament beginning from
[1:19:37] Isaiah the word bride is
[1:19:44] used in Genesis
[1:19:48] 24 there when
[1:19:51] elaser receives the commission from
[1:19:56] Abraham and he's to
[1:20:01] get a

[1:20:15] 24 the the the word bride isn't
[1:20:20] used eler is isn't called to go get a
[1:20:24] bride for
[1:20:28] Isaac he's he's Abraham calls him to
[1:20:31] take bring a wife for
[1:20:37] Isaac consider in verse one of Genesis

[1:20:45] in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham
[1:20:48] in all
[1:20:51] things
[1:20:53] and Abraham said unto his eldest servant
[1:20:55] of his house that ruled over all that he
[1:20:57] had put I pray thee thy hand under my
[1:21:08] thigh he was going to give elazer his
[1:21:11] servant a
[1:21:15] commission probably the most important

[1:21:28] four but but Thou shalt go into my

[1:21:33] wife unto my son
[1:21:38] Isaac in verse 7 he says then the Lord
[1:21:41] God Of Heaven which took me from my

[1:26:50] moment I'm taking home
[1:26:53] no longer
[1:26:55] bride
[1:26:58] wife so there's no
[1:27:01] debate of Bride and
[1:27:03] wife just like there's no debate who was
[1:27:07] Jesus was he the lion of the tribe of
[1:27:11] Judah or is he the Lamb of
[1:27:13] God who is he he's both those are his
[1:27:19] ministries well guess whatch chur of God
[1:27:23] your ministry begins when you're
[1:27:26] baptized in the name of
[1:27:29] Jesus you accept to be the bride of
[1:27:33] Christ now you're a woman being
[1:27:37] prepared for the husband to finally look
[1:27:41] down and he looks down at
[1:27:44] you he says he says wow what a
[1:27:48] beauty I'm taking her now she's going
[1:27:52] home with
[1:27:55] me at 90 years
[1:27:57] old Jesus will look
[1:28:01] down and if you've been in the
[1:28:03] word growing in
[1:28:06] Christ he says wow wow prettiest girl I
[1:28:10] ever
[1:28:11] seen I'm taking her
[1:28:13] now the
[1:28:16] husband because you've allowed him
[1:28:19] you've entered into a preparation
[1:28:23] the Bride is a woman a wife
[1:28:27] preparing for an invisible Union with
[1:28:31] Christ the
[1:28:34] husband Jewish in Jewish
[1:28:37] custom a bride was a man's wife
[1:28:43] already but they were awaiting a
[1:28:46] future wedding
[1:28:51] ceremony when they would publicly be
[1:28:56] pronounced man and
[1:28:58] wife and then live
[1:29:02] together in our case
[1:29:06] eternally not so under the
[1:29:09] law but under the
[1:29:11] law a man could
[1:29:14] divorce and put away his
[1:29:17] wife for any
[1:29:20] reason but if the reason was
[1:29:24] unjust even under the
[1:29:29] law the
[1:29:31] woman was
[1:29:35] free to marry
[1:29:37] again under the
[1:29:40] law you see a man could put a woman
[1:29:46] away for a term called and say she's
[1:29:50] unclean
[1:29:55] and yet she had done nothing
[1:29:58] wrong and yet she she was not found in
[1:30:00] fornication or
[1:30:03] adultery she had done nothing
[1:30:06] wrong it was just a general
[1:30:09] term for a man that all realized I don't
[1:30:12] really like this
[1:30:15] woman and he could put her away in
[1:30:20] divorcement but under the of
[1:30:23] Moses though it was allowed under the
[1:30:25] law of
[1:30:28] Moses yet that woman who had been
[1:30:31] treated
[1:30:34] unjustly was free to marry someone
[1:30:39] else under the
[1:30:42] law but when Jesus
[1:30:45] come the custom would
[1:30:48] end for a gentile people and not only
[1:30:51] only a gentile
[1:30:53] people but for all
[1:30:55] people at the first coming of
[1:30:59] Christ a prophet came and taught us the
[1:31:02] truth of marriage and
[1:31:06] divorce putting scripture together for
[1:31:10] us remember the first coming of
[1:31:13] Christ was going to bring five things
[1:31:16] for
[1:31:18] Israel according to the prophecy of
[1:31:20] Isaiah 40
[1:31:23] and the changes would come through a
[1:31:25] prophetic
[1:31:27] Ministry of John the Baptist he would
[1:31:30] introduce the
[1:31:32] changes he would introduce the Lamb of
[1:31:36] God who would add great detail to the
[1:31:40] changes and what John came to
[1:31:43] do was exactly that and the five things
[1:31:47] that Isaiah spoke
[1:31:49] of that John would bring
[1:31:52] was change change change
[1:31:56] change and when Jesus came he would tell
[1:32:00] us in
[1:32:02] detail what those five changes
[1:32:05] were and he started in in Matthew 28 in
[1:32:09] Matthew
[1:32:10] 19 turn with me to Matthew
[1:32:20] 19 we'll begin at verse
[1:32:24] one a great
[1:32:26] change came to
[1:32:28] Israel one that they couldn't
[1:32:31] accept and yet it was thus saith the
[1:32:34] Lord yet it was the great a change that
[1:32:37] would bless their
[1:32:40] lives yet it was a change that would
[1:32:42] bring peace to their
[1:32:44] families and they couldn't accept it
[1:32:48] verse one and it came to pass that when
[1:32:50] Jesus had finished these Saints he
[1:32:53] departed from Galilee and came into the
[1:32:55] coast of Judea Beyond
[1:33:02] Jordan and great multitudes followed
[1:33:05] followed him and he healed them
[1:33:10] there and the Pharisees also came unto
[1:33:15] him despite the miraculous
[1:33:20] Ministry
[1:33:23] they didn't come to see if God with this
[1:33:25] was with this
[1:33:27] man no the Bible says the Pharisees also
[1:33:31] came unto him tempting him and saying
[1:33:33] unto
[1:33:36] him is it lawful for a man to put away
[1:33:40] his wife for every
[1:33:43] cause they asked him a question to which
[1:33:47] they thought they already knew the
[1:33:50] answer and to they asked him a
[1:33:54] question that they felt Moses would back
[1:33:57] them
[1:33:59] up and he answered and said unto them in
[1:34:01] verse
[1:34:03] four have ye not read that that he which
[1:34:07] made them at the beginning made them
[1:34:09] male and
[1:34:16] female and said for this cause shall a
[1:34:19] man leave father and mother and shall
[1:34:21] cleave to his wife and they twain shall
[1:34:24] be one
[1:34:29] flesh wherefore there are no more Twain
[1:34:33] but one
[1:34:36] flesh what therefore God hath joined
[1:34:39] together let not man put
[1:34:43] aunder this was thus sayith the
[1:34:48] Lord this was God bringing chain
[1:34:53] this was the grace of
[1:34:55] God and they couldn't accept the grace
[1:34:57] of God they've been under the law for so
[1:35:01] long they they'd been under church
[1:35:03] dogmas for so
[1:35:06] long they they've been under the
[1:35:08] propaganda of too many preachers that
[1:35:10] didn't know the word for so
[1:35:15] long now they say unto him verse
[1:35:20] seven why why did Moses then command to
[1:35:23] give a writing of divorcement and put
[1:35:26] her
[1:35:30] away they thought they had an answer and
[1:35:33] they had him in a
[1:35:38] corner because what Jew would
[1:35:44] dare to contradict
[1:35:47] Moses a great Exodus
[1:35:50] prophet
[1:35:52] they thought they they thought they had
[1:35:54] put him in a
[1:35:56] corner but they didn't know who they
[1:35:58] were talking
[1:36:00] to they were talking to Jehovah
[1:36:05] himself who had come to bring
[1:36:09] change they're talking to almighty
[1:36:12] God who was going to extend the king's
[1:36:16] scepter to
[1:36:19] Israel to be bright and WI
[1:36:22] but Israel would
[1:36:24] reject the
[1:36:28] betral Israel would reject to be bride
[1:36:32] Israel would reject to be
[1:36:35] wife he saith unto
[1:36:37] them
[1:36:39] Moses because of the hardness of your
[1:36:42] hearts suffered you to be put away to
[1:36:46] put away your
[1:36:50] wives
[1:36:53] listen to
[1:36:54] this but from the beginning it was not
[1:37:01] so God allowed Fallen
[1:37:07] man he allowed
[1:37:09] Moses to give them a writing of a
[1:37:13] divorcement it was either
[1:37:17] that or have Jewish men or
[1:37:22] in
[1:37:24] abundance murdering their
[1:37:28] wives to take another
[1:37:32] one Moses said Lord what do I
[1:37:36] do God allowed
[1:37:38] him because of the hardness of their
[1:37:41] hearts to let them give a writing a
[1:37:45] divorce instead of pull a knife and
[1:37:47] butcher the
[1:37:50] women this is is
[1:37:54] true but it wasn't so from the
[1:37:58] beginning before man's
[1:38:00] fall before the human race was mixed
[1:38:03] with the DNA of The
[1:38:08] Serpent and before the characteristics
[1:38:11] of that serpent were in this flesh
[1:38:17] body a liar and a murderer from the
[1:38:22] beginning you say no I've never killed
[1:38:26] anyone not with a gun but with our
[1:38:30] tongues with our
[1:38:36] words and
[1:38:40] lies I stopped counting
[1:38:46] mine and just started asking for
[1:38:50] forgiveness
[1:38:52] amen there's many that I'm sure I don't
[1:38:57] remember as a Young Man growing
[1:39:00] up but I'll bet everyone I told them to
[1:39:04] they
[1:39:08] remember Jesus
[1:39:11] says I say unto you who soever shall put
[1:39:16] away his
[1:39:19] wife except be for
[1:39:23] fornication and shall marry
[1:39:26] another committeth
[1:39:30] adultery and whosoever Marth her which
[1:39:33] is put away doth commit
[1:39:39] adultery can it be more clear than
[1:39:43] that his disciples say unto
[1:39:47] him this ain't the Pharisees speaking
[1:39:50] now
[1:39:52] this isn't the sadu
[1:39:54] speaking this isn't the lawyers of the
[1:39:56] law
[1:39:59] speaking they were
[1:40:01] shocked they didn't know what to
[1:40:04] say but his
[1:40:06] disciples said unto
[1:40:10] him if the case of man be so with his
[1:40:16] wife his
[1:40:18] disciples you know like Peter James John
[1:40:24] Andrew men that were following him the
[1:40:28] phes weren't following him they were
[1:40:30] tempting
[1:40:31] him but when he come to this place
[1:40:35] here his disciples say unto him if the
[1:40:39] case of the man be so with his
[1:40:42] wife it's not good to
[1:40:45] marri if I can't get rid of
[1:40:49] her when I when I think I've had enough
[1:40:52] of
[1:40:53] her marriage isn't a good thing
[1:40:57] anymore that's the way these men were
[1:41:00] thinking that's the way these men had
[1:41:02] lived for 4,000
[1:41:05] years but Jesus was bringing change to
[1:41:09] Israel bring Jesus was bringing change
[1:41:12] to both Gentile and
[1:41:15] Jews Jesus is bringing change both to
[1:41:18] Saint and sinner
[1:41:22] because the word of God thus sayith the
[1:41:26] lord it's not just for the
[1:41:28] believer it's for the
[1:41:31] unbeliever because on Judgment Day God
[1:41:35] will judge the
[1:41:37] World by his
[1:41:40] word he won't judge us by the Catholic
[1:41:44] church he won't judge us by the Lutheran
[1:41:48] Church he won't judge us by the the
[1:41:50] rules of the Baptist
[1:41:54] Church he won't judge us by the
[1:41:56] Pentecostal church and their
[1:41:59] rules no sir the whole world will be
[1:42:03] judged by the word of
[1:42:05] God Jesus Christ the
[1:42:10] husband it's just that only the
[1:42:13] believer is interested in keeping his
[1:42:17] word the unbeliever isn't interested
[1:42:21] and yet the very thing he's not
[1:42:23] interested
[1:42:25] in is what will judge
[1:42:28] him the word of God but the bride wants
[1:42:32] to be
[1:42:34] adorned with his word because she wants
[1:42:38] to come to that
[1:42:41] ceremony to be called
[1:42:43] wife and carried away in an invisible
[1:42:48] Union to be with her husband
[1:42:52] eternally verse n and I say unto
[1:42:56] you whosoever shall put away his
[1:43:00] wife except it be for
[1:43:04] fornication and shall marry
[1:43:07] another committeth
[1:43:12] adultery and who so Marth her which is
[1:43:15] put
[1:43:16] away do commit
[1:43:18] adultery God is speaking to the man
[1:43:22] here who at one
[1:43:24] point was saying Moses gave us a writing
[1:43:27] of
[1:43:30] divorcement and we can put her away for
[1:43:33] any
[1:43:35] reason Jesus said it wasn't so from the
[1:43:40] beginning and the reason I've
[1:43:43] come the reason I've come in the in
[1:43:48] flesh is to show you all
[1:43:52] how to get
[1:43:53] back to the
[1:43:55] beginning I'm not even taking you back
[1:43:58] to the to the to the days of
[1:44:02] Abraham I'm not trying to take you back
[1:44:05] to the days of
[1:44:07] Moses I'm not trying to take you back to
[1:44:09] to to to the even to the days of Abel
[1:44:12] and
[1:44:13] Cain no I'm wanting to take you back
[1:44:17] before man ever
[1:44:19] fell I'm wanting to take you back to
[1:44:21] that
[1:44:24] day when there was no sin on planet
[1:44:30] Earth and he says I say unto
[1:44:34] you whosoever shall put away his wife
[1:44:38] except it be for
[1:44:41] fornication then the question
[1:44:45] Rises well then what's fornication
[1:44:48] brother some say
[1:44:51] fornication is the same as
[1:44:54] adultery so if if you marry your
[1:44:57] wife and and and she lived
[1:45:00] clean and she was virgin but yet 5 10
[1:45:05] years
[1:45:07] later she runs off with another man
[1:45:11] commits
[1:45:12] adultery then the man can put her
[1:45:16] away that's one side of it the other
[1:45:19] says no
[1:45:22] fornication uh only takes
[1:45:24] place between single
[1:45:27] people and adultery is is a term used
[1:45:31] for people already
[1:45:34] married who are living
[1:45:37] immorally so there's another
[1:45:39] argument and others say no let's go to
[1:45:42] the dictionary and see what the
[1:45:43] dictionary
[1:45:46] says and then the dictionary tells us
[1:45:49] both it's unclean immoral
[1:45:55] living so so then
[1:45:58] uh when Jesus
[1:46:01] said whosoever shall put away his
[1:46:04] wife accept it before
[1:46:13] fornication and shall marry
[1:46:16] another committeth
[1:46:19] adultery so the word
[1:46:21] is
[1:46:25] fornication so who has the right
[1:46:29] interpretation where is the true
[1:46:31] definition
[1:46:34] found so we'll know what the truth
[1:46:38] is it's not found in a
[1:46:41] dictionary and it's not found in a group
[1:46:44] of men debating
[1:46:48] ministers where could we find find
[1:46:53] it I think we have to go back to the
[1:46:58] beginning that the definition for
[1:47:03] fornication lays in
[1:47:07] Genesis because God is his own
[1:47:10] interpreter so what happened in the
[1:47:14] beginning turn with me to Genesis
[1:47:17] chapter
[1:47:19] 3
[1:47:22] beginning at verse
[1:47:27] one
[1:47:29] Eve was Adam's
[1:47:33] wife she was bones of his
[1:47:36] bones Spirit of his
[1:47:39] Spirit flesh of his
[1:47:41] flesh you couldn't get no more closer a
[1:47:46] man and a woman than what Adam and Eve
[1:47:49] were
[1:47:53] and even though she was
[1:47:56] wife they had not lived together
[1:47:58] intimately as husband and
[1:48:00] wife she was wife but she was a woman
[1:48:06] betr she was Adam's
[1:48:09] bride and a wife to
[1:48:13] be and there and what and God was
[1:48:16] tutoring this
[1:48:19] couple
[1:48:21] to bring forth the family of
[1:48:24] God but in
[1:48:26] Holiness by the spoken
[1:48:29] word so here in Genesis
[1:48:33] 3 it says now the serpent was more
[1:48:36] subtle than any beast of the
[1:48:40] field so the serpent was the title of
[1:48:42] this
[1:48:45] being but the serpent wasn't a
[1:48:48] reptile the serpent was a
[1:48:52] mammal like
[1:48:56] man and it was the and it was the most
[1:48:59] subtile beast of the
[1:49:03] field so of all the animals in God's
[1:49:08] kingdom with exception of
[1:49:10] man the serpent was a
[1:49:19] smartest so the
[1:49:21] serpent was the
[1:49:23] link between the animal
[1:49:26] kingdom and human
[1:49:29] beings it it is what science calls
[1:49:33] today The Missing
[1:49:37] Link because science says there is a
[1:49:40] missing
[1:49:42] link between the
[1:49:45] chimpanzee and the human
[1:49:48] race they can take take they can take
[1:49:51] all the life that was
[1:49:54] created and mix one seed that's next to
[1:49:57] the
[1:49:59] other and create some kind of a
[1:50:03] creature none of them never live
[1:50:07] long but they can interbreed
[1:50:16] them and science has tried the same
[1:50:21] between the
[1:50:23] chimpanzee and
[1:50:26] man and as much as they have tried to
[1:50:29] conceive
[1:50:33] something by mixing the seed of a
[1:50:35] chimpanzee with the human
[1:50:40] being nothing
[1:50:43] happens so then science has
[1:50:45] said there's a missing
[1:50:48] link between the Animal Kingdom and man
[1:50:53] because we can mix everything else and
[1:50:55] produce some kind of a
[1:51:03] mutation but when they came to the
[1:51:06] chimpanzee and
[1:51:08] man nothing
[1:51:10] happens no life is
[1:51:13] made because the link that was
[1:51:17] missing was the serpent that God cursed
[1:51:21] and we realize now what happened in
[1:51:23] Genesis
[1:51:25] 3 was the
[1:51:27] serpent anointed of
[1:51:30] Satan to offer
[1:51:33] Eve another
[1:51:37] seed you see
[1:51:40] God in his mercy and
[1:51:42] Grace offered Adam and
[1:51:45] Eve the woman's
[1:51:48] seed
[1:51:51] so the prophecy of the woman's
[1:51:54] seed here in
[1:51:56] Genesis wasn't because of the
[1:51:59] Fall the prophecy of the woman's
[1:52:03] seed is the seed that Eve
[1:52:09] rejected and the one she
[1:52:12] accepted was the seed of the
[1:52:15] serpent the woman's
[1:52:17] seed was the spoken word
[1:52:20] that would bring
[1:52:22] forth a
[1:52:24] Manchild that would bring
[1:52:27] forth the family of
[1:52:31] God you see God never had an
[1:52:38] afterthought all his thoughts are
[1:52:42] original so to think that the prophecy
[1:52:45] of the woman's
[1:52:48] seed was an after
[1:52:52] thought would be naive of
[1:53:00] us would be very childish of
[1:53:06] us let's
[1:53:08] turn in Genesis
[1:53:13] 3
[1:53:18] inesis in
[1:53:23] verse verse 10 or verse let's go to
[1:53:26] verse
[1:53:30] nine man had
[1:53:32] fallen Eve had
[1:53:35] fallen and the Bible said in verse 9
[1:53:38] Genesis 3 and the Lord called unto Adam
[1:53:41] and said unto him where art
[1:53:45] thou God knew where he was
[1:53:48] at
[1:53:50] he was outside of the protection of the
[1:53:54] word of
[1:53:55] God and he said I heard thy voice in the
[1:53:58] garden and I was afraid because I was
[1:54:01] naked and I hid
[1:54:06] myself the holy Veil from their eyes had
[1:54:09] been ripped to
[1:54:12] pieces he said who told thee that thou
[1:54:15] was
[1:54:17] naked has thou eaten of the the tree
[1:54:20] wherefore I commanded thee that thou
[1:54:21] shouldest not
[1:54:24] eat and the woman said and the man said
[1:54:27] the woman whom thou gavest to be with me
[1:54:30] she gave me of the tree and I did
[1:54:36] eat and the Lord God said unto the woman
[1:54:39] what is this that thou has done and the
[1:54:41] woman said the serpent beguiled me and I
[1:54:44] did
[1:54:48] eat
[1:54:52] and the Lord God said unto the serpent
[1:54:55] because thou Hast done this Thou Art
[1:54:57] cursed above all
[1:55:05] cattle and above every beast of the
[1:55:10] field watch what the curs did to the
[1:55:15] serpent upon thy belly shalt thou
[1:55:18] go it was a
[1:55:21] curse telling us that this creature was
[1:55:24] never on its
[1:55:27] belly this creature stood
[1:55:31] upright like you and I on two
[1:55:35] feet he
[1:55:38] said Thou Art cursed above all cattle
[1:55:41] above every beast of the field upon thy
[1:55:43] belly shalt thou
[1:55:48] go
[1:55:50] and thus shal thou eat all the days of
[1:55:52] thy
[1:55:55] life now the this serpent was was
[1:56:00] cursed now this beast of the
[1:56:03] field that was the most
[1:56:06] subtile it was so subtle it could speak
[1:56:09] Eve's
[1:56:11] language it was so sub he could
[1:56:14] manipulate
[1:56:17] her it was so subtle
[1:56:21] that what took place in the
[1:56:24] garden was an act of
[1:56:27] fornication why
[1:56:29] fornication because Eve Adam's
[1:56:34] wife when when when she met with the
[1:56:38] serpent was a virgin but she had never
[1:56:42] been with her
[1:56:48] husband
[1:56:50] so
[1:56:51] Jesus when he said in in in Matthew
[1:56:56] 19 and gave to the man
[1:57:00] now not any reason but only one
[1:57:05] reason one reason
[1:57:08] why a man could now put his wife
[1:57:13] away in verse 9 of Matthew
[1:57:16] 19 he said I say unto you
[1:57:20] whosoever shall put away his
[1:57:23] wife except it be for
[1:57:27] fornication and the answer lies in
[1:57:30] Genesis what took place in
[1:57:33] Genesis while Eve was the bride to
[1:57:40] Adam a woman betroth to her
[1:57:46] husband a woman engaged to to to enter
[1:57:49] into a wedding
[1:57:55] ceremony and before she was ever with
[1:57:58] her husband
[1:58:00] intimately she received seed from
[1:58:03] another
[1:58:04] man that's the
[1:58:07] fornication that Jesus was
[1:58:09] speaking and the only reason why
[1:58:13] today a man could put away his
[1:58:16] wife because you see once you have a
[1:58:20] vow once you're engaged to be
[1:58:25] married that young lady is your
[1:58:29] wife you've made a
[1:58:31] promise the two of you and what God has
[1:58:35] put
[1:58:36] together let no man put us
[1:58:41] under the only reason that God gives a
[1:58:45] man a right to
[1:58:48] divorce not so much the
[1:58:51] divorce men aren't worried about the
[1:58:54] divorce
[1:58:55] part they want to know if I leave this
[1:58:58] woman I want to get married again that's
[1:59:00] the
[1:59:04] question you may divorce her you may put
[1:59:08] her away you can do all the paperwork
[1:59:11] according to to
[1:59:14] man but in the eyes of God that woman is
[1:59:18] still your wife
[1:59:20] and if you marry again you are
[1:59:22] committing
[1:59:24] adultery so what's the only
[1:59:28] reason is when a woman betroth to a
[1:59:33] man
[1:59:39] engage she has accepted a vow yes I will
[1:59:43] be your
[1:59:46] wife and then she has a relationship
[1:59:49] ship with another
[1:59:51] man before the marriage before she ever
[1:59:55] has a relationship with her husband who
[1:59:58] she made a vow
[2:00:01] to then that
[2:00:03] man has a right to put her
[2:00:08] away and
[2:00:11] remarry does he have an
[2:00:14] obligation he
[2:00:16] must no no
[2:00:20] can the man forgive
[2:00:23] her he can he can forgive
[2:00:27] her and justify
[2:00:30] her for the
[2:00:32] marriage and when he does
[2:00:35] that he releases his
[2:00:40] right to put her
[2:00:43] away and remarry
[2:00:47] again now the
[2:00:51] woman according to God's
[2:00:54] word even
[2:00:57] today once she takes the
[2:01:00] vow and cons and consents to be married
[2:01:03] to a
[2:01:06] man she is bound to that
[2:01:13] man only death only the death of that
[2:01:18] man will ever allow
[2:01:20] her to
[2:01:25] remarry you say what if it's a terrible
[2:01:31] husband she don't have to stay with a
[2:01:34] terrible
[2:01:35] husband while that man lives she she
[2:01:39] doesn't have a scriptural
[2:01:42] right to
[2:01:45] remarry fathers do you see how serious
[2:01:49] it
[2:01:49] is for you to stand and intercede for
[2:01:53] your
[2:01:54] daughters it's their whole
[2:01:57] future it's their whole
[2:02:00] life don't be
[2:02:04] silent intercede for that
[2:02:16] girl not mad I'm just a
[2:02:21] dad three
[2:02:25] daughters and when I saw that it was my
[2:02:30] duty to stand between my
[2:02:33] daughter and some immature young
[2:02:38] man I did
[2:02:40] it I was
[2:02:42] criticized but you know today my
[2:02:45] daughters are married to some of the
[2:02:47] finest young men
[2:02:51] that love
[2:02:52] them watch over
[2:02:55] them treat their children my
[2:02:59] grandchildren with great
[2:03:08] kindness heads of your
[2:03:13] homes the the father in the
[2:03:17] home if I would have
[2:03:21] known the
[2:03:24] responsibility as a Christian
[2:03:29] man in a
[2:03:32] home I may have never gotten
[2:03:35] married because the burden and the
[2:03:37] weight is
[2:03:41] tremendous you are
[2:03:47] responsible
[2:03:50] no brother Daniel if you knew my wife I
[2:03:54] no no if you knew the
[2:03:59] word you could be born
[2:04:02] again if you as a man could get the Holy
[2:04:06] Ghost you'd
[2:04:08] realize you have to stand in the gap for
[2:04:11] that little
[2:04:13] family you have to stand in the gap for
[2:04:16] that little lady your
[2:04:17] wife
[2:04:23] amen you've got to put on the
[2:04:29] harness like they do in
[2:04:33] Oxen and that oxin pulls the
[2:04:38] weight and they never put two old oxin
[2:04:45] together they take the biggest the
[2:04:47] strongest
[2:04:49] the well the well
[2:04:52] trained and they put a younger one next
[2:04:54] to
[2:04:56] it because he's going to train that
[2:04:59] one he'll have the
[2:05:02] strength to pull that younger
[2:05:05] one even if he wants to go a different
[2:05:08] way but he's in the same yoke with
[2:05:12] him and he just pulls
[2:05:14] them and they
[2:05:16] go and he teaches them how
[2:05:19] to make a straight
[2:05:23] line he teaches them how to go from the
[2:05:26] cross of
[2:05:28] Calvary to eternal
[2:05:30] life teaches them his wife and his
[2:05:33] children about the baptism of the Holy
[2:05:41] Ghost we speak of a five-fold
[2:05:45] Ministry but there's a sixfold Ministry
[2:05:50] that isn't spoken of
[2:05:52] much that's the head of each
[2:05:58] home you are the last word in your
[2:06:01] home not
[2:06:04] me you are the head of your
[2:06:07] home not
[2:06:10] me I must set a pattern in the
[2:06:15] assembly before almighty
[2:06:17] God judge me on that day of
[2:06:23] judgment if I don't set the pattern of
[2:06:25] God's word for
[2:06:32] you I must keep the church in
[2:06:36] order and the husband must catch the
[2:06:40] Revelation
[2:06:42] ding wait a
[2:06:44] minute I also need to keep my home in
[2:06:47] order
[2:06:50] I need to be careful who I let in my
[2:06:53] home I need to be careful who I let my
[2:06:56] children go off
[2:07:02] with my family my flesh family my
[2:07:07] brothers my sisters living in
[2:07:11] sin their children growing up
[2:07:15] worldly they were all about the same age
[2:07:20] and my mom told
[2:07:22] me she says why don't you visit your
[2:07:24] brothers and
[2:07:26] sisters why don't you let your children
[2:07:28] play with their
[2:07:31] cousins I said Mom I would be a
[2:07:36] fool to let my
[2:07:39] children go with their cousins knowing
[2:07:42] that in their
[2:07:43] homes they're putting on television
[2:07:46] every
[2:07:47] day of the most most wicked and immoral
[2:07:53] movies and I would send my children to
[2:07:55] be there and sleep over for two or three
[2:08:00] nights that's like that's like leading
[2:08:02] them to the doorstep of
[2:08:07] hell and say stay here with the
[2:08:11] devil I'll be back in three
[2:08:14] days that is if your minds and little
[2:08:16] Souls survive it
[2:08:21] I said Mom while they're living for the
[2:08:24] devil I'll not mix my
[2:08:28] children with these with these
[2:08:30] Philistine
[2:08:32] children and it was my own brother it
[2:08:35] was my
[2:08:36] sister you say but they were just
[2:08:40] children they were just
[2:08:43] children who used the foulest of
[2:08:45] language
[2:08:47] already
[2:08:52] one time as little
[2:08:54] children I seen one of their
[2:08:57] cousins reach over put to put their
[2:08:59] hands on my little
[2:09:03] girl I stopped
[2:09:06] it my little girls didn't know what was
[2:09:09] taking
[2:09:11] place my nephew was shocked that I saw
[2:09:15] him because already their hearts and
[2:09:18] mind Minds had been
[2:09:25] perverted do you see
[2:09:28] dads you must be a Watchman in the
[2:09:35] house how can two walk
[2:09:38] together unless they be
[2:09:41] agreed unless we're all striving for the
[2:09:44] same
[2:09:46] thing to be like Jesus
[2:09:54] Jus the
[2:09:57] Bride is a is a wife
[2:10:01] preparing for a
[2:10:04] marriage and and immediately following
[2:10:07] the
[2:10:09] marriage this bride who is being adorned
[2:10:13] prepared and
[2:10:17] washed
[2:10:21] prepared for the
[2:10:23] marriage prepared for the wedding
[2:10:27] ceremony because as soon as the marriage
[2:10:29] ceremony takes
[2:10:32] place the groom takes her
[2:10:34] away to live with her
[2:10:38] eternally bride
[2:10:41] wife it's your
[2:10:43] ministry it's where you
[2:10:45] start and what you come to just like
[2:10:49] Jesus the lion of the tribe of Judah and
[2:10:52] the Lamb of God which one was he he was
[2:10:57] both but it was his ministry
[2:11:01] unfolding the bride or the wife which
[2:11:03] one are
[2:11:05] you you're
[2:11:10] both what is bride it's the
[2:11:14] wife being
[2:11:16] adorned washed
[2:11:19] cleansed
[2:11:21] prepared for the wedding
[2:11:27] ceremony Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse
[2:11:47] 32
[2:11:56] let's start in verse
[2:11:59] 31 oh generation see ye the word of the
[2:12:06] Lord have I been a Wilderness unto
[2:12:12] Israel a land of
[2:12:15] Darkness wherefore say my people
[2:12:19] we are Lords we will come no more unto
[2:12:23] thee then God says to them through the
[2:12:26] mouth of
[2:12:28] Jeremiah can a maid forget her
[2:12:32] ornaments or a bride her
[2:12:35] attire can she can once she's called
[2:12:39] once she's made a
[2:12:40] vow can she forget that she's preparing
[2:12:43] to be
[2:12:46] wife and made forget her
[2:12:50] ornaments or a bride her
[2:12:52] attire yet my people have forgotten
[2:12:57] me days without
[2:13:00] number and when Jesus came at his first
[2:13:04] coming that was
[2:13:09] Israel like the story of
[2:13:11] Esther in the Book of
[2:13:14] Esther do you realize that that Old
[2:13:16] Testament allegory
[2:13:23] a
[2:13:26] parable is speaking of two
[2:13:29] churches the Orthodox Jewish
[2:13:32] church and a New Testament
[2:13:35] Church the bride of Christ when
[2:13:38] vasti the king's
[2:13:41] wife would no longer be obedient to his
[2:13:45] voice like Israel was when Jesus
[2:13:50] came what did Jesus say when he came to
[2:13:54] Israel I came to you as great Jehovah
[2:14:00] Eagle no he didn't say that he
[2:14:04] didn't he said how
[2:14:08] often as a h tries to gather her
[2:14:14] brood so here is God typing in
[2:14:18] self to a
[2:14:20] hen it sounds terrible to say but
[2:14:23] Jehovah
[2:14:26] hen he says I came to you
[2:14:30] Israel you're not a House of
[2:14:33] Prayer you're a den of
[2:14:36] Thieves you're a chicken
[2:14:39] [Music]
[2:14:40] yard pecking on the ground in the
[2:14:44] dirt looking at the Earth all the time
[2:14:49] and never looking
[2:14:50] up from where
[2:14:55] cometh your
[2:14:57] Redemption Israel was
[2:15:01] vashy and she refused to
[2:15:06] come to be wife to the King King
[2:15:12] Jesus so he chose a new
[2:15:15] bride he went looking for a
[2:15:18] Bride for a wife that would be
[2:15:22] obedient that would be
[2:15:25] adorned in the fashion that he would
[2:15:27] like her to
[2:15:30] be he was looking for a woman that would
[2:15:33] be
[2:15:35] chained because that's what Jesus
[2:15:37] brought to
[2:15:38] Israel change change change change I'm
[2:15:43] going to change the
[2:15:44] way you fathers judge your children
[2:15:48] under the law a rebellious son the
[2:15:52] father would take
[2:15:54] him call the
[2:15:56] Elders by force they would walk him into
[2:15:58] a
[2:16:01] field and if the father said this son
[2:16:04] has been
[2:16:07] rebellious the father and the
[2:16:10] elders would Stone the son to
[2:16:15] death guess what Jesus came to
[2:16:19] change that way of raising your
[2:16:25] kids under the law it was said spare the
[2:16:30] rod and spoil the
[2:16:37] child but Paul said
[2:16:41] when he says don't
[2:16:43] provoke your children to
[2:16:46] anger
[2:16:49] everything had
[2:16:51] changed I want you to know this
[2:16:56] morning that everything has
[2:16:59] changed for the
[2:17:01] believer in
[2:17:03] Christ first of all in a marriage
[2:17:07] [Music]
[2:17:10] covenant God leaves no
[2:17:16] room for a man just to live his wife for
[2:17:19] any
[2:17:22] reason once The Vow is
[2:17:25] made once the Covenant is in
[2:17:30] place
[2:17:33] unless
[2:17:36] unless that the
[2:17:39] woman would be
[2:17:41] unfaithful before the marriage takes
[2:17:46] place and the man cannot divorce
[2:17:50] his and marry
[2:17:52] another you say well what if my wife
[2:17:55] commits adultery
[2:17:58] later five years later 10 years
[2:18:02] later well I'm sure there's many things
[2:18:05] that attributed to her not wanting to be
[2:18:07] with you no
[2:18:10] more but that's not the
[2:18:13] fornication that Jesus was
[2:18:16] speaking CU if you married
[2:18:19] her and she was a
[2:18:22] virgin and she commits adultery
[2:18:25] later that's not the fornication that
[2:18:28] Jesus was
[2:18:31] speaking can you put her away
[2:18:34] sure can you
[2:18:37] remarry no
[2:18:45] no change come
[2:18:48] do we want the changes that Jesus has
[2:18:51] for
[2:18:54] us or do we want to still
[2:18:57] live as
[2:18:59] legalists under the law of
[2:19:02] Moses instead of the grace of
[2:19:13] God As We Stand to our
[2:19:16] feet
[2:19:29] Jeremiah said Can a maid forget her
[2:19:35] ornaments or a bride her
[2:19:38] attire he said yet my people have
[2:19:41] forgotten me days without
[2:19:46] number is Israel refused to be
[2:19:51] wife and then so God put Israel
[2:19:58] away and took to him a new
[2:20:01] wife a
[2:20:04] bride you and
[2:20:06] I so the Bride of Jesus
[2:20:09] Christ is a gentile
[2:20:12] woman not the Jewish
[2:20:14] Church she's not bride she's not wife
[2:20:19] she never
[2:20:20] was she never
[2:20:24] conceived
[2:20:27] seed in Revelations chap
[2:20:31] 12 it's a
[2:20:34] prophecy but this is the bride of
[2:20:38] Christ this is the Lamb's
[2:20:40] wife listen as we're
[2:20:43] closing and there appeared a great
[2:20:45] Wonder in heaven
[2:20:47] a woman clothed with the
[2:20:52] Sun a woman clothed with the
[2:20:55] sun fine
[2:20:57] linen Sun represented the grace of
[2:21:01] God and the moon under her
[2:21:05] feet represented the law of
[2:21:07] Moses and upon her head a crown of 12
[2:21:12] Stars represented the 12
[2:21:16] apostles and she being with child
[2:21:19] CED travailing in
[2:21:22] birth and pain to be
[2:21:27] delivered Israel was never with
[2:21:32] child Israel rejected
[2:21:35] Christ Israel rejected to be
[2:21:38] wife Israel never travailed and
[2:21:42] birth and pain to be delivered of Christ
[2:21:46] inner the
[2:21:48] so who is this woman here this woman is
[2:21:51] the Lamb's
[2:21:53] wife this woman is the bride of
[2:21:56] Christ now in a very literal
[2:22:00] sense this woman was little
[2:22:04] Mary and who did this little virgin
[2:22:08] girl who did she
[2:22:11] represent little
[2:22:13] Mary a little Jewish
[2:22:16] girl represented the bride of
[2:22:19] Christ the Lamb's
[2:22:23] wife because she
[2:22:25] received the spoken
[2:22:27] word the original
[2:22:31] SE Eve received the
[2:22:35] seed Mary received the seed that Eve
[2:22:43] rejected because it wasn't an
[2:22:46] afterthought
[2:22:47] the woman's
[2:22:49] seed was the spoken word
[2:22:51] seed The Original
[2:22:54] Seed it would have brought
[2:22:57] forth the family of
[2:23:00] God and when she would have been
[2:23:02] faithful to
[2:23:05] Adam she would have been faithful to
[2:23:09] God and brought forth the family of
