Revelations 13 is a chapter that begins I'm speaking about this great Beast that was to rise up this Beast will be will be a man will be Satan incarnate in a man satanas and it'll be he will be a one world leader he said and the Bible says that it was given to this one world leader is he will be the king of all the Earth he will be the president of every nation then how can we still have wars the whole world has only one Global Leadership the Bible says it was given to him once he controls the whole earth to make war with the Saints those have been who have been sanctified and power was given him over all kindreds and tongues and Nations that means he was a one worldly significance he was a global leader it's what all the nations are talking about today it's what they claim will fix all of our problems and will make your lives but God has a plan now to take you out of this world before this plan comes into us this prophecy begins to unfold a character and revealing foreign uh is unfold your word to us as only you can you're the Lamb of God for the book is yours we ask all this in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated Revelations 13 and 8. it says in all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him again and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him but there's only but there's one exception whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world where did God know your name from the foundation of the world but when were you born on the Earth I didn't come till 1956. but he knew my name is before I was the son of Angel and Francis I was a Son of God before the foundation my name was in this book is whose names were written in the Book of Life of the Lambs slain from the foundation of the world will escape this Great Tribulation so this book is when did it begin turn with me to Matthew chapter one Matthew chapter 1 and verse 1. and it reads like this the book Libro the book Libro of the generation of Jesus Christ the son of Abraham the book had begun the book was a new testamento the book was the New Covenant the Old Testament the old covenants it only spoke of this book types but the day would come when they would no longer kill natural Lambs when they would no longer kill a natural heifers when the life of that animal that Israel would sacrifice God would receive it to cover their sins but they were never changed a man would be Godzilla numbers to take this book where your name was written a Revelations Uno this was the prophecya Behold a virgin shall be your child bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel it's being interpreted is God With Us it's the book is it was spoken of this prophecy 700 years ago this day in the life of this little lady this scriptures and there are scriptures in the words Santo Jesus isn't Jesus the way of the truth and the line that's a pretty powerful statement and what about Peter Pedro a backslidden fisherman [Music] who said repent and be baptized so then the fight goes because they have no Revelations I'm sure your Bible readers you all remember it it was really a parable speaking about two seeds the seed of God and the seed of the surface Children of the kingdom of God and Children of the devil you realize that there's two fathers of this human race this Parable Jesus was revealing it is [Music] Anointed of the Holy Spirit to reach back into the Old Testament to pull forth a prophecy and he and he declares the prophecy declare La prophecya here in verse 34. Matthew 13. he said all these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and without a parable not unto them the ministry of Jesus and everything he says was in Parables it may sound very literal when you read it but God was hiding something in The Parables of his ministry all these things fake Jesus unto the multitude and Parables Jesus yeah without a parable spoke not unto them the multitude why did he do it this way that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet I will open my mouth in Parables things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world the lamb and Cordero was opening up his books and his Plan of Salvation that was in the mind of God even before his children just like your name is for you were even in your mother's womb the Bible continues same thought and theme foreign last child comes in since the foundation of the world these things that he would speak to us and teach us were things that he was teaching to Adam and Eve from this tutorship they fell from this mentorship they fell from this apprenticeship okay my word will not return to me voice I'll have a man that takes me at his words he created a body of Flesh the human body he created the human body he created was called the Son of God but it wasn't foreign as a man once asked how many gods do you have just one he says that's ridiculous Jesus Christ the body was called equal adios but God went into that vessel and in that body the Bible tells us not three Gods one God in three manifestations but the father the ministry of the father brought in the ministry of the sun you are in the ministry of the Holy Spirit God the Father we couldn't touch him Israel on the mountains selection [Music] more than we even desire to be close to him when he came down and was made the style of his ministries Psalms 78 and verse one it begins with moshil of ASAP this is the Scribe of this song his name was he was the son of ASAP foreign speaks as if though it's him saying it is all prophetic utterances they of the prophets they speak in the first person and you wonder is he talking about himself he was anointing of Jehovah to leave this prophecies if you have been there the day he said it is because he said give ear o my people and his friends and cousins sitting there is a child it was one of the the naughtiest Boys around but now he's being an anointed of God and he says give here all my people incline your ears to the words of my mouth I will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark sayings of old hablade which we have heard and known and our fathers have told us we will not hide them from their children to the generation to come the Praises of the Lord and his wonderful Works yes I will open my mouth the Holy Spirit anointed this is to the heart and mind of Matthew a prophecy that had been laying in the old testamento for over a thousand years but that day that day there in Jerusalem that day Matthew a man of God of the Lamb's Book of Life opens his mouth giving us the style of Ministry of the Lamb of God now with that said let's turn to Matthew 28. and verse 19. Jesus Jesus is about to ascend on highs he's gone through his death burial and resurrection and he gives the last commission to the church and verse 17 says in Matthew 28 and when they saw him they worshiped him but some doubt it and Jesus came and spoken to them saying don't doubt don't do that because all power is given unto me and in Earth then he says go ye therefore and teach all nations in the name of the father hmm did he mean what he said he said he did he say it the way he wanted to say it is did he speak it in a prophetic Parable so was it literally no no he used these words to hide the secrets that he would reveal to his children about three Pentecost this prophecy is given the keys how do you enter into this Kingdom respirito real baptized there's only one door and Peter was given the keys the Holy Spirit God who spoke here therefore and teach All Nations you see how it's written it doesn't say baptizing them in the name father son Holy Ghost it says baptizing them in the name of the father and of the Sun and of the Holy Ghost not in the name don't go baptize in the name father son holy ghosts yes why because so was it spoken by the prophets that when he comes we would speak in Parables and without a parable he would not speak so everything he spoke somebody say s so what would it'll take to understand a prophetic Parable it'll take the author personally revealing personality right so Matthew 2019 it's true it's the word of God something is hidden within this prophetic Parable Dentures to open up this prophecies in the book of Acts chapter 2. how many remember it how many love it we'll begin at verse 36. the day of Pentecost had fully come you know that's what the prophecy was when Jesus Took the book by The Scroll of Isaiah in the synagogue they're in Nazareth and the Bible says the priest took the scroll of Nazareth and handed it to Jesus and Jesus read the first half a verse Isaiah 61 verse 1. and he stopped in the middle of the verse because that's all that was going to come to pass at that time and then he said this day yes you know what the prophecy was he was speaking of the day of Pentecost foreign [Music] therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made that same Jesus whom he crucified both Lord and Christ Jesus Christ Lord Christ I Cristo that's the Holy Spirit and Jesus he Jesus so who is Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus is the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ [Applause] and how much and the birth of Christ foreign forget which one of them they make books they print a book of each child pictures and somewhere on the internet they'll take and they'll have it made into a book and that book starts with the day the little baby was born they sent me one or two or three or plus about 10 000 pictures to my phone also yes and you turned the first page it's a picture of one of my grandchildren yes there is a little baby a little note he's uh he's two hours you turn the page now he's three hours you turn the page he's a whole eight hours recorded therefore verse 36 of Acts 2. let all the house of Israel know assured that God has made that same Jesus Jesus whom he crucified in other words one God changing forms because he wanted to get closer and many times as she got closer we got scared and then he'd see us and maybe a few months later someone would say aren't you tired of running don't you want to know Jesus and we'd get scared again oh but he didn't give up on us [Music] Jesus Savior of my soul tires Glory oh Gloria therefore let the house of Israel know assuredly God hath made that same Jesus Jesus Christ now when they heard this they were pricked in there and Jesus said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles and they said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren is these these men these women who were there on the day of Pentecost watching 120 people being blessed by the Holy Spirit in a powerful manner manifestations and they were watching him and they read these were the ones that stood there on crucifixion days these are many of whom cried out and screamed with the crowd much but when they came to this old-fashioned meeting the Holy Spirit the Bible says they were pricked in their hearts that just a few days earlier about 50 days remember Jesus after his death and burial Jesus and was seen of many for a period of 40 days after 40 days yes is called the day of pentatives and the Holy Spirit sovereign these people in verse 37. these were many of those that 50 days prior estos foreign when they heard this the Bible says what shall we do seen that we've blessed in God be in the famous blessing that we screamed crucified their names must have been on the Lamb's Book of Life you say could a man scream crucify him today and tomorrow God said I forgive you um [Music] he persecuted the Church of Jesus Christ that's why he would say the chief of Sinners but God has made me worthy because I'm a Son of God because I did I did it in the ignorance all the amazing Graceville then Peter said unto them you not screamed crucify him when the Roman soldiers stuck the spear in his eyes [Music] [Applause] to all of you Peter said I say unto you repent repetitos and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ Santo this day is Matthew 28 19. the prophecy the professor was fulfilled and Matthew 28 19. they come together like this there's no scripture fighting scriptures no no one was a prophecy because it was the same thing from the prophets of Allah [Music] now your ears can hear it your heart one of you in the name of Jesus Christ and when you're baptized that way was that company foreign foreign because these men and women the devil was already working in their minds yeah okay so you made a mistake okay professor is that the word is a discerner of the hearts and intents and Peter by the Holy Spirit how Satan was trying to drag them people down where they could say yeah okay I do believe he was Messiah but it can't be for me I've crossed the line and Peter by the Holy Spirit foreign foreign then it says and with many other words we can testify and exhort s from this untoward generation and you waited yes pero like I'm waiting and the Bible says then they gladly received his word verse 41. foreign foreign would come to set them free but not free as kings the freedom was Supernatural Freedom was in your heart the freedom was to be set from from the from the lust of the flesh the pride of life that's what this king of Jesus Christ God yes at the end of descending with one purpose has been his descending to get closer to you remember Thessalonians the Lord himself now Paul is speaking in Parables speaking in symbols because it was the way of Jesus now it was the way of this messenger because he was being led of the Holy Spirit he said and the Lord himself the voice of the archangels what was it it was a three-part mystery of the ministry of Christ that is prophet we have been speaking El Domingo and we're just going to start right now what I just said that was extra okay no charge but this new order this new ministry can we entitled it prophets and priests in the laws and Prophets and Priests no law professors because some think that the prophetic Ministry ended foreign [Music] it was two two ministries of the same person Jesus right queso Cristo it began coming so with a new order of prophets which was John the Baptist Luke chapter one Lucas Capital Uno Luke chapter one will begin at verse 13. as you remember the story of Zechariah Elizabeth Zechariah was a priest and it happened to be that this time that Zechariah as a Levi the priest had come his time that he would burn incense represents prayers ascending up high incense and he was to burn incense for the for the for the for for the for all of Israel Israel as a prayer unto God interceding for the people so Zechariah goes into the temple and and outside is a whole multitude of people yes and while Zechariah goes into the temple the Bible says it appears unto him an angel of the Lord the teachings and the rituals and he's a big man yes the Bible says he was trouble in verse 13. for thy prayer is Zechariah was an old man Elizabeth and Zechariah is still praying Lord I'd like to have a service and the Bible says the angel tells him you're not Zechariah thy prayer is heard and thy wife Elizabeth shall bear the son and thou shall call his name John yeah and thou shall have joy and gladness and many shall rejoice at his birth for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink it was the beginning of a new ministry under the old testamento they still drink wine from time to time they would take strong drink even the priests but now a new ministry has begun he was to be an example to a new generation he was the first fruits of this new generation this Prophet is more than a prophet it was a forerunner to the first coming of Christ he will was to live a certain way and his life was to be an example all who followed would live is for he shall be great in the sight of the Lord and shall drink neither wine nor strong and he shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother's womb sometimes we think about how old or how young you must be abuses [Music] it seems like there's a Bible principle here that says you can't be too young and you can't be too old Jesus John received it even from his mother's womb and it's at verse 16. basically he says and many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God because Israel had long left God was not with Israel Israel at this time they had long abandoned his statutes remember that day on Pilots tribunals when when pilate said to to the high priest and the children of Israel what shall I do get it with the king of the Jews and then the high Priests of Israel Israel anointed of Lucifer um we have no King but Caesar Israel Israel had rejected the Lamb's Book of Life is the opening of this book Israel had rejected when Jesus loosed the Seven Seals because Seven Seals on the Lamb's Book of Life but when the seals were loose foreign how do we know it's the Lamb's books because the first picture was taken there's Jesus is a baby just eight years old they're going to take them to be circumcised foreign that's what God uses prophets foreign he Cristo what do I do now Peter said this is what you have to do of how you've been living of how you've been talking about how you've been treating your wife how you've been treating your husband of how you've been treating your children it'll make you a better father it'll make you a better mother make you a better son this baptism so this not only of water baptism that brought the John said God would give you a baptism of the Holy Spirit fire is a cleanser completely but the original part original Gabriel speaking to Zechariah of John his son telling him who he was and what he would do telling him about his ministry that he would have in verse 17. and he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elias foreign hmm he's the Elijah Ministry he will be the Forerunner to the first coming of Christ and he will turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just to make ready a people prepared for the Lord is this prophetic Ministry was part of the preparation for God's people Gabriel was quoting the prophet Malachi Gabriel turn with me to the Book of Malachi yes The Book of Malachi chapter four and verse begins with speaking of the unend time prophecy where the whole Earth would be burned up for the proud and the wicked would be made stubble um he goes on to say after he brings this statement of judgment to the whole earth then he brings then he turns it to the positive side and he says but unto you that fear my name is Lord Jesus Christ aren't you that fear my name is [Music] and he said shall tread down the wicked after this world is all burned to us foreign I'm doing something new I'm doing something different and yet I'm doing something that the prophets have spoken in types in allegories in Psalms in symbols in metaphors foreign I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet before I do what I told you in verse one that I was going to do oh this Bible is written behold I send you lies the prophet before the coming and great and Dreadful day of the Lord okay okay what will he do this shall turn the heart of the father is that what Gabriel told Zechariah and there's a comma you know apart because the first part is Jesus Nina he'll do it that way when he rises up the second Elijah at the end of time for a world is destroyed he'll do it for one purpose to once again because the book was lost for over 1500 years after 300 years after the Resurrection The Rose up a church called the Roman Catholic church and it took all the books took all the writings of the prophets and forbade the people and no one had a Bible no one had the scriptures no one had the Gospels even if they had them most of them couldn't read so how did they survive how did they ignore Jesus by a personal experience by a born-again experience did you know you can be born again and not even know how to read it did you know that you can receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost and never have gone to school even one day you know that you don't need an education leader Pedro upon this Russia gates of hell yes and what school did Peter go yeah first grade second grade did he have a college education no no the the Bible says he couldn't even he was illiterate couldn't even write life did he make it to Junior High yeah didn't even know what that was surely he got into he was into Elementary School and went to the sixth grade he never even went to first grade he didn't even know what kindergarten was kinder he almost went right from the crib to fishing with his Dad he had no education but one day perundian God gave him Revelations he had an experience with Jesus Christ he got to know him in the power of his resurrection and it made him a man Fearless that when they finally took him prisoners one of many times history tells us that he told his executioners hang me upside down on the cross I'm not worthy to die like my Lord what gave him that courage a born-again experience wants to make you a new creation if you'll stop running and turn around and bow is I I've been going to church for 10 years now hmm going to church doesn't make your new creation no no repentance obedience obedient to God's words going to church makes you a legalist yes that's the way of death we come to know the Lord but when we repentance and are baptized if we're truly repentance when the man baptizes you in water person truly repented God is and you'll never be the same again Islam's book of life it was John the Baptista he was to be he was to introduce this Lamb of God we read of his ministry in Isaiah 40. and he said yes how he would come and and The Way It Was Written it was also written in a way there was hidden hidden from the eyes of the wise Improvement It Was Written in the story it was written in a type in a shadow God did it to hide it so that he would only reveal it to his children to the wise version the prophecy of Isaiah 40. I read it it was the first coming of Christ it was a prophecy right out of the Lamb's Book of Life because it spoke of Pardon it spoke that he would comfort his people spoke that he would prepare their ways to receive salvation he said Comfort ye Comfort ye my people sayeth your God speak comfortably to Jerusalem Israel tell Jerusalem said that when I come your Warfare is accomplished I'll fight your battles Jesus Christ this morning is speaking to your heart he wants to tell you your Warfare is accomplished [Music] [Music] for your iniquities you can find Rest in Me how will it come come this I'll start it this way I'll send the voice of him crying in the wilderness he'll help prepare the way he's going to introduce me to you because Israel no longer knew how to recognize Jehovah Jesus Israel hadn't felt the presence in Jehovah in a few thousand years Israel wasn't what was a religious organization God wasn't in it anymore [Music] where God wants us into a personal experience true it said he would make straight in the desert what is this speak of building roles no no no no it spoke of a change then this is a great change every Valley shall be exalted that's a great change the Crooked shall be made straight that's a great change and the rough places that's a great chance so the so the five steps of the ministry of the lives was going to bring five things Israel foreign when we who are alive and remains Elijah Minnesota was being bringing great change no longer the law of Moses no longer thou shall not kill yeah Thou shalt not commit adultery that was over yesterday you say wait a minute seems to me that thou shall not kill is a good thing to practice the human race has failed to practice it that's what wars since the beginning of time this is Cain killed his brother Thou shalt not kill the Commandments it didn't work it's never worked had a new plan for his children but there had to come a man that would take God in his words a man who was a Kinsman to you and I um who could redeem us so that Upon Our Redemption a door in heaven would be open and now we could have a birth Immaculate birth like Jesus the born-again experience universe and when Jesus said the law and the prophets were until June he says since then he said they sentences the kingdom of God is preached to see what happens the prophetic ministry didn't end up what they would preach now they would preach lives what will he do at the second coming of Christ what's she looking to do in your life if Jesus Christ what he wants to bring to you when you feel his presence it's the same five things that he promised to the first election and when God pulls at your heart bring you into repentance it's because there's five things he wants to do is is Supernatural foreign of an oak tree they say probably that seed has no that you can see the seed has no leaves you hold it in your hands I don't see any Roots if it's a fruit tree there's no apples on it it's a tiny little seed but when you lay it in Fertile ground and it begins to grow is is the Bible holds the plan of God this is the Lamb's Book of Life because started speaking of the Lamb's birth when all the way speaking of the Lamb's death then it spoke of the Lamb's resurrection of the Lamb being glorified and sitting at the right hand of the throne giving us a chance to ask God for forgiveness and ask him this morning Lord Jesus foreign that you would reveal this president we could come to be a pistols and our lives of the Saving Grace of Jesus Christ that three thousand could be born in a day and if not three thousands at least let us affect our families for the saving of their souls father we thank you this morning quick in your word to our hearts give us Revelation soften our hearts the Holy Ghost and
