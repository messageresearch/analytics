[47:51] amen God bless you all this
[47:54] morning it's good to be back in this
[47:58] house of God and what makes it a house
[48:01] of
[48:02] God it's his
[48:05] presence but what also makes it a house
[48:07] of
[48:09] God is your
[48:11] presence and when we gather
[48:14] together and his presence and our
[48:18] presence
[48:19] together then it makes it the house of
[48:23] God God with his family
[48:27] once again we ministered on uh behold
[48:30] what manner of
[48:36] love and we read out of First John
[48:39] chapter
[48:43] 3 and we want to read that scripture
[48:46] once
[48:47] again as we open up this part two this
[48:52] morning first we want to read the
[48:54] scripture Rec cap on what we
[49:01] spoke and then Lord willing God will
[49:04] help us to finish this thought here this
[49:09] morning first John chapter
[49:12] 3 verse one behold what manner of love
[49:17] the father hath bestowed upon us that we
[49:19] should be called the sons of God
[49:22] therefore the world knoweth us not
[49:24] because it knew him not
[49:31] [Music]
[49:35] behold now are we the sons of God and it
[49:39] does not yet appear what we shall be but
[49:43] we know that when he shall appear we
[49:47] shall be like him for we shall see him
[49:50] as he
[49:54] is
[50:05] I want to read it one more time verse
[50:07] two it says beloved now are we the sons
[50:12] of
[50:15] God right
[50:17] now this
[50:19] morning this moment if we can
[50:23] recognize now
[50:25] we are the sons of
[50:27] God and then John
[50:30] says and he's connecting these two
[50:34] thoughts
[50:36] together it does not yet appear what we
[50:40] shall
[50:43] be we're going to be like
[50:47] Jesus but John is
[50:50] saying it's hard to see that right
[50:54] now because because we're being
[50:58] persecuted because we're being chased
[51:01] out of
[51:06] Jerusalem because everyone is against
[51:10] us the
[51:12] denomination the federal
[51:14] government everything's working against
[51:18] us so we're in a bit of a stage of
[51:21] spiritual
[51:24] amnesia
[51:26] we're we're we're we're we're feeling
[51:28] all these human
[51:31] emotions we're feeling
[51:35] fear we're feeling we have to run for
[51:38] our
[51:40] lives so he says and it does not yet
[51:43] appear what what we shall
[51:49] be
[51:50] then see it started out so
[51:54] positive
[51:56] verse two it said behold beloved now are
[51:59] we the sons of
[52:01] God
[52:03] positive and then it looks like he drops
[52:06] off a little negative and it does not
[52:09] get
[52:12] appear what what we shall
[52:16] be it's like he drops us back down
[52:21] oh then he's going to lift us up
[52:24] again
[52:26] know that when he shall
[52:29] appear he says we know
[52:31] this we shall be like
[52:36] him for we shall see him as he
[52:41] is remember as a gentile
[52:44] people as the bride of
[52:47] Christ he doesn't appear to us as a
[52:53] group think about that
[52:57] but when he shall
[53:00] appear not to a
[53:02] group but to
[53:05] you an
[53:08] individual so does that make his
[53:10] appearing
[53:12] now a personal experience with Jesus
[53:19] Christ where you as an individual you
[53:22] know he's appeared to you
[53:27] and yet then there's many that say but
[53:29] he hasn't
[53:32] appeared but many others might
[53:36] say he has not
[53:38] appeared and he
[53:41] hasn't to
[53:43] them but to those who
[53:47] believe but we know John
[53:50] said that when he shall
[53:53] appear to us personally
[53:56] then we
[53:58] personally shall be like him even if
[54:01] nobody else
[54:05] is we shall see
[54:08] him as he
[54:10] is in us the hope of
[54:14] glory verse three and every man that
[54:18] have this
[54:21] hope the hope of a born again experience
[54:25] of the love of God being bured in our
[54:29] hearts and every man that have this hope
[54:31] in
[54:33] him purifieth
[54:37] himself it takes a holy ghost
[54:43] experience to begin
[54:46] purifying
[54:49] ourselves he said even how
[54:53] pure even as he is
[54:56] pure how
[54:58] perfect even as he is
[55:05] perfect and verse n of 1 John
[55:10] 3 whosoever is born of
[55:14] God whosoever is born of
[55:19] God does not commit
[55:23] sin you might make a
[55:27] mistake then God will correct
[55:30] you and we repent
[55:32] again and you keep traveling in this
[55:37] journey
[55:38] Perfection he says whosoever is born of
[55:41] God does not commit sin for his seed
[55:44] remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[55:47] because he is born of
[55:54] God
[55:59] oh these are the kind of
[56:02] scriptures that you read over and over
[56:04] and
[56:06] over and each time it keeps connecting
[56:09] more and
[56:11] more with all that's
[56:14] written let's pray Heavenly Father we
[56:18] thank you once again this
[56:21] morning for We Are
[56:23] beholding
[56:25] what manner of
[56:28] love that you that you the father have
[56:31] given
[56:32] us and we thank you in Jesus name amen
[56:38] amen you may be
[56:42] seated behold what manner of love that
[56:46] the father has given
[56:51] us God's love as we spoke
[56:57] and the measure of his
[56:59] love is his longsuffering towards
[57:06] us in St John 3 and verse three we read
[57:09] where
[57:13] Jesus he he said you must be born again
[57:16] he told
[57:20] Nicodemus he says or you cannot see the
[57:22] kingdom of God
[57:27] we unless we be born
[57:31] again we cannot
[57:34] see why we must
[57:38] seek and
[57:40] look for
[57:42] Holiness for
[57:44] honesty for
[57:46] Fidelity for
[57:49] meekness to be
[57:52] merciful these are the things
[57:55] in our Christian
[57:58] walk that give us the
[58:00] victory over the
[58:02] flesh we read in Ephesians
[58:06] 4 and if you'll turn with me once
[58:10] again Ephesians 4 verse
[58:22] 30 Apostle Paul
[58:26] adding more
[58:29] detail to the to the love of God to the
[58:32] Born Again
[58:34] experience to the things that the
[58:36] baptism of the Holy Ghost takes from
[58:42] us and in verse 30 of Ephesians
[58:47] 4 Paul says and grieve not the holy
[58:50] spirit of
[58:52] God whereby you are sealed until the day
[58:55] of
[58:58] redemption now verse 30 was a was a kind
[59:01] of a closing
[59:07] statement uh and and it had to do with
[59:11] the 29 verses
[59:14] before no with all the with all those 29
[59:20] verses from 1 to
[59:22] 29 verse 30
[59:25] was a kind of a closing
[59:33] statement so so in in verse 30 he Paul
[59:37] says and grieve not the holy spirit of
[59:40] God whereby you are sealed unto the day
[59:43] of
[59:46] redemption this baptism of the Holy
[59:49] Ghost that doesn't come just
[59:53] once it's not not a onetime
[59:57] experience it is a first time
[1:00:01] experience it is a first time
[1:00:12] experience but it's not a one-time
[1:00:17] experience It's Time After Time After
[1:00:21] Time that this baptism of the Holy
[1:00:24] spirit with
[1:00:27] fire that is cleansing
[1:00:33] us it's cleansing
[1:00:37] us of this old
[1:00:40] nature the very reason we must be born
[1:00:46] again there is a
[1:00:48] reason it's because our first
[1:00:53] birth the natural
[1:00:57] birth is the
[1:00:59] curse that fell on the human
[1:01:02] race that fell on Adam's CH Adam's
[1:01:08] children that fell on Eve's
[1:01:12] children that also brought brought forth
[1:01:15] a Generation of
[1:01:19] Vipers the children of the
[1:01:22] devil so that's why
[1:01:25] we must be born
[1:01:27] again but if there is a teaching in the
[1:01:31] Bible that the that the religious World
[1:01:44] fights it's this teaching on the serpent
[1:01:49] seed it's this
[1:01:52] teaching that the good seed are the
[1:01:54] children of
[1:01:57] God and that the
[1:02:00] tears is the children of the devil and
[1:02:03] those are quotes from The
[1:02:06] Bible and yet they refuse to
[1:02:11] believe the religious World wants to
[1:02:15] believe we're all
[1:02:19] good we're all good we're all God's
[1:02:23] children
[1:02:25] and no matter how you
[1:02:29] die no matter how you
[1:02:32] die no no no matter how ungodly a life
[1:02:36] you
[1:02:41] lived at everyone's
[1:02:44] [Music]
[1:02:46] funeral you might have been a horrible
[1:02:53] gangster
[1:02:55] and they at your funeral they
[1:02:58] say he's resting
[1:03:00] now in the hands of
[1:03:04] Jesus I've been in those
[1:03:10] funerals but that's not the
[1:03:13] truth there are the children of
[1:03:17] God and they are children of the
[1:03:22] devil but the entire human
[1:03:32] race has been
[1:03:36] corrupted with the high breeding of the
[1:03:39] family of
[1:03:41] God Ephesians 4:30
[1:03:45] says and grieve not the holy spirit of
[1:03:48] God whereby you are sealed unto the day
[1:03:50] of
[1:03:53] redemption
[1:03:57] then he said then you might ask
[1:04:02] why he says grieve not the holy spirit
[1:04:05] of God whereby you are sealed unto the
[1:04:07] day of
[1:04:13] redemption what are the ways we could
[1:04:16] grieve the holy spirit in our
[1:04:18] life what are the
[1:04:23] way
[1:04:25] bitterness verse
[1:04:27] 31
[1:04:29] bitterness wrath anger clamor evil
[1:04:36] speaking Paul says put it away from
[1:04:42] you and all
[1:04:45] malice verse
[1:04:48] 32 then how do we keep the Holy Spirit
[1:04:51] close to
[1:04:53] us
[1:04:55] how do we keep his presence around
[1:05:00] us and in our Gatherings
[1:05:03] together and he says Be Kind one to
[1:05:06] another tenderhearted forgiving one
[1:05:09] another even as God for Christ's sake
[1:05:12] hath forgiven
[1:05:23] you
[1:05:24] wow
[1:05:27] wow
[1:05:29] God rich in
[1:05:32] Mercy behold what manner of
[1:05:36] love that the father has given
[1:05:41] us in the
[1:05:46] beginning there in
[1:05:50] Eden Eve reasoned with the serpent
[1:05:56] uh on on the path or the
[1:05:59] way to bring forth the family of
[1:06:06] God the serpent didn't present a whole
[1:06:09] different plan
[1:06:13] to no he presented the same
[1:06:17] plan that they were to bring forth the
[1:06:20] family of
[1:06:21] God but he told her
[1:06:24] I've got a I've got a better
[1:06:27] way I've got a faster
[1:06:31] way and I've got a way that instead of
[1:06:34] Adam teaching you you'll be able to go
[1:06:36] teach Adam
[1:06:41] now so he reasoned with the
[1:06:44] serpent about the way that God's family
[1:06:47] would be to
[1:06:53] existence she should have
[1:06:56] known that that Adam had to be included
[1:06:59] in this
[1:07:02] way and to exclude her
[1:07:05] husband was a great
[1:07:10] mistake but the
[1:07:12] serpent inspired of
[1:07:18] Lucifer his
[1:07:20] way talk to
[1:07:22] Eve
[1:07:25] his way that was taught to
[1:07:30] Eve was a
[1:07:32] lie that brought
[1:07:34] death to every living thing on planet
[1:07:40] Earth Satan had a
[1:07:43] way he was a
[1:07:46] way but he was also the
[1:07:49] lie and he was
[1:07:52] death Jesus is is also a
[1:07:59] way Jesus is also the
[1:08:02] way but he's also the
[1:08:05] truth and he's also
[1:08:07] life Lucifer used the
[1:08:11] serpent to inject his seed into the
[1:08:14] human
[1:08:18] race to genetically modify
[1:08:22] it
[1:08:24] the natural
[1:08:26] man the family of God with the de with
[1:08:30] with the
[1:08:33] characteristics of this most subtile
[1:08:38] Beast most subal beast of the
[1:08:42] field this was The Missing
[1:08:47] Link in between the animal kingdom and
[1:08:52] man
[1:08:55] reasoned with the
[1:08:57] thought how that her and Adam would
[1:08:59] bring forth a
[1:09:04] generation of the family of
[1:09:07] God had Eve looked at the
[1:09:10] pattern had Eve looked see
[1:09:15] Eva of God's of God's
[1:09:18] word over the past six
[1:09:22] days
[1:09:25] of
[1:09:27] creation and now she was living in the
[1:09:29] seventh
[1:09:31] day she would have
[1:09:35] said okay
[1:09:37] now so far God has done
[1:09:43] everything he's brought everything to
[1:09:48] pass by the
[1:09:50] power of the spoken word
[1:09:54] that was the
[1:09:55] pattern had she stopped to look at the
[1:09:58] pattern in the word of
[1:10:01] God and she stopped to look at the
[1:10:03] pattern of how God was doing everything
[1:10:05] the
[1:10:10] creation she would have
[1:10:13] realized well that's the way God will
[1:10:16] bring it to
[1:10:18] pass that's how me and AD me and Adam
[1:10:21] will bring forth the family of God
[1:10:25] by the spoken
[1:10:27] word because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:10:30] yesterday today and
[1:10:34] forever and
[1:10:37] surely if had she
[1:10:40] thought for a
[1:10:42] moment she would have said
[1:10:45] surely we will
[1:10:47] follow we will
[1:10:49] follow in his
[1:10:52] footprints
[1:10:54] that's how we must think
[1:10:56] today as we read the
[1:10:59] word what's the
[1:11:01] pattern how will we come to
[1:11:05] Perfection following his
[1:11:08] footsteps do what he
[1:11:12] did
[1:11:14] instead she took the devil's
[1:11:18] way a
[1:11:21] shortcut that was a line
[1:11:25] and brought
[1:11:26] death Eve gave her sacred
[1:11:34] virtue her
[1:11:36] virginity to the serpent another
[1:11:40] man but she did
[1:11:43] it but but she did
[1:11:45] it when she was Adam's
[1:11:49] bride Adam's
[1:11:52] wife but before the wedding
[1:11:57] day she gave her sacred
[1:12:02] virtue to
[1:12:04] another there is the
[1:12:07] fornication that Jesus spoke
[1:12:11] of in Matthew
[1:12:13] 19 when he said that when he gave only
[1:12:16] one
[1:12:18] reason why a man could could leave his
[1:12:22] wife
[1:12:24] and marry
[1:12:25] another and that reason was for
[1:12:30] fornication you see the
[1:12:33] answer this was the type of fornication
[1:12:36] he was speaking
[1:12:39] of when he said
[1:12:42] fornication Webster's Dictionary doesn't
[1:12:44] have the
[1:12:47] answer you if you can't you you can't
[1:12:50] look into the dictionaries and find the
[1:12:52] definition
[1:12:56] you've got to go back to the pattern of
[1:12:58] God's
[1:13:00] word and when you see the pattern of
[1:13:02] God's
[1:13:05] word then then God's word interprets its
[1:13:08] own
[1:13:10] word what happened in
[1:13:13] Genesis interpreted the word fornication
[1:13:17] for
[1:13:19] us you can't use human reasoning
[1:13:25] so it was fornication that Jesus
[1:13:28] said when a woman is
[1:13:31] engaged when when when a woman is betr
[1:13:35] as it says in the
[1:13:39] Bible then then there's a time that she
[1:13:43] prepares
[1:13:45] herself she's she is the
[1:13:48] bride once
[1:13:50] engaged she is the man's wife
[1:13:54] cuz she she's made a promise to
[1:13:57] him and he's made a promise to
[1:14:00] her and in the eyes of God they're
[1:14:03] husband and
[1:14:05] wife so she is the
[1:14:08] wife but she's also the bride because
[1:14:11] the Bride is a wife preparing
[1:14:17] herself the
[1:14:19] bride is is a
[1:14:22] wife
[1:14:24] the bride is the
[1:14:27] wife preparing herself for the wedding
[1:14:33] day but she still has her sacred
[1:14:40] trust until that day that the husband
[1:14:45] will take her to live with him
[1:14:51] forever but that's why why Jesus called
[1:14:55] what Eve did
[1:15:01] fornication because Eve though she was
[1:15:05] Adam's
[1:15:06] wife gave her sacred trust to another
[1:15:13] man but she was the
[1:15:19] wife but they but Adam and Eve had not
[1:15:22] come together yet
[1:15:26] so that's the
[1:15:28] fornication that Jesus spoke
[1:15:31] of that a man could divorce his
[1:15:35] wife and marry
[1:15:38] another outside of that there are no
[1:15:42] reason there is no Bible or scriptural
[1:15:49] reason for which a man can leave his
[1:15:52] wife
[1:15:54] divorce
[1:15:55] her and marry
[1:15:58] another oh they they they can
[1:16:01] separate they can
[1:16:03] divorce but he can't marry
[1:16:06] again unless it be for this
[1:16:11] reason of for this kind of
[1:16:14] fornication that the woman would
[1:16:18] commit so
[1:16:20] now so now it's no longer a man can
[1:16:23] divorce his wife and marry another for
[1:16:25] any
[1:16:32] reason he doesn't have any reason he
[1:16:36] wants
[1:16:39] anymore he has just one
[1:16:42] reason and if this isn't the
[1:16:45] reason once he
[1:16:48] marries he cannot
[1:16:51] remarry but but unless you be born
[1:16:55] again you cannot see this so you'll live
[1:16:59] like the rest of the
[1:17:02] world marrying and divorcing and
[1:17:05] marrying and
[1:17:09] divorcing oh brother Daniel you mean uh
[1:17:11] the the the Catholic
[1:17:16] people or or the Baptist people or the
[1:17:20] Pentecostal people no no no I I mean I
[1:17:23] mean the message
[1:17:32] people so
[1:17:34] Eve betrothed to Adam
[1:17:38] engaged to be
[1:17:41] married Adam's
[1:17:45] bride commits an act of
[1:17:50] fornication she gives her virginity
[1:17:54] to another man instead of her
[1:17:58] husband but she was already
[1:18:01] engaged she was Adam's
[1:18:06] bride Lucifer uses the
[1:18:10] serpent which the Bible says is a
[1:18:14] beast a
[1:18:16] mammal
[1:18:18] m not a
[1:18:20] reptile and he but he was the most
[1:18:24] subtile beast of the
[1:18:27] field the most
[1:18:30] subtle he was more
[1:18:33] subtle than the
[1:18:36] chimpanzee he was beyond
[1:18:41] that he was a man to look
[1:18:45] at the serpent was a one of a kind
[1:18:51] Beast the serpent was
[1:18:53] a the he was the only kind of his
[1:18:59] [Music]
[1:19:02] type there was no Mrs
[1:19:07] serpent you would say wait a minute
[1:19:10] brother
[1:19:12] Daniel the Bible says he he he made all
[1:19:15] the the the animals of the
[1:19:20] Kingdom male and female made he
[1:19:25] them and he
[1:19:27] did except for this
[1:19:31] one this one was made for a
[1:19:37] purpose so that when God gave his
[1:19:39] children free moral
[1:19:47] agency then there'd be something for
[1:19:49] them to choose
[1:19:51] between
[1:19:55] if I tell
[1:19:57] you I'm going to let you
[1:20:01] choose what you would
[1:20:03] like to eat for lunch
[1:20:09] today and here I've got a
[1:20:12] hamburger and here I got a
[1:20:15] hamburger they both got
[1:20:19] mayonnaise the
[1:20:21] meat a little bit of lettuce
[1:20:25] and
[1:20:26] tomato but I want you to choose what you
[1:20:28] want to
[1:20:30] eat so of these two which one would you
[1:20:34] like well I'm I'm telling you I'm giving
[1:20:37] you a choice but I'm but but in reality
[1:20:39] there is no
[1:20:43] choice but no but God said I'm going to
[1:20:45] give you a
[1:20:47] choice that we'll be able to choose
[1:20:50] between Good and
[1:20:51] Evil
[1:20:54] now this one of a kind
[1:20:58] Beast now this
[1:21:00] serpent who was a one of a
[1:21:05] kind with no Mrs
[1:21:10] serpent now you
[1:21:12] say where did God ever do that
[1:21:17] before because there must be a pattern
[1:21:19] of it
[1:21:21] then so we go to the
[1:21:24] Bible and we read on the about
[1:21:28] Jonah and Jonah is on a
[1:21:32] ship on his way to
[1:21:36] Tarsus and and the great storm hits
[1:21:41] them and the storm is so
[1:21:45] great that they know it's going to
[1:21:47] destroy the ship and kill
[1:21:51] all
[1:21:54] they began to say what's wrong who has
[1:22:00] sinned and Jonah stands
[1:22:02] up being an honest
[1:22:05] man he says I'm the one at
[1:22:10] fault he says if you cast me
[1:22:15] over he says this storm will be
[1:22:20] calmed they struggled with it a
[1:22:24] little but he said no you must for the
[1:22:26] rest of you to be
[1:22:30] saved and they throw him over the
[1:22:34] ship and they see a great fish come up
[1:22:36] and swallow
[1:22:40] him and they said and the and the storm
[1:22:43] calms
[1:22:45] down they said surely this man was the
[1:22:48] guilty
[1:22:51] one but Jonah lives in this
[1:22:56] fish for three
[1:22:58] days like because it was a type and a
[1:23:00] shadow of
[1:23:03] Christ that he would be three days in
[1:23:05] the
[1:23:08] earth and then rise up
[1:23:11] again
[1:23:13] Jonah was was a type of
[1:23:16] this the Bible
[1:23:19] says that God made this created this
[1:23:25] fish this was a special
[1:23:30] creation there was no other fish in the
[1:23:33] ocean like
[1:23:38] it there will never be another one like
[1:23:42] it it was a one of a
[1:23:47] kind of this
[1:23:50] species it was a whale
[1:23:54] that could swallow a
[1:23:57] man and the man would could was able to
[1:24:00] live inside of this
[1:24:05] fish for three days then the
[1:24:09] fish would be led of
[1:24:12] God to take the
[1:24:16] prophet to the
[1:24:18] beach of
[1:24:20] Nineveh open his mouth
[1:24:23] and the prophet walk out of the
[1:24:27] fish and when the people of
[1:24:31] Neva worshiped the fish
[1:24:35] God saw no saw Jonah walk out of this
[1:24:39] fish's
[1:24:42] mouth they said surely this is a prophet
[1:24:45] sent of God to
[1:24:49] us and whatever he tells us we're going
[1:24:53] to do
[1:24:54] it but this was a one-of-a kind
[1:25:02] fish there was no Mrs
[1:25:05] fish or maybe it was a Mrs
[1:25:10] fish but there was no Mr
[1:25:14] Fish this was a one of a
[1:25:19] kind
[1:25:21] fish
[1:25:22] for this event that would take
[1:25:26] place for
[1:25:27] prophecy to come to
[1:25:32] pass so here we have this
[1:25:35] serpent a one of a
[1:25:39] kind there was not two of them there was
[1:25:42] not a m
[1:25:44] one he said and the turent approaches
[1:25:46] Eaves and and brings
[1:25:49] forth so the serpent
[1:25:54] and brings forth a generation of
[1:25:58] serpents by planting his
[1:26:03] seed in Adam's virgin
[1:26:09] bride this was the fall of
[1:26:16] mankind this was the
[1:26:18] curse that Jesus died on the cross of
[1:26:21] calvary
[1:26:24] to give us the victory
[1:26:27] over through a born again
[1:26:31] experience because the natural
[1:26:35] [Music]
[1:26:36] birth was introduced to Adam and
[1:26:42] Eve through the
[1:26:44] serpent God wanted them to bring forth
[1:26:46] the family of
[1:26:50] God by the spoke spoken
[1:26:53] word like Jesus was
[1:26:56] born like he came into this
[1:27:00] world and when he
[1:27:02] came he gave us that that birth back
[1:27:05] again to every son and daughter of
[1:27:11] God to put away the curse of the
[1:27:18] natural so that so that he could change
[1:27:21] and mold us
[1:27:25] for us to become the clay in his
[1:27:30] hands and the Potter form
[1:27:37] us into his very
[1:27:43] image this was the fall of
[1:27:47] mankind the sex
[1:27:51] birth
[1:27:54] this continues to be the
[1:27:58] fall of every
[1:28:02] relationship between man and
[1:28:05] woman and the fall of every
[1:28:09] family for for the natural
[1:28:13] birth brings natural
[1:28:18] characteristics of the
[1:28:20] serpent this is why Jesus Jesus
[1:28:23] said in Matthew
[1:28:25] 13 and verse
[1:28:29] 38 he said the field is the
[1:28:34] world this say
[1:28:38] uh Matthew
[1:28:41] 13:38 he said the field is the world the
[1:28:45] good seed are the children of the
[1:28:50] Kingdom so there there is one
[1:28:53] seed and the good seed are the children
[1:28:56] of the
[1:28:59] Kingdom but the
[1:29:01] tears are the children of the wicked
[1:29:05] one two
[1:29:07] seeds two
[1:29:09] generations it's not just a
[1:29:13] metaphor it
[1:29:15] happened go the the the human race was
[1:29:18] mixed with the seed of the
[1:29:20] serpent
[1:29:24] the the family of God was mixed with the
[1:29:27] seed of the
[1:29:30] serpent that's why when we're born we
[1:29:33] suffer
[1:29:37] anger and
[1:29:39] wrath and lies and
[1:29:43] stealing and and and to be abusive with
[1:29:46] each
[1:29:48] other because we've been mixed with that
[1:29:51] seed
[1:29:53] that's why we must be born
[1:29:56] again to break the
[1:29:59] curse natural and
[1:30:06] spiritual verse 38 said but the tears
[1:30:08] are the children of the wicked
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:18] one these this is Jesus speaking
[1:30:23] so who is the wicked one
[1:30:27] then all you have to do is read the next
[1:30:33] verse verse
[1:30:36] 39
[1:30:38] Matthew
[1:30:40] 13:39 the Bible says the
[1:30:45] enemy that slded
[1:30:48] them is the
[1:30:50] devil
[1:30:52] it's his
[1:30:54] seed the seed of
[1:30:57] God and the seed of the
[1:30:59] serpent but only the seed of
[1:31:03] God only Sons and Daughters of
[1:31:06] God can be born
[1:31:09] again what happened in
[1:31:12] Eden God gave them a
[1:31:15] commandment on how to keep the
[1:31:19] victory instead they took the devil's
[1:31:25] lie my way is better he
[1:31:29] said my way is more fun he
[1:31:33] said my way will be faster than God's
[1:31:40] way but his way was a
[1:31:43] [Music]
[1:31:46] lie and his way brought
[1:31:50] death Jesus Jesus said I am the way but
[1:31:55] my way is the
[1:31:57] truth and my way is
[1:32:02] life God rich in
[1:32:08] Mercy behold what manner of
[1:32:18] love behold what manner of love
[1:32:23] that the father has given
[1:32:25] us so that we can have the
[1:32:28] victory in Christ
[1:32:32] Jesus we had
[1:32:34] read we read in the Book of
[1:32:42] Joshua of the story of
[1:32:45] Israel when they were getting ready to
[1:32:47] cross into the Promised
[1:32:50] Land
[1:32:56] and and
[1:32:57] Joshua begins to admonish
[1:33:02] Israel and Joshua 23 and verse
[1:33:07] one and it says then it came to pass a
[1:33:10] long time after the Lord had given rest
[1:33:13] unto Israel from all their enemies
[1:33:16] roundabout that Joshua waxed old and
[1:33:18] stricken and age ACC
[1:33:32] they they were experiencing a great
[1:33:37] peace because they experienced great
[1:33:43] victories because Joshua had kept them
[1:33:45] in the
[1:33:48] word he says and and verse two and
[1:33:50] Joshua called for for all Israel and for
[1:33:52] their elders and for their heads and for
[1:33:55] their judges for their officers and said
[1:33:57] unto them I am well stricken in
[1:34:10] age and ye have seen all that the Lord
[1:34:13] your God hath done unto all these
[1:34:16] nations because of
[1:34:20] you
[1:34:27] for the Lord your God is he that has
[1:34:30] fought for
[1:34:34] you in other words we've had great
[1:34:41] victories in verse
[1:34:44] six Joshua
[1:34:47] says be ye therefore very courageous to
[1:34:51] keep and do all that is written in the
[1:34:53] book of the law of
[1:35:01] Moses that she turn not aside from there
[1:35:04] from to the right hand or to the
[1:35:09] left he says that you come not among
[1:35:13] these
[1:35:13] nations verse
[1:35:18] 7 the these that remain among
[1:35:23] you he says neither make mention of the
[1:35:27] name of their
[1:35:30] gods nor cause to swear by
[1:35:35] them neither serve
[1:35:37] them no B nor bow yourselves unto
[1:35:42] them he said the Nations that are
[1:35:45] left the struggles that you have in your
[1:35:50] life need a total
[1:35:54] separation from every
[1:35:57] Temptation from every person who isn't
[1:35:59] who isn't helping you to grow in
[1:36:04] Christ and verse eight he tells them but
[1:36:06] cleave unto the
[1:36:10] Lord but cleave unto the Lord verse
[1:36:13] eight your God as ye have done unto this
[1:36:17] day Joshua
[1:36:20] 238
[1:36:26] take good heed therefore verse 11 unto
[1:36:30] yourselves that you love the Lord your
[1:36:38] God as we told you last
[1:36:43] service that's how we keep the
[1:36:46] victory you don't let your love grow
[1:36:50] cold
[1:36:53] for
[1:36:54] God that's how you keep the
[1:36:56] victory you don't let your love grow
[1:36:59] cold for your
[1:37:04] wife you don't let your love grow cold
[1:37:07] for your
[1:37:10] husband you don't let your love grow
[1:37:12] cold for your
[1:37:15] children you don't let your love grow
[1:37:18] cold for your
[1:37:20] parents
[1:37:22] you don't let your love grow cold for
[1:37:24] the household of
[1:37:33] God in Matthew
[1:37:36] 24 and verse 12 as we read we'll read it
[1:37:42] again an an end time
[1:37:45] prophecy Matthew 24 and verse
[1:37:50] 12
[1:37:55] and in the last
[1:37:57] days this is a
[1:37:59] revelation that was brought to
[1:38:02] us under the opening of The Seven
[1:38:07] Seals because a prophet taught
[1:38:10] us that here in Matthew
[1:38:12] 24 Jesus was preaching the Seven
[1:38:17] Seals in a
[1:38:20] parable
[1:38:22] and Jesus says in verse
[1:38:24] 12 and because iniquity shall
[1:38:29] abound the love of many shall wax
[1:38:33] cold in this so-called
[1:38:37] message Joshua
[1:38:40] said you remember he said take heed to
[1:38:47] yourselves that
[1:38:49] you that she love the the Lord your
[1:38:54] God because that's how you're going to
[1:38:56] keep the
[1:38:58] victory in Joshua
[1:39:04] 24 and verse
[1:39:08] 14 Joshua continues to admonish
[1:39:13] Israel I'm going to start he says Joshua
[1:39:17] 24:14 now therefore fear the lord and
[1:39:21] serve him in sincerity and
[1:39:27] Truth in spirit and in
[1:39:29] truth that's how we say it
[1:39:32] today and put away the gods which your
[1:39:35] father
[1:39:41] served on the other side of the
[1:39:44] flood and in Egypt and serve ye the
[1:39:49] Lord then he makes this great
[1:39:52] statement that we've all read many
[1:39:56] times and if it seem evil unto you to
[1:39:59] serve the Lord choose ye this day whom
[1:40:02] ye will
[1:40:09] serve it's what happened in
[1:40:12] Eden CH Eve made a
[1:40:16] choice whom she was going to
[1:40:18] serve and the one she chose to
[1:40:22] serve brought death to her and the whole
[1:40:26] family of God through a lie that he told
[1:40:33] her he he said choose ye this day whom
[1:40:36] ye will serve whether the gods which
[1:40:38] your father served that were on the
[1:40:40] other side of the flood or the gods of
[1:40:43] the amorites in whom land ye dwell but
[1:40:45] as for me and my house we will serve the
[1:40:50] Lord
[1:41:06] hidden in the
[1:41:11] allegory of this of
[1:41:14] this of this book of
[1:41:18] Joshua is our lives also
[1:41:22] and as he said and he made this bold
[1:41:29] statement but as for me and my
[1:41:33] house we will serve the
[1:41:35] Lord It's what each and every one of us
[1:41:39] it's the Revelation and the conviction
[1:41:41] that we must
[1:41:46] have verse 16 of Matthew
[1:41:49] 24 listen to what the people
[1:41:55] said and the people answered and said
[1:41:57] God forbid that we should forsake the
[1:42:00] Lord to serve other
[1:42:08] gods that's what they
[1:42:10] said now the Book of Joshua as we as we
[1:42:15] mentioned it was a book of
[1:42:18] victory victory through love
[1:42:22] Victory through
[1:42:24] faith Victory through
[1:42:27] obedience but what followed This Book of
[1:42:31] Judges was a book of
[1:42:35] defeat that records Israel's
[1:42:44] defeat for over 300
[1:42:47] years 12 men and one
[1:42:51] woman judges of
[1:42:54] Israel but
[1:42:57] nonetheless though they had men to judge
[1:43:02] them they didn't have a prophet to lead
[1:43:07] them so the
[1:43:10] result was not
[1:43:12] Victory but
[1:43:14] defeat after
[1:43:17] defeat Israel as we said was in a cycle
[1:43:24] and it just didn't start at this
[1:43:27] time no Adam and Eve fell into this
[1:43:32] cycle this very same
[1:43:35] cycle that's been that that that's with
[1:43:38] that's with the human race yet
[1:43:42] today it's a
[1:43:44] cycle of
[1:43:47] men both young and old
[1:43:56] the cycle is
[1:44:00] rebellion
[1:44:03] retribution
[1:44:06] repentance then God
[1:44:10] restores and then what does man
[1:44:14] do what then what does man
[1:44:19] do he falls
[1:44:22] again a week
[1:44:24] later a month later a year later five
[1:44:29] years
[1:44:30] later once again falls into
[1:44:34] Rebellion
[1:44:37] retribution
[1:44:39] repentance then God restores
[1:44:42] again and without the Born Again
[1:44:48] experience every man every woman
[1:44:52] we will live in this
[1:44:54] cycle it's a cycle of Fallen
[1:44:59] man under the
[1:45:01] law without a born again
[1:45:04] experience without the baptism of the
[1:45:06] Holy
[1:45:09] Ghost a cycle of
[1:45:14] mankind a cycle of a
[1:45:18] people lost in
[1:45:21] sin so
[1:45:24] judges a book of
[1:45:27] defeat and not
[1:45:30] victories remember what Israel
[1:45:33] said God forbid that we ever forsake
[1:45:37] Him we we'll follow him we'll stay with
[1:45:41] the word we'll do everything that what's
[1:45:44] written in the book of the
[1:45:48] law and in verse 21 of
[1:45:53] Judges it begins with the Tribe of
[1:45:57] Benjamin as remember Benjamin was the
[1:46:03] youngest and it says this in verse 21 of
[1:46:06] Judges
[1:46:10] one says and the children of of benj and
[1:46:14] the children of Benjamin did not drive
[1:46:17] out the
[1:46:19] jebusites
[1:46:23] judges
[1:46:33] 121 but they were supposed
[1:46:36] to but that's what God's word called for
[1:46:38] them to
[1:46:41] do and they said when Joshua was alive
[1:46:44] we will do
[1:46:49] it he said but the jebusites dwell with
[1:46:52] the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem
[1:46:54] unto this day
[1:47:05] this this day as in
[1:47:10] 2024 with
[1:47:12] Hamas in the holy
[1:47:15] land with Arabs in the holy
[1:47:18] land with with with with the great
[1:47:21] Muslim temple sitting where Solomon's
[1:47:23] Temple once
[1:47:27] stood
[1:47:29] Salomon is now a Muslim
[1:47:34] temple they did not put them
[1:47:38] out they're still in this
[1:47:43] cycle of
[1:47:45] mankind we go on to read verse
[1:47:49] 27
[1:47:51] that Manasses did the same
[1:47:54] thing that Benjamin had
[1:47:56] done we read in verse
[1:48:00] 29 we read in verse
[1:48:04] 29 that Ephraim did the same
[1:48:08] thing they didn't drive out the
[1:48:14] Canaanites and and we read in verse
[1:48:19] 30th that neither did Zebulon drive out
[1:48:22] the
[1:48:25] inhabitants it said but the Canaanites
[1:48:28] dwell among them and became
[1:48:42] tributaries
[1:48:44] tributaries that means we have a I just
[1:48:48] came up with a better idea
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:53] said we're going to do what Benjamin
[1:48:57] did because I went and talk to
[1:49:00] him and they've made tributaries of all
[1:49:03] the Canaanites in their
[1:49:06] land and he showed me the bank
[1:49:11] account they're making billions off of
[1:49:13] these
[1:49:16] people so it don't make no sense to
[1:49:18] drive these people out
[1:49:22] this is
[1:49:24] money we'll be able to make a better
[1:49:28] streets why we'll even have a social
[1:49:31] social security program for the old
[1:49:37] people but it wasn't God's
[1:49:40] way it was man's
[1:49:44] way in verse
[1:49:47] 31 it said neither did Asher drive out
[1:49:50] the
[1:49:53] inhabitants for they were seeing dollar
[1:49:55] signs
[1:49:58] also in verse 33 he says and
[1:50:03] naali it didn't he didn't drive them out
[1:50:06] either they all thought what Benjamin
[1:50:09] had done was was working
[1:50:15] great they said we'll watch Benjamin how
[1:50:17] it's going for him
[1:50:22] he said have you seen the car that
[1:50:24] Benjamin's driving now
[1:50:27] wow there's money to be
[1:50:30] made with these foreign
[1:50:35] Gods foreign
[1:50:38] Gods there's money to be
[1:50:41] made we don't have to serve their
[1:50:43] foreign
[1:50:47] Gods we just have to let them live in
[1:50:50] our
[1:50:52] homes and play with our
[1:51:00] children they were in total
[1:51:03] Disobedience they they
[1:51:06] were to thus sayith the
[1:51:11] Lord then in Judges chapter
[1:51:15] 2 a messenger was
[1:51:18] sent an angel of
[1:51:21] God and it says in verse
[1:51:24] one and an angel of the Lord came up
[1:51:27] from gilgal to Bim and said I made you
[1:51:30] to go up out of
[1:51:38] Egypt and have brought you into the land
[1:51:41] which I swear unto your fathers and I
[1:51:43] said I will never break my Covenant with
[1:51:48] you
[1:51:56] I won't break my Covenant with
[1:52:00] you but you have something to
[1:52:03] do ye shall make no league with the
[1:52:06] inhabitants of this
[1:52:12] land you won't cut any
[1:52:16] deals you you won't get up and you won't
[1:52:19] get involved in all their religious
[1:52:24] ceremonies you will you will live a life
[1:52:26] totally separate from
[1:52:30] them he said as a matter of
[1:52:35] fact ye shall throw down their
[1:52:47] altars but ye have not obeyed my
[1:52:52] voice you have made a you have made a
[1:52:55] league with the
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:53:00] inhabitants you haven't thrown down
[1:53:02] their
[1:53:04] altars you've let them build those
[1:53:06] altars in your those Pagan altars in
[1:53:08] your hearts and
[1:53:14] Minds he said you haven't obeyed my
[1:53:18] voice for God always has a
[1:53:22] voice for his
[1:53:24] children and then he
[1:53:26] said why have you done
[1:53:33] this in verse
[1:53:36] three before they could
[1:53:39] answer they knew why they had done
[1:53:42] it because they had taken on a spirit of
[1:53:48] disobedience
[1:53:52] and in verse three God said the
[1:53:54] messenger to Israel says this
[1:53:57] Angel wherefore I also
[1:54:01] said I will not drive them out of your
[1:54:07] hearts or out of your
[1:54:10] minds because you're the one that's been
[1:54:13] inviting them to come
[1:54:18] in but they shall be thorns in your
[1:54:25] sides and their
[1:54:27] gods these
[1:54:29] serpents shall be a snare unto
[1:54:34] you they will
[1:54:36] hinder they will
[1:54:39] hinder your Christian
[1:54:41] walk and your personal
[1:54:46] relationship with with Jesus Christ
[1:54:50] your
[1:54:51] lord your
[1:54:54] savior but in the midst of this time of
[1:54:59] judges in Israel when the church was
[1:55:03] continually in this cycle of
[1:55:09] death when they couldn't keep the
[1:55:13] victory that they had when Joshua was
[1:55:18] alive in the midst of this
[1:55:22] time of
[1:55:23] Judges there was an NE
[1:55:30] lady whom the spirit of the Lord was
[1:55:33] moving
[1:55:36] upon not the
[1:55:38] church the
[1:55:40] bride her name was
[1:55:43] Ruth she was a
[1:55:45] moabit she was a
[1:55:47] gentile she wasn't coming in under the
[1:55:51] law but it was her love for
[1:55:55] Naomi remember Ruth lived during the
[1:55:58] time of the
[1:56:01] judges but she wasn't living in the
[1:56:03] cycle that they were living of
[1:56:07] death and through the troubles and
[1:56:12] trials the woes and
[1:56:18] misfortunes
[1:56:22] this little
[1:56:24] Ruth her love didn't wax
[1:56:28] cold it waxed stronger and
[1:56:32] stronger for the testimony of
[1:56:36] Naomi her
[1:56:39] mother-in-law and her love for
[1:56:43] Jehovah though she wasn't a
[1:56:48] Jew
[1:56:50] but she seen in
[1:56:53] Naomi a faithful Jewish
[1:56:58] woman that surely of a woman can have
[1:57:01] this kind of
[1:57:04] love only her God could give
[1:57:09] it and Ruth
[1:57:11] said I want that she's got something I
[1:57:15] don't have and I want
[1:57:18] that
[1:57:21] so Ruth was
[1:57:24] inspired by the love and the strength of
[1:57:27] this
[1:57:28] woman in the Book of Ruth chapter

[1:58:44] cycle under
[1:58:46] death under
[1:58:48] Rebellion under
[1:58:53] retribution under
[1:58:55] repentance and then restoration
[1:58:59] again all this under this humanistic
[1:59:02] realm under the
[1:59:09] law Ruth was living in a bright
[1:59:14] age and yet she didn't know
[1:59:17] it but that's what was pulling
[1:59:21] her something was pulling
[1:59:24] her when she didn't even know where it
[1:59:27] was pulling her
[1:59:30] too but one day she'd see
[1:59:33] it she got pulled
[1:59:36] in to the presence of
[1:59:39] Boaz who would become her
[1:59:42] husband who would restore her and
[1:59:46] Naomi to everything things they had ever
[1:59:48] lost lost and even
[1:59:52] more Eve Ruth didn't know
[1:59:56] it that what was pulling her
[2:00:01] in was the
[2:00:04] groom to be her
[2:00:07] bride it was
[2:00:11] Supernatural Ruth was
[2:00:14] living in the bride
[2:00:17] age under the voice of the
[2:00:22] Archangel Under The
[2:00:25] Voice she had gone from Revelations
[2:00:30] 3:19 you go back and read
[2:00:33] it and she had gone and found herself in
[2:00:37] Revelations
[2:00:41] 32-22 go back and read
[2:00:43] it she had gone from Revelations
[2:00:48] 10:7
[2:00:50] she'd moved up to Revelations 108
[2:00:56] to1 people want you to
[2:00:59] believe ministers want you to
[2:01:03] believe that that that that your calling
[2:01:06] stopped at Revelations
[2:01:11] 10:7 but the Bible
[2:01:15] says that there's four more
[2:01:18] verses
[2:01:20] after the seventh angel leaves a
[2:01:25] scene it's the bride
[2:01:27] age it's
[2:01:30] Ruth entering
[2:01:34] into a
[2:01:38] marriage with the
[2:01:43] lamb Revelations 108
[2:01:48] to1
[2:01:49] is the is the bride
[2:01:54] age it's the marriage of the
[2:02:01] Lamb it doesn't end for us at
[2:02:04] Revelations
[2:02:07] 107 now it goes on to be a personal
[2:02:14] experience to bring forth the family of
[2:02:17] God for Adam and Eve fell
[2:02:22] short but this little bride will not
[2:02:25] fall
[2:02:28] short a second Adam will not fall
[2:02:33] short he will bring forth the family of
[2:02:39] God and he's bringing it
[2:02:42] forth one at a
[2:02:45] time by a born again
[2:02:47] experience
[2:02:49] by the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:52] Ghost and Fire by refilling after
[2:02:59] refilling he has made a vow unto his
[2:03:03] bride I'll never leave you I'll never
[2:03:06] forsake you until I have made you
[2:03:11] perfect even as I am
[2:03:17] perfect Ruth was Liv
[2:03:20] living under an open
[2:03:25] book where there was plenty to
[2:03:29] eat when the book came
[2:03:33] open when the book came open for Ruth
[2:03:36] her days of famine were
[2:03:45] over Ruth found herself in Bethlehem
[2:03:51] at Harvest
[2:03:53] time you go back and read the book of
[2:03:57] Ruth Ruth would never again hunger and
[2:04:01] thirst for
[2:04:08] righteousness Ruth would never
[2:04:10] again
[2:04:16] Ruth hunger and thirst
[2:04:21] for
[2:04:22] righteousness and have to go away
[2:04:27] hungry little
[2:04:30] Ruth there's 66 books in the
[2:04:34] Bible there's over 1,200 recorded
[2:04:40] messages to help make
[2:04:45] clear how you can be
[2:04:47] perfect even as the father which is in
[2:04:52] heaven and look at the Modern events
[2:04:54] that we're seeing
[2:04:58] today through Bible
[2:05:02] prophecy and have no
[2:05:05] fear because we
[2:05:07] know that God's not trying to make
[2:05:10] America great
[2:05:16] again or any other Nation
[2:05:20] he is focused on one little
[2:05:26] lady you to make
[2:05:30] you great
[2:05:33] again and what could be
[2:05:36] greater and and what could be
[2:05:40] greater than for you to
[2:05:43] recognize that you are the bride of
[2:05:47] Christ
[2:05:54] in Ruth chapter 2 Ru verse
[2:06:01] 14 now we see Boaz in the
[2:06:09] picture and it reads like this in verse
[2:06:12] [Music]
[2:06:13] 14 and Boaz said unto her at Meal Time
[2:06:18] Come Thou hither and eat of the bread
[2:06:21] and dip thy morsel in the
[2:06:32] vinegar and she sat beside the Reapers
[2:06:35] and he reached her parched corn and she
[2:06:38] did eat and was sufficed and
[2:06:47] left
[2:06:50] and when she was risen up to glean Boaz
[2:06:53] commanded his young man the ministers
[2:06:56] the fful ministry saying to them let her
[2:07:00] glean even among the sheaves and
[2:07:02] reproach her
[2:07:14] not if she's seen more than you minister
[2:07:24] don't hold her
[2:07:26] back it's just her having a personal
[2:07:29] experience with
[2:07:33] me don't reproach
[2:07:36] her don't tell her wait a minute you
[2:07:39] can't get no higher than the
[2:07:44] pastor oh yes she can if the pastor
[2:07:48] won't go
[2:07:49] higher you can go higher get in the
[2:07:55] word you might have to find another
[2:07:59] Pastor if you want to keep going
[2:08:02] higher but you are an individual with
[2:08:08] Christ and if God's showing you
[2:08:11] more then to God be the
[2:08:16] glory I know that's very very
[2:08:19] different maybe what you've been taught
[2:08:24] before in verse
[2:08:27] 16 then Boaz tells the fful
[2:08:32] ministry and let fall also some of the
[2:08:35] handfuls of purpose for her and leave
[2:08:38] them that she may glean them and rebuke
[2:08:41] her
[2:08:47] not
[2:08:51] twice he commanded his young
[2:08:55] men twice he commanded the fful
[2:09:01] ministry don't rebuke the church for
[2:09:03] wanting to go higher and
[2:09:10] deeper Ruth had drink Ruth had drank her
[2:09:15] milk Ruth had done her ABC
[2:09:20] don't hold Ruth
[2:09:22] back she's going all the way this little
