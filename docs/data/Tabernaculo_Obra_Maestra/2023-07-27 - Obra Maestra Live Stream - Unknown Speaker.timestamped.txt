[29:40] I just wanted to
[29:43] share something that we had I had asked
[29:48] prayer for a friend of mine at work that
[29:50] works at Ryder and he
[29:54] had a cancer I'm not sure what type of
[29:57] cancer
[29:59] it's pretty serious
[30:01] and he texted me today
[30:03] and he said he's in remission
[30:06] um
[30:07] he was
[30:09] by his text he was very very happy he
[30:12] was just wanted to say thank you for
[30:14] your prayers and I I just wanted to
[30:18] share that because you know I think if
[30:20] anybody ever has a
[30:22] testimony
[30:24] I mean obviously I think we should
[30:28] maybe maybe Lord willing brother Daniel
[30:30] will allow us to have a service just for
[30:32] testimonies but if you have something
[30:35] that you want to share and even if you
[30:37] don't want to come up here maybe we can
[30:40] maybe one of the song leaders can share
[30:42] it or brother Daniel or us you know
[30:45] because you know what
[30:47] testimonies encourage us and and it's
[30:50] what increases our helps increase our
[30:53] faith so we want to acknowledge that we
[30:56] serve a living God and it's just not
[30:58] prayers we're not just praying but he
[31:00] hears us and he also answers

[31:06] you can you can have your seats
[31:12] let's sing um

[31:20] I really believe that
[31:23] our faith in him
[31:28] opens that door of Supernatural we have
[31:31] to believe that with all of our heart
[31:33] and we either believe it with all of our
[31:35] heart
[31:36] or
[31:38] don't come don't come brother round said
[31:41] when you get in the prayer line
[31:42] [Music]
[31:44] believe you have that was the one thing
[31:47] whenever he talked to anybody he would
[31:51] always ask that you know that was one of
[31:53] the things that did do you believe

[36:11] God bless you all tonight
[36:14] good to be once again in the house of
[36:17] God
[36:19] with Saints of light precious faith
[36:23] con Santos
[36:26] precious
[36:27] we want to continue again tonight
[36:31] speaking on the subject we had started
[36:39] we began part one
[36:43] The Pale Horse Rider
[36:49] in the Days of Elijah
[36:52] and the subject
[36:54] who has believed our report
[36:58] and to whom is the arm of the Lord
[37:00] revealed
[37:03] foreign
[37:19] and last week
[37:22] so we're thankful tonight for everyone
[37:25] here estamos
[37:29] we greet all the god saints that are
[37:32] listening
[37:35] and we begin here tonight on on part two
[37:41] so if you'll stand with me here tonight
[37:45] and we'd like to read a scripture
[37:50] and want to begin uh there in
[37:54] Revelations chapter six
[37:55] [Music]
[37:58] Revelations chapter six
[38:02] is is what the the vision of John
[38:06] and it was a vision of what he called
[38:10] the first seal is
[38:13] and it unfolded to Seven Seals
[38:18] and Seven Seals is forever
[38:22] it's been a a confusion
[38:26] because it's a book of symbols
[38:30] so John was a prophet of God
[38:35] not just an apostle
[38:38] but a prophet he pastored the Ephesians
[38:44] God used them in many ways
[38:48] but he used them in this special way
[38:53] to write this book by vision is
[39:00] not the first time God has used someone
[39:02] for them
[39:07] Moses wrote the first five books of the
[39:10] of the Bible says
[39:13] Moses wrote the Book of Genesis
[39:17] he wrote it with great details
[39:22] because he saw it by Vision
[39:25] just like John at the Book of Revelation
[39:30] apocalypses and God's man God's prophets
[39:35] God's men
[39:37] God's prophets
[39:41] and God's prophets
[39:50] they wrote my vision foreign
[39:58] and that's how this book was written
[40:01] from Genesis
[40:04] so it wasn't something new that God was
[40:07] doing here with John
[40:10] it was the pattern of his work that he'd
[40:12] followed since the beginning
[40:16] so Revelation 6 Revelation says and
[40:21] verse one person as we read
[40:24] and I saw when the lamb opened one of
[40:27] the seals
[40:28] and I heard as it was the noise of
[40:30] Thunder one of the four beasts saying
[40:32] come and see
[40:36] because
[40:46] let's pray Heavenly Father Celestial
[40:49] what we need tonight
[40:52] is the author of the book
[40:55] and the book is called the Lamb's Book
[40:58] of Life
[41:02] so if you the lamb will come tonight
[41:08] you can reveal your book to us
[41:12] Lord so we thank you for this
[41:15] and we expect you to have you on the
[41:18] scene
[41:22] we ask it in Jesus name
[41:25] amen amen you may be seated
[41:28] Revelation 6 1.
[41:31] and John says and I saw when the lamb
[41:34] opened one of the seals
[41:39] shared with you I'll share with you
[41:40] often yeah
[41:41] [Music]
[41:43] Seven Seals is seven parts of one divine
[41:48] plan Divino of salvation of redemption
[41:53] of Revelation the Revelation for you as
[41:56] an individual
[41:58] it's not designed for a whole group
[42:03] Revelation is designed for one on one
[42:07] Revelations
[42:11] you and God Alone how Revelation comes
[42:22] we might be in a small congregation
[42:26] and yet God can be revealing something
[42:29] to you at that moment
[42:33] that no one else is catching
[42:37] you might be that one in a Congregation
[42:39] of a thousands
[42:43] you might be you might be that one in
[42:46] the congregation of 10.
[42:50] but you're catching Revelation
[42:55] because this book of Prophecy
[42:59] it was about having a personal
[43:01] experience with Jesus Christ
[43:06] with that said
[43:09] will hundreds and thousands be part of
[43:12] the Bride of Jesus Christ then
[43:33] here in this book of Revelations
[43:38] where it says and it came to pass no
[43:41] excuse me Revelation 6 1.
[43:48] this is then I saw when the lamb opened
[43:50] one of the seals and I heard as it was
[43:52] the noise of Thunder one of the four
[43:54] beasts saying come and see and it would
[43:56] come and see see it
[44:02] is
[44:13] not an evangelist
[44:18] not an apostle
[44:21] not a pastor Pastor it was it was to be
[44:26] a teaching
[44:29] but it was to be the teaching
[44:32] of a man who was the entire faithful
[44:36] Ministry is
[44:42] which was Jesus Christ
[44:44] but the one that he was using here
[44:47] was the Teaching Ministry
[44:51] one of the four beasts said come and see
[44:55] I'm going to teach you something
[44:57] so for this to unfold as we said before
[45:00] the lamb had to be present it's part of
[45:02] the division
[45:05] there was a noise of Thunder yes
[45:09] there was
[45:11] a noise of Thunder
[45:14] one of the Forbes
[45:19] it was a teaching he was about to bring
[45:27] pertaining to their day okay a teaching
[45:31] that would help them to recognize their
[45:33] day and their message
[45:38] and we realized that the the the
[45:42] the Beast that was here that it was
[45:43] speaking of in this in this scripture
[45:48] that it was the first seal so this was
[45:52] the first living creature
[45:54] which was The Lion
[45:57] and the lion was the lion of the tribe
[46:00] of Judah
[46:04] is the first seal part one is the first
[46:09] coming of Christ
[46:10] and the one that was going to be doing
[46:13] the teaching
[46:15] he was going to bring a teaching from
[46:17] the Lamb's Book of Life
[46:21] The Lion was going to bring a teaching
[46:24] out of the Lamb's Book of Life
[46:30] because in the Lamb's Book of Life
[46:33] was salvation and Redemption
[46:37] for Israel
[46:39] and in the Lamb's Book of Life foreign
[46:53] [Music]
[47:10] for all nationalities
[47:13] so the lion was going to teach out of
[47:16] this Lamb's Book of Life
[47:19] this was the book that was being opened
[47:25] and these are the seven parts of that
[47:28] book that were going to be revealed
[47:33] and it was going to create a whole new
[47:36] testament
[47:39] a New Covenant of redemption
[47:43] for Adam's Fallen Race
[47:48] So Revelation 6 1.
[47:51] verse 2 says
[47:53] Revelation 6 6 2 and I saw him Behold a
[47:57] white horse and he that sat on him had a
[47:59] bow
[48:30] so this white horse rider
[48:34] this white horse rider
[48:40] with this bow and this Crown
[48:44] he went out conquering
[48:47] so these were Tools in his hands
[48:50] I'll tell you now we'll explain in the
[48:54] future
[48:56] the bow was was was Israel
[49:00] the bow was the Jude the the judeaic
[49:04] church
[49:08] the bowl was the high priest of Israel
[49:15] and the crown was Pagan Rome
[49:19] so with Pagan Rome in his hand
[49:23] and the high priest of Israel in his
[49:25] hand
[49:29] Lucifer Lucifer Satan was going to use
[49:33] them
[49:34] to try to close the book
[49:38] that is seven parts of redemption
[49:41] wouldn't unfold
[49:47] so that God's people wouldn't be saved
[49:51] so Redemption would not start
[49:55] but one starts once God starts a plan
[49:59] unfolding
[50:03] no man no devil not even the Devil
[50:06] Himself can stop God's plan
[50:09] is
[50:12] a plan when God decides I'm coming down
[50:15] to save you and to change you and to
[50:18] make you my son and daughter nothing can
[50:21] stop that plan
[50:27] and the Lord himself the Bible says
[50:35] that shout was the Forerunner
[50:40] Ministry it had begun Redemption had
[50:44] begun
[50:47] Revelations
[50:55] Revelation 6 1-2 was the vision of what
[50:58] John thought
[51:12] Revelation 6 1 and 2. Revelations
[51:15] was the vision of what John thought was
[51:18] a future event
[51:23] when in fact
[51:26] it was present tense
[51:30] and what's happening is even as he was
[51:34] seeing the vision
[51:36] when he saw the vision of the church
[51:39] ages
[51:41] and the Ephesian age
[51:46] it was already unfolding
[51:48] it had been unfolding for 30 40 years
[51:56] and even as he was seeing the vision
[52:00] and would continue to unfold
[52:04] this vision of the first sealed would
[52:08] continue to unfold
[52:10] for the next 300 years
[52:14] you see prophecies have a life span
[52:20] just like you and I
[52:22] 70 years old 80 years old
[52:26] well the Visions are the same way
[52:29] and this vision of the first seal is
[52:32] from the time it started
[52:37] to the time that it would everything
[52:39] would come to pass that was going to
[52:41] come to pass in that vision
[52:45] would be 300 years
[52:48] so Visions have a lifespanic
[52:54] and and
[52:56] Revelations five
[52:58] when John saw it
[53:01] it had been unfolding
[53:05] for 4 000 years
[53:09] in only five verses
[53:12] that's how God writes his Bible
[53:16] and Revelations 5 has not expired yet
[53:26] yet God still has a representation
[53:32] like a lamb slain
[53:36] forever interceding
[53:40] for our sins
[53:42] for our healing for our salvation for
[53:47] our joy foreign for our character change
[53:51] for our body change
[53:54] Revelations five is still a vision
[53:59] it's still an effect right now
[54:03] Revelation six
[54:06] is the vision of this of part one
[54:09] it was only two verses
[54:12] but what's going to happen now
[54:15] when we go to the scripture in the New
[54:18] Testament
[54:21] where this came to where this Vision
[54:24] opened up
[54:26] then God's Gonna add more details
[54:31] that John didn't write
[54:34] now Jesus is going to add more detail to
[54:38] the opening of this first seal okay
[54:43] he's going to add more verses
[54:46] [Music]
[54:47] as we spoke to you on Revelation 7.
[54:54] I mean as we spoke to you in Revelation
[54:56] the revelations on the seventh seal
[55:06] but when you let your fingers do the
[55:09] walking through the Bible Pages
[55:21] and you put scripture and prophecy
[55:24] together
[55:28] then he told us that Revelations 10.
[55:34] was the seventh seal so now we don't
[55:38] just have one detail
[55:41] one verse in Revelation they won
[55:48] talking of the seventh seals
[55:50] now he's added 11 more verses
[55:56] describing the description of the things
[55:59] that will happen under that silent
[56:01] opening the the las cosas
[56:07] so here in this this word of God
[56:11] we're ministering
[56:15] the white horse rider in the Days of
[56:18] Elijah
[56:20] and the pale horse rider yeah
[56:25] in the Days of Elijah you say well which
[56:28] one is it brother Daniel
[56:30] it's both because the White Horse Road
[56:34] and the first coming of Christ
[56:39] Road
[56:42] at the first coming of Christ
[56:45] and the pale horse rider is riding at
[56:50] the second coming of Christ
[56:54] so it's both
[56:57] we will we stick with the biblical
[56:59] pattern
[57:02] we stay in the word
[57:06] we don't use human reasoning by the
[57:08] grace of God
[57:11] now revelation 6.
[57:16] in its reality in
[57:19] Matthew 11
[57:22] is
[57:31] open what's that video
[57:33] redemption's plan had begun
[57:36] so no more under the law and the
[57:40] prophets
[57:44] God had come
[57:45] on
[57:49] preaching the Kingdom of Heaven is at
[57:52] hand
[57:54] of the words that were coming out of the
[57:56] mouth
[58:03] can be forgiven
[58:06] and and more detail will be added to the
[58:09] baptism
[58:12] until we would even have a name
[58:17] in which we could do
[58:19] this ritual and be bound by a covenant
[58:26] and be born again the bride of Christ
[58:32] we
[58:43] went down a sinner
[58:50] we went down uh the devil's wife
[58:56] Bahamas
[59:00] and we rose up the bride of Christ
[59:03] we got a new husband born again
[59:11] Matthew 11 1.
[59:14] Jesus teaching
[59:17] on the first coming of Christ
[59:20] now you say what do you mean Jesus
[59:24] teaching on the first coming of Christ
[59:26] Jesus
[59:30] wasn't he there hasn't hadn't he come
[59:35] yes see but they didn't know him
[59:38] they didn't know what was unfolding
[59:41] before them
[59:43] they didn't realize that that Day
[59:47] scriptures
[59:50] they hadn't recognized as Isaiah 7. they
[59:55] hadn't recognized him that is Isaiah 9.
[59:58] he said yes they didn't realize he was
[1:00:01] Isaiah 53.
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:04] they didn't realize that this was
[1:00:06] Messiah
[1:00:08] oh my God
[1:00:26] from the teacher himself
[1:00:29] who was the author of the book
[1:00:35] that little song he is here
[1:00:51] now when John had heard in the prison
[1:00:54] The Works of Christ
[1:00:56] he sent two of his disciples
[1:01:03] now John had already understood that he
[1:01:06] must decrease
[1:01:11] and Christ must increase
[1:01:16] but yet it was a very difficult thing
[1:01:19] for him to go through in in reality
[1:01:24] he says and there he was laying in
[1:01:26] prison
[1:01:28] knowing he'd be beheaded in a few more
[1:01:31] days
[1:01:34] and he sent two of his disciples
[1:01:38] and verse verse 3 says can said unto
[1:01:42] them art thou he that should come or do
[1:01:44] we look for another
[1:01:50] now remember
[1:01:52] the way it started in verse one
[1:01:56] so then I came to pass
[1:01:58] when Jesus had made an end of commanding
[1:02:01] his twelve disciples
[1:02:03] disciples
[1:02:09] he departed dance to teach and preach in
[1:02:12] their cities
[1:02:15] what was it it was the line of the tribe
[1:02:19] of Judah
[1:02:23] it's Revelation 6 1. and when John heard
[1:02:28] in the prison The Works of Christ verse
[1:02:30] two he had only two of his disciples
[1:02:35] foreign
[1:02:40] to them
[1:02:42] or tell he that should come or do we
[1:02:44] look for another para president
[1:02:48] a prophet said
[1:02:50] this this prophet's eyes had become
[1:02:53] dimmed over for the trial he was going
[1:02:55] through
[1:03:04] and Matthew 11 4 Jesus answered and said
[1:03:08] unto them Go and show John again
[1:03:12] it wasn't the first time that John had
[1:03:15] recognized the ministry and its
[1:03:18] Vindication he said Go and show John
[1:03:21] again in other words Jesus had already
[1:03:23] spoken to him before on this
[1:03:29] so Jesus answered and sent them to him
[1:03:31] go and show John again those things
[1:03:34] which you do here
[1:03:36] foreign
[1:03:43] these details
[1:03:45] that are under the opening of this first
[1:03:48] seal
[1:03:50] these details that are under the opening
[1:03:52] of part one of redemption
[1:03:56] that are under the opening of part one
[1:04:00] of redemption it's the same things that
[1:04:04] would repeat under the opening of the
[1:04:06] seventh seals
[1:04:13] because the first seal
[1:04:15] is his first coming as the seventh seal
[1:04:19] is the second coming
[1:04:22] now watch the pattern here
[1:04:25] that will repeat in our day
[1:04:29] when we get to wandering
[1:04:32] is this was this the Forerunner this
[1:04:36] morning
[1:04:39] and Jesus tells them go tell John this
[1:04:56] [Music]
[1:05:02] [Music]
[1:05:21] and it repeated in our days again
[1:05:25] so that we could know and recognize
[1:05:28] second coming of Christ
[1:05:33] Jesus is now adding detail Jesus
[1:05:37] to the opening of the first seal
[1:05:40] of part one of how it would open how
[1:05:45] would it be unfolding and how we could
[1:05:48] recognize the opening of the second
[1:05:50] coming in our days
[1:05:53] recognize the opening of the seventh
[1:05:55] seal in our day
[1:05:58] he's telling us the process
[1:06:00] of the opening of the seal
[1:06:04] part one of the Plan of Redemption
[1:06:08] salvation restoration
[1:06:13] why under the opening of these seals
[1:06:18] a man and a woman
[1:06:22] can find happiness in a marriage
[1:06:31] it's part of the promise it's part of
[1:06:34] this Redemption it's part of your your
[1:06:36] personal experience with Christ
[1:06:39] experience he can make you the man
[1:06:44] that a woman that loves God will want to
[1:06:46] be with
[1:06:50] under the opening of this word
[1:06:53] under this Lamb's Book of Life
[1:07:00] Book of Life
[1:07:02] foreign
[1:07:23] [Music]
[1:08:02] you were speaking to a great multitude
[1:08:04] of people
[1:08:07] and that Spirit discerned yeah
[1:08:13] that they were offended
[1:08:16] in this teaching
[1:08:19] verse 7 says
[1:08:22] and as they departed
[1:08:26] because they were offended
[1:08:28] and Jesus that discerned it
[1:08:32] I can discern that you're offended with
[1:08:35] this what I'm telling you
[1:08:39] and they begin to depart and then Jesus
[1:08:43] began to say unto the multitudes
[1:08:45] concerning John yeah
[1:08:48] verse 7 what went down to the Wilderness
[1:08:52] to see a reed shaken with the Wind
[1:08:54] Raymond
[1:09:03] okay Salis is
[1:09:07] where soft Raymond are in King's houses
[1:09:20] that introduced him
[1:09:24] but what went down to see a prophet yes
[1:09:27] I say unto you and more than a prophet
[1:09:29] is
[1:09:35] because he was a forerunner to the first
[1:09:39] coming of Christ
[1:09:42] and in all the billions of people that
[1:09:44] would be born in the world
[1:09:47] and all the ministers that God would
[1:09:50] raise up
[1:09:53] there would only be two men
[1:09:55] whom God would choose
[1:09:59] to foreign
[1:10:26] Matthew 11 10.
[1:10:30] for this because he of whom it is
[1:10:32] written
[1:10:35] behold I send my messenger before thy
[1:10:38] face
[1:10:41] shall prepare thy way before thee
[1:10:47] Jesus was identifying John
[1:10:50] Jesus identification
[1:10:52] is
[1:11:00] Jesus was going to the word and saying
[1:11:03] this
[1:11:04] is that that the prophet spoke of
[1:11:08] Malachi 3
[1:11:10] that's John and it's unfolding right
[1:11:12] here before your very eyes
[1:11:18] that offends the people yes that offends
[1:11:22] the religious community
[1:11:25] that offends the denominations
[1:11:28] to put a name on the scripture and
[1:11:31] saying this man is that scripture and
[1:11:33] this day this word is fulfilled
[1:11:39] only a true Born Again believer in
[1:11:42] Christ can actually accept that kind of
[1:11:44] a message
[1:11:51] behold I will send my messenger
[1:11:55] and he shall prepare the way before me
[1:11:59] and the Lord whom you seek shall
[1:12:01] suddenly come to his Temple
[1:12:05] behold I will send my messenger
[1:12:21] Lord means god Elohim
[1:12:27] and the Lord whom you seek
[1:12:31] suddenly come to his Temple yeah
[1:12:35] what was the Lord's Temple
[1:12:39] behold the Virgin shall conceive
[1:12:42] and a temple will be made by the spoken
[1:12:45] word
[1:12:47] and the temple will be the body of a man
[1:12:51] and that man will be called The Son of
[1:12:54] God yes
[1:12:56] and in that body called the Son of God
[1:13:00] and and in that body yes called the Son
[1:13:05] of God
[1:13:06] will be the fullness of the Gods
[1:13:11] the Lord will shall suddenly come to
[1:13:15] that Temple
[1:13:18] see how this Bible is
[1:13:23] even the messenger of the Covenant
[1:13:28] because remember Revelations 5 Seconds
[1:13:31] behold one sat on the throne yeah
[1:13:41] then he says and a strong Angel then
[1:13:44] came
[1:13:47] God
[1:13:49] for Redemption
[1:13:52] then it says then he was looking for a
[1:13:55] man who was worthy to open that book
[1:14:00] and when he couldn't find no man
[1:14:03] and John webbed then one of the elders
[1:14:07] said
[1:14:08] don't weep John
[1:14:11] the father is willing to descend lower
[1:14:16] to get closer to his children so he's
[1:14:21] going to descend to his Temple
[1:14:23] is the line of the tribe of Judah as
[1:14:27] Jesus Christ of Nazareth
[1:14:30] and God kept descending
[1:14:33] so from this from from the Lord whom you
[1:14:37] seek
[1:14:39] who will certainly come to his Temple
[1:14:42] then it says even the messenger of the
[1:14:45] Covenant
[1:14:47] because it was from the messenger of the
[1:14:49] Covenant
[1:14:51] to God made flesh that God changes
[1:15:01] behold he shall come saith the Lord of
[1:15:04] hosts
[1:15:07] this will
[1:15:08] say
[1:15:14] even the messenger of the Covenant okay
[1:15:28] so Jesus identified John Jesus
[1:15:32] identification as Malachi 3. as this
[1:15:36] messenger
[1:15:37] in verse 11 versions of Matthew 11.
[1:15:43] Jesus says verily I say unto you
[1:15:57] now he's comparing John to everyone that
[1:16:00] was ever born of a woman
[1:16:04] which is all of us
[1:16:06] saying he's the greatest
[1:16:10] but then he said notwithstanding he that
[1:16:13] is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:16:15] greater than him
[1:16:18] now he's comparing John to the smallest
[1:16:22] insignificant believer in Christ
[1:16:28] and Saint John is least in that one
[1:16:33] because it was a example unto us it was
[1:16:39] that that God's ministers
[1:16:43] would be the people's servants uh
[1:16:52] for we have only one Lord
[1:17:01] and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:17:04] until now
[1:17:06] the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence
[1:17:11] and the violent take it by force
[1:17:15] Jesus identifies himself
[1:17:19] to Jesus identifies John as the Elijah
[1:17:23] Ministry Jesus
[1:17:28] is preaching on his first coming Jesus
[1:17:36] but that he's here now it's coming to
[1:17:39] pass
[1:17:41] you're living in the day when this
[1:17:43] scripture is coming to pass
[1:17:50] now in verse 12 verse and from the days
[1:17:54] of John the Baptist until now
[1:17:58] history tells us and no one can put an
[1:18:01] exact date on it
[1:18:03] is
[1:18:08] of how long the ministry of John was
[1:18:14] it could have been a few months
[1:18:17] it could have been three years
[1:18:20] but it was a very short Ministry
[1:18:24] but from the days of John the Baptist
[1:18:32] a and until now
[1:18:35] the day that Jesus is preaching to them
[1:18:40] he says the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth
[1:18:43] violence
[1:18:45] those that are following John and being
[1:18:48] baptized
[1:18:50] they're the ones suffering the Violence
[1:18:54] by the violent ones who are taking them
[1:18:58] by force
[1:19:00] putting them in jail
[1:19:04] and physically dividing their families
[1:19:07] up
[1:19:08] and killing them
[1:19:12] there's that writer
[1:19:15] there's that writer who went forth
[1:19:18] conquering
[1:19:20] and to conquer
[1:19:36] are taking it by force
[1:19:39] this is the white horse rider
[1:19:43] of Revelation 6 2.
[1:19:47] of Revelation 6 2.
[1:19:51] anointing the bow and the crown
[1:19:56] anointing the Jewish or Orthodox
[1:19:59] priesthood
[1:20:04] anointing the Jewish or Orthodox
[1:20:07] priesthood
[1:20:08] um
[1:20:13] and the Caesar of pagan Rome
[1:20:17] to go out conquering with violence
[1:20:21] this little flock is
[1:20:24] called The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:28] and the pattern of Genesis repeats
[1:20:33] the violent one
[1:20:36] came
[1:20:39] took the kingdom of God by force
[1:20:43] and killed his brother
[1:20:47] we see the pattern of God's word
[1:20:51] and as you read through your Old
[1:20:53] Testament
[1:20:55] um
[1:20:59] all the way to the days of the first
[1:21:01] coming of Christ
[1:21:06] this little flock
[1:21:08] called The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:21:11] the pattern of Genesis repeats
[1:21:30] remember Isaiah 53 seconds
[1:21:33] which is also the opening
[1:21:37] of the first seal
[1:21:40] it adds more details
[1:21:43] to what was taking place under this
[1:21:45] opening
[1:21:49] say you
[1:21:51] Isaiah 53 and 9 as we read last Sunday
[1:21:57] it says can he made his grave with the
[1:22:01] wicked and with the rich in his death
[1:22:03] because he had done no violence neither
[1:22:07] was any deceit in his mouth he said
[1:22:12] to support
[1:22:19] in him was no violence
[1:22:22] Jesus Christ can his followers was no
[1:22:26] violence yeah
[1:22:30] for they believed him on his message of
[1:22:33] perfection
[1:22:36] when he said blessed are the peacemakers
[1:22:41] he didn't say blessed are the
[1:22:43] peacemakers
[1:22:45] but if you have to be violent I
[1:22:48] understand
[1:22:50] he didn't say that he didn't teach that
[1:22:54] what about John's followers
[1:22:57] who repented and were baptized
[1:23:01] in Luke chapter 3 Lucas
[1:23:04] verses 10 to 16.
[1:23:09] John was baptizing at the River Jordan
[1:23:16] people were repenting and giving their
[1:23:18] hearts to the Lord
[1:23:23] they were tired of the violence some of
[1:23:25] these people
[1:23:28] and once they were baptized
[1:23:31] they realized they needed something else
[1:23:35] and the people in verse 10 of Luke 3
[1:23:43] he says and the people asked him saying
[1:23:46] what shall we do then
[1:23:51] now that we've repented now that we've
[1:23:54] been baptized
[1:23:56] in the name of Jesus he answered and
[1:24:00] said unto them
[1:24:14] let him do likewise
[1:24:17] then came also the publicans to be
[1:24:20] baptized
[1:24:22] and then once they were baptized
[1:24:26] they also had a question in their hearts
[1:24:30] Master but what what shall we do
[1:24:33] you know what kind of work we do
[1:24:38] we're Jews but we're Tax Collectors for
[1:24:41] Rome
[1:24:44] you know everyone hates us for that so
[1:24:52] no more than what is appointed you
[1:24:58] 13 verse 13.
[1:25:01] and he said unto them exact no more than
[1:25:04] what is appointed you is
[1:25:10] they found peace not only had they were
[1:25:14] they repented and baptized
[1:25:18] but the burden and question in their
[1:25:21] heart
[1:25:22] what do we do now
[1:25:24] how should our lives change now that
[1:25:27] we've accepted this baptism
[1:25:40] what shall we do you know
[1:25:44] we're not just regular folks
[1:25:48] we're not publicans
[1:25:51] he said we're soldiers we're soldiers
[1:25:54] for Rome
[1:25:56] we're soldiers of the synagogues
[1:25:59] he said unto them to You Soldiers
[1:26:04] to You Soldiers
[1:26:08] I want to tell you what to do now
[1:26:11] do violence
[1:26:14] yeah
[1:26:16] do violence to no man
[1:26:19] neither accuse any falsely
[1:26:23] as they content with your wages
[1:26:31] as soldiers
[1:26:33] they were taught foreign
[1:27:03] this isn't enough
[1:27:04] for the kind of men we have to be
[1:27:07] foreign
[1:27:27] foreign
[1:27:31] so when the Bible said when Jesus said
[1:27:35] and from the days of John the Baptist
[1:27:38] until now
[1:27:41] the Kingdom of Heaven suffered violence
[1:27:49] it wasn't the Disciples of Jesus
[1:27:52] he taught them different it wasn't the
[1:27:55] Disciples of John no foreign
[1:28:08] with a bow in one hand
[1:28:12] the Jewish the Jewish high priest of
[1:28:15] Israel
[1:28:18] is
[1:28:22] he was the bow
[1:28:24] the Jewish church was the bow
[1:28:27] they were the Violent ones
[1:28:30] and the Caesar of Rome
[1:28:43] both of them enemies
[1:28:46] both in the hands of Lucifer
[1:28:50] being anointed by the most violent
[1:28:55] OS
[1:28:58] now the scene is unfolding
[1:29:01] now we see Matthew 11.
[1:29:04] it was Jesus on the Jesus opening the
[1:29:08] book
[1:29:12] and showing I'm here
[1:29:17] I've come
[1:29:20] and all the prophecies the prophet is
[1:30:22] changing Ministry and forms
[1:30:27] to bring Salvation
[1:30:29] to give you an eye
[1:30:32] a personal experience
[1:30:34] with Jesus Christ to reveal to us the
[1:30:40] foreign
[1:31:09] to a personal experience
[1:31:15] and you can have that every time you
[1:31:17] read your Bible
[1:31:21] say Lord
[1:31:25] dear dying lamb of calvary
[1:31:30] build more of your word to me
[1:31:33] it's a read of a verse tonight
[1:31:41] as only you can
[1:31:46] in him was no violence
[1:31:50] in John was an awareness
[1:31:56] so the violent one
[1:31:58] um
[1:32:00] Jesus
[1:32:03] preaching on the first coming of Christ
[1:32:12] identified the Forerunner in China
[1:32:17] and then identified that the ride of the
[1:32:21] white horse rider yeah
[1:32:33] perfect perfecto and this is the amazing
[1:32:37] thing this is
[1:32:39] Matthew 11 13 was about A.D 30-34
[1:32:46] it was the year ad 30.
[1:32:53] John wasn't on the island
[1:32:57] s foreign
[1:33:01] until A.D 67.
[1:33:07] so when when Jesus is
[1:33:11] unfolding the mystery
[1:33:14] part one of the factors
[1:33:18] The Book of Revelations
[1:33:21] wasn't even written yet
[1:33:25] it wasn't going to be written
[1:33:27] for another 40 years
[1:33:32] that means that what Jesus was doing
[1:33:36] in Matthew
[1:33:39] wasn't by the way of the written word
[1:33:45] it was the it was by way of the spoken
[1:33:48] word
[1:33:50] because a thunder a prophet told us
[1:33:55] is the voice of God
[1:33:58] when a seal is
[1:34:03] opening the first seals
[1:34:06] it didn't have to be ready
[1:34:11] it was the time it was the season
[1:34:19] and God was unfolding
[1:34:22] the plan that was in his mind
[1:34:25] for the foundation
[1:34:29] and it wasn't even written yet
[1:34:32] remember Revelations 10 7.
[1:34:35] Revelations 10
[1:34:38] 4.
[1:34:40] yes and when seven Thunders had uttered
[1:34:43] their voices
[1:34:57] they say you see it's not even written
[1:35:01] it's
[1:35:02] like we see a principle in the word of
[1:35:05] God
[1:35:07] when it comes time for God to bring his
[1:35:10] word to pass
[1:35:14] how can he bring it to pass if it's not
[1:35:17] written in this Bible
[1:35:21] because everything written in this Bible
[1:35:25] was the thought in the mind of God
[1:35:27] before the foundation of the world
[1:35:31] he speaks it and it comes to pass
[1:35:41] God created the heavens and the Earth
[1:35:46] Genesis 1.
[1:35:48] and it wasn't even written yet
[1:35:51] because Moses didn't write the book okay
[1:35:56] until almost 2500 years later
[1:36:02] can we deny he created the heavens and
[1:36:05] the Earth
[1:36:06] did it happen did it have to be written
[1:36:10] or did it just have to be the time and
[1:36:12] God says Now's the Time
[1:36:17] just like for every one of us
[1:36:21] Spirit swept down of course
[1:36:24] he says now is the time
[1:36:29] I'm going to change your life
[1:36:33] [Music]
[1:36:35] foreign
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:37:03] to give you more than hope
[1:37:24] when you read one scripture
[1:37:27] and wonder is
[1:37:31] this all that the Bible has to say about
[1:37:34] this is
[1:37:37] know this the answer is no
[1:37:43] God has scripture and word upon word
[1:37:51] to add more details
[1:37:54] that's why Prophet said okay you can't
[1:37:58] take one scripture
[1:38:01] and put a period
[1:38:03] you got to put it
[1:38:06] because it's word upon word
[1:38:09] up online
[1:38:11] then he would give us an example he says
[1:38:15] let me give you an example
[1:38:17] the Bible says Judas went and hung
[1:38:20] himself
[1:38:21] foreign
[1:38:53] this precious book of the Bible
[1:39:01] unfolding this Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:07] concerning the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:39:17] Isaiah 53
[1:39:19] was the opening
[1:39:23] Isaiah 53 is the first coming of Christ
[1:39:29] Isaiah 53.
[1:39:31] part of part one
[1:39:39] to this person
[1:39:41] and the detail he added about this seal
[1:39:44] yeah
[1:39:47] that it was going to be a new message
[1:39:51] and he says in Isaiah 53 1.
[1:39:57] who have believed our report
[1:40:01] foreign
[1:40:13] uh
[1:40:28] and you could only catch it
[1:40:32] by the Lamb of God
[1:40:37] it'll have to be if you and I are going
[1:40:41] to make a Rapture stay young
[1:40:46] going to take a personal experience
[1:40:50] it's going to take career
[1:40:55] personal experience with Jesus Christ
[1:41:03] Heavenly Father we thank you
[1:41:06] as we believe we're growing
[1:41:10] and maturing in Christ
[1:41:13] each and every day is
[1:41:24] and we ask you to come on the scene
[1:41:28] and you give us deliverance
[1:41:31] and you bring peace to our hearts again
[1:41:37] and we realize
[1:41:40] that we received another refilling of
[1:41:43] your spirit
[1:41:47] you're lifting us up
[1:42:06] brotherly kindness
[1:42:10] a friendship restored with the fatherism
[1:42:17] it's called sons and daughters being
[1:42:20] adopted
[1:42:23] we thank you Lord
[1:42:25] for this great word you brought us
[1:42:29] this great Plan of Redemption foreign
[1:43:11] amen so brother Kenny would come
[1:43:16] let's just sing that song
[1:43:18] Amazing Grace
[1:43:20] How Sweet the Sound
[1:43:22] saved or Rich like me
[1:43:25] I once was lost
[1:43:28] but now I'm found
[1:43:31] was blind but now I see
[1:43:36] [Music]
[1:43:40] great
[1:43:41] [Music]
[1:44:03] [Applause]
[1:44:05] [Music]
[1:44:08] but now
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:20] I see
[1:44:26] was Grace
[1:44:31] [Music]
[1:44:51] and how places
[1:44:54] [Music]
[1:45:17] praise the Lord
[1:45:22] I just wanted to say that um if we can
[1:45:25] remember my mother-in-law she went to
[1:45:29] Albuquerque she went to Albuquerque we
[1:45:32] could just remember her in prayer
[1:45:35] and I just wanted to say one more thing
[1:45:37] in regards to the what I shared with a
[1:45:39] friend of mine from Ryder he is in
[1:45:42] remission he does have a couple more
[1:45:44] tests to take
[1:45:46] but
[1:45:47] um
[1:45:49] if you would just remember him as well
[1:45:51] he was very very excited about the
[1:45:57] turnout and I I don't know I
[1:46:02] he's he I believe he has faith
[1:46:06] uh and and I and I believe that um
[1:46:10] God has has done something for him and
[1:46:14] so we could just remember him his name
[1:46:17] is Mitch
[1:46:18] um
[1:46:19] I believe I'm believing that he's going
[1:46:22] to come back to work because he's been
[1:46:24] gone for three or four months now
[1:46:26] um
[1:46:27] and um
[1:46:30] I believe he's going to testify to those
[1:46:33] men around him
[1:46:34] [Music]
[1:46:36] that God is alive
[1:46:39] and and so that's the reason why I
[1:46:42] wanted to part of the reason why I
[1:46:43] wanted to share that with you is that
[1:46:46] as believers
[1:46:48] trust and know that God is alive we
[1:46:50] believe that he is but it when we pray
[1:46:53] we need to believe that not only does he
[1:46:57] does he hear us but he does answer
[1:46:58] sometimes it's not always the way we
[1:47:00] want it but there are times it he does
[1:47:04] answer the prayer
[1:47:05] and so we just want to give thanks to
[1:47:08] the Lord and give him all the glory and
[1:47:10] and encourage one another with that so
[1:47:13] Lord bless you
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:16] foreign
[1:47:22] I just I believe that
[1:47:25] if we'll just put our faith in the Lord
[1:47:27] there's nothing impossible I believe
[1:47:30] that with all my heart and I just love
[1:47:32] this song because it's
[1:47:35] it's it's it's it's telling us if
[1:47:39] you'll believe in God
[1:47:41] we should it shouldn't even be enough we
[1:47:45] should just believe we should just trust
[1:47:47] it with all of our hearts scripture says
[1:47:50] trust in the Lord with all your heart
[1:47:52] and lead not into your own understanding
[1:47:55] we've all come there's time for we doubt
[1:47:58] I'm not saying that I don't doubt I'm
[1:48:00] just saying though I'm letting you know
[1:48:02] what the scripture says
[1:48:03] and that's where we that's where we put
[1:48:05] our faith in is his word
