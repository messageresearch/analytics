[54:27] Africa he was a great blessing to the
[54:29] people
[54:31] there we had a great time of Fellowship
[54:35] together well we had to we were in Congo
[54:37] we were the only English speaking people
[54:41] there though there is some brethren that
[54:44] spoke
[54:46] English but the most of the folks either
[54:49] speak the uh uh
[54:52] French or they speak their dialect
[54:56] lingala so um but we look forward to
[55:00] those Services coming
[55:03] up and we sure and we're sure these men
[55:05] of God will be a blessing to all of
[55:09] you and we've got with us this morning
[55:13] also a
[55:15] gentleman uh a friend a brother in
[55:19] Christ and who we've
[55:22] invited and he was able to come this
[55:24] morning

[55:28] you
[55:29] also and uh our brother Dennis mcgi
[55:33] Dennis McGary from down in Flagstaff AR
[55:36] FL his wife Sister Louise also

[55:41] with
[55:43] us so brother Dennis if you'll come at
[55:45] this time and uh as we all stand to our
[55:50] feet and uh we invite our brother Dennis
[55:53] to come and share all that's in his
[55:58] heart um and there is we don't have a
[56:01] time
[56:03] limit we think each man ought to be led
[56:05] of the
[56:07] spirit and if the spirit tells him to
[56:10] stop in a half
[56:13] hour that's what it is but if the spirit
[56:16] keeps leading
[56:17] him and takes him to three
[56:20] hours who are we to argue with the Holy
[56:23] Spirit
[56:25] uh and uh we're sure that the brother's
[56:27] LED of the spirit this
[56:30] morning and the words he has for
[56:33] us will be words of
[56:36] life so uh the Lord bless you all this
[56:39] morning I forgot to mentioned to brother
[56:41] Dennis he'd be speaking with an
[56:45] interpreter but but uh I know he's
[56:48] accustomed to
[56:49] that that's nothing new for
[56:52] him so with that said
[56:56] brother Dennis if you'll come at this
[56:57] time and share with us all that God's
[57:00] put on your
[57:02] heart and uh and bless our
[57:11] hearts
[57:14] bless God bless you this
[57:17] morning it's nice to be in the church
[57:20] house this
[57:23] morning to Fellowship around the things
[57:25] of the
[57:30] Lord every good and perfect gift comes
[57:33] from the father
[57:36] above and we're in his house this
[57:40] morning the scripture came to my mind
[57:43] this morning where the spirit of the
[57:45] Lord
[57:47] is there is
[57:51] liberty so we're believing that we
[57:56] can experience that Liberty that we have
[58:02] in and so if you'd like to turn in your
[58:05] Bibles this
[58:07] morning just appreciate the invitation
[58:10] to be

[58:16] of
[58:18] Leviticus and the 25th
[58:23] chapter
[58:27] we like to read from the 47th
[58:35] verse and if the Lord would help us this
[58:38] morning
[58:39] we we'd like to speak on God's free
[58:44] man God's free
[58:50] man verse
[58:53] 47 and if if a Sojourner or a stranger

[1:00:11] morning we trust in you that you will
[1:00:14] give us something for our
[1:00:18] soul something that our inner man can
[1:00:22] live
[1:00:23] by
[1:00:26] that we can live our lives for you
[1:00:29] Lord be in
[1:00:32] love and be
[1:00:34] free and we commit
[1:00:37] this into your hands in Jesus name amen
[1:00:42] amen amen you may be
[1:00:46] seated just in
[1:00:48] a way of
[1:00:52] introduction I'm Rec calling this
[1:00:55] morning a a time when my wife and I were
[1:00:58] going overseas
[1:01:01] and there was just uh for very unusual
[1:01:06] that
[1:01:07] we got to the airport hours early for
[1:01:11] our
[1:01:14] flight and we were so early that I
[1:01:17] decided that I would try to take care of
[1:01:20] some business and make use of my
[1:01:23] time
[1:01:27] and my wife she uh she decided to go
[1:01:30] through a for a little walk in the
[1:01:34] airport and she was trusting me to be
[1:01:37] keeping track of the
[1:01:40] time and I was trusting her to be track
[1:01:43] keeping track of the
[1:01:46] time and it turned out that we having so
[1:01:51] much extra time we ended up being late
[1:01:53] for our flight
[1:01:57] flight there overseas
[1:02:01] flight and so uh just by God's grace the
[1:02:08] airline uh put us up in the
[1:02:13] hotel in in Philadelphia Philadelphia
[1:02:16] and we had to wait for the flight the
[1:02:18] next
[1:02:20] day and so we took that opportunity to
[1:02:23] go to the places in Philadelphia where
[1:02:27] this
[1:02:28] country uh first declared its
[1:02:37] independence and these uh colonies were
[1:02:42] under a
[1:02:44] great
[1:02:48] oppression from the government of
[1:02:52] England and they
[1:02:54] made their grievances known and then
[1:02:57] they proclaimed that they were going to
[1:03:01] declare themselves a Sovereign
[1:03:08] Nation and they and they made this
[1:03:11] declaration of
[1:03:14] independence and they said we do this in
[1:03:16] the sight of
[1:03:19] God and we're believing that God is
[1:03:22] going to keep us in this move that we're
[1:03:29] making but we are
[1:03:32] declaring that we are no longer going to
[1:03:35] live under this
[1:03:38] oppression this oppression is
[1:03:41] wrong we believe it's out of God's
[1:03:45] divine
[1:03:47] order and we believe that God's going to
[1:03:50] stand with us in this move that we are
[1:03:53] making
[1:03:56] and we are
[1:03:58] declaring that we are
[1:04:01] independent of
[1:04:05] England
[1:04:07] and they rung in Philadelphia they had
[1:04:11] this Bell
[1:04:14] made and on that
[1:04:17] Bell it was called the Liberty
[1:04:20] Bell and what's written on the Liberty
[1:04:23] Bell
[1:04:25] now this in our country is a very famous
[1:04:28] symbol because that Bell is
[1:04:35] cracked but it's just one of those
[1:04:38] symbols of uh of the freedom of of this
[1:04:44] nation but what many people don't know
[1:04:46] is what's written on that
[1:04:50] Bell so we were looking at that
[1:04:53] Bell
[1:04:54] and what's written on it is the
[1:04:57] scripture from uh Leviticus chapter
[1:05:04] 25 and uh Leviticus 25 and
[1:05:10] 10 says
[1:05:12] this and you shall hallow the 50th
[1:05:18] year and Proclaim Liberty throughout all
[1:05:21] the
[1:05:23] land
[1:05:24] unto all the inhabitants
[1:05:27] thereof it shall be a jubilee unto
[1:05:31] you and you shall return every man unto
[1:05:35] his
[1:05:37] possession and you shall return every
[1:05:40] man unto his
[1:05:44] family so that
[1:05:46] Bell became the symbol of
[1:05:50] Liberty and at different times they
[1:05:53] would even take this Bell on
[1:05:58] tours to remind the
[1:06:01] people that we're to
[1:06:03] live in
[1:06:05] Liberty and so where the spirit of the
[1:06:07] Lord is there is
[1:06:11] liberty and Jesus said You shall know
[1:06:15] the
[1:06:16] truth and the truth will set you
[1:06:19] free now so many times when we don't
[1:06:23] look at the big
[1:06:26] picture and we're kind of in what we
[1:06:30] call tunnel
[1:06:33] vision you know that's the problem with
[1:06:35] these Maps uh these electronic maps on
[1:06:38] your phone and
[1:06:42] things many times you're too zeroed
[1:06:47] in and you can't get an idea where
[1:06:50] you're
[1:06:51] at so you have to zoom out and at the
[1:06:54] big
[1:06:57] picture and get orientated
[1:07:00] again to where I really
[1:07:03] am and sometimes we allow
[1:07:06] Satan and our
[1:07:09] circumstances to to pull us in and we we
[1:07:14] get zoomed in and zoomed
[1:07:16] in and we come into this
[1:07:20] bondage that you know well you know I
[1:07:23] have these
[1:07:25] lexes I'm in this
[1:07:28] situation I I got in this uh uh some
[1:07:32] kind of
[1:07:33] [Music]
[1:07:34] cage maybe it's
[1:07:37] economics you know maybe it's a
[1:07:40] spiritual things
[1:07:42] or but sometimes we're all zoomed
[1:07:46] in and we think you know what's wrong
[1:07:49] with
[1:07:50] me you know why can't I get the victory
[1:07:53] over myself
[1:07:56] why can't I get the victory over this
[1:07:59] situation you know why am I so
[1:08:02] nervous why am I
[1:08:06] upset and we were too zoomed
[1:08:11] in and when we zoom out and see the big
[1:08:20] picture the scripture we opened with
[1:08:23] this morning
[1:08:30] this is the law that God made it's
[1:08:33] called The Law of
[1:08:38] redemption
[1:08:40] so many times we as Believers in the
[1:08:44] message of the
[1:08:47] hour we've maybe heard ministers and
[1:08:50] brother
[1:08:52] Bram talk about Revelations chapter
[1:08:57] 5 and the Book of
[1:09:01] redemption and we're familiar with the
[1:09:03] thought that in our day and age this
[1:09:05] book of redemption is is being made
[1:09:08] known
[1:09:12] or it's being
[1:09:15] understood it's being
[1:09:18] revealed but that book of
[1:09:22] redemption is this book
[1:09:25] it's the
[1:09:26] Bible so it's the things that were
[1:09:29] always in the
[1:09:32] Bible but we didn't understand
[1:09:35] them and we did not consider
[1:09:39] them and so uh they were a mystery to
[1:09:44] us and many of these things spoken in
[1:09:47] the Book of
[1:09:50] Revelation they they they seem very kind
[1:09:52] of strange to
[1:09:54] us kind of
[1:09:57] mysterious and we might ask in our heart
[1:09:59] well Lord how does that help
[1:10:04] me in my everyday
[1:10:08] living but you know when when I was
[1:10:15] Catholic they taught
[1:10:17] us that you're supposed to uh accept
[1:10:21] this
[1:10:22] condition
[1:10:24] they they teach you that you're not
[1:10:26] supposed to
[1:10:30] understand what's wrong with this
[1:10:33] picture in your
[1:10:36] heart and your love for
[1:10:39] God you want to understand
[1:10:41] God you want to understand his
[1:10:44] purpose you you you in your heart you
[1:10:47] want to understand his will for your
[1:10:51] life you you want to understand about
[1:10:54] the things of
[1:10:56] God because you want to be a
[1:11:00] partaker and what a dark
[1:11:04] idea that it's not for you to
[1:11:07] understand you know if you want to be
[1:11:12] spiritual uh you can become a
[1:11:16] priest or you can become a
[1:11:19] nun but you know for the
[1:11:22] congregation you just live any way you
[1:11:26] want go to the
[1:11:28] movies go to the ball
[1:11:31] games but if you really want to know
[1:11:33] something about
[1:11:36] God then you join the Catholic
[1:11:40] priesthood and and and we'll teach you
[1:11:42] Latin and we'll educate
[1:11:46] you so there was this
[1:11:50] mentality that you should not have the
[1:11:53] hope
[1:11:55] to understand the things of
[1:11:58] God but I'm so
[1:12:01] thankful that God became man so that we
[1:12:06] could
[1:12:08] understand it's his
[1:12:10] desire to have
[1:12:12] Fellowship he don't want to be a
[1:12:15] mystery and we're
[1:12:17] gonna by the grace of God this
[1:12:20] morning we're going to see this
[1:12:24] that God had this
[1:12:27] plan for
[1:12:29] intimacy for
[1:12:31] friendship for
[1:12:33] fellowship and understanding don't come
[1:12:36] by
[1:12:39] intellect but it comes by the heart
[1:12:42] you're going to understand these things
[1:12:44] in your
[1:12:46] heart there's going to be a voice inside
[1:12:49] of
[1:12:50] you that
[1:12:52] believes that this is the voice of God
[1:12:56] to
[1:12:57] me your heart's going to
[1:13:00] declare I feel safe
[1:13:03] here I feel the spirit of the
[1:13:05] Lord I feel the spirit of
[1:13:08] Liberty I believe this is God speaking
[1:13:12] to my
[1:13:15] heart and nobody's going to shove that
[1:13:17] down your
[1:13:21] throat nobody's gonna manipulate your
[1:13:27] mind and say you you know you have to
[1:13:29] come under my idea my
[1:13:36] theology but God put something in your
[1:13:41] heart that you recognize his
[1:13:44] voice you recognize his
[1:13:47] spirit so in our scripture this
[1:13:52] morning God
[1:13:54] is setting forth by the mouth of
[1:14:01] Moses this
[1:14:06] law now we know when we read the New
[1:14:11] Testament that Paul said that the law is
[1:14:14] a school
[1:14:18] Master it teaches you until you come to
[1:14:22] a place
[1:14:24] where you can be a son or daughter of
[1:14:29] God and walk in the true Liberty that
[1:14:33] God has in mind for
[1:14:37] you but it's the it's the law that
[1:14:40] convicts you of
[1:14:47] sin it's
[1:14:49] the it's there are certain laws in you
[1:14:55] that bring you
[1:14:58] conviction now conviction and
[1:15:01] condemnation are two different
[1:15:06] things
[1:15:09] condemnation doesn't put you in the
[1:15:13] hole but it don't give you a
[1:15:17] ladder but God always gives
[1:15:21] you a way of escape a way of
[1:15:29] redemption so
[1:15:31] this law that God's putting forth
[1:15:37] here it's part of God's
[1:15:42] picture but God's developing this
[1:15:47] picture when God delivered the children
[1:15:52] of Israel
[1:15:57] he had a picture in his
[1:16:00] mind where these people would
[1:16:05] dwell and in this picture in the Old
[1:16:09] Testament this was called the promised
[1:16:13] land it was a a land promised to these
[1:16:18] people they were in slavery under the
[1:16:21] Pharaohs of Egypt
[1:16:25] they were making
[1:16:28] bricks they were
[1:16:30] slaves but they were given a
[1:16:35] promise and Moses God sent Moses to
[1:16:40] them and he said I'm G to take you out
[1:16:43] of this
[1:16:46] bondage and I'm going to bring you to a
[1:16:49] land that belongs to you that I'm going
[1:16:51] to give you
[1:16:55] and every
[1:16:57] family and every tribe is going to have
[1:17:01] a a a certain place in this
[1:17:05] land and he said to this tribe or to
[1:17:08] this
[1:17:10] family you're going to have from this
[1:17:12] mountain
[1:17:13] here down to this River
[1:17:16] here and your boundaries are going to be
[1:17:19] here and
[1:17:22] here
[1:17:24] and it was God's picture in his
[1:17:28] mind where every family and every tribe
[1:17:31] would
[1:17:32] be and this other family
[1:17:35] or there would be the other side of this
[1:17:39] River and from these mountains to this
[1:17:43] plane and that's the
[1:17:46] place that God wanted them to
[1:17:49] be now that's in the natural that was a
[1:17:54] physical geographical
[1:17:57] place that God brought
[1:18:01] them
[1:18:02] now we know that God's got a place for
[1:18:08] us but it's a little greater than just
[1:18:14] geographical but it in God's
[1:18:19] mind he's got a place for you to
[1:18:26] now in this
[1:18:29] scripture in verse 47 it says if a
[1:18:32] solder or a stranger wax Rich by
[1:18:40] thee now the people when they come into
[1:18:43] this
[1:18:46] land God says that there's going to be
[1:18:48] others
[1:18:50] there not your tribe not your
[1:18:53] family but you're going to be dwelling
[1:18:56] among
[1:18:58] them and if one of these Souljers or
[1:19:01] strangers wax is
[1:19:07] Rich and your brother that dwells by him
[1:19:11] wax is
[1:19:14] poor
[1:19:16] now we're only in the first part of the
[1:19:18] scripture and there's a little mystery
[1:19:21] here
[1:19:24] why would God let the stranger wax
[1:19:28] rich and the believer wax
[1:19:32] poor and you know you can read the book
[1:19:34] of
[1:19:35] Job and those religious
[1:19:38] guys they're painting the
[1:19:41] picture to to job and they're saying you
[1:19:45] know if you live for God and you live
[1:19:48] clean and you do
[1:19:51] right God's going to bless you and
[1:19:54] you're going to prosper and you're going
[1:19:57] to have
[1:19:58] abundance and it's going to be
[1:20:03] wonderful and job would have to say
[1:20:08] amen
[1:20:09] amen but then job said
[1:20:12] back he said look at the wicked over
[1:20:16] here look they're rich
[1:20:19] too who filled up their coffers with
[1:20:25] gold they're out there living in
[1:20:28] pleasure they don't care nothing about
[1:20:30] God and they got wealth and riches
[1:20:37] too so you said a good
[1:20:40] thing but we can look in
[1:20:42] life and we can see the other thing is
[1:20:45] true
[1:20:48] too oh brothers and
[1:20:51] sisters
[1:20:53] you know when we're really honest with
[1:20:58] ourselves every
[1:21:01] time that we think we get things figured
[1:21:06] out we find
[1:21:10] out that at our
[1:21:16] best brother bradam told a story like
[1:21:20] this he said one little Canary got up on
[1:21:22] the high uh branch in the
[1:21:26] cage and he started telling the other
[1:21:30] canaries you know I've been a few
[1:21:33] places I've been in some nice
[1:21:35] houses I know a lot about
[1:21:38] humans let me tell you a few
[1:21:41] things and he's talking to all the other
[1:21:44] canaries like you know you're pretty
[1:21:45] smart
[1:21:49] Canary and then this professor comes up
[1:21:53] to the
[1:21:54] cage and he starts you know talking to
[1:21:57] this
[1:21:59] Canary and this car Canary can't
[1:22:01] understand one thing
[1:22:04] he why can't he understand because he's
[1:22:08] a canary and this man's a university
[1:22:13] professor and he's only got a canary
[1:22:18] brain and brother Bram says compared to
[1:22:21] God's Great
[1:22:25] intelligence compared to what God
[1:22:28] knows and who God
[1:22:31] is really we just have a canary
[1:22:36] brain we're only going to
[1:22:39] know what God reveals to
[1:22:42] us John the Baptist when when when he
[1:22:46] was on the banks of the river and they
[1:22:48] came to John the
[1:22:51] Baptist and they said John your
[1:22:54] disciples now they're following
[1:22:57] Jesus you know aren't you bothered
[1:22:59] aren't you
[1:23:03] upset and John said a man can receive
[1:23:08] nothing except it be given him of
[1:23:14] God I'm not even worthy to latch his
[1:23:19] shoes I baptize in water but he
[1:23:23] baptizes with the Holy Ghost what he
[1:23:27] does will change you
[1:23:30] completely what what what what he can do
[1:23:35] is give you eternal
[1:23:37] life I'm I'm not the
[1:23:40] bridegroom I'm just the friend
[1:23:43] of the one that has the
[1:23:46] bride he's the
[1:23:49] bridegroom the
[1:23:51] god of our
[1:23:54] life the Lord of our
[1:23:58] heart he's the
[1:24:01] master what do we
[1:24:03] know
[1:24:05] except what he'd give us by his
[1:24:11] grace so we don't know why he allowed
[1:24:16] this man to wax
[1:24:20] poor but his neighbor who is not one of
[1:24:23] the children of
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:28] Israel his neighbor this land was not
[1:24:30] promised to his
[1:24:33] neighbor this land was promised to him
[1:24:35] it's his
[1:24:37] inheritance th sayith the Lord this is
[1:24:40] the word of the Lord you're going to
[1:24:42] you're going to possess this land the
[1:24:43] borders are going to be this the borders
[1:24:45] are going to be
[1:24:47] this but this Man waxs
[1:24:49] Poor he's trying to make's to feed his
[1:24:53] family things don't go
[1:24:56] good and he sells
[1:24:59] out and
[1:25:01] finally he sells his
[1:25:05] stuff in one place in the scripture says
[1:25:07] he even sells out his his
[1:25:12] family and finally he sells himself into
[1:25:17] slavery just to eat just to
[1:25:21] survive
[1:25:23] but in God's
[1:25:26] law this
[1:25:28] man can be redeemed and his possession
[1:25:34] can
[1:25:37] now when this land is
[1:25:41] sold God doesn't
[1:25:44] want that promised possession to be in
[1:25:46] the hands of
[1:25:50] another he wants it to be in possession
[1:25:54] of the one it was promised
[1:25:58] to because God's plan was this tribe
[1:26:01] this family is going to be on this side
[1:26:03] of the
[1:26:05] river the whole program can't get mixed
[1:26:08] out but now this person owns part of it
[1:26:10] and that person is over here that part
[1:26:13] and God's not going to allow
[1:26:15] that so God makes this law of
[1:26:20] redemption and he says
[1:26:24] your possession can be
[1:26:28] redeemed but it has to be by your
[1:26:32] family because I want this family to be
[1:26:38] here so it has to be your family that
[1:26:41] comes and
[1:26:44] redeems your
[1:26:46] possession it's got to be either your
[1:26:48] uncle or
[1:26:50] somebody of close K to
[1:26:57] you and so when this close kin
[1:27:03] comes to redeem your
[1:27:06] possession they don't buy it for
[1:27:09] themselves they redeem it back to
[1:27:13] you they pay the
[1:27:15] price that you can have your
[1:27:21] possession so that's
[1:27:23] this law of
[1:27:27] redemption and this is this story of the
[1:27:32] kinsman
[1:27:35] redeemer that the law is that the one
[1:27:37] who redeems
[1:27:39] it must be able to do
[1:27:43] it they have to have the resources they
[1:27:46] have to have the
[1:27:48] ability and they have to be your near of
[1:27:54] K so there might have been a lot of
[1:27:57] people there was a lot of Rich
[1:28:01] guys who would redeem it for
[1:28:04] you but the law was it has to be your
[1:28:13] kid so God's showing us something here
[1:28:17] in this Old Testament
[1:28:21] picture
[1:28:23] because God in his
[1:28:25] thoughts he's developing this
[1:28:29] picture he sees
[1:28:31] something now when
[1:28:33] God sees
[1:28:35] something and he makes a
[1:28:40] blueprint when in this blueprint how
[1:28:43] many is anyone in here in
[1:28:47] construction when you're building a
[1:28:49] building you have this set of plans is
[1:28:52] all rolled
[1:28:56] up normally is printed with blue
[1:29:00] ink that's why they call them
[1:29:05] Blueprints and you see the picture of
[1:29:08] what what you're going to build
[1:29:10] here you know it's going to go this way
[1:29:13] and that
[1:29:15] way streets over there and here's the
[1:29:18] building they show a picture from above
[1:29:21] the the floor
[1:29:24] plan they have one one page for the
[1:29:27] plumbing one for the
[1:29:34] electrical but when God has so man he'll
[1:29:38] make a
[1:29:41] blueprint and he got a beautiful
[1:29:44] plan but maybe the project doesn't get
[1:29:49] financing maybe the people who are going
[1:29:51] to build the house you know they
[1:29:55] die but you know there there's many
[1:29:58] blueprints at the City of
[1:30:01] Phoenix that they paid for the permit
[1:30:04] but the building never got
[1:30:08] built because the the the vision they
[1:30:11] couldn't make the vision
[1:30:14] happen but God's not like
[1:30:17] that God when he had a
[1:30:20] plan the
[1:30:22] it those plans were as
[1:30:25] real when God thought it as when it came
[1:30:29] to
[1:30:30] pass because God's thoughts are
[1:30:34] Eternal so when God was
[1:30:37] thinking
[1:30:40] church when he was thinking of a
[1:30:43] bride when he thought that down at the
[1:30:45] end of
[1:30:48] time I'm going to have a people that
[1:30:50] love me I'm going to have a people that
[1:30:52] love my
[1:30:54] word have for
[1:30:57] me a
[1:31:01] bride
[1:31:06] now God's
[1:31:08] thoughts are
[1:31:10] Eternal I want to slow down here a
[1:31:14] moment in an airport in Germany one time
[1:31:17] talking to some Muslim
[1:31:20] men
[1:31:23] very very friendly very kind
[1:31:26] man but they were Islamic they were
[1:31:33] Muslim and so I asked him I
[1:31:35] said does God know who is going to
[1:31:41] heaven say you believe in heaven and
[1:31:45] hell they said yeah of course I said
[1:31:48] well does God know who is going to
[1:31:51] heaven and who is going to
[1:31:56] hell they looked at each other they said
[1:32:00] well yes he's
[1:32:03] God he knows
[1:32:05] everything so I said to them when did he
[1:32:09] know
[1:32:12] that when when did he know going to
[1:32:18] heav he always knew that
[1:32:23] amen so when God has a
[1:32:29] picture oh it's a beautiful way to
[1:32:32] live when you talk about living
[1:32:36] inty it's what God reveals to your
[1:32:40] heart that purchases your
[1:32:43] Liberty and he puts something in your
[1:32:47] heart to believe his
[1:32:49] word and you live by
[1:32:56] that so here God
[1:32:59] is he has in his mind that I'm going to
[1:33:03] have a true Christian Church in the end
[1:33:13] time not Hypocrites not people who you
[1:33:17] know act one way and have another life
[1:33:19] on another
[1:33:20] way
[1:33:22] no I'm going to have a I'm going to have
[1:33:24] a church that loves
[1:33:26] me I'm going to have a
[1:33:28] bride I'm G to have somebody who has
[1:33:31] confidence in
[1:33:32] me that believes in me and that loves me
[1:33:37] and I got this picture in my
[1:33:40] mind it's the bride It's The End Time
[1:33:46] bride did he know who would be in his
[1:33:51] bride
[1:33:54] when did he know
[1:33:58] that when did he know
[1:34:01] that and if he knew who they
[1:34:05] were did he know what they would look
[1:34:10] like amen he know what color hair they
[1:34:15] have they know they' be
[1:34:20] tall
[1:34:23] yeah he knew
[1:34:27] exactly do you know what kind of
[1:34:29] complexes they would
[1:34:33] have did they know they'd be a little
[1:34:36] bit
[1:34:38] lazy
[1:34:40] sorry do you know they' be
[1:34:44] nervous we have an expression of worry
[1:34:46] wart I don't know that doesn't translate
[1:34:49] a worry wart you know when you have a
[1:34:51] little on your hand a little
[1:34:56] gr they they call people you know like a
[1:34:58] worry workart
[1:35:02] worried but did God
[1:35:06] know who you
[1:35:08] were and did he know what you would be
[1:35:12] like amen yes and when did he know that
[1:35:17] before the foundation of the
[1:35:20] world SL before
[1:35:25] foundation for your
[1:35:30] Redemption this isn't just you know us
[1:35:33] in our
[1:35:35] thoughts we watch the
[1:35:37] news we watch the ball
[1:35:40] games you know we look in the newspaper
[1:35:42] for sales you know where we're going to
[1:35:45] get the best deal and how we're going to
[1:35:47] save
[1:35:48] money look for a better place to rent
[1:35:52] and we're busy with all that and then we
[1:35:57] think why am I in this
[1:36:01] condition I love God so
[1:36:05] much and I have this Human
[1:36:10] Condition I think it
[1:36:13] would serve us very
[1:36:16] well if we worry less about the
[1:36:20] shopping
[1:36:22] maybe leave away the ball
[1:36:26] games maybe don't watch so much
[1:36:32] news and start looking at the word of
[1:36:36] God and who you
[1:36:40] are and there's a
[1:36:45] witness inside of
[1:36:48] you that you're a child of God
[1:36:53] and everything else clouds that
[1:36:58] picture but like the prodal
[1:37:01] son when you come to
[1:37:04] yourself you come to a little deeper
[1:37:10] things and you your thoughts become a
[1:37:13] little deeper and you say Lord what am I
[1:37:20] doing what is my purpose here I talked
[1:37:24] to a young lady and she working at a
[1:37:26] little coffee
[1:37:29] shop I said how you doing and she said
[1:37:32] she said well you know I'm going to
[1:37:36] University and she said I I changed my
[1:37:40] uh program
[1:37:42] again I changed my
[1:37:45] direction I was going to get a degree in
[1:37:49] this and now I'm I'm going to get a
[1:37:51] degree in
[1:37:53] this and she said you know I don't
[1:37:56] really know what I want to
[1:38:00] do you know to trying to figure out well
[1:38:03] what's my purpose you know what what's
[1:38:05] my
[1:38:09] Direction but you know if you go a
[1:38:11] little
[1:38:14] deeper and you ask a bigger
[1:38:18] question why did God create man
[1:38:22] why did why did God have people on the
[1:38:28] Earth what was his
[1:38:30] purpose you know he had all the
[1:38:33] animals and each one got more
[1:38:36] perfect more
[1:38:38] advanced and then he came to this
[1:38:40] masterpiece of
[1:38:42] man who's a little Creator he's like a
[1:38:45] little
[1:38:46] God he he he can even create an
[1:38:49] atmosphere with his own
[1:38:53] mouth oh sure your words and how you
[1:38:58] talk what you profess you live in that
[1:39:01] world you the world you live
[1:39:05] in you want to talk about faith
[1:39:08] confidence in God you want to talk about
[1:39:11] how good God
[1:39:13] is and you talk about those things
[1:39:16] you're going to live in that
[1:39:20] world little
[1:39:22] creators look at the works that man
[1:39:24] does Bridges and
[1:39:28] skyscrapers spaceships and all
[1:39:32] this did God create
[1:39:34] man to do those
[1:39:37] things God created man for
[1:39:41] Fellowship he wanted to have
[1:39:45] someone that he could have communion
[1:39:48] with he could talk to them
[1:39:53] they he can talk
[1:39:55] back he could have
[1:39:57] affection he could have love
[1:40:01] Fellowship so when the picture gets you
[1:40:04] know a little
[1:40:07] confusing like with this young
[1:40:09] lady she might be having trouble finding
[1:40:12] her
[1:40:15] Direction but if she knows her
[1:40:19] purpose if she can keep that
[1:40:24] straight my primary
[1:40:28] purpose my reason for
[1:40:32] being is fellowship with
[1:40:36] him now there's a witness in
[1:40:40] you that loves
[1:40:42] you that there's a witness in you that
[1:40:44] loves him excuse
[1:40:49] me
[1:40:52] if you look in the word of
[1:40:54] God and you see the people who don't
[1:40:56] care about
[1:40:58] God and you see the people that do care
[1:41:01] about
[1:41:02] God some tells you hey I'm over
[1:41:08] here but you look at your
[1:41:13] condition and you say well how can I
[1:41:16] love God so
[1:41:19] much and be so
[1:41:22] tempted and be so tore up
[1:41:27] sometimes but this condition of this man
[1:41:31] in the Book of
[1:41:33] Leviticus that's all of
[1:41:37] usen you see this thing it's not just
[1:41:41] you you know having a
[1:41:44] complex being nervous and you know
[1:41:47] because you're kind of
[1:41:49] strange no brother sister you're not
[1:41:52] strange we were sold
[1:41:55] out in the Garden of
[1:41:57] Eden we lost our
[1:42:00] position because Adam and Eve sold us
[1:42:04] out and now we were born into this
[1:42:07] carnal
[1:42:10] body into this Human Condition and the
[1:42:14] Bible says that the carnal
[1:42:17] mind you it
[1:42:21] it's an enity against
[1:42:24] God and the carnal mind cannot it will
[1:42:28] not be
[1:42:30] subject and it cannot be brought into
[1:42:35] subjection because it's from that fall
[1:42:38] in the garden it's part of this
[1:42:42] flesh we have not only our
[1:42:45] bodies but we also have this carnal
[1:42:49] thinking
[1:42:51] and it's just
[1:42:58] carnality but we do have a
[1:43:02] redeemer that can redeem
[1:43:06] us from this condition to buy us
[1:43:11] back to the land that God intended us to
[1:43:15] live
[1:43:19] him
[1:43:24] and this promised land for the children
[1:43:27] of
[1:43:29] Israel that was a land of
[1:43:33] rest they were going to rest from that
[1:43:36] slavery they were going to rest from
[1:43:41] oppression and they were going to come
[1:43:43] into this
[1:43:45] land and that was their resting place
[1:43:52] but there was a
[1:43:53] group that wouldn't
[1:43:56] believe and they died in the
[1:44:01] wilderness and they didn't enter into
[1:44:04] God's
[1:44:08] rest because of
[1:44:19] unbelief
[1:44:21] so it doesn't
[1:44:24] matter how much you
[1:44:28] pray I'm quoting brother
[1:44:31] Bram he said you can come here to The
[1:44:35] Altar and and and it doesn't matter how
[1:44:39] much you
[1:44:41] cry and how long you
[1:44:44] pray if you cannot
[1:44:47] believe that the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:44:52] makes you
[1:44:53] clean all that praying and all that
[1:44:57] crying will do you no good until you
[1:45:01] accept by faith that the blood of Jesus
[1:45:04] Christ has
[1:45:09] made not 80%
[1:45:13] clean
[1:45:16] 98% but the blood of Jesus Christ makes
[1:45:20] you completely
[1:45:22] clean in the sight of
[1:45:24] God and your
[1:45:28] Redemption is complete and you are
[1:45:30] placed
[1:45:32] back in the place that God wanted you to
[1:45:37] have which is complete
[1:45:41] Liberty in
[1:45:43] him no
[1:45:46] condemnation no
[1:45:49] shame you know it's an interesting
[1:45:53] thing I believe
[1:45:55] people
[1:45:56] can accept that God forgives them of
[1:46:00] their
[1:46:04] sin say you know I'm
[1:46:09] forgiven but I'm so
[1:46:12] ashamed but he bore your shame at
[1:46:18] Calvary he was shamed
[1:46:21] he was stripped
[1:46:23] naked in front of those that loved
[1:46:26] him he was crucified
[1:46:29] nak brother said the artist put that
[1:46:32] little cloth
[1:46:35] there but that wasn't
[1:46:37] so he bore our
[1:46:40] shame he bore our sin and our
[1:46:47] shame and that loosing he loosed us from
[1:46:51] our
[1:46:53] sins and when that loosing is
[1:46:58] complete and it and it brings complete
[1:47:09] Liberty it's the confidence that we
[1:47:13] have in a finished
[1:47:16] work
[1:47:19] yes
[1:47:23] the thief at the
[1:47:28] cross what could he
[1:47:30] do what works could he
[1:47:33] do he lived his life without
[1:47:36] God he he he he was
[1:47:40] careless he was a
[1:47:42] criminal but on the
[1:47:45] cross when the other one was blocking
[1:47:49] Jesus saying if you be the
[1:47:52] Christ free yourself and us
[1:47:57] too and he said don't you fear
[1:48:00] God he said we're we're getting justly
[1:48:03] what we
[1:48:05] deserve this
[1:48:07] man he's he did nothing but
[1:48:10] good he opened blind eyes he he healed
[1:48:14] the
[1:48:15] leopards he spoke the truth never man
[1:48:18] spoke like this man
[1:48:20] he opened blind
[1:48:22] eyes and he's hanging in there on the
[1:48:27] cross for
[1:48:29] what for our
[1:48:33] Redemption did Jesus hang on the
[1:48:37] cross and thinking I hope that someone
[1:48:40] Believes In
[1:48:42] Me I I hope someone feels sorry for
[1:48:45] me I hope there's someone that
[1:48:48] believe no
[1:48:52] died that he
[1:48:54] fornew came to redeem those that
[1:48:59] he he knew you would
[1:49:02] believe he died for
[1:49:10] you he died for those that He
[1:49:19] forew
[1:49:22] and he came to purchase
[1:49:27] for this
[1:49:30] Liberty that we walk in
[1:49:33] today and you say well brother
[1:49:37] Dennis you know isn't this just common
[1:49:42] gospel
[1:49:45] preaching but you know there's only one
[1:49:48] gospel there's there not the gospel and
[1:49:52] then the
[1:49:54] message no the message is the
[1:49:57] gospel it's the original
[1:50:01] gospel brought back to its original
[1:50:06] state it's the same
[1:50:09] gospel that became
[1:50:14] obscured it became
[1:50:19] buried it became
[1:50:21] hidden by man's
[1:50:25] Theology and so now this hidden Mana
[1:50:30] that's been
[1:50:33] revealed is the same
[1:50:35] Mana Jesus said I am the bread of
[1:50:39] life I the bread that came from
[1:50:43] Heaven if he that believeth on
[1:50:47] me he'll never die he'll have eternal
[1:50:52] life
[1:50:55] now when you can pull that into your
[1:51:01] heart and
[1:51:03] know that you're part of his
[1:51:08] thoughts and brother R said your
[1:51:10] thoughts are who you
[1:51:13] are why we have to we have to re our
[1:51:17] thoughts and bring every thought into
[1:51:30] so he he purchased our
[1:51:35] Redemption and in the book of
[1:51:38] Hebrews Paul is explaining
[1:51:42] this this is he became our high priest
[1:51:46] and he says in verse 14 in the second
[1:51:49] Hebrews
[1:51:56] let me stop before I read that
[1:52:01] scripture there's a lot of mechanisms in
[1:52:05] the mind of
[1:52:07] man there's a lot of emotions in our
[1:52:12] heart there's a lot of
[1:52:17] voices but no matter what those things
[1:52:21] are the word of God will not
[1:52:25] fail his
[1:52:27] word will not
[1:52:30] fail
[1:52:32] so you're going to make
[1:52:34] it and there's a witness in you that
[1:52:37] you're his
[1:52:39] child Paul said he put a spirit in
[1:52:45] you that cries
[1:52:48] father and he said that
[1:52:52] spirit that thing that's in you that's
[1:52:55] crying out ABA
[1:52:58] father is a
[1:53:00] witness that you are a
[1:53:03] child it's the
[1:53:05] evidence that you're his child because
[1:53:08] spirit is abiding in
[1:53:11] you and every legal
[1:53:16] voice all your situations and your comp
[1:53:20] they may scream at
[1:53:23] you but that voice in you that says ABA
[1:53:26] father is a
[1:53:30] witness and he's gonna lose none of
[1:53:34] his so having begun in
[1:53:39] grace are we going to be perfected by
[1:53:42] works over us are we going to
[1:53:47] defend depend on our
[1:53:51] mental
[1:53:54] ability to articulate quotations of
[1:53:58] brother
[1:54:01] brandom to to to understand every
[1:54:07] scripture someone says well you know in
[1:54:10] the Greek it it it really meant
[1:54:14] this and are we going to
[1:54:17] move out of our hearts
[1:54:21] and into our
[1:54:24] mind and and attain to something
[1:54:30] intellectually and this is going to get
[1:54:31] us to a resurrection and a
[1:54:36] Rapture if that's
[1:54:39] so then I have little
[1:54:42] hope because it's hard for
[1:54:45] me to cope
[1:54:48] mentally
[1:54:52] to to handle things
[1:54:55] mentally there's too much going on in
[1:54:58] life I get
[1:55:01] confused I get confused by my phone I
[1:55:03] get confused by the
[1:55:06] computer I I I I I get I get confused
[1:55:10] about a lot of things in
[1:55:12] life it's really
[1:55:14] complicated but I'm not depending on my
[1:55:17] canary brain
[1:55:21] I'm depending on Holy Ghost
[1:55:24] leadership depending on the love of
[1:55:28] God and when I get
[1:55:31] confused I just get in my little prayer
[1:55:35] closet I said Jesus you know who I
[1:55:39] am you know who I
[1:55:41] am better than I
[1:55:44] know you understand me you love me and
[1:55:49] if you want me to understand this
[1:55:55] teaching this
[1:55:57] Doctrine this scripture this
[1:56:00] quotation the only way I'm going to
[1:56:03] understand is with your
[1:56:05] help if you reveal it to
[1:56:08] me I'm going to
[1:56:10] understand and if you don't I ain't
[1:56:13] going to understand Jesus said you
[1:56:16] cannot
[1:56:18] understand
[1:56:20] until you're born
[1:56:22] again and how can you ever be born
[1:56:25] again until you die to
[1:56:28] yourself and die to your own
[1:56:31] ability and you become a new person in
[1:56:36] Christ
[1:56:38] Jesus you put off the old
[1:56:41] man you put on the new
[1:56:43] man who's full of
[1:56:46] faith in the Lord Jesus and his
[1:56:50] ability to keep his
[1:56:53] own he said I'm not going to lose one of
[1:56:55] them going to pull them out of my hand
[1:56:59] and so now today we're walking in that
[1:57:04] Liberty
[1:57:07] amen because we've been
[1:57:10] redeemed we're God's free
[1:57:14] Man enemy comes and says what do you
[1:57:17] mean you're
[1:57:18] free
[1:57:19] look at that flesh you're
[1:57:22] in look at look look look at look at
[1:57:24] this man that you
[1:57:28] are it don't matter what I look
[1:57:32] like my redeemer
[1:57:35] came verse 14 for then as as the
[1:57:39] children are partakers of Flesh and
[1:57:42] Blood Hebrews 2
[1:57:48] and4 he also himself likewise took part
[1:57:52] of the
[1:57:54] same that through death he might destroy
[1:57:57] him that had the power of
[1:58:01] death that is the
[1:58:04] devil and deliver
[1:58:06] them who through fear of
[1:58:09] death were all their lifetime subject to
[1:58:16] bondage for verily he took not on him
[1:58:19] the nature of
[1:58:22] angels but he took on him the Seed of
[1:58:28] Abraham wherefore in all things it
[1:58:32] behooved him to be made like unto his
[1:58:39] Brethren that he might be a merciful and
[1:58:43] faithful high priest in things
[1:58:46] pertaining to
[1:58:48] God
[1:58:52] to make reconciliation for the sins of
[1:58:55] the
[1:59:00] people he's the one that reconciles our
[1:59:07] account you know years
[1:59:10] ago you used to have this
[1:59:14] checkbook and in little pieces of
[1:59:17] paper a little book
[1:59:21] and they all had
[1:59:23] numbers it from the bank it's called
[1:59:25] your
[1:59:27] checkbook and and everywhere you go it
[1:59:29] used to be that you write these
[1:59:34] checks but every time you write a
[1:59:37] check you're supposed to go in the back
[1:59:39] of the
[1:59:41] book and you're supposed to say well I I
[1:59:43] wrote check number
[1:59:45] 102 to the grocery
[1:59:48] store
[1:59:55] so now I have that much left in my bank
[1:59:59] account and you know if you're
[2:00:03] diligent that's what you do and they
[2:00:06] call that to keep your account
[2:00:11] reconciled keep it in
[2:00:14] order but you know you start writing
[2:00:16] checks and you don't write in the book
[2:00:18] and
[2:00:21] everything gets all messed
[2:00:23] up and maybe one of those checks comes
[2:00:26] back and they charge you
[2:00:29] extra you know you don't know what your
[2:00:32] account and you need
[2:00:35] somebody to straighten out this
[2:00:43] mess and you know brothers and sisters
[2:00:46] we say we
[2:00:48] believe
[2:00:50] oh I believe the perfect
[2:00:51] word I believe you Lord but you know the
[2:00:55] prophet of God
[2:00:57] said the the root of every sin is
[2:01:03] unbelief so we're saying you know I
[2:01:05] believe the
[2:01:07] prophet I believe in Jesus I'm following
[2:01:11] Jesus read my Bible I believe
[2:01:15] Paul I believe all the word of God glory
[2:01:22] for and then I see sin in my
[2:01:25] life I think well where did that come
[2:01:29] from Brother Ram said it comes from
[2:01:32] unbelief so you're unbelieving some
[2:01:42] placewhere I believe sometimes when you
[2:01:44] get
[2:01:46] anxious I'm kind of a nervous person you
[2:01:49] know I want to see what happens what's
[2:01:50] going to happen
[2:01:54] next you know I'm just wondering what
[2:01:56] you know how's this going to
[2:01:59] be but I don't need to know how how it's
[2:02:02] going to
[2:02:04] be believe it's going to be good because
[2:02:08] God is good and I committed my life to
[2:02:11] him he's going to take care of me he's
[2:02:14] going to provide for me and he might
[2:02:17] give me a mountain
[2:02:19] or he might give me a Val but I'm in his
[2:02:22] care my is in
[2:02:27] him but you know you get
[2:02:29] nervous you get anxious and then you say
[2:02:33] something that you shouldn't have
[2:02:35] said and you say yeah that was
[2:02:39] wrong but where did that come
[2:02:43] from well it its roots were back there
[2:02:49] where when you started getting
[2:02:52] nervous that's what got you ready to say
[2:02:55] what you
[2:02:57] said so the unbelief was back
[2:03:13] there but he gave
[2:03:16] us a resting place
[2:03:20] he redeemed
[2:03:22] us back to our land and that
[2:03:26] land is is a place of
[2:03:32] rest and when we go to him in our prayer
[2:03:37] closet we can
[2:03:40] know that he understands what we're
[2:03:42] going
[2:03:46] through just have a couple more more
[2:03:49] points and we'll
[2:03:52] close remember brother brandham when he
[2:03:55] went to those Pentecostal meetings Jesus
[2:03:58] only
[2:04:01] meetings it was kind of a new believer a
[2:04:05] young
[2:04:07] preacher and he saw on the back of these
[2:04:09] cars and things he said Jes it said
[2:04:12] Jesus
[2:04:14] only and he was on a fishing trip and he
[2:04:17] decided to follow them to these meetings
[2:04:20] [Music]
[2:04:23] and you remember the story he was all
[2:04:26] the preachers had to introduce
[2:04:28] himself and he was the youngest one on
[2:04:31] the on the
[2:04:34] podium and you know he was just in his
[2:04:36] uh fishing clothes you
[2:04:40] know and the next day they called for
[2:04:43] him to bring the morning message
[2:04:47] preaching
[2:04:51] and they said you know William brandham
[2:04:53] Willam we want you to come bring the
[2:04:54] morning
[2:04:57] message and he slid down in his
[2:05:02] chair and he wasn't gonna tell
[2:05:07] nobody and that colored man next to him
[2:05:09] there black guy next to
[2:05:14] him he said do you know where where he
[2:05:17] is
[2:05:19] he said sh he said I I'm him but I can't
[2:05:24] go up there look the way I'm
[2:05:27] dressed and he said those people don't
[2:05:30] care how you're
[2:05:32] dressed get there he said no no no no
[2:05:37] and then the announcement came
[2:05:39] again and that black guy said here he
[2:05:44] is
[2:05:46] here well anyway you know the story in
[2:05:50] brother bram's at those
[2:05:52] meetings and he hears these people
[2:05:54] speaking in
[2:05:57] tongues and one man he he's met the two
[2:06:02] men after
[2:06:06] church and he said one man was a real
[2:06:09] Christian real devoted
[2:06:13] Christian and he
[2:06:15] said the lord gave him a gift a little
[2:06:18] wave
[2:06:19] of
[2:06:22] knowing he said the Lord give me a way
[2:06:26] to
[2:06:28] know and he said this other
[2:06:31] man he's a total
[2:06:34] hypocrite living in
[2:06:36] adultery complete
[2:06:38] hypocrite and they were both operating
[2:06:41] the same
[2:06:44] gift well we know by listening to
[2:06:48] brother
[2:06:50] sermons and following his
[2:06:53] ministry we know what that way of
[2:06:55] knowing brother brandham
[2:07:00] had brother brandham had a
[2:07:03] vision he saw it God showed it to him
[2:07:08] and he looked at it and then he just
[2:07:10] spoke what he
[2:07:12] saw that was brother bram's way of
[2:07:16] knowing and remember brother Bram said
[2:07:18] said no
[2:07:20] one can interpret your
[2:07:22] dream nobody can tell you what your
[2:07:26] dream
[2:07:28] meant unless unless they can tell you
[2:07:32] what you
[2:07:34] dreamed I remember I was in
[2:07:37] Romania you know brother he's
[2:07:42] coming and he he might look Hispanic but
[2:07:46] he's not he's
[2:07:47] Romanian
[2:07:51] and I spent some time there in
[2:07:54] Romania they had a lot of these gifts
[2:07:57] going
[2:07:59] on people said they had
[2:08:03] Visions they got a word of the
[2:08:07] Lord and so I just read this
[2:08:12] quotation that brother brandham
[2:08:15] said that the only one that could inter
[2:08:18] your
[2:08:19] dream somebody who could tell you what
[2:08:21] they
[2:08:23] dream and you could hear a pin
[2:08:25] [Music]
[2:08:29] drop and then I got under a little
[2:08:32] pressure from
[2:08:35] that to trying to hold to what brother
[2:08:39] Bram
[2:08:42] said and I'm reading in my
[2:08:45] Bible and in the Book of Daniel
[2:08:49] all these
[2:08:51] divers they were all in
[2:08:54] trouble this King was going to he was
[2:08:56] going to kill them
[2:08:58] all because this King had a dream that
[2:09:00] troubled
[2:09:02] him and all the spiritual guys
[2:09:05] came and they said oh King you know we
[2:09:08] can give you the
[2:09:11] interpretation tell us the
[2:09:13] dream and we'll give you the
[2:09:16] interpretation he said all you you guys
[2:09:19] you're you're a joke you're
[2:09:23] clowns it's in the Bible he said tell me
[2:09:27] what I
[2:09:28] dreamed and then I'll know you have the
[2:09:32] interpretation he said you guys I'm
[2:09:34] going to kill you
[2:09:35] all and they got scared and they said oh
[2:09:38] well we know a real man of
[2:09:43] God we better call on
[2:09:47] Daniel and he'll save our hide because
[2:09:50] God talks to
[2:09:53] Daniel so we know that brother Bram had
[2:09:59] visions and that was his way of
[2:10:05] knowing where does that
[2:10:08] put all these
[2:10:10] guys they give you the idea that they
[2:10:13] have a way of
[2:10:16] knowing how do you know
[2:10:21] did God give you a
[2:10:24] vision and if he did give you a
[2:10:26] vision then speak
[2:10:30] that and we're going to see if it comes
[2:10:31] to pass
[2:10:33] or don't you better be at the
[2:10:36] altar but that gift was one to an
[2:10:40] age there wasn't anybody else like
[2:10:42] brother BR and brother Ram said there
[2:10:44] never would
[2:10:47] be
[2:10:50] this thing was not done in a
[2:10:53] corner this is not some kind of game
[2:10:55] we're
[2:10:56] playing it's God's provided
[2:11:00] way now you don't have to
[2:11:03] be some great spiritual
[2:11:08] intellect because it's simple and your
[2:11:12] heart
[2:11:13] true but you know sometimes we just get
[2:11:17] confused because we were born under this
[2:11:21] carnal this curse from the
[2:11:26] garden and we get
[2:11:28] confused and
[2:11:31] sometimes we don't we we we even get
[2:11:34] confused who we are what we're
[2:11:38] about and when I was a
[2:11:41] child they used to have this television
[2:11:45] show and they had this
[2:11:49] panel the these people here maybe four
[2:11:52] or five
[2:11:55] people sitting in these chairs behind
[2:11:57] his
[2:11:59] desk I don't know who they were maybe
[2:12:02] celebrities maybe someone from the
[2:12:03] audience but
[2:12:05] anyway group and then you had three
[2:12:09] people over
[2:12:11] here maybe there was three men
[2:12:15] here and the game was
[2:12:19] that one of these three men was say an
[2:12:25] astronaut but you didn't know which one
[2:12:30] was so this panel over
[2:12:33] here they would ask them
[2:12:35] questions they try to figure out which
[2:12:38] one was the real
[2:12:40] astronaut they say well how does it feel
[2:12:43] to wear a space
[2:12:47] suit you know how much training do you
[2:12:49] have to
[2:12:51] do what do you eat what do you see when
[2:12:54] you're up
[2:12:55] there and they're trying to get Clues
[2:12:58] which one's the real
[2:13:00] guy so after all these
[2:13:03] questions then these three guys then
[2:13:05] they ask the
[2:13:09] question will the real John Armstrong
[2:13:13] stand
[2:13:14] up
[2:13:16] Armstrong he's famous
[2:13:19] astronaut and one man start to stand
[2:13:23] up another man start to stand
[2:13:26] up and finally the real John
[2:13:30] Armstrong Armstrong he stands up and he
[2:13:33] say I am the
[2:13:38] astronaut I am John Armstrong John
[2:13:42] Armstrong and
[2:13:44] sometimes
[2:13:46] life brings so so many
[2:13:49] things and you start wondering who you
[2:13:52] are but if you go in your prayer
[2:13:56] closet and you get alone with
[2:13:59] God and that Spirit that's in you that
[2:14:01] chres ABA
[2:14:04] father you say Lord
[2:14:07] Jesus I got to work this
[2:14:09] out I got to have some
[2:14:14] aners I need some clarity I need things
[2:14:17] to be clear
[2:14:20] will the
[2:14:21] real child of
[2:14:24] God please stand
[2:14:26] up and you know finally you just raise
[2:14:30] up and you say Jesus
[2:14:33] you this is the real
[2:14:35] me you know that this is the man that
[2:14:39] loves
[2:14:41] you I'm your
[2:14:45] child the
[2:14:46] real of God finally
[2:14:50] stands and says
[2:14:52] Lord
[2:14:54] I I can't be anybody
[2:14:57] else but who you made
[2:15:04] me I've had a lot of times in my
[2:15:08] life going to
[2:15:10] church hear
[2:15:13] something it brings a little
[2:15:16] uncertainty
[2:15:19] somebody told me you know brother Bram
[2:15:21] said
[2:15:22] this you have to see it this
[2:15:25] way or you're missing
[2:15:28] it you know you're not believing the
[2:15:30] real
[2:15:32] message the message inside the
[2:15:36] message very
[2:15:39] complicated too complicated for this
[2:15:41] Canary
[2:15:43] brain I just I just I'm just reading and
[2:15:46] believing just whatever ever he shows
[2:15:50] me you know we just come under these
[2:15:55] pressures I remember I came as a young
[2:15:57] Christian I came to a time in my
[2:16:01] life and through different
[2:16:05] influences I was trying to figure out
[2:16:07] who's wearing the black hats and who's
[2:16:09] wearing the white
[2:16:13] hats you know in the old western
[2:16:16] movies
[2:16:19] people hadn't watched very much
[2:16:22] movies they're just simple people and
[2:16:25] you know they're going to this western
[2:16:30] movie and you know the the the good guys
[2:16:34] they're upstanding
[2:16:38] citizens and these guys over here they I
[2:16:41] don't know robbed the bank or they're
[2:16:43] stealing someone else's
[2:16:46] cattle
[2:16:48] but you know they get in a big gunfight
[2:16:50] you
[2:16:51] know they're G Corrals you know and and
[2:16:55] they're shooting each
[2:16:57] other and you know the camera is moving
[2:17:00] to this one and that
[2:17:02] one hey you got to know who's
[2:17:05] who well they made it really
[2:17:08] simple and they put the good guys in the
[2:17:10] white
[2:17:12] hats and the bad guys in the
[2:17:16] black
[2:17:18] and you know I got confused in some of
[2:17:21] this teachings and things and I said
[2:17:26] Lord you know because the
[2:17:29] devil he wanted to put black hats on
[2:17:31] people I
[2:17:35] loved he want to start operating in a
[2:17:38] spiritual realm and he want to put black
[2:17:40] Pat on somebody I know that love the
[2:17:46] Lord
[2:17:49] but we don't need to know
[2:17:50] who's you know we don't need black hats
[2:17:53] and white
[2:17:56] hats if we don't
[2:17:58] understand we put it on the
[2:18:01] Shelf Lord you you'll work it
[2:18:03] out Paul said the Lord knows who's his
[2:18:07] own your heart tells you that hey you
[2:18:11] know that might be someone else's
[2:18:15] food but for me right now
[2:18:18] that's not what I'm hungry
[2:18:20] for somehow the Lord that his sheep know
[2:18:23] his
[2:18:29] voice I remember I got to a
[2:18:32] place I'm out in this
[2:18:36] forest and I got my arms around this
[2:18:39] Ponderosa
[2:18:42] Pine and I'm hugging that
[2:18:45] tree and I'm telling the Lord Lord you
[2:18:48] started me on this
[2:18:51] path you're going to have to take me the
[2:18:53] rest
[2:18:54] of hallelujah amen you know and then
[2:18:58] years later all this ecological thing
[2:19:02] about saving
[2:19:06] nature and they started calling this
[2:19:08] group of people they called them Tree
[2:19:13] Huggers I said yeah I know what it is to
[2:19:15] be a tree hug I remember that place I
[2:19:19] came to in my life where I had to
[2:19:21] recommit myself to
[2:19:25] God but i' like to close this
[2:19:30] morning tell you about a
[2:19:34] man he he lived in a farming community
[2:19:39] in the state of
[2:19:46] Vermont and his name was William Bentley
[2:19:50] William Bentley Bentley
[2:19:54] Bentley
[2:19:56] and everyone was Dairy Farmers in his
[2:20:03] community they were all Farmers they got
[2:20:06] up
[2:20:08] early they harvested the hay to feed to
[2:20:11] the
[2:20:14] cows they got up early and they mil milk
[2:20:17] the
[2:20:21] cows and so this required a great
[2:20:24] commitment everybody had to work
[2:20:31] hard but this young boy he really loved
[2:20:36] nature and he get up early in the
[2:20:38] morning
[2:20:41] too and he go notice things in
[2:20:46] nature and uh he got interested in
[2:20:52] snowflakes and he would catch those
[2:20:56] snowflakes and then he tried to make a
[2:20:59] drawing of
[2:21:01] them before they
[2:21:04] melted and he was so interested in the
[2:21:07] pattern of that
[2:21:10] Crystal and there were so many different
[2:21:12] patterns so many different
[2:21:16] kind little book about him is a
[2:21:18] children's
[2:21:20] book and his mother and
[2:21:25] father they spent a great amount of
[2:21:27] money to buy him a special
[2:21:32] camera like a microscopic
[2:21:36] camera and he took a picture of these
[2:21:39] snow
[2:21:42] crystals and he did that for years and
[2:21:46] years and he never saw a snowflake that
[2:21:50] was the same as another
[2:21:54] one all his years of studying
[2:21:58] snow he never saw two snowflakes
[2:22:06] alike now this
[2:22:09] man he became quite a
[2:22:12] photographer and he said you know
[2:22:15] everyone's worried
[2:22:17] about how you know that people get their
[2:22:20] milk get their fresh
[2:22:25] milk they get it up early to make sure
[2:22:28] people have their
[2:22:31] milk he said I get up early
[2:22:35] too but I want to catch a
[2:22:38] picture of some of God's
[2:22:40] creation and he said when I share with
[2:22:43] the people my
[2:22:46] pictures I give them something
[2:22:49] too he said I think they'll get their
[2:22:52] milk all
[2:22:54] right it's not no big
[2:22:57] crime I know everybody around thinks you
[2:22:59] know you got to work very hard and you
[2:23:02] got to milk
[2:23:03] those you got to get with the
[2:23:08] program but I'm
[2:23:10] doing what I
[2:23:12] love and I think I'm giving people
[2:23:16] something
[2:23:18] they'll get their milk
[2:23:20] okay but I'm giving them something
[2:23:24] else now if you've been a
[2:23:27] partaker of the love of
[2:23:30] God if you know what his touch
[2:23:33] is if he's shown you something in his
[2:23:37] word if he's made unto known unto you
[2:23:43] Redemption and real
[2:23:46] Liberty being free from sin
[2:23:49] and you got a little something different
[2:23:51] to
[2:23:55] share the work will get done out
[2:23:58] there but you got something to
[2:24:03] share that they can't
[2:24:05] give and this little man he said I don't
[2:24:08] have no
[2:24:10] shame that I'm
[2:24:16] different
[2:24:18] God gave him that
[2:24:21] gift God made
[2:24:24] him he didn't bow down to all that
[2:24:27] social pressure that
[2:24:30] you you got to milk
[2:24:35] cows he was God's free
[2:24:39] man he was doing what he led to
[2:24:42] do he was sharing something
[2:24:45] else
[2:24:48] oh if you could just
[2:24:51] believe in the finished
[2:24:54] work and know that you're
[2:24:58] clean and know that your
[2:25:02] destination is
[2:25:04] predetermined that's what predestination
[2:25:09] means your
[2:25:11] destination to be with him when he
[2:25:15] comes when he
[2:25:18] we're going to be like him and we're
[2:25:21] going to be where he
[2:25:24] is when he left his Earthly
[2:25:28] Ministry I go to prepare a place for
[2:25:33] you that where I
[2:25:35] am you may be
[2:25:39] also than Lord God bless you this
[2:25:42] morning let's
[2:25:45] together
[2:25:57] brother Braham said
[2:26:02] that Jesus knows how you
[2:26:08] feel and I think many of us
[2:26:11] said well God knows all
[2:26:15] things he's
[2:26:18] omniscient you know he knows everything
[2:26:20] from the beginning to the end that's
[2:26:22] why God
[2:26:24] knows that's how God
[2:26:26] knows brother Braham said oh
[2:26:29] no he said Jesus has another way of
[2:26:35] knowing he knows because he's been in
[2:26:39] your
[2:26:41] shoes
[2:26:42] am you
[2:26:45] know the Lord took two of our children
[2:26:50] home and many people would you know
[2:26:53] being many of my our brothers and
[2:26:55] sisters have been very
[2:26:59] compassionate very
[2:27:04] kind but when someone else has been
[2:27:07] through the same
[2:27:09] thing when they say I know how you
[2:27:14] feel you know they know
[2:27:18] amen and brother R said about the man
[2:27:22] running for
[2:27:23] president he said if he was a
[2:27:26] farmer he said all the farmers will vote
[2:27:29] for that
[2:27:32] man because he knows what it is to be a
[2:27:39] farmer and Jesus knows what you're going
[2:27:44] through because he was in every way
[2:27:48] tempted as you
[2:27:51] are he's got another way of
[2:27:54] knowing because he walked in SHO
[2:27:57] leather isn't that
[2:28:00] wonderful that Our
[2:28:02] Redeemer is our
[2:28:04] brother isn't that wonderful and he has
[2:28:07] redeemed us and made us clean what a
[2:28:11] liberty we should walk
[2:28:14] in God forgive me of my
[2:28:18] unbelief let me believe more now than
[2:28:23] ever and

[2:30:37] hearts it was a word from
[2:30:40] God it was the Holy Spirit speaking to
[2:30:42] us
[2:30:44] here calling us to be God's free
[2:30:48] men God's free
[2:30:51] women a family of God and in our
[2:30:55] troubles and
[2:30:57] struggles we say Lord I
[2:31:00] believe now my
[2:31:05] unbelief I'm a Son of
[2:31:08] God I'm a daughter of God now help me to
[2:31:12] live a life worthy of the Gospel of
[2:31:14] Jesus
[2:31:15] Christ
[2:31:17] Leviticus 25 said after that he is
[2:31:23] sold after we were sold out in
[2:31:27] Genesis after we were sold out at the
[2:31:30] beginning after that we were
[2:31:33] sold Moses said we may be redeemed
[2:31:37] again we don't have to stay in bondage
[2:31:39] and slavery all our
[2:31:43] lives we have a kinsman redeemer
[2:31:46] we have a Brethren not only may he
[2:31:49] redeem
[2:31:50] us but he did redeem us he paid a price
[2:31:55] he did not
[2:31:57] owe we owed a price we could not
[2:32:00] pay Jesus washed our sins away if we can
[2:32:06] believe it we can be that bride without
[2:32:11] spot without
[2:32:13] wrinkle he created man
[2:32:17] he created man because he desired a
[2:32:21] family he desired fellowship with his
[2:32:25] family and it's true the carinal mind is
[2:32:28] the enemy of
[2:32:31] God and that's where we all
[2:32:33] [Music]
[2:32:35] began that's why we must be born
[2:32:40] again I've read it
[2:32:43] before a poem that God gave me many many
[2:32:46] years
[2:32:47] ago and I think it's
[2:32:51] fitting with what our brother Dennis
[2:32:53] brought what the Lord put on his
[2:32:56] heart it goes like this sunrise to
[2:33:02] sunset I will seek your face knowing the
[2:33:07] victory that awaits me when I make you
[2:33:10] first

[2:33:13] wait for
[2:33:15] you in my prayer
[2:33:17] closet where your promises come
[2:33:20] true it's not a busy place where the
[2:33:24] multitudes
[2:33:25] abide it's the secret of your
[2:33:28] Pavilion where bride and groom
[2:33:32] reside I know it's the best
[2:33:35] way and yet I try at
[2:33:37] Last Only to be
[2:33:41] defeated by Satan's ugly
[2:33:45] blast
[2:33:48] I dedicate myself
[2:33:50] again to the prayer closet with my
[2:33:54] friend who listen so
[2:33:57] attent to every word I say but when I
[2:34:01] listen
[2:34:03] quietly to every word he
[2:34:05] speaks it gives me all the strength I
[2:34:09] need to hear him say you're
