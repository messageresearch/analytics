might go to a city of habitation that's talking about is that how the Lord [Music] provided amen how he was [Music] there but notice when they cried out that's what made the difference because they

me God bless you all tonight amen it's good to be here once again worshiping we are worshippers that's what we're called to do that's what burns in our hearts worshiping is a Heart full of Thanksgiving wanting to give thanks to God every time we come and when we give him worship and praise which is which is our first and and Main Pur purpose to come then we're also looking forward that he'll receive our worship and our praise that he'll be so pleased with it he'll be so pleased with it that he'll come down in our midst and touch every heart but it's you that brings him down in worship and praise unto him when you lift up his name when you come because you say Lord I'm going tonight to be amongst the Saints and I want to make it public how thankful I am for all that you've done for me this day for years past for now I can see the leading of your holy hand upon me and I realize now I'm not coming to ask for anything more I'm just coming to thank to give you thanks and you know when you give him thanks from the bottom of your heart for the things he's done for you even this day it pleases him that's right I believe and he comes down because when he's pleased he wants to do one more thing for you you say what what's that one more thing he wants to do for us he wants to give you the desires of your heart in Holiness in Holiness we're uh will'll be leaving tomorrow morning myself and sister Karen heading up to Minnesota it was originally going to be a few little days of rest being with my son and daughter-in-law but uh but my son uh become a Traer and he told the pastor I was coming and the pastor called me and asked if we'd Minister for them on the weekend here so I told Karen there went the vacation but we're thankful to God and we're praying that we can share something that'll be a help to the people there it's it's kind of a heavy burden churches are Ministries are at different stages and there's different things that that particular people are going going through so so we don't want to go and just say something that's that that doesn't relate to the struggles they're they're having we want to say something that God wants us to say just for them you pray for us I believe there's a Saturday and a Sunday service and we'll certainly be remembering here and my brother Jonathan will be ministering on Sunday we we leave tomorrow morning about 10:30 we return back on Monday and uh Lord willing will see you here again uh Wednesday night we have our services coming up um it's the I think the 202nd 23rd Saturday and Sunday with our brother Cosman Stefan Stan and then Lord willing will be having a a New Year's night watch service of which maybe we'll get together with all the the brothers and kind of discuss uh how we'd like to see that service go and and how how we' like to divide it up and let people share whatever is on their hearts and we'll we'll get together later just before that time we're continuing here preaching on part six of marriage and divorce was the title and the subject in the mouth of two or three Witnesses because that's exact exactly how the revelation of this of this teaching is and uh brother Brandon preached the message marriage and divorce and and and God allowed him to show us and bring these loose ends together that it was in the mouth of these three witnesses that that God was going to reveal to us uh this Brokenness amongst the human race and and and things of how to do it correctly and and and and and things of how to help those that are already in a broken condition by the grace of God we continue here in in part six and the three Witnesses was the Lord Jesus himself the Apostle Paul and Moses a prophet of God all three of them prophets Jesus being a god prophet and and yet and and the greatest of all the prophets the Apostle Paul prophet Moses a prophet but to bring these three Witnesses together then once again it also took a prophet but once a prophet brings it together then the book is open and Revelation is Flowing God's people and and though God would take his Prophet home the god of the prophets is still here to continue to open and bring us more revelation details hooking word with word line upon line and we see it all flow together just let's uh read once again the scripture we've been sharing first Thessalonians 4 the Apostle Paul verses 1-7 first Thessalonians 4 and the first verse and it says furthermore then we beseech you Brethren and exhort you by the Lord Jesus that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God so ye would abound more and more for you know what Commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor not in the lust of concupiscence even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any matter because the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forewarned you and testified for God hath not called us unto uncleanness but un to Holiness let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you add your blessing to your word bring Revelation to our hearts that Revelation would bring a growth and that we could grow into the stature of a perfect man in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated Matthew 19 m we begin at verse one Jesus had finished speaking sharing Parables with the people and within those Parables were hidden great mysterious truths that would later be divinely revealed and that divine revelation was to be in our day and it was to be and we were to be that people Matthew 19 verse1 it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these sayings he departed from Galilee and came into the coast of Judea Beyond Jordan and great multitudes followed him and he healed them there it was for the healings and the Miracles that they followed him he he his ministry had changes it had a first pole had a second pole when he would pray for the sick in Matthew 4 and thousands and thousands would gather and hundreds and thousands would be healed then he come to a place where the ministry Ministry shifted went to a higher level he was still praying for the sick but then now he was Discerning the hearts of people also so now they were more cautious they didn't want to be in the prayer line if their sins were going to be found out the word had gone and the ministry had gone to a higher level even as it did in this 20th century with us and verse three says and Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female he got Stern with him he start he they pushed on him he pushed back he said I thought you guys were Bible readers I thought you guys are studying the Scrolls all the time he said because if you have you would have read this part and at the beginning he made them male and female and said and for this cause shall for this word that was written there shall a man leave father and mother and cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more Twain but one flesh then he drops the bomb on them what therefore God had joined together how dare you ministers put it aunder they say unto him why did Moses that great prophet of God Vindicated Prophet command a commandment they tell them to give a writing of divorce and put her away Jesus said that's an easy one that's a very easy question you asked me he said unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts the same thing you're manifesting right now in front of me because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and this is where the language that Jesus used speaking in a parable form mixing the term of wife with the word fornication which seems odd because usually the word fornication would be used for people living in sin who are single people not married but here he uses it concerning the putting away of his wife that he said he says whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication not adultery shall and and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her which is put away doth commit adultery his th disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it's not good to marry if we don't have that right if we can't have that little paper and Pen in Hand to put her away when we want to why would we even want to get married that was the mentality under the law of men Sinners and Saints alike Jews Philistines amorites the entire world but he said unto them all men cannot receive this Revelation save they to whom it is given Jesus speaking Jesus was our first witness one of three for in the mouth of three Witnesses was this teaching made more clear to us Jesus Moses and the Apostle Paul and Jesus in his teaching and speaking to the Pharisees he immediately takes them back to the beginning immediately takes him back to the beginning because that's where he's wanting to take us to is the beginning he took them back there for the teaching but he wants to take us back there for a place where life will be Eternal with him in his presence more than just a teaching in the mouth of two or three Witnesses God was establish l in these truths in Genesis 3 we read of the tribunal the Judgment that that that Came Upon Adam Eve The Serpent and and in verse 16 God speaking to the woman bringing Judgment of the things that will now befall her and what she has brought on her gender and he says unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception it wasn't to be that way in the beginning this was because of the fall and sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children it wasn't supposed to be that way original plan of God he says and thy desire shall be to thy husband because she had also put her desire to another man and he shall rule over thee in the beginning they were co-equal but when Eve fell into this transgression it brought judgment unto her and to all women in this fall and and in the beginning God had made them co-equal the the husband didn't rule over her but now he would rule over her and him being a fallen creature himself that would bring more complications a fallen man a beastly man now ruling over the woman who had fallen also you see the picture we're in today but there is hope and the hope when is when Jesus came to Nicodemus Jesus came to Nicodemus and told him you must be born again to break the curse to break the curse up upon the Earth you must be born again to break the curse that's upon the woman you must be born again break the curse that's upon you for the Earth groans and moans for the manifestation man that can take God at his word break the curse of the family God rich in Mercy and the in the mouth of three Witnesses bringing us this divinely revealed the truth of marriage and divorce in the mouth of three Witnesses Jesus Paul and Moses and brother Branham tied the loose ends together of what Jesus said what Paul said what Moses said in Genesis for Moses was the one that wrote the Book of Genesis and he wrote down the New Covenant that God had given the woman all all three of these men were prophets with thus sayith the Lord and it would require prophetic Ministry to tie them together so the revelation of marriage and divorce once again has come to us in the mouth of three Witnesses Jesus the first witness in in Matthew in M there 19 verse3 the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have ye not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh therefore God ha joined together let no man put us son that's why a prophet said he says You must consider marriage prayerfully that indeed it's God putting this together this making this Union for what God joins together man can never put it aunder but most marriages today isn't God putting it together that's why they're put aunder that's why they're divorced after six months that's why they're divorce after a year that's why they separate after five years that's why some after 25 years they say I'm done we're we're divor in approached prayerfully asking God for a revelation of who will be my partner until death to me part they say unto him why did Moses in command to give a writing a divorcement and put her away and this is a the answer for many things in our lives and he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication the only exception and shall marry another he's talking to the man now committeth adultery and whosoever marri her which is put away do commit adultery his disciples sayto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it's not good to marry because not everybody will marry by Faith by Revelation and base the relationship around the word of God if you're going to have a lasting marriage it's got to be based on God's word the two of you must have the same absolute I guess I guess uh another way to say it is you've got to live by the same rules you got to live by the same book then there'll be peace then there'll be the love of God in your hearts then you'll make wiser decisions then you'll give your marriage 100% because a marriage is not 5050 if the man gives 50 expecting the woman to give 50 that will be a miserable relationship no no the man has to give 100% no matter what the wife is doing regardless you picked her now do her justice you said God gave me this girl now Treat Her Like A Daughter of Zion God never changed the one Commandment that he left for sinner or Saint to abide by so even under polygamy there might be some order and mercy for the woman but God never he says you can't and and and and that mercy and that statement there was a commandment from the beginning from Genesis to the whole human race even in a fallen condition to the man and that was you cannot take another man's wife it pollutes the Earth every time a man does it that still applies today and here is the Bible reason why and this is the woman's New Covenant after the fall a woman is bound to her husband as long as he lives that's the Covenant that the woman is under you say that's not right no it's not right and it wasn't that way in the beginning God made her co-equal with the man the woman broke God's word Ste out from behind the protection of the word of God and brought the fall of all the women brought the fall of of all nature brought the fall of H Genesis 3:16 unto the woman he said I'll greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception sorrow Thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband now we understand why all those things were said because because her desire had been to another other than her husband and that's what had broken that family bond that's what broke her fellowship and friendship with the father and then he said and he shall rule over thee from now on God made them co-equal that is still God's desire for the man and for the woman that the only ruler you'll ever have the only guide you'll ever need is him when a woman accepts a man's proposal for marriage a lot of this we are backgrounding we've done it every Service as we try to connect it all so when a woman accepts a man's proposal for marriage if she has a head at home a father at home he he has helped her to to choose a righteous God-fearing man that's what a father should do that's his responsibility is to be a Watchman in the tower of his house that's the things he to be watching for we must help our daughters choose we want them to marry a man they love but we as fathers must be involved to judge of the man is worthy when our daughters marry we we turn over full headship to another man you can't fix it once you've given her away you do wrong to get into their business once you give them away your business is not to give her away until you find the right Godly [Music] Man we turn over full headship I understand that a young man asking you to marry your daughter he has no idea the responsibility he's asking for and most fathers have no idea what they're giving away full Authority and power over that young lady you're giving it all away it's got to mean something to you we've got to take it seriously we've got to we've got to see how the the longl lasting effects it'll have on how long we say sometimes all our lives on planet Earth it's serious it can mean the difference between happiness in a home or a house of hell so we turn our we turn over full headship to another man and she is bound to that man as long as he lives if they divorce dear sister you cannot by the word of God remarry unless he dies or you find yourself to be an adulteress and he finds himself to be an adulterer is it fair as we would say as human beings is fair no it's not but God Made You co-equal with man he's not the one that put put us into this world of sin he simply gave us free moral agency to choose between right and wrong because he didn't want a people that were his puppets he went out he wanted a family that loved him and served him because they loved him Lucifer Luci through the serpent Lucifer enticed Lucifer anointed this this beast called The Serpent that beguiled Eve first with his words and Disobedience to God's word aned Eve's first Covenant where she was co-equal and gave her a covenant that was now equal to her conduct the Bible says all that we sow we reap Matthew 19:7 they say unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing a divorcement and put her away Jesus said the why doesn't lay on the woman no no the why for the for the for the writing of divorcement lays on the man and in verse eight he saith unto him Moses because the hardness of your hearts suffered you to put away your wives because of you hard-hearted men who really weren't worthy of the daughters of Zion but from the beginning it wasn't so and then he goes in verse 9 again and I say unto you who whoever shall put away his wife except it be for [Music] fornication remember there's now Jesus is saying there's only one reason one why a man could put away his wife and the big question and marry again only one reason Jesus they had any reason before for 4,000 years and Jesus Takes It All Away like that because what they had was a proverb and Proverbs can and will be annuled this wasn't the first one his disciples say unto him he say and and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever Marth her which is put away do commit adultery his disciples say unto him if if the case of man be so with his wife it's not good to marry remember it's it's one cause not two fornication not fornication and adultery that gives you a right to remarry because then that would be two causes two reasons and Jesus didn't give two he gave one so Jesus is now opening the book that's been sealed with Seven Seals and telling you now the truth of marriage and divorce he he said I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever marrieth her which is put away does commit adultery so Jesus now tells us despite many opinions there's only one exception for a man to put away his wife sinner or Saint preacher or a hell's Angel's [Music] biker it doesn't matter if you're a Believer or an unbeliever because God will judge This World by One Thing by the word of God Jesus Christ every man every woman will be judged by the word of God sin or Saint ignorant or aware one day before God all will stand and be judged by the very same word w won't be a different measuring stick for anybody so Jesus now tells us there's just one exception for a man to put away his wife and Mar another that's fornication now the great debate we have the many schools of what does fornication mean you won't find it through reasoning you won't find it in any dictionary not even a Bible dictionary we will find the definition back in Genesis of what Jesus meant when he said except that be for fornication so what happened in Genesis that reveals the statement that Jesus made Eve before before she's intimate with her husband has an intimate relationship with this most subtile beast of the field the serpent who to look at was a man the most subtile beast of the field and he plants a seed in her womb and it brings forth a Cain the son of the wicked what has she done she is a damsel who has surrendered her virginity to another man with whom she had no intention of marrying then approaches Adam who is unaware of her condition who is who is her betroth [Music] husband now both their eyes are open and equally ashamed Eve was a damsel and a virgin with a betroth husband in other words engaged to be married a woman betro she was Adam's wife but they had not lived together intimately just like Joseph and Mary Mary was Joseph's wife but yet they had not been together and lived together as husband and wife according to the Jewish religion their culture their rituals that when a man when a woman accepted a proposal for marriage from a man then in Jewish culture she was that man's wife already she was the bride she was now to have a time of preparation to Adorn herself get her wedding dress ready for the day when they would have a public display their display their their their their their their vows one to another then Joseph would take Mary to live with him forever it's a type and the shadow of we the bride of Christ we ministered on that are we the bride or we the wife well according to the Eastern culture the bride was the wife preparing adorning herself getting her wedding dress ready for the wedding day when the husband would come and take her away you see the type and Shadow of the bride of Christ of a Rapture so when are we the Lamb's wife we already the Lamb's wife we the Lamb's bride we are now the bride of Christ so who is this bride this bride is the wife who is adorning herself and getting her wedding dress ready what do that mean adorning herself preparing her wedding day this is what it means repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy and that Holy Ghost experience will lead you and guide you it will bring you to be justified by faith it'll it'll urge you you want to live a holy life and be Sanctified by the spirit it'll bring you to a higher level to a friendship with the father that when you pray you know he hears because you've heard from him before being adorned getting your wedding dress ready for a catching away for a Rapture the last change what is a bride she is the wife being changed from Glory glor glor from Faith to Virtue to patience to Temperance to knowledge to brotherly kindness to the Capstone of the love of God do you see it are you his wife now you are we're still in this body of Flesh so we're wanting to go through these stages of changes to get get to the final change a body change the wedding where the groom catches you away to the wedding supper of the Lamb to live with him eternally Eve was a damel and a virgin betroth to a husband his name was Adam she was Adam's wife but they had not lived together intimately today we would say they were engaged this is the fornication that Jesus spoke of that a man could leave his wife and marry another this is the one exception it's the decision that Joseph had made with Mary when they found that Mary was great with child and he knew it wasn't his child because the wedding day hadn't come yet they had not lived together so he thought that Mary if she was his child then she's been with another man she gave away her sacred virtue to another man now Moses had now now Joseph had a new testament right to put his wife away and marry another here in Genesis this is the fornication that Jesus spoke of why a man could leave his wife and marry another and this is the one exception before Adam knew his wife intimately Eve had already defiled herself with another partner and Adam knew it not even Eve hid it from him until his eyes came open then God descended to judge them a white Throne judgment in this judgment the serpent the Beast is cursed in its physical body where it's where it's not would be now unrecognizable it will never be capable again of defiling a woman but it has already planted his seed of every Wicked attribute that it has and the family of God has been genetically modified in the beginning this GMO stuff is nothing new since the beginning science has just not been breaking into it the last 100 years maybe because Lucifer's been anointing them because it if it destroyed the first family and brought down the human race then he's playing the same games over and over again just as Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and when you see him do something and honor Faith you can be sure that if you meet those [Music] requirements he'll honor your faith again well Satan works the same way also the definition of fornication that Jesus spoke of is found in the act that Eve committed against her husband Adam before they ever knew each other intimately Even Adam were husband and wife but had never cohabitated they had never entered into an intimate relationship therefore in Genesis 3 when Eve was meeting with the serpent she's a virgin a damn and she was another man's wife Eve in Genesis 3 is Virgin and yet Adam's wife according to Old Testament customs of the Jews marriages were arranged by Elders many times of both families with a consent of the girl if she was of age I say that because many a Jewish men sold their daughters without their consent once they entered into the agreement whether whether the girl was bought or the intention was to be part to be the man's wife from the beginning but once they entered into the agreement they were they were considered man and wife in all legal and religious aspects legal and religious except that of cohabitation living together so to be betr was to contract an actual but but incomplete marriage once betr there was a waiting period sometimes as much as 12 months not always but when the marriage was being taken was was was was was between a free woman of Israel A Daughter of Zion then there' be a waiting period as much as 12 months and then the wedding ceremony where man and wife would have a public ceremony and from that day on lived together thus now the marriage complete and the father turns over full head ship to another man until then the father holds full headship and he could even annul the betral once married he has no more headship over his daughter once married dad you have no more headship over the the daughter you must go to her head if you think something you want to make a recommendation that's hard to swallow no it's my daughter and if I want to tell her something and that guy don't like it no no we've got to go back to the word not to our emotions not to our feelings if we don't like it there there is a way to get out of it Jesus said the way to get out you must be born again that's the start to get us out of this condition to get us out of this body and into a theophany into a Celestial body back to the beginning in Deuteronomy 22 and verse 22 it says this if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband then they shall both of them die both the man that lay with the woman and the woman so shall thou put away evil from Israel remember the parable in the of Jesus Pharisees and men brought a woman to him cast her on the ground and he said this woman we caught her in the very Act of adultery Moses said she ought to be stoned the Bible says he said nothing and he began writing on the ground the Bible says one by one the men left they knew the law my guess is Jesus wrote here is the woman but where is the man and they go verse 23 says if a damsel see if a if a man be found lying with a woman married to a husband then they shall both of them die both the man that layeth with the woman and the woman so shall thou put away evil from Israel if a damsel that is a virgin be betr unto a man and a man find her in the city and lie with her verse 22 sounds like it's just repeating verse 23 but one is a woman married in other words their wedding day they've already had it this is past the engagement past the time of adorning this this is after the wedding takes place publicly but verse 23 says if a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto a husband engaged they have not been together yet and a man find her in the city and lie with her then you shall bring them both out into the gate of the city and you shall Stone them with stones that they die the damel because she cried not being in the city and the man because Heath humbled his neighbor's wife so Thou shalt put away evil from among you today we have a similar process called being engaged your your fiance it's an old French word simply meaning a man or a woman engaged to be married so Eve here in Genesis was a damsel a virgin betrothed unto a husband Adam and another man finds her in the garden and convinces her of a shortcut and they commit an intimate act with a serpent the most subtile beast of the field before she ever is with her husband Adam she was a woman betr she was a bride who who was supposed to be preparing for her wedding day and she gave her sacred trust to another that's the fornication that Jesus was speaking of this scripture interprets that word for us we'll stop here marriage and divorce in our day in the mouth of three Witnesses Jesus Moses and the Apostle Paul as we stand to our feet God rich in Mercy brother Kenny was singing a song Today sister Abby could you
