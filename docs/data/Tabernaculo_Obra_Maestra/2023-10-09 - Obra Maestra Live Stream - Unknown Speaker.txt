us further each day but God who is rich in Mercy how many have needs how how many needs something from the Lord each time in the Bible we see when there's someone that was in need let me tell you when Jesus came and got involved everything else changed but when Jesus came in the presence ears started opening eyes started to see people fell on their knees it makes a difference when Jesus is in the house and you believe with all your heart that Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's in this house amen he's in this house in the heart amen there's many needs there's a brother in New Mexico his uh daughter's baby she's in uh a condition where she they need prayer my dad's older brother passed away and if we could just remember all them in prayer amen if we can stand up amen my subject that I'd like to speak on today is he's in the house now and Mark and chapter 5 let's all bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we come together here to hear your word Lord we believe oh Lord God open up to us the scriptures we believe that you're in this house Lord we believe that you're in the house where brother Daniel is too Lord Lord we just thank you we ask that you just help us all here today oh that our faith may may be edified we know that you're here today with us forgive us for everything that we've done Lord and we put everything in your hands in Jesus name amen amen it says in Mark in Chapter 5 Verse 22 it says and behold there cometh one of the rulers of the synagogue gyrus right gyrus by the name when he saw him he fell his feet and besought him greatly saying my little girl lith at the point of death I pray come and lay hands on her and she may be healed and she shall live it says and Jesus went with him much people followed him and thronged him amen amen and then we can go down to verse 35 it says well yet he spake there came rulers of the synagogue's house certain which said thy daughter is dead why troubles thou Master any further so someone's daughter was in need amen and he went to Jesus asking him to come and touch his daughter and while they're on the way other people come they go to that the the girl's dad and say your daughter's dead amen how hard that could have been to hear how tough that could have been to take in but the Bible says on 36 he says as soon as Jesus heard heard the word that was spoken from those men he said to the rulers of the synagogue 36 be not afraid but only believe amen because they gave him tough news but the Bible says that Jesus heard what they were saying and he said be not afraid but only Bel amen amen 37 says and he suffered no man to follow him sa Peter James and John and the brother of James and he come to the house of the rulers of the synagogue and they seen the tomal and them that wept and welled greatly 38 in verse 39 it says and when he come in he says unto him why make it she Aldo and Weep the damsel is not dead but sleepeth amen you may have your seats but after he had told him that she wasn't dead but she's that she's sleeping the Bible says in verse 40 that they laughed at him because they couldn't believe that she could have just been sleeping amen amen the Bible says in first Thessalonians in chapter 4 and verse 13 says but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope says for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that that which that we which are alive remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep 15 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with the shout and with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first amen that sounds like a resurrection to me amen amen that sounds like a resurrection to me if you could turn with me to John in chapter 11 again at verse one it says now a certain man was sick named Lazarus of Bethany the town of Mary and her sister and Martha and it was that Mary which was anointed of the Lord with that aned the Lord with anointment and wiped his feet with her hair whose brother Lazarus was sick therefore his sister said unto him saying Lord behold he whom thou lovest is sick and when Jesus heard that he said the sickness is not unto death but for the glory of God that the Son of God may be glorified thereby he said now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus when he had heard therefore that she was sick he bought it two days still in the same place where he was Amen brother Brown says in the resurrection the message the resurrection of La Lazarus he says then when these things began to take place Mary and Martha they sent and said have Jesus come back and pray for him pray for Lazarus amen and Jesus just ignored their call Jesus just ignored their call and he went to another city further away and well then they sent again and he still ignored their call and they sent again and he kept going he turned around and said our friend Lazarus is sleepest and he said what he really was he said he said if he sleep that his discipl said if he sleepeth he doeth well but then Jesus tell his disciples he had a Time plainly he had a time in the regular language he said that Lazarus was dead and he said for your sake I'm glad I wasn't there but I go awake him he said watch at the grave see God had already showed him he says I'll go wake him amen you see now the first day passed previous things had had come in and got Lazarus they took him say they embalmed his body took him and buried him they put him in the grave all hope was gone but the second day passed it was still dark the third day passed corruption sat in his body the fourth day had come and and had done it was gone then the first thing you know somebody come that little Martha and Mary sitting at home there crying the bread bread winners was gone and they had left look look everything was gone they gave it says now that man that had had their confidence which was Jesus seemly have betrayed [Music] them he said all hope was gone their brother was dead they they they turned out their church this man was teaching Divine Healing and their Pastor he was gone said all hope was gone see but about that time when they felt like all hope was gone about that time is when Jesus came that usually what happens he comes in the darkest hour it was the darkest hours but then Jesus came along when they started to feel like all hope was gone many people were there talking to them saying your brother is dead he's gone he ain't coming back so they maybe they're listening to that negative stuff amen but you see Jesus was coming to the house and where there is no hope hope was walking in their way amen if we can just realize that we get put in situations where it seems like there's no hope but yet watch when Jesus comes along just as Jesus came along there they came and called Jesus he didn't come he didn't come again he didn't come again but the Bible says everything works works good for those that were called according to his purpose he was working it for their good just like when we go through something he's working it for our good oh we can complain we can say why is this happening why is is happening we know why is it happening because you're called you're called to be Sons and Daughters of the Living God so we should rejoice when we're going through something so tough we're going through something so hard they we're going through a tough time imagine a person that you love God forbid my daughter one of your sons brother Kenny imagine you're out you're you're away imagine that you you're calling for someone to come and touch them and they had not come for a few days but then something ends up happening and the child dies amen amen then it's like oh the way you feel but I'll tell you what that's how they were feeling amen but when Jesus came in the picture everything changed right it wasn't the same way anymore in John 11:19 amen it says that many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother then Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus was coming amen as soon as she heard Jesus was coming to that house amen she went and met him and Mary sat still in the house then said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died amen but I like the attitude of her look in the next verse she says but I know that even now amen amen oh God help us to to be just like her that when the situation seemed so hard oh man when she seen Jesus coming she said Lord even if my brother is the way he is even if everybody's telling me all these things but I know even now amen I know even now she believed in Jesus she believed that what he can do she said I know even now whatsoever thou will ask of God God will give it to thee and Jesus said unto her thy brother shall rise again Martha said unto him oh I know he he will rise but again in the resurrection at the last day oh I like that amen she said I I know even right now and Jesus says uh he'll Rise Again amen she didn't doubt she said I know he will but in the resurrection in the last day but God saying she'll rise right now because when he responded to her Jesus looks at her and said I am the resurrection amen and I and the life and he that believeth in me though were he were dead yet shall he live and whosoever and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die he says believest Thou this she said to she said unto him she said unto him yes Lord I believe that thou are the Christ of son of Son of God which should come into the world and when she had said she went her way and called Mary her sister secretly saying the master is come amen I like that amen all that stuff they were going through everything that was happening before Jesus got there amen but when Jesus got there she said the master has come we can say that this morning to any trouble that we have we could just look at this devil look at the sicknesses look at all the things going around said I'm not afraid the the master has come the master is com in their midst look what happens when the master has come the master has come to Martha the master came to that little girl and as he was with them the master has come to us in this day to heal us of our sicknesses to give us a new life a new meaning amen amen I like when she says that amen the Bible says in verse 29 says as soon as she heard that she Rose quickly and came unto him now Jesus was not yet come into the town but was in a place where Martha met him and the Jews then which were with her in the house and comfort her when they saw Mary that she rose up hastily and went out and followed her saying she goeth up to the Grave we in there and then when Mary was come where Jesus was and saw him she fell down at his feet and said unto him Lord if thou had been here my brother had not died and when Jesus therefore saw her weeping and the Jews were also weeping which came with her which came with with her he groaned in the spirit and was troubled amen he felt their concerned he cared about their need he came into that that same feeling that she was feeling and Jesus still feels that way when he sees you in your kns that you have when he sees you crying out this scripture here when he heard their weeping is causing him to groan amen amen that's why the Bible says cast your cares upon Him for he cares upon you that says right there that Jesus cared for them he was coming to the same feeling that she was feeling and Jesus went he was feeling that way verse 34 he says Where Have ye laid him they said Lord come and see Jesus wept the Bible says then said the Jews behold how he loved him and someone said could not this man which opened the eyes of a blind have caused that even this man should not have died Jesus therefore again groaning in himself come to the grave and it was a cave and a stone laid upon it and Jesus said take away the stone Martha and the sister of him that was dead dead said unto him Lord by this time he stinketh I'm just so happy he's not going to sneak no more why because a master came there he was in the house for he he says for he had been dead four days and Jesus said unto her said I not unto thee if thou wouldest would wouldest believe thou shall see the glory of God then they took away the Stone from the place where the dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his eyes and said father I thank thee that thou has heard me and I know that thou hears me always but because of the people which stand by that they may believe that thou has sent me and when he thus has spoken amen now look what happens when he's in the house many people were there amen that probably told them a negative report that told them that your brother is gone amen amen but see Jesus came things when Jesus comes in the picture the Bible says that With God all things are possible amen amen and what happened they told him look your brother's gone he ain't coming back amen amen a lot of unbelief going on but here is Jesus now he comes to the tomb said take away that stone and the Bible says that when he had spoken he cried with the he cried with a loud voice and said Lazarus come forth amen amen 44 it says and he that was dead came forth and bound in hand and foot with Graven clothes and his face was bound with the napkin Jesus said unto him loose him and let him go am man he wasn't dead no more but Jesus said that he was sleeping you see he was in Christ amen and Jesus went and called him and said Lazarus come forth you see a difference a difference see when she said the master has come say even now even now I know whatever you ask he will give it to you amen and look at Jesus he comes and someone that was dead for days corruption sat in the body amen the skin were started to eat up his body he started to look different but see when the master came when Jesus was in the house he said Lazarus come forth and when he came forth he had all these old clothing on him he said Laz you don't look good with that he said take that clothing off of him because he's a new man a mean he's came forth he doesn't have that old all that old stuff on him he man get rid of it loose that off of him amen I'll tell you what oh that God will come and loose every bad thing off of us just like as he rose Lazarus up that he could raise a son and daughter of God in this last day that they can come forth and Lord thank you that I can get rid of all this wethy clothing and come forth with a new set of clothing you know what God does with that old clothing he throws it in the sea of forgetfulness it doesn't exist anymore amen amen well that's what happened with that little girl amen when Jesus came he said that she was just sleeping and they laughed at him they're like oh she ain't just sleeping all the phys the Physicians came they pronounced her dead they said she's dead she's not sleeping I don't know what you're talking about I don't know who you are but she we felt her pul she's gone they said she was only sleeping the Bible says that they laughed at him they laughed at him hard amen they laugh at him so hard but you see they had to put everyone else outside all the unbelievers had to go and he invited some of his disciples in amen amen oh praise the Lord but you see he took that Mom and Dad he went where that little girl was laying amen and where she was l Jesus went up to that little girl touched her and said to her arise amen and she arose and that little girl wasn't sleeping anymore and all those people that were laughing seen a little girl come to life amen amen what was it the master came God was in that house amen and where that little girl was lying you see life came back into that house but that house that was full of Darkness you see when Jesus comes that house which was full of Darkness became a house that was full of light amen and light came back to that dark that girl she woke up she hugged her mom and dad D and her mom and dad hugged her and all those that were laughing they weren't laughing anymore cuz they seen that the master came to that house amen amen you see that same God came to Lazarus told him to come forth amen was the same God come forth why because he is the resurrection he is the life and he brought life into that little girl Bible says she was 12 years old can't imagine like your your your young child dies or she gets really sick you imagine being in that those parents position so hurt cuz you look at your child but then you see the master come and life comes back into your child if I had been that Dad and Mom I don't know I think I would have just ran everywhere in that house saying praise the Lord I tell you Life came back into me amen when I was out there full of Darkness amen amen the Bible says that the devil cometh not but to steal kill and destroy he tried to take me out well brother Bram says what's the strongest part of a man's body he said it's his back and his legs amen amen the Bible talks about when the Sheep got lost that he went from those 0 from the 99 and went from that one but when he found that sheep he stuck it on his back which was the strongest part of his body and went back rejoicing amen amen and that's what God has done with us once we were lost but he put us on his shoulders took us back to the Sheepfold why because we are his children amen man we are his children you know was something else you know before Jesus he came to that little girl while he was on the way coming to her he ran into that womb with the blood issue amen amen the Bible says that in Mark 525 it said a certain woman which had a blooded issue for 12 years and has suffered many things of many Physicians and had spent all that she had it was nothing and and nothing better but rather grew [Music] worse amen I'm sure those same Physicians she she visited were probably the same Physicians that came to that little girl amen amen man those Physicians I don't know them but they must have a testimony going to visit sick people then going to visit a gam and they're not sick amen amen but she spent all of her living all of her money the Bible says that it just got worse and her situation got worse but it says that when she heard of Jesus Amen she heard that he came near man let me just okay she heard that he came in and pressed behind him she heard that he you see she heard that he was in the house she heard that he came near and while she was sitting there where at she touched His Garment and the Bible says for she said if I may just touch His Garment I shall be whole amen and straight away the Fountain of her blood was dried up and she felt in her body that she was healed of that plague and Jesus was wondering who touched me amen she came she came to him and fell on her knees and Jesus looks at her said that thy faith has made thee whole amen amen but see that that lady she recognized when God was in the house and when she recognized God was in the house she got determined that she was going to receive her healing she said that even if he can't lay hands on me I'm going to lay my hands on him just His Garment if I touch it this Blood issue I had for 12 years that's getting worse will be gone why because Jesus was in the house amen amen amen and she touched it and all that problem that she had went away so that we can get determined like that lady get determin like that sister amen and recognize that God is in this house you know that's what the devil battles us with he wants us to fill soul so so asleep in the spirit that we can't even recognize when we're in the presence of God amen amen he wants us to be numb to the spirit but see God loves his children amen amen devil ain't stronger than God why because the Bible said greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen that's what we we have to recognize is when we're in the presence of God and when we're in the presence of God ask him what you will just like Jesus said when he said Don't Fear he told him don't fear after they gave him that report he said only believe amen amen that all things are possible only believe amen amen look at the Hebrew children you could turn to uh Daniel 3:14 you know right here Nebuchadnezzar he was a king and he said up a gold image and we know that brother brandom he teaches us that that gold image was their own brother was Daniel and this Nebuchadnezzar wanted him them to worship this gold image and he gave a Commandment that when they hear start hearing this music that they should Bow Down and Worship this image but you see in this very moment the sad the sad scene that we see is that when the music sound many Hebrews many people bowed down they began to worship this image but see there was three there that weren't going to worship this image amen it didn't matter if it was their own brother and they had a good relationship with Daniel but see they knew that they only worshiped God they only they know that God was the only one that answers the prayers why because they had an experience with God they seen God In Action amen amen and after after the music sounds and all these Hebrew children bow down yet there is Shakra mesach and abedo they didn't bow down and the King's servant see that oh they go by they go they went crying to their King oh King Nebuchadnezzar you gave a commandment and these guys didn't listen you see Nebuchadnezzar he uh everybody was afraid most people majority people were afraid of him see Nebuchadnezzar he felt now see when he went places maybe people fell straight to their feet because he knew that people feared him and so then he goes take me to them and the Bible says in verse 14 that Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is this true oh Shakra mhach and Abednego Daniel 3:14 do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up now if if you be ready that the time when you hear the sounds all the music ye Fall Down and Worship this image which I have made but if you don't worship you shall be cast into the same hour into the midst of a burning fire furnace a man watch this he says and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands he was questioning God he said who is that God that should deliver you out of my hands because he believed he was so powerful that no one could beat him amen and look at what Shak M and Abednego said they answered and said to this king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer this matter we don't got to think what to say they had wisdom don't get me wrong but in a way they're not having to be careful and pick words what they need to say to him so they don't get punished we said if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning Fury fiery furnace Fury furnace 17 and he will and he will deliver us out of thy hand oh King oh I like I like these brothers I'm telling you when I when I get to that side I like to meet them oh talk with them it's going to be a nice day it says but if if but if let me just read that again he says if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace and he will deliver us out of the hand O King but if it not be be it known unto thee Oh King that we will not serve th thy Gods nor worship the gold image which thou Hast set up after what he just said I'll burn your bodies I will burn your bodies and they had such a faith that they're like we're not going to answer you careful just letting you know we're going to tell you how it is and this is how we're going to tell you we're not going to worship your image and our God's going to deliver us but it be so that that that that say he doesn't we're not going to serve your Gods regardless of what you think you may scare everybody else but you ain't scaring us amen amen amen the Nebuchadnezzar he was mad Bible says in 19 he was full of Fury amen and from the form of his uh Visage was was changed against Shakra mesak and abedo therefore he spake and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it than it won't that was to be heated you see and he commanded the most Mighty Men let me tell you they they must have been mighty men to them strong men men that the king had confidence in men that he sent on the front battles men that he said no one no one can touch these men I have confidence in these men he so he commanded these these most mighty men that were in his army to bind M and abendego and to cast them into the burning FY fiery furnace in verse 22 it says therefore because a king command commandment was urgent you see the the the furnace was exceedingly hot but look what it says the flame of that fire slew those men kill those men kill those mighty men that he had confidence in was supposed to be the very top guys and the fire just got close to them and killed them amen amen amen it killed those that took Shakra mhak and abedo it's a true statement lay lay not your hands on my anointed that's what they did they bind them up then they burned God's about his word amen so you see Shakra mhak and abedo they're going to that fire seven times more hotter amen it was super hot be see by Faith they saw the Fourth Man in that furnace by by faith he seen that that Jesus was in the house that he came into their midst and they said that our God is able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace brother Brown says that they seen the Unseen they seen that uh is that fiery or F Fury they seen that fiery furnace and what did they do they seen the Fourth Man Standing in it Fanning the breeze away from them therefore they wasn't afraid of that fiery furnace amen they they realized that Jesus the master has come they realized I can walk in this trouble cuz I know that he is with me amen and what happened after that happened verse 24 the neuch conure the King was astonished and he rose up in haste and and spake to them and said to his counselors did not we cast three men Bound in the midst of that fire they answer said to King that's true oh King and he answered said lo I see the Fourth Man Loose walking in the midst of that fire and he saw that the fire didn't hurt him and then they see that the form of the fourth is like the Son of God oh even Nebuchadnezzar seeing that God was in their house even Nebuchadnezzar seeing that the master that they had so much confidence in came down in that fire to be with his servants cuz God was working everything for their good amen amen in verse 27 amen it says the princes and the governors and the captains and the King's counselors began to gather together and they saw these mens upon the whose bodies the fire had no power nor were there a hair the a hair of their head head singled neither were their coats changed nor smell like fire had passed on them amise God Amen that fire that had passed on them wow their clothes weren't touched their hair wasn't gone they realized oh wow they realized see when when God is in the presence amen that King and all those those governors counselors and all them they saw that the power had no I mean the fire had no effect on them amen amen but see that's how it is when you can believe that God is in your midst amen just like they believe God was in their midst amen they seen that the fire had no power on them amen but look what he says in 28 remember before he says and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands amen God wanted to change his mind oh you have confidence in that huh go ahead throw my servants in there I will come down and be with them and look what it says in verse 28 and Nebuchadnezzar spake and said blessed be the god of Shakra Meshach and abedo who has sent his Angel and delivered his servants so at first he said who is that God that should deliver deliver you out of my hands you see in that very God he was talking about now he was calling him blessed he was calling him blessed and he made a decree there amen you see what happens when you're in the presence of God it's like Daniel looking at the Unseen he knew that there is Angel of fire who stood between him and those Lions oh when he got thrown in the Lion's Den you see we hear of of what happened with these Believers would you ever once put yourself in that situation like imagine we can say like you know oh man amen like if I if I were in that day I would believe and that would happen and praise God but you see imagine me put into a a f a a den with lions that are going to tear your body to Pieces amen but you see Daniel he wasn't afraid he knew that God was going to come in his midst amen amen you see he knew that the master was going to come and what happened he was looking at the Unseen and he seen that the that that Pillar of Fire stood between the him and the lions and those Lions couldn't do nothing to him we know that that form the pillar of Fire is Jesus Christ so Jesus Christ was standing between him and the Lions amen I like that one song won't you come on over to the winning sides The Winning Side let's talk about Jesus we got a banner held high we're God's Mighty Army amen amen but you see these these in that song it said Daniel said that these Lions they can't hurt me cuz I'm on the winning side and those Lions couldn't hurt him amen I'll be closing now amen we I'll stand up you know sometimes the services are long and sometimes they're short but you have to go exactly what God gives you amen that's how you know you know what I mean so you never know there might be a three-hour day so so we love these days too amen amen do you remember blind barus like
