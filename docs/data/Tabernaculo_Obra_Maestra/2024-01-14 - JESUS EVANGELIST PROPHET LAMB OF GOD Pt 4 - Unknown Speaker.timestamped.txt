[42:15] uh just wanted to let you
[42:17] [Music]
[42:19] know I just wanted to say one thing
[42:22] before we sing this song um I've I've
[42:25] always believed that
[42:27] that the
[42:32] god what made God God to me was not that
[42:35] he created this whole world but that he
[42:38] humbled
[42:40] himself and
[42:43] uh that's what makes
[42:46] God I would say to me that's the
[42:50] greatest thing that I I wouldn't say
[42:52] it's the greatest thing the love is the
[42:54] greatest but but the humility to me is
[42:57] just a great attribute knowing how great
[42:59] he
[43:00] is um we just wanted to say that
[43:03] because I believe that that's
[43:08] what we need in our lives is just to
[43:11] keep ourselves humble before the
[43:14] Lord we just want to sing this song uh
[43:18] and I'm sure you know it we just want to

[58:44] come we really are
[58:47] worshippers we come to
[58:50] worship we we we come to wash his
[58:53] feet just like that little
[58:57] lady uh a woman of uh of of of of a bad
[59:02] reputation but she seen
[59:05] Jesus walk into a a a house of one of
[59:09] the of of one of the
[59:13] Pharisees one of the
[59:15] priests but she as she as she peeed
[59:18] through the
[59:21] fancing she she saw that they were not
[59:24] making him
[59:26] welcome like they did all the other
[59:30] guests but she realized that it was
[59:33] Jesus and she realized that it was that
[59:37] that this same
[59:39] Jesus had
[59:41] forgiven a woman just like
[59:44] her a woman who had been caught in the
[59:47] very
[59:50] Act of adultery a woman that that that
[59:54] that that the priest and the Levites had
[59:56] brought to
[59:59] Jesus and they said this woman was
[1:00:01] caught in the very Act of
[1:00:05] adultery what should he said what does
[1:00:08] Moses say we should do to
[1:00:10] her what does the law
[1:00:12] say and the Bible says that
[1:00:15] Jesus he took his
[1:00:18] finger he took his hand and he began
[1:00:21] writing on the
[1:00:23] dirt
[1:00:25] it doesn't say what he
[1:00:27] wrote but by one by
[1:00:30] one all the
[1:00:33] accusers walked
[1:00:35] away and the woman looked up
[1:00:39] and and
[1:00:43] wondered and Jesus told her go and sin
[1:00:48] no more cuz we're not under the law no
[1:00:52] more the penalty for for being caught in
[1:00:56] sin if you
[1:00:58] repent the penalty now is not
[1:01:02] death but it can now be eternal
[1:01:05] life oh what a
[1:01:08] paradox when the Covenant
[1:01:10] changed from the old to the new that we
[1:01:14] could be
[1:01:15] delivered we could be
[1:01:17] forgiven we could be
[1:01:19] changed we could be
[1:01:21] quickened God could then even transform
[1:01:24] us
[1:01:26] this whole body of
[1:01:27] Flesh to a theop to a Celestial body oh
[1:01:33] do you love him this
[1:01:34] morning turn with me in your bibles if
[1:01:37] you
[1:01:40] would and we'll go to Luke
[1:01:51] 13 Luke chapter 13
[1:01:56] and verse
[1:02:04] 32 Luke
[1:02:08] 13:32 and it reads like
[1:02:11] this and he said unto them go ye and
[1:02:14] tell that
[1:02:18] fox behold I cast out
[1:02:21] devils and I do cures to
[1:02:25] today
[1:02:27] one and
[1:02:29] tomorrow two and the third
[1:02:33] day I shall be
[1:02:37] perfected it was three polls of a
[1:02:41] Ministry it was three stages of the
[1:02:43] ministry of
[1:02:45] Messiah amongst the Min amongst the
[1:02:48] positions that he would manifest in
[1:02:51] these three
[1:02:53] stages
[1:02:56] he says he says I do cures
[1:02:59] today I begin as an
[1:03:02] evangelist praying for the sick and
[1:03:06] tomorrow and I'll continue doing it
[1:03:08] through my second
[1:03:11] poll but in the third
[1:03:13] pole I shall be
[1:03:15] perfected and so will my little
[1:03:18] bride at the end
[1:03:21] time nevertheless I must walk to today
[1:03:24] and tomorrow and the day following I
[1:03:28] have to walk through these stages of the
[1:03:35] ministry for it cannot be that a prophet
[1:03:38] perish out of
[1:03:42] Jerusalem and his style of preaching in
[1:03:44] a
[1:03:46] parable he was speaking and he was
[1:03:49] telling them what would what would take
[1:03:52] place for this Parable was a
[1:03:56] prophecy and this and this and this
[1:03:59] Prophet would perish in
[1:04:02] Jerusalem but this was more than a
[1:04:05] Prophet this was more than the messenger
[1:04:07] to a church
[1:04:09] age this was God
[1:04:12] Messiah this was the Lamb of God this
[1:04:15] was the prophet of prophets he said oh
[1:04:18] Jerusalem
[1:04:20] Jerusalem which killest the prophets and
[1:04:24] Don as them that are sent unto
[1:04:27] thee how often would I have gathered thy
[1:04:29] children
[1:04:32] together as a hen doth gather her
[1:04:35] brood under her wings and you would
[1:04:40] not Jesus said my ministry will have
[1:04:42] three
[1:04:45] poles but they won't see it they'll be
[1:04:49] blinded they they they will put me to
[1:04:51] death I will be another prophet that
[1:04:54] perishes and dies in
[1:04:57] Jerusalem in Mount Calvary and then he
[1:05:00] says oh
[1:05:02] Jerusalem you which killed the
[1:05:08] prophets and Stones
[1:05:11] them he says and despite your great
[1:05:15] sin as a hin tries to gather her
[1:05:19] children
[1:05:21] together so have I come even at this
[1:05:24] time to gather
[1:05:27] you and you would
[1:05:29] not God types himself
[1:05:33] Jehovah as a hen because he had come to
[1:05:37] a chicken yard of a religious
[1:05:42] order even as God came to a chicken yard
[1:05:45] of a religious
[1:05:50] order and once again as the in House of
[1:05:54] denomination
[1:05:56] rejected
[1:05:58] coming so will they at the second
[1:06:01] coming but just like at the first coming
[1:06:05] there was a little flock that was
[1:06:08] persecuted by that
[1:06:10] denomination there was a little flock
[1:06:12] that was
[1:06:13] persecuted by the politicians and the
[1:06:15] global
[1:06:17] leaders so is it again today because
[1:06:20] it's the pattern of God's word and when
[1:06:23] you see the pattern of God's word you
[1:06:26] see God and you see more than what the
[1:06:29] world wants to do to
[1:06:31] you when you see the pattern in there
[1:06:34] you see what God is doing for you
[1:06:39] today let's pray Heavenly Father we
[1:06:43] thank you bless the reading of Thy
[1:06:45] word and we'll be sure to give you all
[1:06:49] the honor glory and the praise in Jesus
[1:06:53] name amen amen you may be
[1:07:00] seated like to read a quote for
[1:07:13] you and it's found
[1:07:17] um let's see
[1:07:22] here
[1:07:25] in the
[1:07:26] message
[1:07:29] 195611 why are people so tossed
[1:07:43] about and it's a message where brother
[1:07:46] rman speaking of the tent vision and and
[1:07:48] the vision that he
[1:07:50] had uh speaks on the three poles of his
[1:07:52] ministry
[1:07:56] and in paragraph
[1:07:58] 37 then he then he talks about that
[1:08:01] angel that was speaking to me in this
[1:08:04] Vision he says and the man which was
[1:08:07] talking behind
[1:08:09] me walked around in front of
[1:08:12] me and he was dressed in Palestinian
[1:08:17] clothes and a and a turban on his
[1:08:21] [Music]
[1:08:22] head he had a white
[1:08:26] robe he said brother brandom that's it I
[1:08:30] said I know I didn't do
[1:08:34] right I said I jerked it when I when I
[1:08:37] shouldn't
[1:08:40] have he said don't get your line tangled
[1:08:42] up in these kinds of
[1:08:46] times and I said while I'm running as
[1:08:48] straight as I
[1:08:50] can I'll be very careful and he said now
[1:08:54] the first time I spoke with
[1:08:57] you you put your hands on the
[1:09:01] people in other words as Jesus spoke
[1:09:05] there in the Book of
[1:09:08] Luke praying for the sick and
[1:09:11] evangelist great campaigns healing
[1:09:14] campaigns he said you put your hands on
[1:09:17] the people and told them what was wrong
[1:09:18] with
[1:09:22] them and the second poll you would know
[1:09:26] the secrets of their
[1:09:30] hearts and I made you a seer before the
[1:09:34] people a prophet was he always a
[1:09:38] prophet you were born a
[1:09:41] prophet but it wasn't known to the
[1:09:44] people it wasn't known to his family
[1:09:51] hard but there come a
[1:09:54] time when the gift would be a
[1:09:58] Vindicated that God would interpret to
[1:10:01] the
[1:10:02] people when he began Discerning the
[1:10:05] hearts and they realized no man can do
[1:10:09] this this has to be God and the
[1:10:12] Discerning of the hearts and the
[1:10:16] intents was was the very sign that God
[1:10:19] was on the
[1:10:21] scene it was the sign of the Messiah
[1:10:24] it's how Nathan recognized him
[1:10:28] immediately because he was a well-taught
[1:10:31] Jew he said no man can do this they was
[1:10:35] from the time he was a
[1:10:37] child and they'd never seen it
[1:10:39] done they only heard that God Alone is
[1:10:44] the discerner and intense of the
[1:10:47] heart because they hadn't had a prophet
[1:10:49] for 400
[1:10:52] years and when Jesus Jesus came and he
[1:10:55] tells Nathan he says I knew you I says I
[1:11:00] saw you when you were under that tree
[1:11:02] over
[1:11:03] there a few days
[1:11:06] ago and he says Master th the Christ the
[1:11:10] son of the Living God you're Messiah you
[1:11:13] recognized it you have to be God Only
[1:11:16] God can do this be God in you you have
[1:11:20] to be a prophet for this is the sign of
[1:11:23] the prophet
[1:11:26] he he he said now the first time I spoke
[1:11:29] to you
[1:11:30] verse per 38 you put your hands on the
[1:11:34] people and told them what was wrong with
[1:11:39] them and the second poll you would know
[1:11:43] the secrets of their
[1:11:46] hearts and I made you a seer before the
[1:11:49] people it was that manifestation
[1:11:54] it was when he began to discern the
[1:11:56] hearts of the
[1:11:58] people that some began to say this is
[1:12:01] more than an
[1:12:04] evangelist that prays for the sick they
[1:12:07] said it of Jesus this is more than an
[1:12:11] evangelist that prays for the sick this
[1:12:14] man is a
[1:12:16] prophet in chapter
[1:12:18] 4 of Matthew Jesus began his ministry
[1:12:24] as an evangelist praying for the
[1:12:28] sick in chapter
[1:12:31] five he he begins not only praying not
[1:12:35] only just laying hands on the
[1:12:38] people and healing them but he's now
[1:12:41] teaching on
[1:12:44] Perfection Matthew 5 6 and
[1:12:47] 7 but Perfection is a
[1:12:50] call for you and I to be be justified by
[1:12:55] faith because Perfection is the end
[1:12:59] result of something that God wants to
[1:13:01] start in your
[1:13:03] life and without this beginning without
[1:13:06] this
[1:13:07] start all that awaits the man or the
[1:13:09] woman is a devil's
[1:13:12] hell but if you accept this teaching on
[1:13:16] Perfection God is offering eternal
[1:13:19] life Perfection is a
[1:13:22] call for you and I to be justified by fa
[1:13:27] Sanctified by the spirit baptized with
[1:13:31] the Holy
[1:13:33] Ghost refilling after refilling of that
[1:13:36] same
[1:13:38] Spirit our cup is running
[1:13:41] over Perfection is the end
[1:13:44] result of this process of this
[1:13:48] friendship restored with the
[1:13:52] father turn with me to Romans chapter
[1:14:03] n Romans 9 and verse
[1:14:12] 23 he says and that he might make Paul
[1:14:16] the Apostle Paul speaking to the
[1:14:19] Romans and that he might make known The
[1:14:22] Riches of his
[1:14:24] glory on the vessels of
[1:14:31] Mercy which he had a four prepared unto
[1:14:37] Glory even us whom he ha
[1:14:40] called not of the Jews
[1:14:43] only but also of the
[1:14:47] Gentiles because it's come to a
[1:14:50] place where the generation of Jesus
[1:14:55] Christ was not Israel
[1:14:57] alone but it was also a gentile
[1:15:01] people you say brother Daniel did you
[1:15:03] say that
[1:15:05] backwards that the Jews first were a
[1:15:08] generation of Jesus
[1:15:11] Christ they were
[1:15:12] indeed for they were the firstborn
[1:15:15] son when you read the genealogy of
[1:15:18] Matthew 1 and verse
[1:15:22] one Matthew says and this is the
[1:15:26] generation of Jesus
[1:15:28] Christ then he begin to say and Abraham
[1:15:31] and David and all the descendants they
[1:15:34] were all Jews the generation of Jesus
[1:15:38] Christ but because of the mixing of the
[1:15:42] seeds then amongst the
[1:15:45] Gentiles is also the
[1:15:48] generation not every generation not
[1:15:50] every
[1:15:52] Gentile is a seed of
[1:15:55] God not every
[1:15:57] Jew is a seed of
[1:15:59] God but in the mix but in the mix of all
[1:16:03] these people in the
[1:16:07] world amongst both Jews and
[1:16:10] Gentiles there is a
[1:16:13] generation it's for those that he came
[1:16:17] down it's for those that he came and
[1:16:20] presented himself as
[1:16:22] anel
[1:16:24] Healing The Sick doing great
[1:16:26] wonders to catch the
[1:16:29] attention of his children they would
[1:16:33] know this would excite
[1:16:35] them this would encourage them in our
[1:16:38] world falling apart when Jesus came this
[1:16:43] gave God's children
[1:16:45] hope today in a world falling apart to
[1:16:50] see the ministry that's amongst us not
[1:16:53] only the ministry of William
[1:16:55] BR today the messenger is the Holy
[1:17:00] Ghost who said I'll be with you I'll be
[1:17:04] in you to the ends of the Earth Christ
[1:17:08] in us he's the hope of
[1:17:11] glory for you and
[1:17:13] I without him there would be no prophets
[1:17:18] without him there be there would be no
[1:17:20] sincere
[1:17:21] Pastor without him there would be no
[1:17:23] sincere
[1:17:25] evangelist without him there would be no
[1:17:29] hope but in him we have hope and and he
[1:17:34] prepares us daily to move from Glory
[1:17:38] unto
[1:17:39] glory to refilling after
[1:17:43] refilling and he's changing us
[1:17:47] daily if we look in the mirror of his
[1:17:50] word and we can't see Christ in his
[1:17:55] fullness and we can't that's why we must
[1:17:58] look in the mirror of the
[1:18:00] word and say through the blood You See
[1:18:04] Me Lord Jesus you see me cleansed and
[1:18:09] rightous and
[1:18:11] perfect but when I look in the mirror of
[1:18:13] the
[1:18:15] word I know I need to
[1:18:17] grows when I look in the mirror of the
[1:18:19] word I know I need to change and as long
[1:18:23] as I keep myself in the mirror of the
[1:18:27] word I will be changed the glory unto
[1:18:31] Glory unto Perfection which is eternal
[1:18:35] life which is a which is a reunion with
[1:18:38] the
[1:18:40] father it'll raise my
[1:18:42] faith to rapturing Faith if every
[1:18:46] day as I get up in the
[1:18:49] morning I look in the mirror of his word
[1:18:54] know where I'm falling
[1:18:56] short and know that God can lift me up
[1:18:58] from that
[1:19:00] spot and be the man he wants me to be
[1:19:04] that that morning all the way till the
[1:19:09] evening that's the mercy of
[1:19:14] God so in chapter 4 he come as the
[1:19:17] Evangelist
[1:19:19] praying lay hands on the sick
[1:19:23] in chapter five and six and
[1:19:25] seven the Evangelist begins
[1:19:28] toach on a process on a friendship being
[1:19:32] restored with the
[1:19:35] father on
[1:19:37] Perfection on how to be
[1:19:40] peacemakers in our
[1:19:42] home at our
[1:19:45] jobs how to how to apply meekness in our
[1:19:49] life when we feel the old anger rising
[1:19:52] up
[1:19:55] up but the Holy Spirit sweeps
[1:19:58] in and he says put the anger
[1:20:01] aside let me give you the meekness of
[1:20:04] the holy
[1:20:05] spirit that I displayed when I was on
[1:20:09] the
[1:20:10] earth and I was riled
[1:20:13] against by by the
[1:20:16] Levites by the priest by the high
[1:20:20] priest by his soldiers that SLA
[1:20:24] by the Roman by the Roman Pontius pilot
[1:20:27] who jerked on
[1:20:31] me and I pushed away the human
[1:20:35] anger and I displayed
[1:20:39] meekness I displayed
[1:20:43] self-control I didn't lose
[1:20:46] it so I could show
[1:20:50] you you too
[1:20:53] can have
[1:20:54] control over the Deeds of the
[1:20:57] Flesh and because I live and had
[1:21:02] self-control you can live in me and I
[1:21:05] can live in you and and display
[1:21:14] self-control in chapter
[1:21:16] 8 of The Book of
[1:21:21] Matthew Jesus finishes his
[1:21:24] teaching 56 and S of Matthew of the Book
[1:21:28] of
[1:21:30] Matthew was Jesus
[1:21:32] preaching on
[1:21:35] Perfection first he made the
[1:21:38] statements in chapter five and verse and
[1:21:41] chapter six and seven he begins to
[1:21:46] expound and F in and fill in the
[1:21:50] details of what he meant to be a
[1:21:53] peacemaker to be meek when R against not
[1:21:57] riing
[1:21:58] [Music]
[1:21:59] backfolded this
[1:22:01] teaching in a parable that can be
[1:22:04] revealed to you and I this
[1:22:07] morning it doesn't have to remain a
[1:22:11] parable has to remain
[1:22:14] prophecy it can become reality in your
[1:22:17] life this
[1:22:19] morning so in chapter eight of the Book
[1:22:21] of Matthew
[1:22:23] the mountain he went up on in chapter
[1:22:27] 5 in chapter eight he comes
[1:22:31] down and when he comes down from that
[1:22:34] mountain he continues his his ministry
[1:22:37] as an
[1:22:39] evangelist praying for the sick and the
[1:22:42] first is the
[1:22:43] leper and the leper heard his
[1:22:47] preaching Le heard his
[1:22:50] teaching and the leper believed every
[1:22:53] word he
[1:22:55] said maybe he didn't understand every
[1:22:58] word but he believed
[1:23:01] it he believed it to the
[1:23:04] point that though he knew being a
[1:23:10] leper that the leprosy would finally
[1:23:13] destroy
[1:23:15] him not only destroy him but it was big
[1:23:19] white blotches all over the skin
[1:23:25] a person was was was was was the skin
[1:23:28] was rotting as they were
[1:23:34] walking everyone shunned the
[1:23:38] lepers it was a horrible
[1:23:41] disease there was no cure there was no
[1:23:46] hope there was no
[1:23:50] physician till Jesus Jesus
[1:23:53] came and the leper saw
[1:23:55] it he caught the
[1:23:58] Revelation he said
[1:24:00] Lord if thou
[1:24:03] will you can make me
[1:24:05] clean he believed
[1:24:08] it and the Bible
[1:24:12] says that it was still the first pull of
[1:24:14] his
[1:24:16] ministry so what did he do did he
[1:24:19] discern his heart the Bible says he
[1:24:24] the gift was in his
[1:24:28] hand and the leper was healed it would
[1:24:33] change it would go to where it'd be
[1:24:35] Discerning the hearts of the
[1:24:38] people this was the first B of his
[1:24:41] ministry and he told him don't tell
[1:24:44] don't tell any
[1:24:46] man but go and
[1:24:49] offer the gift that Moses commanded
[1:24:54] and be a
[1:24:56] testimony for what God has done in your
[1:24:59] life you see what he said first he said
[1:25:02] don't tell no
[1:25:04] man and we think because he spread his
[1:25:07] Fame all over that he
[1:25:12] disobeyed he said first he tells him
[1:25:15] don't tell no
[1:25:16] man no
[1:25:18] instead go to the church and offer the
[1:25:22] the
[1:25:23] gift that Moses
[1:25:26] commanded and be a
[1:25:28] testimony to hundreds in the synagogue
[1:25:33] and be a testimony to the
[1:25:36] priest because most
[1:25:39] priests had never offered
[1:25:44] up this
[1:25:46] sacrifice for the cleansing of a
[1:25:49] leper in
[1:25:50] Israel you know
[1:25:53] why because they'd never seen a leper
[1:25:55] cleansed in their whole
[1:25:57] life it was a generation that had never
[1:26:00] seen the miraculous healing power of
[1:26:03] almighty
[1:26:06] God so when he met when he went with his
[1:26:09] two turtle
[1:26:11] doves to the
[1:26:14] priest I'm here to offer these two
[1:26:16] Turtle
[1:26:17] dos for the cleansing of
[1:26:21] leprosy he says look at my face you
[1:26:24] remember what I was I was that
[1:26:27] leopard that you didn't want me to come
[1:26:30] close now I'm offering the gift that
[1:26:33] Moses
[1:26:36] commanded he's telling the
[1:26:38] world he's lifting up the two Turtle
[1:26:41] [Music]
[1:26:43] do and he's going to cause the
[1:26:47] priest to give glory to
[1:26:50] God with his sacrifice
[1:26:53] two turtle doves the priest would take
[1:26:57] it one turtle dove was
[1:27:00] taken and it was placed in an earn
[1:27:04] vessel and in thatn
[1:27:07] vessel it was
[1:27:10] killed then they would take the
[1:27:13] blood out of the earth and
[1:27:16] vessel sprinkle it on the other
[1:27:20] Turtle it up they would walk out and in
[1:27:24] an open
[1:27:26] field they'd let it
[1:27:28] fry it was free to go because the other
[1:27:32] had died and the priest didn't
[1:27:35] realize that the bird the turtle dove in
[1:27:40] the vessel of clay represented
[1:27:44] Jehovah in a vessel of
[1:27:47] clay Jesus of Nazareth and that one day
[1:27:51] God would die in this vessel of clay he
[1:27:55] would represent allmighty God take away
[1:27:59] our sin was by the blood of his
[1:28:07] lamb the gift that was
[1:28:11] offered for you and for I to take away
[1:28:15] our
[1:28:16] leprosy
[1:28:19] sin because we were born in sin we were
[1:28:22] shaped in iniquity we come into this
[1:28:25] world speaking
[1:28:26] lies what could wash the St away nothing
[1:28:30] but the blood that Turtle
[1:28:34] do God in a vessel of clay called Jesus
[1:28:39] of
[1:28:39] Nazar died that day on
[1:28:44] C and when he shed his
[1:28:47] blood MC the high
[1:28:51] priest sprinkled you and
[1:28:54] I you know when he sprinkled
[1:28:58] you when you were
[1:29:00] baptized no
[1:29:03] no if you're a child of
[1:29:06] God the day you were
[1:29:08] born in your mother's
[1:29:10] womb because you're a gene of
[1:29:13] God you were sprinkled with a blood of
[1:29:18] this of this turtle dove who died in
[1:29:21] Earth
[1:29:24] for
[1:29:25] you and he watched over
[1:29:29] you all the days of your
[1:29:31] life that's why you're here this
[1:29:34] morning he the gospel because many times
[1:29:38] death should have touched
[1:29:41] you but you were a turtle dove that's
[1:29:43] been sprinkled with the
[1:29:46] blood and death couldn't cross the
[1:29:49] barrier of the blood to take you away
[1:29:53] God had a plan for you and
[1:29:55] I to serve him to love him to stand for
[1:30:00] him be a
[1:30:03] witness the doves does of God being
[1:30:07] Witnesses for him of the leprosy of
[1:30:11] which we've been
[1:30:12] cleansed Oh Amazing Grace how sweet the
[1:30:16] sound that saved the richet
[1:30:19] like and Jesus continues
[1:30:23] and in verse eight he goes to Peter's
[1:30:26] house and when he gets there Peter's
[1:30:30] mother is
[1:30:33] sick with a terrible
[1:30:37] fever she can't do anything she
[1:30:40] sick and the Bible
[1:30:42] says that he put forth his
[1:30:45] hand and he touched
[1:30:48] her he didn't say a
[1:30:50] word for for it was the full first full
[1:30:54] ministry and the gift was in the
[1:30:58] hand
[1:31:01] Jesus the great
[1:31:05] evangelist in
[1:31:07] chapter
[1:31:10] n Jesus it says and he entered into a
[1:31:14] ship and passed over and came into his
[1:31:18] own
[1:31:20] country
[1:31:23] in chapter
[1:31:24] nine Jesus will be entering into his
[1:31:26] second po
[1:31:30] Ministry in the in in verse two it says
[1:31:33] they brought unto him a man sick of the
[1:31:40] py lying on a
[1:31:42] bed and Jesus seeing their faith said
[1:31:45] unto the sick of the son be of good
[1:31:50] cheer he
[1:31:52] said thy sins be
[1:31:55] forgiven the ministry was
[1:31:58] changing it was a second pool he was now
[1:32:01] Discerning the
[1:32:03] hearts he looked at this sick man in a
[1:32:07] bed he said wow wow what a sinner this
[1:32:11] one
[1:32:12] is the first thing I need to do for
[1:32:16] him is forgive him these
[1:32:19] sins I need to heal the soul
[1:32:22] I need to heal this son I need to heal
[1:32:25] his
[1:32:27] heart I need to give him relief in his
[1:32:31] mind but the
[1:32:33] scribes said within this themselves this
[1:32:37] man
[1:32:39] blasphemeth
[1:32:40] watch how he moves into his second pull
[1:32:43] of his
[1:32:46] ministry knowing their
[1:32:49] thoughts he said wherefore think he evil
[1:32:52] in your
[1:32:56] hearts you could ask the
[1:32:58] question didn't he always know the
[1:33:01] thoughts of their
[1:33:04] hearts it wasn't he
[1:33:07] God even as an
[1:33:10] evangelist
[1:33:13] correct but there would come a
[1:33:16] time that he would be fulfilling Bible
[1:33:20] prophecy
[1:33:22] and he wouldn't get ahead of his
[1:33:25] word he was going to be right on
[1:33:28] time doing what he's supposed to
[1:33:31] do on the right day at the right time at
[1:33:36] the perfect hour to set a pattern for us
[1:33:40] that when he comes again and he does the
[1:33:44] same thing
[1:33:45] again can say it has to be God that's
[1:33:49] come down in our midst again to speak to
[1:33:52] our
[1:33:54] hearts and Jesus knowing their thoughts
[1:33:57] said wherefore think ye evil in your
[1:34:06] hearts and they're still thinking
[1:34:10] blasphemer now he's going to put them in
[1:34:12] a
[1:34:13] corner he says you tell
[1:34:15] me what's easier to
[1:34:19] say thy sins be
[1:34:23] forgiven or to say arise and
[1:34:27] walk you call me a
[1:34:30] blasphemer but which is easier to
[1:34:35] say a
[1:34:36] man with no
[1:34:39] inspiration just an arrogant
[1:34:42] man he could scream and say your sins be
[1:34:48] forgiven but that same arrogant preacher
[1:34:53] couldn't tell a man on a
[1:34:56] deathbed arise and
[1:34:58] walk which is easier to
[1:35:02] say for
[1:35:04] God nothing was too
[1:35:07] hard but he put this
[1:35:10] question to these
[1:35:12] scribes because for them in their
[1:35:14] minds one was easier to say than the
[1:35:20] other
[1:35:25] part
[1:35:26] two opens
[1:35:29] up the second poll
[1:35:31] Ministry
[1:35:33] begins could he still heal the
[1:35:36] sick yes that never went
[1:35:39] away but the ministry was going
[1:35:44] higher but that ye may know that the son
[1:35:47] of man hath power on Earth to forgive
[1:35:49] sins then saith he to the sick of the
[1:35:52] policy verse 6 arise take up thy bed and
[1:35:56] go into thy
[1:36:06] house when the multitude saw a marveled
[1:36:09] and glorified God which had given such
[1:36:12] power unto
[1:36:20] men but not just to
[1:36:24] Men first the
[1:36:26] power had to be given to a
[1:36:29] man who knew how to handle the
[1:36:32] power for power without
[1:36:36] character would have been
[1:36:39] demonic but Jesus the second
[1:36:43] Adam had the
[1:36:45] character to handle the
[1:36:48] power of the fullness of the deity of
[1:36:53] God he was a man in complete
[1:36:58] control he was the man that God was
[1:37:01] looking
[1:37:03] for to be able to put the book in the
[1:37:06] hands of a
[1:37:08] man be worthy to open
[1:37:11] it and to lose the seven
[1:37:14] parts of that one Divine Plan of
[1:37:18] Salvation of
[1:37:20] redemption Deliverance for the
[1:37:22] generation of Jesus
[1:37:25] Christ Jew and
[1:37:27] Gentiles both the Fig Tree and the bride
[1:37:32] tree this man Jesus this is the man we
[1:37:37] need this is the man we still
[1:37:43] need God bless all his go all the god-
[1:37:47] sent
[1:37:49] prophets God bless all the God sent
[1:37:53] pastors God bless all the God sent
[1:38:00] evangelists God bless all the fful
[1:38:02] ministry that God has
[1:38:05] sent but the man you and I need this
[1:38:08] morning the man that's in the book of
[1:38:11] this called the
[1:38:13] Bible man Jesus of
[1:38:15] Naz he is the Lord Jesus Christ he is
[1:38:20] Emmanuel and he's still with us this
[1:38:26] morning the Bible says and as they pass
[1:38:30] verse
[1:38:31] n he saw a man named Matthew sitting at
[1:38:34] the seat of
[1:38:38] custom and he arose and followed
[1:38:42] him at the beginning of his second poll
[1:38:45] of his
[1:38:49] ministry Jesus Jesus begins to
[1:38:53] set the New Testament Church in
[1:39:00] order he's he's setting the New
[1:39:02] Testament
[1:39:06] Church he's putting them an
[1:39:09] order the order began like
[1:39:12] this first
[1:39:14] prophets John the
[1:39:16] Baptist and Christ
[1:39:18] himself now apostles but don't put a
[1:39:22] period there because the word was
[1:39:25] unfolding the revelation of a New
[1:39:28] Testament Church was
[1:39:30] growing the order was being
[1:39:33] placed little by little line upon line
[1:39:38] word upon word would be adding
[1:39:42] more so if you are quick to say I got
[1:39:46] it it's just Apostles and nothing else
[1:39:50] no no no no
[1:39:52] no no more would come a fful Ministry
[1:39:57] come and the fful
[1:40:00] ministry was a pattern in God's
[1:40:02] word it was the ministry of Jesus
[1:40:06] Christ that's where the fful ministry
[1:40:09] comes
[1:40:12] from Jesus began as an
[1:40:15] evangelist it was prophesied that he
[1:40:17] would be a
[1:40:19] prophet in the book of deuteron
[1:40:22] and the book of Acts
[1:40:24] Peter reminds us of the prophecy of
[1:40:27] Moses the Lord shall raise up a
[1:40:31] prophet so he was evangelist he was
[1:40:36] prophet in Chapter 3 of
[1:40:38] Hebrews Paul
[1:40:42] said that
[1:40:44] Jesus was the Apostle of our
[1:40:48] faith in the book of Peter
[1:40:51] Peter said that Jesus was the chief
[1:40:56] Shepherd of the
[1:40:58] flock evangelist
[1:41:01] Prophet
[1:41:03] Apostle and when he went to
[1:41:06] Nicodemus in St John
[1:41:09] 3 Nicodemus said we
[1:41:13] know
[1:41:14] we the priests not all of us hate you
[1:41:18] Jesus not every levite against you like
[1:41:22] the high priest and all his family
[1:41:26] members all the political
[1:41:30] priests there's many of us we know the
[1:41:35] priesthood by watching you that thou are
[1:41:38] a teacher come from
[1:41:42] God because no one does the things that
[1:41:45] you
[1:41:46] do no one preaches like you've ever
[1:41:49] preached before
[1:41:52] Jesus evangelist
[1:41:55] Prophet Pastor
[1:41:59] teacher the fightful ministry was the
[1:42:02] ministry of Jesus Christ it wasn't
[1:42:05] something Paul
[1:42:06] invented it was
[1:42:13] God so in Matthew 9
[1:42:16] and9 Jesus begins to set the church in
[1:42:20] order
[1:42:22] he begins to call
[1:42:24] men and the and the ministry he's going
[1:42:27] to need
[1:42:28] first to establish his
[1:42:32] church is the apostolic
[1:42:35] Ministry of Apostles but not only they
[1:42:40] wouldn't do it all but that's where he
[1:42:42] would
[1:42:43] begin because the apostle was going to
[1:42:45] be a certain kind of a
[1:42:48] man certain kind of a of a
[1:42:52] personality he would be the man to come
[1:42:54] and set things in
[1:42:57] order these would be the men that would
[1:42:59] transition from the law to
[1:43:03] grace these were men that would give
[1:43:05] their
[1:43:07] lives these were men that would all die
[1:43:10] for their gospel gospel they
[1:43:12] preached and they understood that and
[1:43:16] they were
[1:43:17] willing and everyone gave their life
[1:43:22] Peter was hung upside
[1:43:24] down he said I am not worthy to die like
[1:43:28] my
[1:43:29] Lord and they hung him upside down on a
[1:43:32] Roman
[1:43:36] cross
[1:43:38] Paul he said I must go to
[1:43:41] Rome for I'm going to preach this
[1:43:44] gospel to Caesar
[1:43:49] himself
[1:43:51] just before he went as he was having a
[1:43:54] little
[1:43:56] Fellowship in a little fellowship hall
[1:43:58] with the
[1:43:59] [Music]
[1:44:01] Saints a man rose up who was a prophet
[1:44:04] of God and he grabbed Paul's
[1:44:09] coat and he said thus sayith the
[1:44:12] Lord the man who whom this coat belongs
[1:44:16] to will die in
[1:44:19] Rome Paul said that's my
[1:44:22] code and I already know that and the
[1:44:26] people began to
[1:44:27] weep don't go
[1:44:30] Paul oh don't don't make this harder for
[1:44:32] me than what it already
[1:44:35] is I must go not just to preach the
[1:44:40] word in the highways and the
[1:44:44] byways but I must proaim Jesus
[1:44:48] Christ at the highest office of this
[1:44:50] Nation Caesar
[1:44:53] himself no man will have an
[1:44:56] excuse for
[1:44:58] rejecting the blood of that Turtle do
[1:45:02] that was killed in the vessel on the
[1:45:05] cross of Calvary and Spilled his
[1:45:09] blood so you could be
[1:45:11] sprinkled and the soul and heart set
[1:45:19] free
[1:45:22] chapter
[1:45:24] n God begins to set his church in
[1:45:29] order Jesus now Discerning the
[1:45:33] hearts he's entered his second
[1:45:36] phase he entered his second poll the
[1:45:40] prophetic part Discerning the thoughts
[1:45:43] and
[1:45:46] intents turn with me to Hebrews chapter
[1:45:49] 4
[1:45:57] Hebrews
[1:45:59] 4 and verse
[1:46:07] 12 the Apostle
[1:46:09] Paul he says for the word of God is
[1:46:12] quick and
[1:46:14] powerful and sharper than any two-edged
[1:46:18] sword piercing even to the dividing a
[1:46:21] center of Soul and
[1:46:23] Spirit and of the joints and
[1:46:27] maral and is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:46:30] and intents of the
[1:46:35] heart so when Jesus began Discerning the
[1:46:41] hearts it declared him to the
[1:46:44] people to be a
[1:46:47] prophet and more than a prophet he was
[1:46:50] God
[1:46:51] himself he was that turtle
[1:46:54] dove in an earn
[1:46:57] vessel the dove represents the Holy
[1:47:04] Spirit and that Holy Spirit was placed
[1:47:06] in an earth and
[1:47:08] vessel not a measure of it the fullness
[1:47:12] of God was in this
[1:47:14] vessel and it's in this
[1:47:17] vessel that God died because as a spirit
[1:47:21] he couldn't
[1:47:23] die you can't kill an eternal
[1:47:27] being so he created for himself a
[1:47:31] body a vessel of
[1:47:34] clay and he dwelt in
[1:47:36] that knowing that one
[1:47:39] day that the
[1:47:41] priest of
[1:47:43] Israel would
[1:47:45] kill this turtle dove in the Earth Earth
[1:47:49] and vessel
[1:47:51] what they didn't
[1:47:52] know is when they sprinkled the
[1:47:56] blood that it would fall on all his
[1:47:59] children not just the
[1:48:02] children in the days of Jesus but his
[1:48:05] children
[1:48:06] today his children this
[1:48:08] morning you and I we have been
[1:48:13] sprinkled with the blood of that turtle
[1:48:16] dove who died in an earth vessel
[1:48:21] and who killed
[1:48:22] them the very high
[1:48:25] priest of the Church of
[1:48:27] Israel it had to be that
[1:48:30] way it was spoken all the types and
[1:48:34] shadows all the patterns spoke of
[1:48:38] it but it would be
[1:48:40] Redemption and the killing of that
[1:48:42] Turtle
[1:48:43] [Music]
[1:48:45] do when we are sprinkled with that
[1:48:49] blood
[1:48:50] we're
[1:48:53] free we're
[1:48:55] free we're free from this old
[1:49:00] nature we're free from all our
[1:49:05] anger we're free from all our
[1:49:10] complexes we're free from everything
[1:49:13] that holds us
[1:49:16] down we're
[1:49:18] free from the lust of the flesh
[1:49:21] the lust of the eye and the pride of
[1:49:24] life when we're sprinkled with the
[1:49:28] blood we can every day
[1:49:32] overcome every strong
[1:49:36] Temptation and be made
[1:49:38] strong in all our
[1:49:41] weaknesses and grow in
[1:49:45] Christ because the refilling of the Holy
[1:49:49] Spirit
[1:49:50] as I've told you before it's not a
[1:49:54] reward for being a good boy and a
[1:49:58] good refilling of the holy
[1:50:03] spirit is God coming
[1:50:05] down and delivering
[1:50:08] you from every
[1:50:11] Temptation he gives you the
[1:50:13] strength with a
[1:50:15] refilling when you feel like I don't
[1:50:18] think I'll make it this time lord
[1:50:23] and the dove swoops down then the turtle
[1:50:26] dove that died in the earth and vessel
[1:50:30] sweep down into the room you're
[1:50:33] at of the job you're on wherever you
[1:50:38] are and gives you the
[1:50:41] strength to rise
[1:50:43] up above that
[1:50:48] weakness chapter chapter
[1:50:52] 9 verse
[1:50:55] 16 start at verse
[1:50:58] 15 he excuse me Hebrews 45 and
[1:51:02] 16 Hebrews 4:15 and
[1:51:05] 16 for we have not an high
[1:51:09] priest which cannot be touched with the
[1:51:12] feeling of our
[1:51:14] infirmities but was in all points
[1:51:16] tempted like as we
[1:51:18] are
[1:51:20] yet without
[1:51:22] sin Let Us therefore come
[1:51:25] boldly unto the throne of
[1:51:28] grace that we may obtain
[1:51:30] mercy and find Grace to
[1:51:34] help time of
[1:51:38] need Matthew chapter
[1:51:48] 10
[1:51:55] under the second poll of Jesus's
[1:51:59] Ministry the word now Discerning the
[1:52:03] hearts of both Sinners and
[1:52:06] Saints he begins to establish the
[1:52:10] ministry that will that will speak to
[1:52:14] Israel that will speak to the generation
[1:52:16] of Jesus
[1:52:18] Christ that will call them out of the
[1:52:20] bondage of this church that they're
[1:52:24] in they called it the Church of
[1:52:32] Moses and yet they were in
[1:52:36] bondage I was going to say something but
[1:52:38] I'm going to hold
[1:52:40] it verse one of Matthew 10 and when he
[1:52:44] had called unto him his 12
[1:52:48] disciples all all the power that he had
[1:52:52] displayed he now gives them
[1:52:55] power his power against unclean
[1:52:59] spirits to cast them out to heal all
[1:53:03] manner of
[1:53:04] sickness and all manner of
[1:53:09] disease gifts and
[1:53:11] callings are without
[1:53:15] repentance these men had
[1:53:18] yet to be baptized with the Holy
[1:53:22] Ghost these men had yet to even baptize
[1:53:25] to they hadn't even B been baptized in
[1:53:28] the name of Jesus
[1:53:31] Christ perhaps baptized in
[1:53:34] water in John's
[1:53:37] baptism where John said I I baptize
[1:53:42] repentance and I preached the Kingdom of
[1:53:44] Heaven
[1:53:46] is and I'm telling you behold this Jesus
[1:53:50] he's the Lamb of
[1:53:51] God but don't put a period there because
[1:53:55] more would be added to the
[1:53:57] baptism the power of that turtle dove
[1:54:02] that died in the earth
[1:54:03] of his name would be added making the
[1:54:08] baptism
[1:54:09] Supernatural and life changing for you
[1:54:12] and
[1:54:14] I now the names of the 12
[1:54:18] apostles are these
[1:54:21] Simon who was called
[1:54:23] Peter Andrew his
[1:54:25] brother James the son of
[1:54:29] zebede John his
[1:54:31] brother Philip and Bartholomew pH Thomas
[1:54:36] and Matthew
[1:54:38] thean James the son of
[1:54:41] alus and leus who surname was
[1:54:45] thus Simon the Canaanite Sim and Judas
[1:54:50] es
[1:54:51] scariot who
[1:54:53] also betrayed
[1:54:56] him 12 chosen
[1:55:00] men with gifts of
[1:55:04] healing including
[1:55:10] Judas what of you were there in that
[1:55:14] day and you're
[1:55:17] sick and now Judas with this Ministry
[1:55:20] with this
[1:55:22] gift Judith
[1:55:24] scariot come by praise for you prays for
[1:55:29] the whole
[1:55:30] family everyone's
[1:55:33] healed you'd say wow wow what a great
[1:55:37] man of
[1:55:39] God a man with a
[1:55:41] gift but he was also called the son of
[1:55:47] predition a man with a gift
[1:55:50] and he betrayed the man who gave him the
[1:55:55] gift but to you but
[1:55:58] today you and I might be ready to follow
[1:56:02] him anywhere he
[1:56:04] goes and those who followed
[1:56:09] Judas they finally wound up on a plot of
[1:56:14] [Music]
[1:56:18] land see Jesus seen
[1:56:21] Judas hang himself on a
[1:56:25] tree and you would have
[1:56:27] said wow wow but he had such a great
[1:56:32] ministry but do you know that that was
[1:56:34] his
[1:56:36] ministry and his end proclaimed who he
[1:56:42] was that's why a prophet in our day
[1:56:46] said stay with the word
[1:56:52] stay with the
[1:56:56] word these
[1:56:58] 12 Jesus sent forth verse five and
[1:57:02] commanded them
[1:57:05] saying go not into the way of the
[1:57:10] Gentiles and into the city of the
[1:57:12] Samaritans enter ye
[1:57:16] not because Jesus had come as king of
[1:57:19] the
[1:57:20] Jews and he was going to
[1:57:23] offer the open book and the revelation
[1:57:26] of
[1:57:27] the to the firstborn
[1:57:30] is all the types and shadows of the Old
[1:57:32] Testament
[1:57:35] SP Jesus wasn't inventing anything
[1:57:38] new Jesus was fulfilling his
[1:57:43] word but go rather to the lost sheep of
[1:57:46] the House of
[1:57:48] Israel
[1:57:51] and is and as ye go
[1:57:54] preach saying the book will be open the
[1:57:58] Seven Seals will be

[2:01:47] hardened by The Bondage they were
[2:01:50] in they had been hardened because they

[2:02:31] world doesn't he know that the Romans
[2:02:33] are persecuting
[2:02:35] us that even the
[2:02:38] priest
[2:02:41] abuses doesn't he see this world's
[2:02:43] falling
[2:02:45] apart where did he come from the moon no
[2:02:50] he came from the throne this was God the
[2:02:54] Father coming to bring to you a a peace
[2:02:59] that passes all understanding all human
[2:03:03] understanding and in the midst of a
[2:03:05] world falling
[2:03:07] apart God's children are at peace
[2:03:11] because we trust
[2:03:13] him we see the pattern of his
[2:03:16] word we know he's here
[2:03:21] verse 16
[2:03:23] says behold I send you
[2:03:26] forth as sheep in the midst of
[2:03:30] wolves I know you're in a world of
[2:03:34] wolves when I told you be a
[2:03:38] peacemaker I
[2:03:40] know that this world is a world of
[2:03:43] wolves so I'm going to give you some
[2:03:46] advice in this world of wolves
[2:03:51] where you work where you
[2:03:54] play he says be ye there
[2:03:57] for wise as
[2:04:00] serpents and
[2:04:02] harmless as
[2:04:04] dogs it was a
[2:04:07] parable you think about
[2:04:10] it and think about how you can apply
[2:04:13] this
[2:04:14] Parable in your life verse 17 but beware
[2:04:19] of
[2:04:21] men for they will deliver
[2:04:23] you up to cils they will scor you in
[2:04:27] their
[2:04:29] synagogue he's speaking to 12
[2:04:31] Apostles he's telling them about their
[2:04:35] Ministry of what it's going to be
[2:04:37] like it won't be
[2:04:40] easy but beware of men for they will
[2:04:42] deliver you up to the
[2:04:47] cils Tribunal
[2:04:49] to be judged and they will Scourge you
[2:04:52] in their
[2:04:54] synagogues that means you'll be
[2:04:56] physically
[2:04:59] beaten and you shall be brought before
[2:05:02] Governors like Pontius pilot like Caesar
[2:05:06] of
[2:05:07] Rome Kings for my sake for Testimony
[2:05:12] against and the
[2:05:14] Gentiles but when they deliver you
[2:05:17] up take no
[2:05:21] thought how or what you shall
[2:05:25] speak for it shall be given you in that
[2:05:28] same hour what you shall
[2:05:34] speak it was a
[2:05:37] prophecy of the third pole of the
[2:05:40] ministry of Jesus and his Apostles the
[2:05:45] five
[2:05:46] Ministry a parable
[2:05:49] and The Parables of
[2:05:51] Jesus were all
[2:05:53] prophecies and most of
[2:05:55] them were becoming
[2:05:58] history the moment he was speaking
[2:06:01] them but they couldn't see it their eyes
[2:06:05] had been
[2:06:06] blinded oh God Open the Eyes of our
[2:06:10] understanding for we're living in the
[2:06:12] last moments we're living at the end
[2:06:17] time
[2:06:22] for it is not ye that speak but the
[2:06:24] spirit of your father which speaketh in
[2:06:31] you then Jesus goes on all in Parables
[2:06:36] and the brother shall deliver up the
[2:06:37] brother to
[2:06:40] death and the Father the child and the
[2:06:43] children shall rise up against their
[2:06:47] parents and cause them to be put to
[2:06:49] death and you shall be hated of all men
[2:06:52] for my name
[2:06:53] sake but he that endureth to the end
[2:06:56] shall be
[2:06:59] saved this just wasn't a parable and
[2:07:02] Prophecy in the days of
[2:07:04] Jesus this was a parable and
[2:07:08] prophecy that is still unfolding amongst
[2:07:10] the Jewish people
[2:07:13] today they'll be hated of all
[2:07:16] men for my name sake
[2:07:19] the old
[2:07:22] name but he that endureth to the
[2:07:25] end when he sends Moses and
[2:07:28] Elijah after he's raptured a
[2:07:31] bride those that endure to the end a
[2:07:35] little a little flock of
[2:07:38] Jews
[2:07:40] 144,000 those are the ones that will be
[2:07:43] saved like a little bride today a little
[2:07:47] flock
[2:07:49] amongst a gentile
[2:07:50] people those are the ones that are going
[2:07:53] to be
[2:07:55] saved oh may we be a part of that little
[2:07:59] group that's saved that's quickened
[2:08:03] that's changed will be translated by the
[2:08:06] power of
[2:08:09] spirit then he
[2:08:12] says but when they persecute you in this
[2:08:16] city stand your around and show them who
[2:08:19] you
[2:08:20] are no he didn't say that he said no
[2:08:24] flee ye into another
[2:08:27] city oh no brother Daniel you don't know
[2:08:30] me I ain't scared of
[2:08:33] nobody I face anybody
[2:08:36] down I ain't scared of
[2:08:38] nobody Jesus
[2:08:41] said but when they persecute you in this
[2:08:45] city I know you ain't scared of nobody
[2:08:49] to do
[2:08:51] violence but I want you to flee in
[2:08:53] another
[2:08:55] city because I don't want you to be a
[2:08:57] man of
[2:08:58] violence because that means you're
[2:09:01] Anointed with demon
[2:09:04] power I want to anoint you with the Holy
[2:09:08] Ghost and in him Jesus was found no
[2:09:13] violence the words of Isaiah in Isaiah
[2:09:17] 53
[2:09:20] so if you're
[2:09:21] Anointed with even a
[2:09:24] measure of that fullness of God that
[2:09:29] Jesus you too will not be a man of
[2:09:34] violence the flesh wants to
[2:09:37] be but the Born Again
[2:09:40] believer and Christ in US overcomes his
[2:09:47] flesh
[2:09:49] the
[2:09:50] disciple is not above his
[2:09:55] master nor the servant above his
[2:10:00] Lord it is enough for the disciple that
[2:10:03] he be as his
[2:10:05] master and the servant as his
[2:10:08] Lord if they have called The Master of
[2:10:11] the House be
[2:10:13] elub how much more shall they call them
[2:10:16] of his
[2:10:17] household
[2:10:19] fear them not
[2:10:22] therefore the disciples weren't running
[2:10:25] into another city because of
[2:10:31] fear the disciples went to another
[2:10:35] city because of
[2:10:37] obedience to Jesus Christ to almighty
[2:10:42] God for there is nothing
[2:10:45] covered that shall not be revealed
[2:10:49] and hid that shall not be
[2:10:52] known what I tell you in
[2:10:55] darkness what I'm telling you in the
[2:10:57] darkness of
[2:11:01] L that speak ye in
[2:11:04] light in your churches that the book is
[2:11:08] open and the Seven Seals which is seven
[2:11:12] parts of one beautiful
[2:11:15] plan of God sprinking sprink King you
[2:11:18] with the
[2:11:20] blood of that turtle dove that died in a
[2:11:24] vessel of
[2:11:25] clay that vessel of clay was Christ the
[2:11:30] turtle dove represented God in
[2:11:32] ch God In This Man Called
[2:11:35] Jesus it was God he was
[2:11:39] Emanuel but to die he needed to become
[2:11:44] man and when he spilled his
[2:11:47] blood
[2:11:48] then he sprinkled
[2:11:51] you you didn't know it I didn't know it
[2:11:56] when we were lost in
[2:11:58] sin but even then we were sprinkled with
[2:12:02] the
[2:12:03] blood that's why when death came so
[2:12:06] close to
[2:12:08] you the devil couldn't take
[2:12:10] you because he couldn't break through
[2:12:13] the barrier of the blood to take
[2:12:17] you
[2:12:20] then we had
[2:12:21] fear now we know we're
[2:12:24] covered with the blood of
[2:12:26] Jesus now he takes all fear
[2:12:34] away and fear not them which kill the
[2:12:37] body but are not able to kill the soul
[2:12:39] verse
[2:12:43] 28 rather fear him which is able to
[2:12:46] destroy both soul and body in
[2:12:51] hell then he goes
[2:12:54] on always in
[2:12:56] parables are not Two Sparrows sold for a
[2:13:02] faring and one of them shall not fall on
[2:13:04] the ground without your
[2:13:08] father a faring today would be worth
[2:13:12] like one tenth of a
[2:13:16] penny it's nothing so it's almost he's
[2:13:20] saying are not Two Sparrows who are
[2:13:22] worth almost
[2:13:26] nothing and one falls to the
[2:13:30] ground and God sees that that bird
[2:13:35] fall it has value to
[2:13:38] him he says but the very hairs of your
[2:13:43] head are all
[2:13:46] numbered
[2:13:51] but the very
[2:13:54] hairs of your
[2:13:56] head are
[2:13:58] numbered that's how much he values
[2:14:01] you that's how well he knows
[2:14:05] you and he wants you and I to come to
[2:14:09] know
[2:14:10] him the same way a friendship
[2:14:15] restored with the father is our hope our
[2:14:20] deliverance it's our Born Again
[2:14:23] experience the of the Holy
[2:14:27] Ghost fear ye not therefore verse
[2:14:32] 31 you of more value than many
[2:14:38] sparrows whosoever
[2:14:42] therefore shall confess me before
[2:14:45] men him will I confess
[2:14:49] My Father which is in
[2:14:51] heav but whosoever shall deny
[2:14:55] me before
[2:14:57] men him will I also
[2:15:00] deny before my
[2:15:02] Father which is in
[2:15:05] heaven and The Parables continued
[2:15:09] on Jesus
[2:15:12] speaking each Parable was a
[2:15:15] prophecy that had a beginning in the
[2:15:17] days of
[2:15:19] Jesus many of his
[2:15:21] Parables had to do with
[2:15:24] Israel she's the eldest
[2:15:28] son the youngest son was a New Testament
[2:15:34] Church it was all
[2:15:37] prophetic but it was all in
[2:15:39] Parables and there was a
[2:15:41] reason the prophet
[2:15:44] said the book of
[2:15:46] Psalms Messiah would come he would speak
[2:15:50] in
[2:15:51] Parables and without a parable he would
[2:15:53] not speak but in Parables he would he
[2:15:57] would speak things that had been hidden
[2:15:59] since the foundation of the
[2:16:02] world he would speak things that only
[2:16:04] the ears of Adam had ever
[2:16:07] heard and now you and I today this
[2:16:10] morning are hearing those things he said
[2:16:14] my word will not
[2:16:16] return people that will complete will
[2:16:21] fulfill this word that will live
[2:16:24] it and will be
[2:16:27] changed and will be
[2:16:29] quickened and will
[2:16:31] inherit eternal
[2:16:36] life and you can make redemption's
[2:16:40] claim on every loved
[2:16:43] one and don't let go of
[2:16:46] it and God will give you the
[2:16:50] desires of your
[2:16:58] hearts verse 41 and
[2:17:01] 42 I'm
[2:17:04] closing he that receiveth a
[2:17:07] prophet name of a
[2:17:09] prophet shall receive a prophet's
[2:17:14] reward I believe
[2:17:16] Jesus was not just speaking of all
[2:17:20] prophets but I believe
[2:17:23] Jesus was speaking more of
[2:17:27] himself he that receiveth a
[2:17:30] prophet in the name of a
[2:17:33] prophet how about if you receive this
[2:17:36] prophet in the name of Jesus
[2:17:41] Christ then there's a
[2:17:43] reward he that receiveth Jesus
[2:17:48] in the name of Jesus Christ shall
[2:17:51] receive the reward that Jesus has for
[2:17:55] you eternal
[2:17:58] life what greater Prophet to
[2:18:01] receive what greater name to receive him
[2:18:05] in what greater reward could there
[2:18:10] be and he that receiveth a righteous
[2:18:14] man in the name of a righteous man
[2:18:18] who is
[2:18:19] righteous you I one of the
[2:18:25] prophets
[2:18:26] Jesus we are
[2:18:29] righteous through the blood of Jesus
[2:18:32] Christ he alone is the righteous
[2:18:35] one he that receiveth a righteous
[2:18:41] man in the name of a
[2:18:43] righteous shall
[2:18:45] receive a righteous man's
[2:18:50] I believe Jesus was speaking of
[2:18:56] himself for there is no righteous man
[2:19:00] for there is no righteous
[2:19:04] man with a greater
[2:19:07] reward than this
[2:19:09] man our
[2:19:11] Lord Jesus
[2:19:14] Christ in
[2:19:16] closing and and whosoever shall give to
[2:19:19] drink unto one of these my little ones a
[2:19:22] cup of cold water
[2:19:26] only in the name of a
[2:19:30] disciple barely I say unto you he shall
[2:19:33] in no wise lose his
[2:19:37] reward as we stand to our feet
[2:19:46] this
[2:19:50] each and every one this
[2:19:53] morning has a
[2:19:55] reward given of
[2:19:59] God you can't lose
[2:20:02] it because because you didn't pay for
[2:20:06] it you can't lose it because you missed
[2:20:08] the
[2:20:11] payment the price has been paid in
[2:20:15] full and to whom that
[2:20:18] believeth all things are
[2:20:21] possible the price has already been
[2:20:25] paid the turtle dove in the in the
[2:20:28] vessel of
[2:20:31] clay has paid the price and the blood
[2:20:35] has been
[2:20:36] shed and you are the turtle
[2:20:40] duve sprinkled with the blood of
[2:20:43] Jesus now I say to
[2:20:46] you
