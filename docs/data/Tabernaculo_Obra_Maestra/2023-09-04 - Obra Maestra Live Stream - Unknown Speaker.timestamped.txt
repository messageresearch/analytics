[54:34] done for us
[54:36] foreign
[55:36] foreign
[55:59] Revelations 13 and and verse 8.
[56:04] Revelations 13
[56:06] is a chapter that begins
[56:10] I'm speaking about this great Beast that
[56:12] was to rise up
[56:15] this Beast will be will be a man
[56:19] will be Satan incarnate in a man satanas
[56:23] and it'll be he will be a one world
[56:26] leader he said and the Bible says that
[56:29] it was given to this one world leader is
[56:39] he will be the king of all the Earth
[56:42] he will be the president of every nation
[56:47] then how can we still have wars
[56:50] the whole world has only one Global
[56:53] Leadership
[56:54] the Bible says it was given to him
[56:58] once he controls the whole earth
[57:02] to make war with the Saints
[57:06] those have been who have been sanctified
[57:13] and power was given him over all
[57:16] kindreds and tongues and Nations
[57:21] that means he was a one worldly
[57:24] significance
[57:25] he was a global leader
[57:29] it's what all the nations are talking
[57:31] about today
[57:33] it's what they claim will fix all of our
[57:36] problems
[57:38] and will make your lives
[57:46] but God has a plan now
[57:49] to take you out of this world before
[57:53] this plan comes into us
[57:56] this prophecy begins to unfold
[58:00] a character
[58:07] and revealing foreign
[58:13] uh
[58:45] is
[58:53] unfold your word to us
[58:57] as only you can you're the Lamb of God
[59:04] for the book is yours
[59:07] we ask all this in Jesus name
[59:10] amen amen you may be seated
[59:17] Revelations 13 and 8.
[59:20] it says in all that dwell upon the Earth
[59:23] shall worship him
[59:27] again and all that dwell upon the Earth
[59:31] shall worship Him
[59:39] and all that dwell upon the Earth shall
[59:42] worship him
[59:44] but there's only but there's one
[59:46] exception
[59:48] whose names are not written in the Book
[59:52] of Life of the lamb slain from the
[59:55] foundation of the world
[1:00:03] where did God know your name
[1:00:06] from the foundation of the world
[1:00:09] but when were you born on the Earth
[1:00:12] I didn't come till 1956.
[1:00:16] but he knew my name is
[1:00:28] before I was the son of Angel and
[1:00:31] Francis
[1:00:34] I was a Son of God
[1:00:37] before the foundation
[1:00:40] my name was in this book is
[1:00:48] whose names were written in the Book of
[1:00:51] Life of the Lambs
[1:00:54] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:00:58] will escape this Great Tribulation
[1:01:04] so this book is when did it begin turn
[1:01:08] with me to Matthew chapter one
[1:01:15] Matthew chapter 1 and verse 1.
[1:01:19] and it reads like this the book Libro
[1:01:23] the book Libro of the generation
[1:01:27] of Jesus Christ
[1:01:30] the son of Abraham
[1:01:35] the book had begun
[1:01:37] the book was a new testamento the book
[1:01:42] was the New Covenant
[1:01:44] the Old Testament the old covenants it
[1:01:48] only spoke of this book
[1:01:50] types
[1:01:53] but the day would come when they would
[1:01:56] no longer kill natural Lambs
[1:01:59] when they would no longer kill a natural
[1:02:02] heifers
[1:02:04] when the life of that animal
[1:02:07] that Israel would sacrifice
[1:02:10] God would receive it to cover their sins
[1:02:14] but they were never changed
[1:02:19] a man would be Godzilla numbers
[1:02:25] to take this book where your name was
[1:02:28] written
[1:02:29] a Revelations
[1:02:35] Uno
[1:03:00] this was the
[1:03:02] prophecya Behold a virgin shall be your
[1:03:06] child
[1:03:07] bring forth a son
[1:03:10] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:03:13] it's being interpreted is God With Us
[1:03:20] it's the book is
[1:03:23] it was spoken of this prophecy 700 years
[1:03:26] ago
[1:03:29] this day in the life of this little lady
[1:03:34] this scriptures
[1:03:37] and there are scriptures in the words
[1:03:45] Santo
[1:04:04] Jesus
[1:04:35] isn't Jesus the way of the truth and the
[1:04:37] line
[1:04:39] that's a pretty powerful statement
[1:04:43] and what about Peter Pedro a backslidden
[1:04:47] fisherman
[1:04:48] [Music]
[1:04:50] who said repent and be baptized
[1:04:55] so then the fight goes
[1:05:23] because they have no Revelations
[1:05:40] I'm sure your Bible readers you all
[1:05:43] remember it
[1:05:47] it was really a parable
[1:05:49] speaking about two seeds the seed of God
[1:05:53] and the seed of the surface
[1:05:56] Children of the kingdom of God
[1:05:59] and Children of the devil you realize
[1:06:02] that there's two fathers of this human
[1:06:03] race
[1:06:06] this Parable Jesus was revealing it is
[1:06:16] [Music]
[1:06:39] Anointed of the Holy Spirit to reach
[1:06:42] back into the Old Testament
[1:06:44] to pull forth a prophecy
[1:06:47] and he and he declares the prophecy
[1:06:50] declare La prophecya here in verse 34.
[1:06:53] Matthew 13. he said all these things
[1:06:57] spake Jesus unto the multitude in
[1:06:59] Parables
[1:07:02] and without a parable
[1:07:05] not unto them
[1:07:07] the ministry of Jesus
[1:07:10] and everything he says
[1:07:12] was in Parables it may sound very
[1:07:16] literal when you read it
[1:07:19] but God was hiding something in The
[1:07:22] Parables
[1:07:29] of his ministry
[1:07:36] all these things fake Jesus unto the
[1:07:38] multitude and Parables Jesus
[1:07:47] yeah without a parable
[1:07:50] spoke not unto them the multitude
[1:07:54] why did he do it this way that it might
[1:07:58] be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[1:08:01] prophet
[1:08:02] I will open my mouth in Parables
[1:08:06] things which have been kept secret from
[1:08:09] the foundation of the world
[1:08:13] the lamb and Cordero was opening up his
[1:08:16] books and his Plan of Salvation that was
[1:08:20] in the mind of God
[1:08:22] even before his children
[1:08:25] just like your name
[1:08:27] is
[1:08:39] for you were even in your mother's womb
[1:08:44] the Bible continues
[1:08:47] same thought and theme foreign
[1:09:45] last child comes in
[1:10:02] since the foundation of the world
[1:10:05] these things that he would speak to us
[1:10:07] and teach us
[1:10:09] were things that he was teaching to Adam
[1:10:11] and Eve
[1:10:15] from this tutorship they fell from this
[1:10:19] mentorship
[1:10:21] they fell from this apprenticeship okay
[1:10:35] my word will not return to me voice
[1:10:38] I'll have a man that takes me at his
[1:10:41] words
[1:10:51] he created a body of Flesh
[1:10:55] the human body he created
[1:10:58] the human body he created
[1:11:01] was called the Son of God
[1:11:05] but it wasn't
[1:11:07] foreign
[1:11:46] as a man once asked
[1:11:52] how many gods do you have
[1:11:55] just one
[1:11:57] he says that's ridiculous
[1:12:08] Jesus Christ
[1:12:14] the body was called
[1:12:18] equal adios
[1:12:20] but God went into that vessel
[1:12:23] and in that body the Bible tells us
[1:12:35] not three Gods one God
[1:12:39] in three manifestations
[1:12:41] but the father
[1:12:44] the ministry of the father
[1:12:47] brought in the ministry of the sun
[1:12:50] you are in the ministry of the Holy
[1:12:52] Spirit
[1:12:59] God the Father we couldn't touch him
[1:13:05] Israel on the mountains
[1:13:24] selection
[1:13:40] [Music]
[1:13:59] more than we even desire to be close to
[1:14:02] him
[1:14:08] when he came down and was made
[1:14:12] the style of his ministries
[1:14:24] Psalms 78
[1:14:39] and verse one
[1:14:43] it begins with moshil of ASAP
[1:14:51] this is the Scribe of this song
[1:14:54] his name was
[1:14:56] he was the son of ASAP foreign
[1:15:00] speaks
[1:15:10] as if though it's him saying it is
[1:15:14] all prophetic utterances they
[1:15:21] of the prophets they speak in the first
[1:15:24] person
[1:15:25] and you wonder is he talking about
[1:15:27] himself
[1:15:32] he was anointing of Jehovah
[1:15:35] to leave this prophecies if you have
[1:15:38] been there the day he said it is
[1:15:49] because he said give ear o my people
[1:15:56] and his friends and cousins sitting
[1:15:59] there is
[1:16:05] a child
[1:16:10] it was one of the the naughtiest Boys
[1:16:12] around
[1:16:14] but now he's being an anointed of God
[1:16:18] and he says give here all my people
[1:16:22] incline your ears to the words of my
[1:16:25] mouth
[1:16:27] I will open my mouth in a parable
[1:16:31] I will utter dark sayings of old hablade
[1:16:36] which we have heard and known and our
[1:16:39] fathers have told us
[1:16:42] we will not hide them from their
[1:16:44] children
[1:16:46] to the generation to come
[1:16:49] the Praises of the Lord
[1:16:53] and his wonderful Works yes
[1:16:58] I will open my mouth
[1:17:06] the Holy Spirit anointed this is
[1:17:10] to the heart and mind of Matthew
[1:17:16] a prophecy that had been laying in the
[1:17:19] old
[1:17:20] testamento for over a thousand years
[1:17:24] but that day
[1:17:26] that day there in Jerusalem
[1:17:30] that day Matthew
[1:17:32] a man of God
[1:17:37] of the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:17:42] opens his mouth
[1:17:51] giving us the style of Ministry
[1:17:57] of the Lamb of God
[1:18:03] now with that said
[1:18:05] let's turn to Matthew
[1:18:08] 28. and verse 19.
[1:18:14] Jesus Jesus is about to ascend on highs
[1:18:19] he's gone through his death burial and
[1:18:22] resurrection
[1:18:26] and he gives the last commission to the
[1:18:28] church
[1:18:29] and verse 17 says in Matthew 28 and when
[1:18:36] they saw him
[1:18:37] they worshiped him
[1:18:39] but some doubt it
[1:18:42] and Jesus came and spoken to them saying
[1:18:47] don't doubt don't do that because all
[1:18:50] power is given unto me
[1:18:54] and in Earth then he says
[1:19:00] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[1:19:08] in the name of the father
[1:19:14] hmm
[1:19:16] did he mean what he said he said
[1:19:19] he did
[1:19:21] he say it the way he wanted to say it
[1:19:24] is
[1:19:27] did he speak it in a prophetic Parable
[1:19:32] so was it literally
[1:19:35] no no he used these words
[1:19:39] to hide the secrets that he would reveal
[1:19:43] to his children
[1:19:46] about three
[1:19:48] Pentecost
[1:19:53] this prophecy is
[1:20:05] given the keys
[1:20:20] how do you enter into this Kingdom
[1:20:25] respirito real baptized
[1:20:29] there's only one door
[1:20:32] and Peter was given the keys
[1:20:39] the Holy Spirit
[1:20:41] God who spoke here
[1:20:45] therefore and teach All Nations
[1:20:56] you see how it's written
[1:20:58] it doesn't say baptizing them in the
[1:21:01] name
[1:21:03] father son Holy Ghost
[1:21:06] it says baptizing them in the name of
[1:21:09] the father
[1:21:11] and of the Sun and of the Holy Ghost not
[1:21:16] in the name don't go baptize in the name
[1:21:18] father son holy ghosts yes
[1:21:52] why because so was it spoken by the
[1:21:56] prophets
[1:22:00] that when he comes
[1:22:02] we would speak in Parables
[1:22:06] and without a parable he would not speak
[1:22:11] so everything he spoke somebody say
[1:22:17] s
[1:22:21] so what would it'll take to understand a
[1:22:24] prophetic Parable
[1:22:28] it'll take the author
[1:22:30] personally revealing personality
[1:22:37] right so Matthew 2019
[1:22:39] it's true it's the word of God
[1:22:45] something is hidden within this
[1:22:48] prophetic Parable Dentures
[1:22:56] to open up this prophecies
[1:23:02] in the book of Acts
[1:23:04] chapter 2. how many remember it
[1:23:08] how many love it
[1:23:21] we'll begin at verse 36.
[1:23:26] the day of Pentecost had fully come
[1:23:30] you know that's what the prophecy was
[1:23:32] when Jesus
[1:23:35] Took the book by The Scroll of Isaiah
[1:23:40] in the synagogue they're in Nazareth
[1:23:44] and the Bible says the priest took the
[1:23:48] scroll of Nazareth and handed it to
[1:23:50] Jesus
[1:23:54] and Jesus read the first half
[1:23:59] a verse Isaiah 61 verse 1.
[1:24:05] and he stopped in the middle of the
[1:24:07] verse
[1:24:09] because that's all that was going to
[1:24:11] come to pass at that time
[1:24:14] and then he said this day yes
[1:24:21] you know what the prophecy was he was
[1:24:25] speaking of the day of Pentecost foreign
[1:24:48] [Music]
[1:24:57] therefore let all the house of Israel
[1:25:00] know assuredly
[1:25:04] that God has made that same Jesus whom
[1:25:08] he crucified both Lord and Christ Jesus
[1:25:12] Christ
[1:25:16] Lord
[1:25:20] Christ I Cristo that's the Holy Spirit
[1:25:24] and Jesus he Jesus so who is Jesus Jesus
[1:25:28] Jesus Jesus is the Lord Jesus Jesus
[1:25:32] Christ
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:55] and how
[1:25:58] much
[1:26:00] and the birth of Christ
[1:26:06] foreign
[1:26:37] forget which one of them they make books
[1:26:41] they print a book of each child
[1:26:45] pictures
[1:26:47] and somewhere on the internet they'll
[1:26:49] take and they'll have it made into a
[1:26:51] book
[1:26:54] and that book starts with the day the
[1:26:58] little baby was born
[1:27:02] they sent me one or two or three or plus
[1:27:05] about 10 000 pictures to my phone also
[1:27:10] yes
[1:27:11] and you turned the first page
[1:27:15] it's a picture of one of my
[1:27:17] grandchildren yes
[1:27:21] there is a little baby a little note
[1:27:25] he's uh he's two hours
[1:27:29] you turn the page now he's three hours
[1:27:33] you turn the page
[1:27:35] he's a whole eight hours recorded
[1:28:23] therefore verse 36 of Acts 2. let all
[1:28:28] the house of Israel know assured
[1:28:30] that God has made that same Jesus Jesus
[1:28:35] whom he crucified
[1:28:40] in other words
[1:28:49] one God
[1:28:51] changing forms
[1:28:55] because he wanted to get closer
[1:29:03] and many times as she got closer we got
[1:29:08] scared
[1:29:14] and then he'd see us
[1:29:17] and maybe a few months later
[1:29:27] someone would say
[1:29:29] aren't you tired of running don't you
[1:29:32] want to know Jesus
[1:29:34] and we'd get scared again
[1:29:39] oh but he didn't give up on us
[1:29:45] [Music]
[1:29:48] Jesus Savior of my soul tires
[1:30:14] Glory oh Gloria
[1:30:17] therefore let the house of Israel know
[1:30:19] assuredly
[1:30:21] God hath made that same Jesus Jesus
[1:30:26] Christ
[1:30:31] now when they heard this
[1:30:34] they were pricked in there
[1:30:38] and Jesus
[1:30:39] said unto Peter
[1:30:41] and to the rest of the Apostles
[1:30:46] and they said unto Peter and to the rest
[1:30:48] of the Apostles men and Brethren is
[1:30:56] these these men these women
[1:31:00] who were there on the day of Pentecost
[1:31:04] watching 120 people being blessed
[1:31:08] by the Holy Spirit
[1:31:12] in a powerful manner manifestations
[1:31:20] and they were watching him
[1:31:23] and they read these were the ones that
[1:31:26] stood there on crucifixion days
[1:31:30] these are many of whom cried out and
[1:31:33] screamed with the crowd much
[1:31:40] but when they came to this old-fashioned
[1:31:43] meeting
[1:31:45] the Holy Spirit
[1:31:53] the Bible says they were pricked in
[1:31:55] their hearts
[1:31:59] that just a few days earlier
[1:32:04] about 50 days
[1:32:10] remember Jesus
[1:32:12] after his death and burial Jesus
[1:32:20] and was seen of many
[1:32:22] for a period of 40 days
[1:32:25] after 40 days yes
[1:32:44] is
[1:32:47] called the day of pentatives
[1:32:50] and the Holy Spirit
[1:32:54] sovereign
[1:33:24] these people in verse 37.
[1:33:27] these were many of those that 50 days
[1:33:30] prior estos foreign
[1:33:52] when they heard this the Bible says
[1:34:03] what shall we do
[1:34:06] seen that we've blessed in God be in the
[1:34:09] famous blessing that we screamed
[1:34:12] crucified
[1:34:16] their names must have been on the Lamb's
[1:34:19] Book of Life
[1:34:22] you say could a man scream crucify him
[1:34:25] today
[1:34:29] and tomorrow God said I forgive you
[1:34:33] um
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:39] he persecuted
[1:34:42] the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:34:49] that's why he would say
[1:34:54] the chief of Sinners
[1:34:58] but God has made me worthy
[1:35:03] because I'm a Son of God
[1:35:05] because I did I did it in the ignorance
[1:35:10] all the amazing Graceville
[1:35:31] then Peter said unto them
[1:35:34] you not screamed crucify him
[1:35:41] when the Roman soldiers stuck the spear
[1:35:44] in his eyes
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:49] [Applause]
[1:35:54] to all of you Peter said
[1:35:56] I say unto you
[1:35:59] repent repetitos and be baptized
[1:36:05] in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:36:13] Santo
[1:36:17] this day is
[1:36:19] Matthew 28 19.
[1:36:22] the prophecy the professor was fulfilled
[1:36:25] and Matthew 28 19.
[1:36:30] they come together like this
[1:36:34] there's no scripture fighting scriptures
[1:36:36] no
[1:36:43] no one was a prophecy
[1:36:46] because it was the same thing
[1:36:49] from the prophets of Allah
[1:37:00] [Music]
[1:37:13] now your ears can hear it
[1:37:16] your heart
[1:37:27] one of you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:37:37] and when you're baptized that way
[1:37:41] was that company
[1:37:46] foreign
[1:37:54] foreign
[1:38:03] because these men
[1:38:05] and women
[1:38:13] the devil was already working in their
[1:38:15] minds
[1:38:17] yeah okay so you made a mistake okay
[1:38:30] professor
[1:38:35] is
[1:38:40] that the word is a discerner of the
[1:38:43] hearts and intents
[1:38:47] and Peter by the Holy Spirit
[1:38:52] how Satan was trying to drag them people
[1:38:55] down
[1:38:59] where they could say yeah okay I do
[1:39:01] believe he was Messiah
[1:39:04] but it can't be for me I've crossed the
[1:39:08] line
[1:39:11] and Peter by the Holy Spirit
[1:39:27] foreign
[1:39:58] foreign
[1:40:16] then it says and with many other words
[1:40:20] we can testify and exhort
[1:40:22] s
[1:40:26] from this untoward generation
[1:40:35] and you waited yes pero like I'm waiting
[1:40:41] and the Bible says then they gladly
[1:40:44] received his word
[1:40:46] verse 41.
[1:40:51] foreign
[1:41:34] foreign
[1:42:04] would come to set them free
[1:42:08] but not free as kings
[1:42:14] the freedom was Supernatural
[1:42:17] Freedom was in your heart
[1:42:20] the freedom was to be set from from the
[1:42:23] from the lust of the flesh
[1:42:27] the pride of life that's what this king
[1:42:40] of Jesus Christ God yes
[1:42:47] at the end of descending with one
[1:42:50] purpose has been his descending
[1:42:54] to get closer to you
[1:42:57] remember Thessalonians
[1:43:03] the Lord himself
[1:43:08] now Paul is speaking in Parables
[1:43:12] speaking in symbols
[1:43:17] because it was the way of Jesus
[1:43:20] now it was the way of this messenger
[1:43:23] because he was being led of the Holy
[1:43:26] Spirit
[1:43:27] he said and the Lord himself
[1:43:33] the voice of the archangels
[1:43:37] what was it it was a three-part mystery
[1:43:42] of the ministry of Christ that is
[1:43:49] prophet
[1:43:53] we have been speaking
[1:43:56] El Domingo and we're just going to start
[1:43:58] right now
[1:44:00] what I just said that was extra okay no
[1:44:04] charge
[1:44:06] but this new order this new ministry
[1:44:10] can we entitled it prophets and priests
[1:44:13] in the laws
[1:44:15] and Prophets and Priests no law
[1:44:18] professors
[1:44:21] because some think that the prophetic
[1:44:24] Ministry ended foreign
[1:44:41] [Music]
[1:45:15] it was two two ministries of the same
[1:45:18] person
[1:45:20] Jesus right queso Cristo
[1:45:24] it began coming so with a new order of
[1:45:27] prophets
[1:45:28] which was John the Baptist
[1:45:34] Luke chapter one Lucas Capital Uno
[1:45:42] Luke chapter one
[1:45:44] will begin at verse
[1:45:47] 13.
[1:45:51] as you remember the story
[1:45:54] of Zechariah Elizabeth
[1:45:58] Zechariah was a priest
[1:46:00] and it happened to be that this time
[1:46:05] that Zechariah as a Levi the priest
[1:46:10] had come his time that he would burn
[1:46:12] incense
[1:46:17] represents prayers ascending up high
[1:46:19] incense
[1:46:21] and he was to burn incense for the for
[1:46:24] the for the for for the for all of
[1:46:26] Israel
[1:46:28] Israel as a prayer unto God
[1:46:31] interceding for the people
[1:46:34] so Zechariah goes into the temple
[1:46:39] and and outside is a whole multitude of
[1:46:43] people yes
[1:46:50] and while Zechariah goes into the temple
[1:46:54] the Bible says it appears unto him an
[1:46:57] angel of the Lord
[1:47:25] the teachings and the rituals
[1:47:31] and he's a big man yes
[1:47:35] the Bible says he was trouble
[1:47:40] in verse 13.
[1:47:45] for thy prayer is
[1:47:48] Zechariah was an old man
[1:47:53] Elizabeth
[1:48:00] and Zechariah is still praying
[1:48:04] Lord I'd like to have a service
[1:48:11] and the Bible says the angel tells him
[1:48:14] you're not Zechariah
[1:48:16] thy prayer is heard and thy wife
[1:48:20] Elizabeth shall bear the son
[1:48:22] and thou shall call his name John yeah
[1:48:25] and thou shall have joy and gladness and
[1:48:29] many shall rejoice at his birth
[1:48:34] for he shall be great in the sight of
[1:48:36] the Lord
[1:48:38] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[1:48:42] drink
[1:48:44] it was the beginning of a new ministry
[1:48:48] under the old
[1:48:50] testamento they still drink wine
[1:48:53] from time to time they would take strong
[1:48:55] drink
[1:48:58] even the priests
[1:49:01] but now a new ministry has begun
[1:49:05] he was to be an example to a new
[1:49:07] generation
[1:49:11] he was the first fruits
[1:49:17] of this new generation
[1:49:19] this Prophet is
[1:49:22] more than a prophet it was a forerunner
[1:49:25] to the first coming of Christ he will
[1:49:29] was to live a certain way
[1:49:31] and his life was to be an example all
[1:49:35] who followed would live is
[1:49:39] for he shall be great in the sight of
[1:49:41] the Lord
[1:49:43] and shall drink neither wine nor strong
[1:49:48] and he shall be filled with the Holy
[1:49:50] Ghost
[1:49:51] even from his mother's womb
[1:49:57] sometimes we think about
[1:50:00] how old or how young you must be abuses
[1:50:08] [Music]
[1:50:10] it seems like there's a Bible principle
[1:50:12] here
[1:50:16] that says you can't be too young
[1:50:20] and you can't be too old
[1:50:29] Jesus
[1:50:33] John received it
[1:50:35] even from his mother's womb
[1:50:38] and it's at verse 16. basically he says
[1:50:41] and many of the children of Israel shall
[1:50:43] he turn to the Lord their God
[1:50:48] because Israel had long left
[1:50:54] God was not with Israel
[1:50:57] Israel at this time
[1:50:59] they had long abandoned his statutes
[1:51:05] remember that day
[1:51:07] on Pilots tribunals
[1:51:12] when when pilate said to to the high
[1:51:16] priest
[1:51:18] and the children of Israel
[1:51:38] what shall I do get it with the king of
[1:51:41] the Jews
[1:51:45] and then the high Priests of Israel
[1:51:47] Israel
[1:51:49] anointed of Lucifer um
[1:51:57] we have no King
[1:51:59] but Caesar
[1:52:04] Israel Israel had rejected
[1:52:08] the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:52:10] is
[1:52:13] the opening of this book
[1:52:20] Israel had rejected
[1:52:23] when Jesus loosed the Seven Seals
[1:52:27] because Seven Seals on the Lamb's Book
[1:52:31] of Life
[1:52:35] but when the seals were loose foreign
[1:53:15] how do we know it's the Lamb's books
[1:53:19] because the first picture was taken
[1:53:22] there's Jesus is a baby just eight years
[1:53:26] old they're going to take them to be
[1:53:28] circumcised
[1:53:31] foreign
[1:54:14] that's what God uses prophets foreign
[1:54:57] he Cristo
[1:54:59] what do I do now Peter said this is what
[1:55:04] you have to do
[1:55:06] of how you've been living
[1:55:08] of how you've been talking about how
[1:55:12] you've been treating your wife
[1:55:14] how you've been treating your husband
[1:55:17] of how you've been treating your
[1:55:19] children
[1:55:27] it'll make you a better father it'll
[1:55:30] make you a better mother
[1:55:32] make you a better son
[1:55:34] this baptism so this not only of water
[1:55:39] baptism that brought the John said God
[1:55:41] would give you
[1:55:43] a baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:55:48] fire is a cleanser
[1:55:55] completely
[1:56:01] but the original part original
[1:56:07] Gabriel speaking to Zechariah
[1:56:10] of John his son
[1:56:14] telling him who he was and what he would
[1:56:18] do telling him about his ministry that
[1:56:21] he would have
[1:56:22] in verse 17.
[1:56:25] and he shall go before him in the spirit
[1:56:29] and power of Elias foreign
[1:56:45] hmm he's the Elijah Ministry
[1:56:48] he will be the Forerunner to the first
[1:56:52] coming of Christ and he will turn the
[1:56:54] hearts of the fathers to the children
[1:56:58] and the disobedient to the wisdom of the
[1:57:01] just
[1:57:02] to make ready a people prepared for the
[1:57:05] Lord
[1:57:09] is this prophetic Ministry
[1:57:13] was part of the preparation
[1:57:16] for God's people
[1:57:19] Gabriel was quoting the prophet Malachi
[1:57:21] Gabriel
[1:57:22] turn with me to the Book of Malachi yes
[1:57:35] The Book of Malachi chapter four
[1:57:38] and verse
[1:57:40] begins with speaking of the unend time
[1:57:43] prophecy
[1:57:46] where the whole Earth would be burned up
[1:57:50] for the proud and the wicked would be
[1:57:52] made stubble
[1:57:55] um
[1:57:59] he goes on to say after he brings this
[1:58:03] statement of judgment to the whole earth
[1:58:07] then he brings then he turns it to the
[1:58:10] positive side
[1:58:12] and he says but unto you that fear my
[1:58:15] name is
[1:58:18] Lord Jesus Christ aren't you that fear
[1:58:22] my name is
[1:58:35] [Music]
[1:58:46] and he said
[1:58:50] shall tread down the wicked after this
[1:58:54] world is all burned to us foreign
[1:59:20] I'm doing something
[1:59:22] new
[1:59:23] I'm doing something different and yet
[1:59:27] I'm doing something that the prophets
[1:59:28] have spoken
[1:59:31] in types
[1:59:35] in allegories in Psalms in symbols in
[1:59:40] metaphors
[1:59:46] foreign
[2:00:17] I'm going to send you Elijah the prophet
[2:00:22] before I do what I told you in verse one
[2:00:25] that I was going to do
[2:00:28] oh this Bible is written
[2:00:31] behold I send you lies the prophet
[2:00:34] before the coming and great and Dreadful
[2:00:36] day of the Lord
[2:00:39] okay okay what will he do this
[2:00:44] shall turn the heart of the father is
[2:00:49] that what Gabriel told Zechariah
[2:00:54] and there's a comma you know
[2:00:57] apart
[2:01:08] because the first part is
[2:01:23] Jesus
[2:01:35] Nina
[2:01:40] he'll do it that way
[2:01:44] when he rises up the second Elijah
[2:01:48] at the end of time for a world is
[2:01:52] destroyed
[2:01:53] he'll do it for one purpose
[2:01:56] to once again
[2:02:05] because the book was lost
[2:02:09] for over 1500 years
[2:02:15] after 300 years
[2:02:18] after the Resurrection
[2:02:21] The Rose up a church
[2:02:23] called the Roman Catholic church
[2:02:27] and it took all the books
[2:02:30] took all the writings of the prophets
[2:02:34] and forbade the people
[2:02:39] and no one had a Bible no one had the
[2:02:42] scriptures no one had the Gospels
[2:02:55] even if they had them most of them
[2:02:57] couldn't read
[2:02:59] so how did they survive
[2:03:04] how did they ignore Jesus
[2:03:07] by a personal experience
[2:03:12] by a born-again experience
[2:03:16] did you know you can be born again
[2:03:19] and not even know how to read it
[2:03:22] did you know that you can receive the
[2:03:25] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[2:03:27] and never have gone to school even one
[2:03:30] day
[2:03:33] you know that you don't need an
[2:03:35] education
[2:03:41] leader Pedro upon this Russia
[2:03:46] gates of hell yes
[2:03:55] and what school did Peter go yeah
[2:03:58] first grade second grade did he have a
[2:04:03] college education
[2:04:05] no no
[2:04:06] the the Bible says he couldn't even he
[2:04:08] was illiterate couldn't even write life
[2:04:14] did he make it to Junior High yeah
[2:04:17] didn't even know what that was
[2:04:20] surely he got into he was into
[2:04:22] Elementary School and went to the sixth
[2:04:24] grade
[2:04:26] he never even went to first grade
[2:04:30] he didn't even know what kindergarten
[2:04:32] was kinder
[2:04:34] he almost went right from the crib to
[2:04:36] fishing with his Dad
[2:04:39] he had no education
[2:04:44] but one day perundian God gave him
[2:04:48] Revelations
[2:04:52] he had an experience with Jesus Christ
[2:04:58] he got to know him in the power of his
[2:05:00] resurrection
[2:05:03] and it made him a man Fearless
[2:05:08] that when they finally took him
[2:05:09] prisoners
[2:05:11] one of many times
[2:05:21] history tells us
[2:05:24] that he told his executioners
[2:05:31] hang me upside down on the cross
[2:05:35] I'm not worthy to die like my Lord
[2:05:42] what gave him that courage
[2:05:47] a born-again experience
[2:06:02] wants to make you a new creation
[2:06:07] if you'll stop running
[2:06:09] and turn around
[2:06:11] and bow is
[2:06:21] I I've been going to church for 10 years
[2:06:24] now
[2:06:27] hmm
[2:06:29] going to church
[2:06:31] doesn't make your new creation
[2:06:34] no no
[2:06:35] repentance
[2:06:39] obedience obedient to God's words
[2:06:45] going to church
[2:06:51] makes you a legalist yes
[2:06:55] that's the way of death
[2:06:59] we come to know the Lord
[2:07:01] but when we repentance and are baptized
[2:07:06] if we're truly repentance
[2:07:10] when the man
[2:07:12] baptizes you in water
[2:07:16] person truly repented
[2:07:18] God is
[2:07:28] and you'll never be the same again
[2:07:38] Islam's book of life
[2:07:40] it
[2:07:44] was John the Baptista
[2:07:47] he was to be he was to introduce this
[2:07:51] Lamb of God
[2:07:53] we read of his ministry in Isaiah 40.
[2:07:57] and he said yes
[2:07:58] how he would come and and The Way It Was
[2:08:02] Written
[2:08:03] it was also written
[2:08:05] in a way
[2:08:07] there was hidden hidden from the eyes of
[2:08:11] the wise Improvement
[2:08:13] It Was Written in the story
[2:08:17] it was written in a type in a shadow
[2:08:21] God did it to hide it
[2:08:24] so that he would only reveal it
[2:08:26] to his children to the wise version
[2:08:31] the prophecy of Isaiah 40. I read it
[2:08:36] it was the first coming of Christ
[2:08:40] it was a prophecy right out of the
[2:08:42] Lamb's Book of Life
[2:08:45] because it spoke of Pardon it spoke that
[2:08:49] he would comfort his people
[2:08:51] spoke that he would prepare their ways
[2:08:54] to receive salvation he said Comfort ye
[2:08:58] Comfort ye my people
[2:09:00] sayeth your God
[2:09:04] speak comfortably to Jerusalem
[2:09:07] Israel tell Jerusalem said that when I
[2:09:11] come
[2:09:12] your Warfare is accomplished
[2:09:15] I'll fight your battles
[2:09:21] Jesus Christ this morning
[2:09:24] is speaking to your heart
[2:09:27] he wants to tell you
[2:09:29] your Warfare is accomplished
[2:09:38] [Music]
[2:10:00] [Music]
[2:10:22] for your iniquities
[2:10:26] you can find Rest in Me
[2:10:31] how will it come come this I'll start it
[2:10:33] this way I'll send the voice of him
[2:10:37] crying in the wilderness
[2:10:39] he'll help prepare the way
[2:10:42] he's going to introduce me to you
[2:10:45] because Israel no longer knew how to
[2:10:48] recognize Jehovah Jesus
[2:10:52] Israel hadn't felt the presence in
[2:10:54] Jehovah in a few thousand years
[2:11:00] Israel wasn't what was a religious
[2:11:02] organization
[2:11:05] God wasn't in it anymore
[2:11:11] [Music]
[2:11:18] where God wants us
[2:11:22] into a personal experience
[2:11:28] true
[2:11:48] it said he would make straight in the
[2:11:50] desert
[2:11:55] what is this speak of
[2:12:00] building roles
[2:12:02] no no no no
[2:12:08] it spoke of a change
[2:12:12] then this is a great change
[2:12:16] every Valley shall be exalted
[2:12:19] that's a great change
[2:12:29] the Crooked shall be made straight
[2:12:33] that's a great change
[2:12:35] and the rough places
[2:12:43] that's a great chance
[2:12:46] so the so the five steps
[2:12:50] of the ministry of the lives
[2:12:54] was going to bring five things Israel
[2:12:59] foreign
[2:13:26] when we who are alive and remains
[2:13:35] Elijah Minnesota
[2:13:40] was being bringing great change
[2:13:44] no longer the law of Moses
[2:13:47] no longer thou shall not kill yeah
[2:13:52] Thou shalt not commit adultery
[2:13:54] that was over yesterday
[2:13:59] you say
[2:14:01] wait a minute
[2:14:03] seems to me that thou shall not kill is
[2:14:06] a good thing to practice
[2:14:13] the human race has failed to practice it
[2:14:19] that's what wars since the beginning of
[2:14:22] time this is
[2:14:24] Cain killed his brother
[2:14:30] Thou shalt not kill the Commandments
[2:14:34] it didn't work it's never worked
[2:14:42] had a new plan for his children
[2:14:45] but there had to come a man
[2:14:48] that would take God in his words
[2:14:53] a man who was a Kinsman to you and I um
[2:14:58] who could redeem us
[2:15:00] so that Upon Our Redemption
[2:15:03] a door in heaven would be open
[2:15:07] and now we could have a birth
[2:15:10] Immaculate birth
[2:15:13] like Jesus
[2:15:14] the born-again experience
[2:15:22] universe
[2:15:42] and when Jesus said the law and the
[2:15:46] prophets were until June
[2:15:49] he says since then he said they
[2:15:51] sentences the kingdom of God is preached
[2:15:54] to see what happens the prophetic
[2:15:57] ministry didn't end up what they would
[2:16:01] preach
[2:16:03] now they would preach lives
[2:16:17] what will he do at the second coming of
[2:16:19] Christ
[2:16:20] what's she looking to do in your life
[2:16:24] if Jesus Christ
[2:16:30] what he wants to bring to you
[2:16:33] when you feel his presence
[2:16:39] it's the same five things
[2:16:43] that he promised to the first election
[2:16:53] and when God pulls at your heart
[2:16:57] bring you into repentance
[2:16:59] it's because there's five things he
[2:17:01] wants to do is
[2:17:16] is
[2:17:38] Supernatural
[2:17:42] foreign
[2:18:06] of an oak tree they say probably
[2:18:13] that seed has no that you can see the
[2:18:16] seed has no leaves
[2:18:20] you hold it in your hands I don't see
[2:18:24] any Roots if it's a fruit tree
[2:18:31] there's no apples on it
[2:18:34] it's a tiny little seed
[2:18:36] but when you lay it in Fertile ground
[2:18:39] and it begins to grow
[2:18:43] is
[2:19:27] is
[2:19:49] the Bible holds the plan of God
[2:19:56] this is the Lamb's Book of Life
[2:20:00] because
[2:20:02] started speaking of the Lamb's birth
[2:20:07] when all the way speaking of the Lamb's
[2:20:10] death
[2:20:12] then it spoke of the Lamb's resurrection
[2:20:16] of the Lamb being glorified
[2:20:19] and sitting at the right hand of the
[2:20:22] throne
[2:20:26] giving us a chance
[2:20:30] to ask God for forgiveness
[2:20:35] and
[2:20:36] ask him this morning Lord Jesus
[2:20:42] foreign
[2:21:14] that you would reveal this president
[2:21:28] we could come to be a pistols
[2:21:34] and our lives
[2:21:36] of the Saving Grace
[2:21:39] of Jesus Christ that three thousand
[2:21:42] could be born in a day
[2:21:44] and if not three thousands
