let's sing that uh one more time from the very [Music] beginning [Music] last verse [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] God bless you all this morning good to be here once again in the house of God and of course what makes it a house of God is that God's people are here those that love him those that love him and those that he has loved he gave his life on Calvary tree he gave his life on calvary's tree just just so you and I could be here this morning for without the sacrifice that he did we couldn't be here this morning we'd have no hope but because of what he did that's why each and every one of you are here this morning because something from eternity touched every each and every one of you maybe you weren't even conscious of this of this of it this morning that how God was pulling you to be here and when I say to be here I mean in his presence with Saints of like Precious Faith you love him this morning we know you do we we uh as a brother can you mention we want to keep our brother Jonathan and his family in prayer Jonathan s [Music] they're in uh some meetings they're in uh I think uh in New Mexico I believe they went with his father and our brother Joshua also who was uh in Mexico they in Magdalena this today this weekend going to keep them all in prayer and um we also want to pray for a a young man uh I say young man he's probably in his early 40s and his name is is Isaiah Johnson Johnson some of you may know his brother uh Elijah Johnson El Elijah Johnson a brother there in uh press Arizona and this is his younger brother who could never quite get the victory I think as a young man he went to church a [Music] bit but of course he came from a troubled family so so the mother and father never really did help him to find Christ a young man who wound up in prison for five years he has three children divorced and then married and then uh so so his is the story of almost every human being on planet Earth who hasn't surrendered their lives to Jesus Christ uh and what happens is they keep going deeper in sin they keep breaking relationship after relationship and and they keep doing the same thing over and over again and when you talk to them they'll they're hoping something will change but but nothing will change until until they change their ways until he changes the friends he hangs with until he changes the places he goes to instead of places of entertainment break the cycle of death and say I'll go to the house of God whether I feel like it or don't feel like it whether whether I feel like it I'll go to the house of God because I'm wanting to break the grip that death has on me I want to be broken loose from Satan's grip and that's the way we spoke to this young man Isaiah I text him this morning and uh a scripture and uh he's a heavy smoker but that's really the least of his problems that's the least because we realize that those are the attributes of his unbelief if he can ever break the cycle if he can ever let God pull him out pull him out of the claws of the devil then he'll be free and to do that all he has to do is believe of the overcoming power that God gave us on the cross of Calvary he he sent me a text back he said Dan he says I need prayer I told him this morning that we would be praying for him that the Saints many who have gone through like fiery trials many that have gone through fiery Tri trials and God has given them deliverance and hope these are the ones that'll be praying for you this morning told so we'd like to take a moment to stand to our feet and help me to keep a promise to this young man whose life and family is falling apart again he's fallen apart many times but now it's happening again and we want to pray for him this morning the Holy Spirit would reach out to that little part wherever he is he's living and Shake all the world out of him and set him free let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this morning Lord and by the prayer of your Saints this morning we send the enforcer we we send the enforcer the great Holy Spirit the great enforcer to lose him Lord that he might believe that he might believe that all things are possible and that everything that is going on in his life can be changed because to him that believeth of what Jesus did for them on the cross of Calvary all these things are possible we thank you now in Jesus name amen amen may be seated just for a moment of course I also want to welcome my friend Emanuel who's here with us this morning uel so God bless you it's good to see you we'd like to see you every Sunday and Wednesday because we love you and appreciate you and we're still and I'm and I'm believing that God has a great future for you a great future in Christ um we also will be uh also the remember the the Hernandez family brother iseland brother brother is mentioned they were all going to be in San Diego this weekend told me remember traveling mercies for them also and last of all uh I leave tonight about midnight and uh take a take a flight as you know we're heading to Congo Africa there for a dedication of a new church with our the pastor and friend our brother [Music] rapael they're in brazaville Congo in bra Congo so we're looking forward to to arriving there we're not looking forward to the journey so much it's about 30 hours to from the time I leave here to the time we get there so I'll probably uh sleep in the plane and the airport more than once but we're certainly looking uh forward to God uh blessing God's people over there and whenever God sends you somewhere Satan always tries to upset what's going what's happening whenever God sends you somewhere Satan will always try to upset your journey and uh of course it's no different this time either uh was I think it was last week week or a week and a half or two ago that we were me and Karen going to breakfast and we got rear ended and the car hit us at about 40 mil an hour yeah so so that's where it began and then uh I was um um I was just the other morning looking at some emails in uh the the airlines Air France that we're traveling with uh told said that I needed to upload a certificate of uh of my yellow fever vaccine proof and and that was yesterday Saturday so then I start calling around and in different places that Walgreen says that they give [Music] them so I go down there and they said you need a prescription from your doctor to get this and I said it's Saturday my doctor is it's closed so I called their I called the office nonetheless and their answering service answered and I talked to to to the lady there that takes messages she says there this is I can call one of the doctors that's on standby for emergencies and she called back and said well the doctor says he will not write you a prescription for this vaccine you must come in in person I I and she says and that will have to be no l that would have have to be on Monday or later in the week I said no that can't be on Monday I I leave midnight Sunday and they said we're very sorry and they hung up by that time it was already about 1 or two in the afternoon yesterday and uh so I talked to the pharmacist at Walgreens wens and they said no we there's nothing we can do but then she says there is an an emergency service here in Phoenix it's a private company and they might be able to get this done for you yet today so I called them up and and first they said no we don't have any appointments for today I said Lord Jesus I I told them well my situation is I leave to I'm supposed to leave tomorrow night for Congo Africa and without this yellow card vaccine certificate I said the most the furthest I'll get is France and then they won't fly me to Congo and the man says oh he says hold on a minute he puts me on hold and uh he run he called me back he said I found you an appointment in surprise at one of our clinics he says it's at 3:00 can you make it I said yes absolutely so by the grace of God we went down and it is a private company so it it was rather expensive but I am now the proud yellow yellow card holder yellow fever recipient so it seemed like every time we turned around something was happening Satan was trying to upset the journey just makes me to feel that this is ordained of God and there's going to be a blessing for the people down there so of course I said I'm going to finish the day nice and calm now I'll go get my haircut it was about 4:30 the I reached for the door at the barber shop and it's open I said praise the lord it's open and I walk in and the two Barbers are there and and I say how about a haircut the marber said no we shut 30 minutes ago no more haircuts I said Lord Jes J so so I said I I said what if I pay you double the money no she's no we're closed we're closed not even double no I'm sorry so I'm going out the door and the barber says you know just around the corner there's one of those uh they call them Great Clips or something [Music] yeah another barber shop says they might be open I went walking around the corner I grabbed the door it's still open but in my mind I'm thinking that doesn't mean anything anymore in America so the door is open but it's really closed and I walk in and and I said um can I have a haircut the lady says sure sure sure just put your name right here and so that's the way it's gone ever since we the brother invited us and we accepted and every step of the way has been an upward climb just little things taking place and uh last night due to the the the rear end accident we had oh my back and my neck wouldn't let me sleep and so I got up and I slept in a chair in the living room and the pain was was a lot of pain but by this morning God had touched me the pain had gone way down not not that great pain would have stopped me but uh it would have made the trip more difficult so with all the so with all the difficulties that have come and it seemed like every time a door was kind of getting shut then God the way maker continued making a way and it may sound very simple but but it was very important to me and to confirm that we're to go there and be a blessing to the people in con this morning as we stand to our feet we'd like to speak on on perfection and if you'll turn with me starting in Genesis 17 Genesis 17 and beginning at verse one Genesis 17 and verse one and when Abraham was 90 years old and nine the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto him I am the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect and I will make my C between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abraham fell on his face and God talked with him saying and as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations in verse one it says Abraham was 99 years old and and almighty God walked before him and told him at 99 years old and he said be thou perfect could you be too old could it could you be too old would you for God to call you into Perfection he called Abraham at 99 years old he said Abraham walk before me and be thou perfect turn with me to the book of Samuel Samuel chapter 1 1 Samuel Samuel chapter 1 is a is a story of a of a woman and and and she's a woman with no children her name was Hannah and she was the Beloved of of her husband but she had no son she was Barren and she prayed before God when they went one time to to to the temple on a feast day of a Passover time and there she prayed at the altar before the Lord and and and asked of God to give her a son in verse 13 it says now Hannah she spake in her heart only her lips moved but her voice was not heard therefore Eli thought she had been drunken if she was speaking from a perfect heart she didn't have to scream it out for all to hear didn't have to make a big scene of it because God knew her heart the desire of her heart but Eli the priest uh he didn't know her heart he judged her according to the way she looked maybe the way she was dressed he could tell she maybe wasn't a very rich person so he assumed right away that she was drunken that's what that's what all the poor people come do here during the celebration time so not knowing this woman's heart he misjudged her in verse 15 and Hanah answered and said no my Lord I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit it was a good place to start for even Jesus would Le would later say blessed are the poor in spirit you see how that right attitude hasn't changed in thousands of years and God sees the heart and she and she said I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink but have poured out my soul before the Lord that's all it takes for a petition that we have in our hearts for something we want to overcome oh if I could save come sober before the Lord and place your petitions before him and God will hear the Cry of your heart then in verse 16 count count not thy handmade for a daughter of B verse 16 for out of the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken here this too then Eli answered and said go in peace and the god of Israel The Story Goes On and and and God gives Hannah a child but not just any child a prophet and a great prophet in Israel this boy was to be and she had made a promise that when she had weaned him a after after after he was old enough he may have only been a a boy of five years old but she told God that she would give the boy that he had given her and return it back to God that he might serve him all the days of his life and Samuel was taken back to the temple put into the hands of Eli the priest that he too might come to like Abraham to be made perfect so we can't be too young like Samuel and we can't be too old like Abraham that the promise of perfection it's for you and me also we're a lot older than Sam than Samuel but most of us are a lot younger than Abraham so God has a purpose for us he's got a plan and he's calling us to be made perfect let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you this morning ask your blessings upon your people in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated when you look up the word [Music] perfect you'll find it from Genesis to Revelations it's almost in every book in the Bible in Psalms 37 and verse 37 the psalmist says this Mark the perfect man and behold the upright for the end of that man is peace so the word Perfection is found throughout the Bible from Old Testament to New Testament throughout the Book of Job job mentions Perfection over and over again and it's a promise of God Jesus said in Matthew 5:48 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so not only does he call us to Perfection but he gives us an example of whom we're to be like be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect perfect as almighty god is perfect now the struggle for Perfection is that we try to interpret the word maybe using a dictionary or our human reasoning I've shared it before speaking with a man he was a pastor or or one of the pastors they have several of the big denomination in town called the CCV a big mega church here in Phoenix and we began speaking on the word of God and I I began speaking to him about perfection and he immediately told me he says dan he says now you know better than that he said we can never be perfect his name was Bert I said brother Bert if God Jesus himself is the one that encourages to go to Perfection then surely he'll make a way to get there but I think the problem lays the the the problem lays in what we think Perfection is [Music] I said and Perfection it isn't being a better Carpenter it isn't being the most successful businessman it has nothing to do with anything we can with our hands but Perfection as god is perfect is eternal life that's the Perfection that's the only thing that's perfect is God who's Eternal and Jesus said strive to Jesus said to try to go forward to be as Eternal as the father is eternal and for a son and daughter of God if you're a seed of God that's already laying within you and what begins to unfold you un Perfection you say where do we start to go to per Perfection there is a beginning and every son and daughter of God has the same beginning and when you take this beginning you've begun going walking into Perfection now now now the devil can knock you off that path but all you have to do is get up knock off the dust and keep walking toward how do you start repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you've begun your journey onto Perfection The Book of Luke Luke 8 and verse 14 as we said you go through the Bible and you find that it speaks of perfection from Genesis to Revelations it's not just one scripture in the Bible it's not just one one scribe in the Bible but but it's the entire Bible and all men of on all the men of God spoke to of it and Jesus brought a a teaching on it and taught us the steps to arrive there in Luke 8 verse4 and that which fell amongst Thorns are they which when they had heard go forth and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of life and bring no fruit to Perfection but those who fell in good ground they bring fruit to Perfection they bring fruit to Perfection St Luke chapter 13 starting at verse 32 he said and he said unto them go ye and tell that fox this is Jesus speaking behold I cast out devils and I do cures today and tomorrow and the third day I shall be perfected St Luke 13:32 because the third day that man Jesus that had a body of Flesh that could that that could taste death and he did that body died on the cross of calvary that body was placed in a tomb of Joseph arthia and it laid there for almost three days but the third day was perfected and that body rose up and it was never the same body again that went down it was a glorified body it was eternal it was quickened it could move from Dimension to Dimension it could pass through that wall and find you on the other side and take you by the hand and say follow me and I'll take you where I'm going that's what God wants to do today he wants you to hear his voice and know that he's a resurrected Lord [Music] Jesus made perfect that he might be able to make you perfect in the message eight called Abraham Abraham brother brandham says this he says God condescending or God descending trying to draw near to his people so he can be loved and worshiped and in this leodan age we've turned him and put him on the outside he's trying he's knocking trying to get back in and you remember the scriptures in Revelations 3 he said as many as I love I rebuke and chasen he said repent that's God our father in the form of the Holy Ghost trying to get back into our lives to control us he said as I said last night that Capstone came down it's got to come there to Perfection and the church has got to be drawn into Perfection you say perfection that's what he said be ye perfect as my Father in Heaven is perfect let's take a little example here for a minute he says now now notice this he says as I was saying this morning if a grape vine has a grape life in it it will bring forth grapes what about this Holy Spirit what what about the vine of God if it's God's life in you it'll bring forth God in your life remember that principle Lane in the word of God let every seed produce of its own kind it's not can I make it it's not is it for me if the seed that's within you is the seed of God down laying in that [Applause] Soul then you will make it will you make a few mistakes along the way you might make a few but because you're a seed of God he'll lift you up because he's taking you unto perfection eternal life in the Book of James chapter 1 and we're verses 2 to 4 J James says this my brethren count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations santiag James had experienced this James had lived this so now he's sharing with you his testimony he said my brethren counted all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations why he says knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience and remember faith is a gift of God by grace are you saved the Apostle Paul said through faith and that's the gift of God that God gives you when you're baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's the gift of the Holy Ghost Faith the size of a mustard seed is deposited down in that soul to help you grow and get to Perfection to eternal life then it says this in verse three again knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire wanting nothing Perfection God is perfecting in this journey every step you take he's bringing Temptations because he wants to increase your faith and through faith give you patience so in the next trial you'll know what the purpose was that my faith might grow that I could believe that I can do all things through Christ who strengthen in verse four it said but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect and entire wanting nothing what is perfection it's gone through a born again Experience day after day and step after step he's taking you closer to eternal life Matthew 5:48 he said be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect not perfect like your Earthly father not perfect like your Earthly mother for we found many defects in them defectos and rightly so because even if they're Believers in Christ they they are on a journey like you going on to perfection and their daily lives are full of Temptations and maybe you see them fall short in those Temptations but they're in a journey going on to Perfection and the whole purpose of those trials is to increase our faith to give us patience to wait on God but Jesus said the Perfection he's talking about is like your heavenly father is perfect and the way he's perfect is he's an eternal being which makes you an eternal being and God's taking you back from this Fallen persons that we are he's walking us back to eternal [Music] life until until that life in US is so great until that life in US is so great that this Earthly body can hold us no more Matthew 19 and verse 16 it says here Jesus speaking and and behold one came and said unto him good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have a perfect life and behold one came and said him to good Master what good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life a perfect life like the father in verse 17 and he said unto him number one he says why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments and he speaking of eternal life he was speaking to him in in in in in in in in the in the office in the ministry that he was unfolding the lion of the tribe of Judah the Lamb of God he was God but he said why callest thou me good there is none good but one that is God he never told him I'm not God did you see that but it's a but but it's a quote that many will tell you no Jesus said he wasn't God no he didn't say that what he did say he says why callest thou me good then he says you know that there's none good but one and that is God he was wanting him to catch the Revelation are you calling me good because you realize who I really am then he tells him but if thou will enter into life keep the Commandments that was Jesus once again answering the question in a parable parabas he saith unto him Verse 18 unto him which verse 18 He saith unto him which no 18 this Jesus said Thou shalt do no murder Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness honor thy father and thy mother and thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself the young man saith unto him all these things have I kept from my youth up what lack I yet he thought he had put Jesus in a corner he said are you kidding me oh I've done that since I was a boy no problem done settled that's that's me that's that's what I do so he thought Jesus had already told him everything he needed to do and he thought he had fulfilled it all that's why he dared to challenge and say what what lack I yet because he thought Jesus had run out of things to ask of him then Jesus said unto him if thou will be perfect and it shocked him perfect well isn't that what I am if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou has and in his mind this young man is saying I've never read that in the Old Testament where's that in the Bible he said if if thou will be perfect go and sell that thou Hast and give it to the poor and thou shalt have treasure in heaven and come and follow me and the Bible goes on to say the young man was sad because the one thing he lacked is the is the one thing Jesus asked of him and he walked him out of the old Old Testament he walked him out of the old test and he walked him into a new testament and he spoke to can he gave him the spoken word The Original Seed because when Jesus said this it wasn't written anywhere in the Old Testament God was writing a new testament by by the spoken word it would get written later but if you could believe the spoken word then you would become an epistle read of all men displaying the spoken word the original scene just like the experience that Adam had in Eden he was walking by the spoken word for there was no written books yet all Adam had in the beginning was a relationship and a friendship with a father and that was enough what if you live in 2023 what if you live in 2023 and you don't know how to read how will you make it to eternal life all you need is what Adam had a relationship a personal experience a friendship restored with the father that's all you really need but by his grace he's given us a whole book to show us every little step unto Perfection remember in Matthew 5:48 Jesus Jesus said be ye therefore perfect even as my Father which is in heaven that was verse 48 and you know how I've shared with you often the reason Jesus said be ye therefore perfect in verse 48 because for 47 verses prior an he was trying to show you the little steps that you can take and arrive and have a friendship restored with the F with the father and in your soul being filled with eternal life in Luke 6 and verse 40 Jesus said this Luke 6 and verse 40 the disciple is not above his master so if your master is is a master what he does then then he'll teach you his ways and you too will be a master so Jesus says here the disciple is not above his master but everyone that is perfect shall be as his master if you take it as a single sentence if you take it as as the only sentence then then then most people will say that's not possible we can't be like God it's because there's still still trying to define the word Perfection with a dictionary that men have written but God's definition lays in his word if there's a question a Bible question there's got to be a Bible answer and and if there's words that Jesus used specifically then the meaning for that word you won't find it in the dictionary that definition will not take you to understand the very Mind Of God no the definition for for these words lays right in the Bible like Perfection like foolish when we speak of the foolish virgin well the word foolish you go to a dictionary and the list gets longer and longer and longer of foolish and if you ask a friend what's foolish they'll give you a list of things that would be foolish to do and yet none of those Define the word foolish as is spoken in Matthew 25 of the 10 virgins five were wise and five were foolish well if they were foolish maybe they didn't plan for their retirement so they could have a million dollars in the bank when they hit 65 it's foolish to think that that's what God meant but the word foolish in that Parable God himself gave the definition and he said the foolish were foolish because they failed to get oil in their lamps you you won't find Webster saying that in the dictionary though he was a Christian man you won't find the Collegiate dictionary saying that about foolish diar because the meaning of foolish that God gave it in that Parable was specific and that meaning you can only get by Revelation these five virgins which makes them believers were foolish because they failed to get the oil in their L the baptism of the Holy Ghost the final steps to break into eternity so this word Perfection it has a definition and to be perfect like the father is perfect is to be Eternal as he is eternal in s John 17 and verse 23 Jesus says this St John 17:23 i in them and thou in me that they may be made perfect in one and that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me the word perfect found from Genesis through Revelations but when Jesus in the par in his ministry began to speak remember how he was speaking it was always in a parable so the word perfect was being used to hide a great truth to hide a great Revelation from the eyes of the wise and prudent from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it unto babes not little children naturally but those who had been born again those get the Revelation for unless you're born again you cannot see this kingdom of God you cannot understand The Parables of Jesus take it all literally when really The Parables was a prophetic word no when really The Parables were a prophetic word it was prophecies some of them coming to pass as he was speaking it many of them challenging the Church of that day that denomination [Music] many of them showing God's children the Journey Back to Eden a restored friendship with the father God rich in Mercy in 1 Corinthians chapter 2 the Apostle Paul he said we speak wisdom among them which are perfect we speak wisdom among them which are perfect he said so in First Corinthians chapter 2 beginning at verse 4 it says this and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's Wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of God in other words he didn't want our faith to stand in the literal interpretations of men no it had to be a revelation this word of God verse six how be it we speak wisdom among them that are perfect yet not the wisdom of this world nor of the princes of this world that come to not but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery in a parable in types and shadows even the hidden wisdom in the which God ordained before the world unto our Glory which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord Of Glory in other words had they had a revelation no had they had a revelation they would never have done that verse 9 but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither ha entered into the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him but God hath revealed unto us by his spirit for the spirit searches all things yay the Deep things of God the Deep things like how God wants to take you and unto Perfection to be perfect even as the father which is in heaven is perfect how is he perfect he's a Eternal being where where is he taking you unto Perfection unto eternal life it's the end goal of the father to have his children around him as table once again and never again be separated he won't go through another separation like he did in Eden he was determined when Adam fell that when no man was found worthy he said I'll be that man I'll be that man that takes my children back into Perfection I'll create a body of flesh I'll call that body the Son of God I will take and dwell in that body the father was dwelling in him the Bible says in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead deity it was God who descended down when he saw no man was worthy God the father as Revelations 5 says with a book in his hand that was sealed with Seven Seals it was a plan it was a figure and a type it was really a plan that was in the mind of God and then God began to descend he came down as the angel of the Covenant looking for a worthy man knowing that he would have to become that man then from the angel of the Covenant the Bible says God came to his Temple that's a body that's the body of Jesus and God become man so that he could restore the friendship with you so he could teach you every step you needed to take to be as Eternal as he is eternal God descending and part of his plan would require an innocent sacrifice and the shedding of blood he was willing to pay that price so you could be perfect even as he is perfect as you know the Bible tells us there is no greater love but that a man should lay down his life life for another and the Lord Jesus laid his life down for all for he was the perfect lamb there was no spot there was no wrinkle in this lamb he was a man but a perfect one and he gave it all up so that you and I could be perfect even as Our Father which is in heaven is perfect in closing this morning perfect love castes out fear so as we are Marching onto perfection so as we are Marching as we are Marching onto Perfection God is perfecting his character in us he's perfecting the faith he's perfecting The Virtue he's perfecting patience in us he's perfecting brotherly kindness in US he's perfecting everything in US step by step and in 1 John 4:16 the Apostle John says this and we have known and believe that the love that God hath to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him 1 John 4:1 16 herein is our love made perfect it's everything about him him that he wants to make perfect in you herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world we are living in a world that is charged with fear fear of sickness fear of loneliness fear of not having enough money fear that our children will be lost fear that our fathers and mothers will be lost we are living in a time and a day where if if you're listening to television and the news and if you are we forgive you for that but it all brings fear to our hearts we are being pounded with fear but listen what Jesus said in verse 18 there is no fear in love the love of God but perfect love casteth out fear because fear ha torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us and by the grace of God we'll love them to our last breath as we stand to our feet this [Music] morning Perfection comes through a restored friendship with the father Perfection is this as the father is perfect it's eternal life and that's where God wants to take us all where does it begin repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you're on a journey unto perfection maybe you've already been baptized but Satan has thrown you off the road and you might you might be asking now what do I do the step's even simpler you've already been baptized you just has to go back to Step One repent once again that's what made David the psalmist the king of Israel a man after God's Own Heart that every time he made a mistake and he and it was told him he repented and God said I like a man that when he makes a mistake and he's told you shouldn't have done that he drops to his knees he says Lord forgive me and maybe he has to go and tell others maybe he has to go to his wife and say forgive me maybe he's got to go to brother and say forgive me but God likes that kind of a man when he realizes I shouldn't have done that and he repents and he lays before God and he ask forgiveness of the father and of his wife and of her husband and of the dad and of the mom maybe you're a young person in the home and you know you crossed the line and said something you shouldn't have said if you're going on to Perfection repent make it right say sorry Mom sorry Dad but sometimes the mothers and fathers we realize we cross the line and we have to be ready to say sorry daughter sorry son because you know what we're all walking unto perfection God's restoring us with the love of God in our hearts be sensitive to his presence is what we long to be you love him this morning let's bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you once again Lord we are in an ex exus we're moving from time into eternity we're moving from a terrestrial body to a Celestial one Lord and if this body be dissolved we have one already that's being prepared for the seed that will produce that body is the soul itself it's closer than we think it's growing to the stature of a perfect man already we'll only know it better when we've crossed over into eternity and we're in this new body and we realize it was with us all the time an eternal one made perfect by the blood of Jesus by the blood of Jesus so we thank you Lord in Jesus name amen amen so our brother would come forward this morning pray for us these next 12 days we believing God will is going to be with us we look to see God's people blessed there in Congo and we certainly look forward to your prayers to help us God bless you all the Lord be with you [Music] again God bless you just want to share something and I just feel to share this right now um the first time I I come to uh hear the word of God I remember that uh in a little church on the south side and um I was listening to the word of God I never had had an experience with God but always remember it because I just remember that I believed what was being said I didn't understand at all but what I did understand I believed and I felt something God allowed me to come into His presence and um from that from that day on my life was uh had begun a change and it was it was because God had put a a faith in me to believe and something when I when I said that was truth my spirit in me bore witness that what what was being said was true and I just felt the presence of God come down in a in a way that excuse me that I had never experienced in my life and the reason I'm sharing this is because I believe that wherever we're at in our life in our stage with the Lord that same presence that same God is here with us right now and he he wants to continue that change in your life he wants to do something for you as the scripture said Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so um I wanted just to share that because I feel in my heart that that we need to Touch the Hem of His Garment as the scripture says and we can do that this morning just by faith it's just by accepting his word in
