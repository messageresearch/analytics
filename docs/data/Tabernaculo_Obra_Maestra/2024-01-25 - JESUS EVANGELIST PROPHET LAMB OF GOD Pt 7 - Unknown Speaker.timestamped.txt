[44:13] tonight we want to continue praying for
[44:17] our brother Glenn
[44:21] tamlins tamlins tamson uh my son-in-law
[44:25] Ruben's dad
[44:30] and uh also for Reuben Candice and and
[44:34] their
[44:35] familyben
[44:37] C I believe some of his other brothers
[44:39] and sisters have been coming into town
[44:42] flying
[44:47] in so we'll keep lifting them
[44:51] up asking God to be with
[44:54] them and and God's will be
[44:58] done because we we pray for God to give
[45:02] us an
[45:03] answer in all our troubles and our
[45:07] trials and a prophet told us always
[45:11] remember this that when God gives you
[45:14] his
[45:15] answer whether it's a yes or a no it's
[45:20] still the perfect will of
[45:23] God even his nose
[45:26] is God's Will and it as much thus sayith
[45:30] the Lord to your
[45:32] life a no as a
[45:35] yes and a no doesn't mean he's with
[45:39] you no no if you pray and he
[45:43] answers that means you're still on
[45:45] talking terms with
[45:47] him that means you can still have a
[45:49] you're having a conversation with
[45:52] him that means he finds you worthy to
[45:55] give you an answer
[45:58] so his
[46:00] yeses are as good as his
[46:02] nose and his NOS are as good as his
[46:06] yes because it's an answer from
[46:10] God he hears us and he
[46:17] answers tonight we'd like to
[46:21] continue on part
[46:24] seven speaking on
[46:27] Jesus
[46:29] evangelist Prophet Lamb of
[46:39] God and we'll turn to
[46:43] Matthew chapter 1 and verse
[46:50] one the book of the generation of Jesus
[46:55] Christ
[46:58] the son of David the son of
[47:02] Abraham and it goes on telling us
[47:04] Abraham begot
[47:08] Isaac Isaac begot
[47:11] Jacob Jacob begat Judas and his
[47:16] Brethren you'll notice that the first
[47:18] one it mentions in this genealogy of
[47:21] Jacob is
[47:24] Judas
[47:27] and yet Judas was not his
[47:31] firstborn but he mentions
[47:34] Judas because that's the tribe that he's
[47:37] going to follow in the
[47:40] genealogy all the members that are being
[47:43] spoken of
[47:45] here is is of the tribe of
[47:48] Judah because he's line because the holy
[47:51] spirit is lining this all
[47:54] up and the the point of highlighting the
[47:57] tribe of
[48:00] Judah is to tell you that this Jesus
[48:03] that it's
[48:05] coming is now is the lion of the tribe
[48:08] of
[48:09] Judah and now that places him in a
[48:11] prophetic
[48:13] role this this this baby that's going to
[48:16] be
[48:17] born of this Virgin
[48:19] Mary she's bringing forth the woman's
[48:24] seed
[48:26] which
[48:28] woman the bride of
[48:30] Christ his
[48:32] church his
[48:34] body that is the woman and this is her
[48:39] seed Jesus Christ the son of
[48:43] God the Lamb of
[48:45] God let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[48:49] you ask your blessings upon your
[48:53] word in Jesus name amen amen you may be
[49:01] seated as we've tried to background
[49:04] almost each
[49:08] Service uh chapter 4 as you remember was
[49:11] Jesus beginning his
[49:17] ministry as an
[49:19] evangelist praying for the
[49:21] sick when he came on the
[49:23] scene John the Baptist was also on the
[49:26] scene
[49:27] already he had already been introducing
[49:32] him he'd been preparing the
[49:35] ground to receive this
[49:38] seed and the ground he was
[49:41] [Music]
[49:42] preparing was the hearts of the
[49:45] people he was preaching
[49:47] things in a way that they've never heard
[49:50] this style of preaching
[49:53] before he was calling them out to repent
[49:57] the the the scribes the the the
[50:00] Levites they never called people out to
[50:04] repent no if they came to your house and
[50:08] knocked it was to bring judgment on you
[50:12] because you they had found you guilty of
[50:14] something in the
[50:16] law they didn't preach
[50:18] repentance they brought
[50:22] judgment but John
[50:24] came with a very different
[50:27] Ministry it was strange to
[50:30] Israel it was contrary to the to the
[50:33] Jewish
[50:35] religion the Levites didn't act this
[50:38] way the Levites didn't preach this
[50:42] way the Levites didn't have such a
[50:44] personal message for the
[50:47] people but John was the
[50:50] Forerunner to introduce this Lamb of
[50:53] God but before he came as Lamb of
[50:57] God he was really born upon the
[51:00] Earth as king of the Jews you remember
[51:04] in the scripture the Bible
[51:06] said as the Magi came before
[51:10] Herod we've been following a
[51:13] star that was John in the first coming
[51:17] we've been following a
[51:19] star that was a Prophet Elijah William
[51:22] brandham in the second
[51:24] coming
[51:27] and that star when it finally
[51:31] disappears we believe we'll be in the
[51:33] presence of the
[51:35] king that star is leading us to this man
[51:41] to this King to this savior to this
[51:45] Divine one that was the reason for the
[51:48] star for running that these three
[51:53] Magi would be coming and they're looking
[51:56] for this
[51:57] King so
[51:59] Jesus came upon the Earth he was
[52:04] born they said where is he that's been
[52:07] born King of the
[52:12] Jews and they found him in
[52:15] Bethlehem in Matthew chapter
[52:18] 4 Jesus begins his
[52:21] ministry as an
[52:23] evangelist praying for the sick
[52:26] first a few
[52:27] came then hundreds came then thousands
[52:32] came then there was a masses multitudes
[52:35] of
[52:37] people and being healed of all different
[52:42] diseases in MA in Matthew Chapter
[52:45] 5 the Evangelist Min Ministry takes a
[52:49] little
[52:52] change and now this evangelist is is is
[52:55] is displaying a Teaching
[53:00] Ministry in chapter five and his
[53:03] teaching is on
[53:05] Perfection but Perfection is the end
[53:10] goal eternal
[53:12] life walking in the presence of of the
[53:16] king himself Eternal beings with
[53:22] with so chapter five six and
[53:27] seven of the Book of Matthew Jesus is
[53:30] teaching
[53:31] onction in
[53:33] chapter8 he falls back into his
[53:36] Evangelistic
[53:38] role emphasizing for the people to have
[53:43] faith giving
[53:46] examples who can I make an example for
[53:48] for the Israel to
[53:52] see and while he's yet talking
[53:56] a
[53:58] centurion he says excuse
[54:00] me he's all dressed up in his in his
[54:04] Roman Roman
[54:07] armors he says I'm a Roman
[54:11] Centurion but one of my servants is very
[54:15] sick if he he says he's dying as a
[54:18] matter of
[54:19] fact he says but if you just speak the
[54:23] word he'll live
[54:26] he says no I'll go with you to see
[54:30] him I'll do as I've been doing for the
[54:33] Jewish people I'll lay my hand on
[54:38] him he says you don't have to do
[54:41] that not you maybe some other
[54:44] evangelist but you're
[54:47] different you just speak the
[54:50] word he said I'm a man with great
[54:54] Authority and and I can look in a crowd
[54:56] of people and see who the people of
[54:58] authority are in that
[55:01] crowd you don't have to tell me I can
[55:05] feel Authority in the
[55:08] air and you've got
[55:11] it all you have to do is
[55:14] speak and when I get back
[55:17] home he'll be healed Jesus said I've not
[55:21] seen Faith Like
[55:24] This in
[55:27] Israel no not in Israel
[55:30] no chapter
[55:32] 8 the
[55:34] Evangelist urging the people to have
[55:38] [Music]
[55:41] faith he he he's he's trying to get the
[55:44] people to have
[55:46] faith encouraging them to
[55:49] Faith but then he does something
[55:53] else they are in awe that he could speak
[55:57] sicknesses out of the bodies of human
[56:01] beings there they're in awe that he even
[56:04] raised the
[56:06] dead gyus
[56:08] daughter they were in awe that he could
[56:11] cleanse a
[56:15] leper they said wow what a
[56:18] manow but then he's on a ship with his
[56:22] disciples and a storm raises up
[56:25] a storm that has these men of the sea
[56:31] scared these
[56:34] seamen
[56:35] experienced they practically been born
[56:38] on the
[56:39] sea but the storm is so harsh so
[56:45] great they're they're
[56:47] fearful and but Jesus was in the
[56:51] ship they said he was
[56:53] asleep but we know that he neither
[56:55] sleeps nor
[56:59] Slumbers he was testing his
[57:03] children he wasn't
[57:06] worried he's in he's got every
[57:09] situation in full
[57:12] control even if he didn't tell you he
[57:14] does he still
[57:17] does you're not sure he
[57:20] does he is sure he
[57:23] does and they wake
[57:26] him and he speaks to the
[57:29] storm and the Sea and the wind OB Bas
[57:34] him this
[57:37] took them to another
[57:39] level they said wow wow I knew he could
[57:44] heal
[57:48] sickness and speak to demon powers that
[57:51] speak back to
[57:53] you but but how do you control
[57:57] something that doesn't speak that you
[58:00] can't touch that you only
[58:04] feel he spoke to the
[58:07] storm this was the king of the
[58:10] Jews who had descended
[58:12] down to lower
[58:16] Ministries to get closer to his
[58:19] people to display his
[58:21] power to display his mercy and his grace
[58:25] [Music]
[58:28] he wanted
[58:29] you and he wanted to do things in your
[58:32] life to teach you and me how to trust
[58:38] him than
[58:43] Lord so chapter 5 6 and
[58:47] 7 Jesus the
[58:49] teacher chapter four the
[58:52] Evangelist in chapter eight he once more
[58:55] enters into the Evangelistic
[58:59] Ministry trying to lift up the faith of
[59:02] the
[59:03] people to believe him so when the time
[59:07] comes that he brings them the word of
[59:11] God the word that will change their
[59:14] lives but a word that is that will seem
[59:17] so strange and radical to
[59:21] them that he wants to capture their
[59:23] hearts
[59:26] so they won't be scared to reach out and
[59:29] get a hold of the promises of
[59:32] God and how their lives can be
[59:35] changed when he starts speaking to them
[59:37] about supernatural
[59:40] things of a born again
[59:42] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[59:45] Ghost of a fire that can cleanse you
[59:50] from the bottom of your feet the top of
[59:53] your head begin speaking this
[59:56] way he's trying to raise up their
[59:59] faith so that when they believe that he
[1:00:01] could
[1:00:03] heal they'll believe this part
[1:00:06] too of how he can heal the
[1:00:09] soul not just the body that will
[1:00:15] perish
[1:00:17] Jesus the
[1:00:19] Evangelist the
[1:00:21] teacher not only heals the
[1:00:26] not only raises the
[1:00:28] dead but he speaks to the
[1:00:31] wind and the Sea obey
[1:00:34] him in chapter
[1:00:37] nine he
[1:00:39] Jesus does two
[1:00:42] things number one he forgives
[1:00:46] sins he'd not done that
[1:00:48] before and number
[1:00:50] two he knows the thoughts of the scribes
[1:00:57] which is a
[1:00:59] characteristic of a prophetic
[1:01:01] Ministry it's the
[1:01:04] characteristic by which Israel would
[1:01:06] know when Messiah
[1:01:09] comes that he would know the thoughts
[1:01:12] and intents of the hearts
[1:01:15] of so now this Jesus of
[1:01:18] Nazareth in chapter n his ministry is
[1:01:23] unfolding to fulfill all that the
[1:01:26] prophets have
[1:01:29] spoken which is really what God had
[1:01:33] spoken through the through the
[1:01:36] mouthpiece of men whom he
[1:01:40] ordained anointed to speak these
[1:01:44] prophecies so in chapter nine this
[1:01:48] Jesus who was born King of the
[1:01:51] Jews is beginning to unfold Divine
[1:01:57] characteristics so the king had
[1:02:00] descended to be an
[1:02:05] evangelist what man natural
[1:02:08] man born a
[1:02:12] king would want to make his first role
[1:02:15] in life an
[1:02:19] evangelist a servant to the
[1:02:23] people
[1:02:26] who who would do that who could humble
[1:02:30] himself from the from the throne as a
[1:02:33] king and descend down to serve
[1:02:38] Humanity what king could do this God
[1:02:42] Alone that was the love of God that
[1:02:46] brought him
[1:02:49] down he came
[1:02:52] down Jesus born King of the
[1:02:56] Jews he came down with a book in his
[1:02:59] hand that was
[1:03:02] sealed and this
[1:03:04] Jesus was going to start unfolding this
[1:03:06] book to
[1:03:09] Israel the king
[1:03:12] descended to be
[1:03:14] evangelist to be teacher to be
[1:03:18] prophet and now the Lamb of
[1:03:22] God in chapter nine
[1:03:25] he forgives
[1:03:27] sins it is something that no man could
[1:03:32] do immediately when he when he when he
[1:03:34] told this leper your sins are
[1:03:39] forgiven all the religious people
[1:03:41] scribes that were
[1:03:43] there they said
[1:03:46] blasphemy only God can forgive
[1:03:50] sins yes that's it he was God he was the
[1:03:54] Lamb of God he was the sacrifice for
[1:03:58] sin his blood would wash us clean why
[1:04:04] sow right the lamb
[1:04:07] Ministry come into play
[1:04:12] unfold a new testament had
[1:04:15] begun unfolding from this
[1:04:18] book called the Lamb's Book of
[1:04:21] Life isn't that how Matthew 1:1
[1:04:25] started book of the
[1:04:29] generation of Jesus
[1:04:32] Christ for you to better understand that
[1:04:37] statement I'll say it this way the
[1:04:41] book of The Life and
[1:04:44] family of Daniel fro that would be the
[1:04:48] book of my
[1:04:50] generation with stories and pictures in
[1:04:53] it
[1:04:55] that's what was unfolding
[1:04:58] here but this book of this
[1:05:02] generation of Jesus Christ generation
[1:05:06] comes from the word
[1:05:09] Gene
[1:05:12] seed children so this is the book of the
[1:05:16] children of the family of Jesus
[1:05:20] Christ so this is the book of the
[1:05:25] revelation of Jesus Christ this is the
[1:05:29] Lamb's Book of
[1:05:31] Life this is his book
[1:05:35] unfolding it's not an abstract
[1:05:38] somewhere no but because our eyes were
[1:05:42] blinded no because we were born in
[1:05:44] spiritual
[1:05:46] Amnesia we packed it in our arms for
[1:05:49] many
[1:05:50] years and we didn't know what we were
[1:05:53] hold
[1:05:59] B it's your family
[1:06:01] book it's your family
[1:06:06] tree I'm visiting with a pastor one
[1:06:11] time and he's relating a little bit of
[1:06:13] his past his
[1:06:16] family
[1:06:18] so I tell them I'll tell you a little
[1:06:20] bit of my
[1:06:23] family of all my brothers and
[1:06:27] sisters they've all been to
[1:06:29] prison federal
[1:06:32] prison matter of fact they were all
[1:06:37] killed even my sisters were in
[1:06:40] prison he says you got to be kidding
[1:06:43] me true every last one of
[1:06:47] them from the oldest to the
[1:06:52] youngest he said every every one of
[1:06:55] them wound up in
[1:06:58] prison one of them they even hung him
[1:07:00] upside down I
[1:07:03] said my brother Peter I told
[1:07:06] him he goes wait a minute brother Daniel
[1:07:09] you're just kidding with me I said I'm
[1:07:10] not kidding they really did hang my
[1:07:12] brother Peter upside
[1:07:15] down because this is my book this is my
[1:07:19] family this is the men that women that
[1:07:22] died their lives for this
[1:07:27] gospel this is the Lamb's Book of
[1:07:30] Life you and I are all his
[1:07:35] sheep his lamb that's what a born again
[1:07:39] experience does for
[1:07:42] you that makes an old
[1:07:44] sheep a new lamb because you've been
[1:07:47] born
[1:07:49] again God rich in Mercy the king
[1:07:55] descended to be
[1:07:57] evangelist to be a teacher to be a
[1:08:00] prophet to be the Lamb of God and from
[1:08:04] Matthew 1 to chapter
[1:08:06] n this
[1:08:08] child fulfilled all of these
[1:08:11] roles unfolding them but as he went from
[1:08:15] one Ministry to the
[1:08:17] next he never lost that
[1:08:21] Ministry that Ministry just became a
[1:08:23] minor
[1:08:26] and the next level was a
[1:08:29] major to be the Lamb of
[1:08:31] God did he still have the
[1:08:34] power in the office as Lamb of
[1:08:37] God to reach over and touch
[1:08:41] someone and say nothing and they were
[1:08:44] healed never Lo never lost it he has
[1:08:49] that power yet
[1:08:52] today and he wants to to work that gift
[1:08:54] in you and
[1:08:56] I that we can reach out by faith and
[1:09:00] some Lord got a terrible flu healed
[1:09:05] them not a big
[1:09:08] show just power and
[1:09:11] control through the character of Jesus
[1:09:14] Christ in you and I in Matthew 10
[1:09:18] remember Jesus he begins placing this
[1:09:21] New Testament Church in order
[1:09:26] an arm is being
[1:09:28] built of men just like
[1:09:31] him called men of
[1:09:33] God and yet all that were
[1:09:38] called were not all called to the same
[1:09:43] Ministry to the same end they didn't all
[1:09:47] use the gift of
[1:09:49] God in the correct
[1:09:51] way because out of 12
[1:09:55] one was a
[1:09:58] Judas you know Judas also was
[1:10:02] given a gift of
[1:10:04] healing to pray for the
[1:10:08] sick he had a gift in his
[1:10:11] life he'd been called of
[1:10:15] God chapter
[1:10:17] 10 God is
[1:10:20] setting this New Testament
[1:10:22] Church placing the
[1:10:25] order and the first thing he
[1:10:28] does is he places the ministry in
[1:10:32] order the
[1:10:34] ministers their lives must be in
[1:10:38] order because they're going to be
[1:10:40] servants to God's
[1:10:45] children not Lords over
[1:10:47] them they're to serve the
[1:10:50] people that has become a strange concept
[1:10:59] today but it wasn't when God established
[1:11:02] when Jesus established this new
[1:11:05] testament
[1:11:07] chur it wasn't that
[1:11:10] way he called
[1:11:13] Simon Andrew James John Philip
[1:11:19] phip Thomas Thomas Matthew m j
[1:11:26] s
[1:11:28] lius Simon the Canaanite and Judas
[1:11:32] scari and he said these
[1:11:36] 12 Jesus sent
[1:11:38] forth and commanded them
[1:11:41] saying Matthew
[1:11:43] 105 go not into the way of the
[1:11:47] Gentiles and into any city of the
[1:11:52] Samaritans it was prophecy being
[1:11:56] fulfilled because the Old Testament
[1:12:00] prophecy the
[1:12:03] metaphor the type the
[1:12:06] shadow is is is that the
[1:12:09] firstborn to him
[1:12:12] belonged all of his father's
[1:12:17] riches so to so to keep within the
[1:12:20] boundaries of his own
[1:12:22] word
[1:12:25] he first came to
[1:12:27] Israel the eldest
[1:12:29] Church to to give to them the Lamb's
[1:12:33] Book of
[1:12:34] Life to give to open to
[1:12:37] them this book and reveal to them the
[1:12:42] seven parts of a
[1:12:45] plan of a divine plan to restore
[1:12:49] Israel to save Israel to heal
[1:12:53] Israel to gather all the Jewish
[1:12:58] people and they rejected that
[1:13:01] plan it was called the seven seal
[1:13:05] plan of the Lamb of
[1:13:08] God written in the Lamb's Book of
[1:13:12] Life what they
[1:13:14] rejected was the Lamb's Book of
[1:13:17] Life what they rejected was the opening
[1:13:20] of this
[1:13:21] book what they re rejected was the
[1:13:25] revelation of these seven parts of one
[1:13:29] divine plan that would have saved
[1:13:33] them that would have given them back
[1:13:35] their
[1:13:36] land that would have healed all the
[1:13:41] nation this what they
[1:13:44] rejected and when they
[1:13:46] rejected at the cross of calv that's
[1:13:49] what Jacob's hands
[1:13:52] represented when he was praying for
[1:13:54] Joseph's two
[1:13:56] sons he crossed his hands and put his
[1:14:00] right hand on the younger son and he
[1:14:04] gave the younger son the firstborn
[1:14:09] blessing and a prophet tells us you know
[1:14:12] what that
[1:14:14] meant I didn't know I read it many times
[1:14:19] as my mom had read it to me many times
[1:14:24] it I didn't understand it it was just a
[1:14:28] story like Red Riding Hood in the
[1:14:32] wolf like the SE the seven dwarfs and
[1:14:35] Snow
[1:14:36] White and those two were kind of
[1:14:38] mysterious to me as a
[1:14:40] kid that didn't make sense to me
[1:14:43] either I was struggling as a
[1:14:47] boy books in
[1:14:49] general but this book be understood
[1:14:54] a
[1:14:55] revelation and the Revelation came one
[1:14:58] day that that that that that Jacob the
[1:15:02] crossing of his arms represented the
[1:15:05] cross of
[1:15:06] Calvary and that day on Calvary when
[1:15:10] this the king of the Jews would hang on
[1:15:12] the
[1:15:14] cross and everything he had offered to
[1:15:17] Israel that they had
[1:15:20] rejected would be given to you and I a
[1:15:23] gentile
[1:15:25] bride and he wouldn't return to the
[1:15:28] Jews till he's 100% done with
[1:15:33] you you're saying what's going to happen
[1:15:35] brother Daniel all this war in the
[1:15:38] Middle
[1:15:39] East Israel is fighting a a war on
[1:15:42] almost every
[1:15:46] border what's what's
[1:15:48] happening is that God is working on you
[1:15:51] and
[1:15:52] I and until he's done with you and
[1:15:56] me don't worry about
[1:16:05] Israel the time piece the prophet tolds
[1:16:07] many
[1:16:09] times you know what you want to know
[1:16:11] what day it
[1:16:12] is look and see
[1:16:16] Israel and Israel's been in her
[1:16:20] Homeland since
[1:16:22] 1946
[1:16:24] and the unbeliever
[1:16:25] say you see nothing is happening 1946 to
[1:16:32] now Israel's in her
[1:16:34] Homeland where's the coming of the
[1:16:39] lord it's because they don't know the
[1:16:42] scripture turn with me in MA to Matthew
[1:16:45] 24 we're going to jump little bit out of
[1:16:48] our subject here and yet it all ties
[1:16:52] together
[1:16:57] a prophet when he preached The Sixth
[1:16:59] Seal he said I'm going to do something
[1:17:02] different because I want you to open
[1:17:04] your Bibles to Matthew
[1:17:07] 24 and then I also want you to open your
[1:17:09] Bibles to Revelations chapter
[1:17:14] 6 and Revelations chapter
[1:17:17] 6 is the first six
[1:17:20] seals he said I'm going to show you how
[1:17:23] Jesus
[1:17:24] preached the seals in Matthew
[1:17:28] 24 in a
[1:17:31] parable and he starts going down tying
[1:17:34] them
[1:17:37] together I won't do that tonight we'll
[1:17:40] do it for you another day BR it all
[1:17:43] together but in Matthew
[1:17:47] 24 in verse two he says and Jesus said
[1:17:52] unto them see ye not all these things
[1:17:55] verily I say unto there shall not be
[1:17:57] left here one stone upon another that
[1:17:59] shall not be thrown
[1:18:05] down and as he sat upon the Mount of
[1:18:08] Olives the disciples came unto him
[1:18:10] privately saying tell us when these
[1:18:12] things shall be and what shall be the
[1:18:15] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[1:18:21] world
[1:18:26] then in Matthew 24 and the 4th
[1:18:30] verse he begins to unfold it reads a
[1:18:34] couple of
[1:18:34] verses he that's the first seal and he
[1:18:38] goes down down the
[1:18:40] verses and and as he keeps going down
[1:18:43] the
[1:18:44] verses SE is is is telling us
[1:18:48] more and it gets longer the
[1:18:51] verses for each
[1:18:54] but when he gets into Matthew
[1:18:57] 24 and
[1:18:59] 14 so Jesus is preaching these Seven
[1:19:04] Seals to Israel and then in verse 14 he
[1:19:09] says and this Gospel of the
[1:19:12] Kingdom shall be preached in all the
[1:19:15] world for a witness unto all nations and
[1:19:19] then shall the End
[1:19:21] come
[1:19:30] ask yourself
[1:19:32] now what was the
[1:19:34] Gospel that he was preaching when he
[1:19:38] made this
[1:19:39] statement he was
[1:19:41] bringing the
[1:19:44] Revelation the teaching
[1:19:47] of let's read it
[1:19:50] again and this and this teaching of the
[1:19:54] Seven
[1:19:56] Seals shall be preached in all the
[1:20:00] world for a witness unto all the
[1:20:03] nations and then shall the End
[1:20:07] come so just to see Israel in the
[1:20:13] Homeland it it it it does reveal that
[1:20:16] they were
[1:20:17] living when you see Israel in her
[1:20:21] Homeland and that God sent a prophet and
[1:20:24] in
[1:20:26] 1963 the
[1:20:28] gospel of these Seven
[1:20:30] Seals was preached from
[1:20:34] 1963 to
[1:20:37] 1965 you say no no brother Daniel no it
[1:20:41] was it was just eight
[1:20:43] days and 10
[1:20:46] Services it it wasn't didn't go all the
[1:20:48] way to 65 no
[1:20:49] no March
[1:20:51] 1963
[1:20:54] he preached the Seven
[1:20:56] Seals and he didn't
[1:20:59] stop the Holy Spirit didn't stop opening
[1:21:03] the book to us till he said the last
[1:21:07] thing that he had to say in
[1:21:12] 1965
[1:21:14] now this
[1:21:17] gospel these Seven Seals he says and
[1:21:21] this Gospel of the Kingdom
[1:21:25] shall be preached in all the
[1:21:27] world for a witness unto all nations
[1:21:32] then shall the End
[1:21:34] come the year is 2023
[1:21:40] 2024 and this gospel is just barely
[1:21:43] making its way around the
[1:21:46] world I mean the Revelation the
[1:21:50] truth is just making its way around the
[1:21:54] world so what was Redemption for Israel
[1:21:57] waiting
[1:21:58] for since
[1:22:01] 1946 for this to take place the
[1:22:05] revelation of the Seven
[1:22:07] Seals seven parts of a divine
[1:22:11] plan to rescue and save and change you
[1:22:14] and
[1:22:16] I the Bride of Jesus Christ the younger
[1:22:20] son to whom at the cross of
[1:22:23] C was given the the the lion shared to
[1:22:29] the hallelujah hallelujah this Lamb of
[1:22:36] God Matthew
[1:22:39] 10
[1:22:40] God setting the church in
[1:22:47] order choosing the
[1:22:51] ministry giving them
[1:22:55] gifts to do what he
[1:22:58] did for the works that he
[1:23:01] did would this new ministry
[1:23:06] do they would
[1:23:08] pray they would preach the
[1:23:10] gospel their Ministries would change
[1:23:14] lives it would pull it would pull God's
[1:23:18] people out of dark
[1:23:21] denominationalism
[1:23:23] it would pull God's
[1:23:24] people out of
[1:23:28] legalism it would take away our
[1:23:32] arrogance it would give us
[1:23:34] meekness humility it would make us
[1:23:39] peacemakers instead of thinking I got to
[1:23:41] be a
[1:23:43] warrior and to be a
[1:23:45] warrior sometimes you got to be
[1:23:48] violent no no no no no no
[1:23:54] the law and the prophets were until John
[1:23:58] since then the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:24:03] preached and the king of this
[1:24:06] kingdom is a
[1:24:08] peacemaker a matter of fact he's called
[1:24:11] The Prince of
[1:24:16] Peace his ways are not
[1:24:21] violence he changes
[1:24:24] people through a born again
[1:24:27] experience that's not available to
[1:24:31] legalist they can have it if they want
[1:24:34] but as long as you choose
[1:24:37] legalism you'll have a problem being
[1:24:39] born
[1:24:46] again you've got to mortify the Deeds of
[1:24:49] the
[1:24:50] flesh to man
[1:24:52] manifest the Deeds of the
[1:24:57] spirit Matthew
[1:25:01] 10 here he is the king of the
[1:25:04] Jews he entered into his lamb
[1:25:08] Ministry and as the Lamb of
[1:25:11] God he chooses 12
[1:25:14] men to begin taking this preaching of
[1:25:18] the
[1:25:20] Gospel of the kingdom of heav
[1:25:24] to the Jewish
[1:25:25] people go only to the house of
[1:25:29] Israel go only to the eldest to the
[1:25:32] eldest son the
[1:25:35] first and when they reject it and he
[1:25:39] knew they
[1:25:40] would he showed it in a
[1:25:45] type Peter said I saw
[1:25:49] Jesus walk up to a fig tree
[1:25:53] it had many
[1:25:54] leaves it was it was
[1:25:57] Springtime all the trees were full of
[1:26:01] Liv and Jesus looked upon it and it
[1:26:04] looked like he was looking to see if
[1:26:06] there's any fruit on
[1:26:08] it he said and in my mind I thought well
[1:26:11] he won't find
[1:26:13] any the tree won't give fruit for a few
[1:26:15] more
[1:26:17] months it's not it's not time for it to
[1:26:20] give fruit
[1:26:21] yet but it's a but it's a beautiful
[1:26:24] tree leaves all
[1:26:27] over and then Jesus looked at the
[1:26:30] tree and he said you have no fruit on
[1:26:33] you and he cursed the
[1:26:35] tree and the and the tree
[1:26:38] died
[1:26:40] immediately the tree was
[1:26:42] Israel the prophecy was for that
[1:26:46] day that Israel would not give
[1:26:49] fruit at the first coming of Christ
[1:26:53] she would die in her
[1:26:56] sins but and a New Testament Church
[1:26:59] would rise
[1:27:00] up and God would have a wife a gentile
[1:27:09] bride he would take the same gospel to
[1:27:11] Israel
[1:27:13] again but not until this
[1:27:17] gospel was
[1:27:18] preached the world
[1:27:21] over seven times around the
[1:27:23] world God sent a prophet to take a
[1:27:29] message opening the Lamb's Book to the
[1:27:33] people and there would be a little
[1:27:37] flock who would surrender their
[1:27:39] lives and in that
[1:27:41] surrender God would give us a
[1:27:45] revelation to live a better
[1:27:47] life to have a better hope to have a
[1:27:51] stronger faith
[1:27:54] to be
[1:27:56] changed Glory upon
[1:27:58] glory to be changed in every
[1:28:03] way in our
[1:28:04] nature our character as men and
[1:28:08] women as husbands and wives as fathers
[1:28:12] and
[1:28:15] children using the wisdom of
[1:28:18] God and the Very nature of the Holy
[1:28:21] Spirit
[1:28:23] we would deal and treat each
[1:28:26] other in the love of God with great
[1:28:30] Mercy Jesus preached it it was his
[1:28:34] teaching on
[1:28:36] Perfection he told us step by
[1:28:40] step the steps that it would
[1:28:42] take to make it into eternal
[1:28:49] life the
[1:28:51] king
[1:28:53] Matthew 1
[1:28:55] to10 he goes from being a
[1:28:58] child being born the king of the
[1:29:03] Jews drops down into this
[1:29:07] Earth and begins
[1:29:09] unfolding a
[1:29:11] Ministry a Ministry like the world has
[1:29:14] never
[1:29:16] known the second
[1:29:18] Adam the king says I'll be an evangelist
[1:29:23] first a teacher a prophet and a lamb of
[1:29:28] God by chapter
[1:29:31] n Jesus had entered in his prophetic
[1:29:35] ministry as Lamb of God one who could
[1:29:38] forgive
[1:29:40] sins in chapter 10 he sets the church in
[1:29:45] order he calls a Ministry to get
[1:29:48] ready then he starts
[1:29:50] unfolding in Matthew
[1:29:53] 11 this Lamb of
[1:29:56] God begins a
[1:29:58] teaching Matthew
[1:30:00] 11:1 and it came to
[1:30:03] pass when Jesus had made an
[1:30:06] end of commanding his 12
[1:30:09] disciples of putting the ministry in
[1:30:12] order for the
[1:30:15] church you see he departed
[1:30:18] thence to teach and to preach in their
[1:30:20] cities
[1:30:24] now when John had heard in the prison
[1:30:26] The Works of
[1:30:30] Christ this anointed
[1:30:33] man he sent two of his
[1:30:38] disciples and he said unto
[1:30:40] them art thou he that should come or do
[1:30:43] we look for
[1:30:47] another John was in
[1:30:49] prison John was locked up
[1:30:52] [Music]
[1:30:54] John John was just days away from being
[1:30:58] beheaded John wasn't feeling too
[1:31:01] good he was
[1:31:03] struggling as they say
[1:31:05] today his PTSD was kicking
[1:31:10] in he was in post he was in post stress
[1:31:14] traumatic
[1:31:17] syndrome he had been rejected by
[1:31:20] Israel
[1:31:22] now he was in prison because he had
[1:31:25] preached to
[1:31:26] Herod the truth of marriage and
[1:31:30] divorce and he said Herod
[1:31:33] publicly it ain't you it ain't right for
[1:31:35] you to take your brother's
[1:31:38] wife divorce doesn't make her your
[1:31:42] wife this is
[1:31:47] wrong and herod's new wife didn't like
[1:31:50] that
[1:31:55] and they had him
[1:31:58] imprisoned and he sitting there it's the
[1:32:01] end of his
[1:32:03] ministry he's not in
[1:32:07] prison because he couldn't
[1:32:10] escape he's in prison because he's
[1:32:13] fulfilled his
[1:32:15] ministry and God has taking him
[1:32:19] home for no man had power over
[1:32:23] John as long as God needed him
[1:32:28] yet and when God was done with
[1:32:31] him he he drew back his
[1:32:34] power he said John I'm going to bring
[1:32:37] you
[1:32:38] home no more suffering no more pain no
[1:32:43] more rejection the ministry is been hard
[1:32:46] on your
[1:32:48] life but fear not you'll suffer no more
[1:32:54] but as a man he was still in his
[1:32:58] mind
[1:33:00] troubled did I do the right thing am I
[1:33:03] really a
[1:33:04] prophet is my cousin who six months
[1:33:07] younger than me could he really be
[1:33:11] Messiah all these thoughts are going
[1:33:13] through this poor man's
[1:33:17] head and he sends two of his
[1:33:20] disciples now when John had now when
[1:33:24] John verse
[1:33:26] 4 Jesus answered and said unto them go
[1:33:30] and show John again those things which
[1:33:33] you do hear and
[1:33:38] see he didn't
[1:33:41] say has John lost all his Revelation
[1:33:44] what's wrong with
[1:33:46] John no he didn't say that no no cuz he
[1:33:50] knew who John was
[1:33:52] he was the Forerunner he was Elijah his
[1:33:56] present
[1:33:58] struggle did not anal the ministry that
[1:34:02] God had given
[1:34:05] him Jesus
[1:34:08] said Go and show John again those things
[1:34:11] which you hear and
[1:34:15] see that you've seen in this in in the
[1:34:19] healing campaigns
[1:34:26] the blind receive their
[1:34:28] sight it happened in our
[1:34:31] generation the lame walk it happened in
[1:34:34] our
[1:34:35] generation the lepers are
[1:34:37] cleansed and the deaf here it happened
[1:34:41] in our
[1:34:42] generation the dead are raised up
[1:34:45] happened in our
[1:34:47] generation and the poor have the gospel
[1:34:51] preach to them these Seven
[1:34:55] Seals and blessed is
[1:34:59] he because he was speaking to a
[1:35:01] multitude of
[1:35:03] people whosoever shall not be offended
[1:35:07] me because he was Discerning the people
[1:35:10] the crowd in front of
[1:35:13] him and as he was preaching on
[1:35:17] this the people were being
[1:35:20] offended
[1:35:22] he's talking about himself they
[1:35:26] said I think he means
[1:35:29] him he did mean
[1:35:33] him and he discerns the hearts of the
[1:35:38] people he said and blessed is he
[1:35:40] whosoever shall not be offended in
[1:35:45] me and as they departed Jesus began to
[1:35:48] say unto the
[1:35:50] multitudes
[1:35:53] concerning
[1:35:54] John what went you out to the Wilderness
[1:35:56] to
[1:35:57] see a read shaken with the
[1:36:01] wind but what went you out to
[1:36:03] see a man clothed in soft
[1:36:07] rment in Matthew
[1:36:10] 11 the lamb is opening the first
[1:36:14] seal and it's a
[1:36:16] Teaching
[1:36:18] Ministry that's what the prophecy said
[1:36:21] turn with me to
[1:36:23] Revelations Revelations
[1:36:27] apocalypsis chapter
[1:36:36] 6 and verse
[1:36:39] one Revelations 6 and
[1:36:42] 1 is Matthew
[1:36:45] 11 this is the
[1:36:47] prophecy Matthew 11 is where it happened
[1:36:52] is where this
[1:36:53] unfolded
[1:36:55] reality and I saw when the lamb opened
[1:36:59] one of the
[1:37:01] seals in Matthew
[1:37:03] 11 and I heard as it were the noise of
[1:37:07] [Music]
[1:37:09] Thunder a prophet told us what is a
[1:37:13] thunder a thunder is the voice of God
[1:37:17] when a seal is
[1:37:20] open
[1:37:25] so the lamb
[1:37:27] opening and I saw when the lamb opened
[1:37:30] one of the
[1:37:34] seals he saw the lamb a lamb open one of
[1:37:38] the
[1:37:40] seals and he and he heard and this
[1:37:44] opening had the sound of a
[1:37:48] Thunder God doubly
[1:37:52] vindicating that a thunder is the voice
[1:37:56] of God meaning the seal is
[1:37:59] opened and one of the four be
[1:38:03] saying come and
[1:38:06] see it doesn't say here that he was
[1:38:09] opening the first
[1:38:11] seal it says and I saw when the lamb
[1:38:13] opened one of the
[1:38:16] seal so how do we know this was the
[1:38:19] first
[1:38:20] seal because in verse three it says this
[1:38:25] and when he had opened the second
[1:38:28] seal oh don't you love the way God
[1:38:30] writes his
[1:38:33] book if you put a period right there and
[1:38:35] say I'm not reading no
[1:38:37] more you're putting a period on God
[1:38:40] being able to reveal to you his gospel
[1:38:43] his
[1:38:45] word we can never put a
[1:38:48] period must always put a comma
[1:38:52] because it's an eternal book this Lamb's
[1:38:55] Book of
[1:38:57] Life when we keep reading that's when we
[1:39:02] realize that verse one was the first
[1:39:06] seal and one of the four be
[1:39:11] saying it doesn't tell us which one of
[1:39:14] the four
[1:39:16] beast but in the chapters
[1:39:20] prior it tells us which one was the
[1:39:27] first turn with me to Genesis chapter 4
[1:39:30] Revelations chapter
[1:39:35] 4 Revelations chapter
[1:39:38] 4 is a scene of the Throne of
[1:39:42] God but but on this scene you go back
[1:39:46] and read the whole
[1:39:48] chapter you'll realize there's no lamb
[1:39:52] on the altar in
[1:39:56] this in in this part of the
[1:39:58] scrip in this
[1:40:01] Throne no lamb no blood that means
[1:40:06] Redemption is
[1:40:09] over and you've been reading the
[1:40:12] message you've heard where brother
[1:40:14] Brandon reads Revelations
[1:40:19] 41 he says and after after this I looked
[1:40:21] and behold a door was opened in
[1:40:25] heaven John speaking and the first voice
[1:40:28] which I heard was it is it worth of a
[1:40:30] trumpet talking with
[1:40:33] me which said come up
[1:40:36] hither and I will show thee things which
[1:40:40] must be
[1:40:41] Hereafter and
[1:40:43] immediately I was in the spirit and
[1:40:46] behold a throne was set
[1:40:48] in and one sat on the throne
[1:40:52] brother brandham says John is a type of
[1:40:55] the
[1:40:56] bride and this is the rapture taking
[1:40:59] place so what
[1:41:03] follows the bride who was he says and
[1:41:07] immediately I was in the
[1:41:10] spirit and behold a throne was s set in
[1:41:14] heaven and one sat on the
[1:41:17] throne a raptured
[1:41:19] bride a wise
[1:41:23] virgin will sit on the throne with the
[1:41:25] king of
[1:41:28] kings and judge the whole
[1:41:30] world this is that
[1:41:32] Throne that's why there's no blood on
[1:41:35] this
[1:41:36] Throne because this is the white Throne
[1:41:41] Judgment at the end of
[1:41:44] time in verse
[1:41:46] S it begins to describe these living
[1:41:50] creatures
[1:41:53] each one represents the ministry of
[1:41:55] almighty
[1:41:57] God through seven Church
[1:42:00] ages just like the just like those four
[1:42:04] horses represent the ministry of
[1:42:08] Lucifer through seven Church
[1:42:11] ages he said and the first
[1:42:14] Beast was like a
[1:42:16] lion there's the
[1:42:19] answer to revelation
[1:42:22] 61 of who was that
[1:42:26] Beast say and I 61 I heard as it were
[1:42:29] the noise of Thunder one of the four be
[1:42:32] saying come and
