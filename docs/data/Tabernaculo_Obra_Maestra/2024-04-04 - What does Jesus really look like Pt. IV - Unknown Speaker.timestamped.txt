[44:57] our hearts full of
[45:00] Thanksgiving giving him praise and

[48:57] this
[48:59] title what does Jesus really look
[49:04] like it's part
[49:06] four and if you'll turn with me into
[49:08] your in your Bibles
[49:12] there in Matthew uh
[49:25] 11
[49:35] Matthew 11 and verse
[49:55] 29
[49:57] thank
[50:03] you Matthew 11 and and verse
[50:11] 29 and it reads like
[50:13] this take my yoke upon you and learn of
[50:18] me for I am meek and lonely in heart and
[50:21] ye shall find rest unto your
[50:25] souls
[50:30] the first thing he said was take my yoke
[50:32] upon
[50:34] you it's the first step to learn of
[50:38] him it's the first step for him to
[50:41] acknowledge I'll be your
[50:44] teacher he said take my yoke upon
[50:47] you then you can begin
[50:51] learning he said for I am meek and
[50:55] lonly he already teaching
[50:57] teaching he's not just saying I am meek
[51:00] and
[51:02] lowly he's saying I'm teaching
[51:06] you and you too can be meek and
[51:10] low in
[51:12] heart and you shall find rest into your
[51:16] souls and and then he understood the the
[51:21] what he had said had kind of shook
[51:23] people up a
[51:25] little
[51:27] the part about take my yoke upon
[51:31] you so then he he discerned what the
[51:34] people was in the people's
[51:36] hearts he's the word he discerns the
[51:40] heart so he said I need to speak on that
[51:44] that's troubling him right now what I
[51:47] said and he did then he said for my
[51:52] yoke the part that That Shook You that's
[51:57] troubled
[51:58] you you want to learn but do I have to
[52:02] take his yoke upon
[52:04] me the answer is yes but he tells us but
[52:08] remember
[52:09] this my yoke is easy Satan's yoke is
[52:16] hard Satan's yoke is
[52:19] heavy Satan's joke will manipulate
[52:23] you joke will use you
[52:27] my yoke is
[52:29] easy and my burden the weight I will put
[52:32] upon
[52:34] you it's nothing like sin it's nothing
[52:38] like
[52:39] sin it's
[52:41] light it's evening
[52:44] light let's pray Heavenly Father we
[52:48] thank you once again and we ask your
[52:51] blessings now upon your
[52:53] word we believe you've received our
[52:56] worship
[52:58] Lord acknowledge
[53:01] it by giving us now your word and
[53:05] touching every
[53:07] heart in Jesus name amen amen you may be
[53:13] seated we've been
[53:16] speaking on what Jesus really looks
[53:21] like his his
[53:24] attributes prophet
[53:27] priest king his
[53:30] ministry Apostle Prophet teacher
[53:36] evangelist his nature when he said learn
[53:39] of
[53:40] me when he said take my yoke upon
[53:44] you I am meek and
[53:50] lonely in
[53:51] heart and you shall find rest unto your
[53:55] souls do you know what Jesus was
[53:58] speaking
[53:58] of it it's it it is something he spoke
[54:02] about more than you can
[54:05] imagine it's something the apostles
[54:08] spoke about more than we even
[54:12] realized for for it wasn't just in St
[54:15] John
[54:16] 3 where Jesus first mentioned to
[54:21] Nicodemus and said you must be born
[54:23] again but if you can let God reveal R to
[54:28] you then you'll realize here in in in in
[54:32] in Matthew
[54:35] 11:29 take my yoke upon
[54:38] you calling you and asking you to be
[54:40] born again
[54:43] of the teaching
[54:45] begins then the learning begins then the
[54:49] relationship
[54:54] begin his position
[54:57] in the seven sealed
[55:00] book which is also called the Lamb's
[55:03] Book of
[55:05] Life not two different
[55:07] books it's the same book because it's a
[55:10] book of
[55:12] redemption it's how he hides himself
[55:14] from the eyes of the wise and
[55:17] prudent adding
[55:20] detail line upon
[55:23] line word upon word
[55:26] where you can't just go to one
[55:30] scripture and say I got it no no there's
[55:33] more there's always
[55:36] more there's always more of himself that
[55:40] he wants to give to you and he wants to
[55:43] give to
[55:46] me in this Lamb's Book of
[55:50] Life of course he was the Lamb of
[55:53] God and he was the lion of the tribe of
[55:58] and these are the two
[56:00] characteristics that he first dwelt
[56:02] in to open the book open it first to
[56:08] Israel he descended as the Lamb of
[56:12] God long before he died on the
[56:16] cross long before they took his
[56:21] life he wasn't the Lamb of
[56:24] God when he went to the cross
[56:27] he was born the Lamb of
[56:29] God he was being tested tried he was
[56:34] being
[56:35] shown that he was a worthy
[56:38] lamb that there was no wrinkle on
[56:41] him there was no spot upon him that the
[56:45] body that God had
[56:47] made come through an Immaculate perfect
[56:50] birthing
[56:52] process what is that process by which he
[56:56] was born the same process by which you
[56:59] and I are
[57:00] born by the Spoken Word by the original
[57:05] scene by the Holy Spirit
[57:08] Creator creating a new
[57:10] creature that was the body of Jesus and
[57:14] that's who you and I
[57:16] are born again as he was born the spoken
[57:21] word the word creative word of
[57:24] God that's how we born
[57:27] again and it makes
[57:29] us made him a whole new
[57:33] creation different from this flesh
[57:36] body very
[57:39] different we read Mark in Mark
[57:53] 10:4 Mark 10 Marco
[57:59] and verse
[58:05] 45 the many different positions of his
[58:10] ministry but remember when he speaks of
[58:13] his
[58:14] ministry he's giving charact he's given
[58:17] to
[58:18] us the
[58:20] characteristics of the five
[58:23] Ministry so that you can recognize him
[58:27] you can know
[58:28] them so that you can test
[58:31] them you don't have to stay under an
[58:34] unjust
[58:36] Steward God don't want you to stay under
[58:39] an unjust
[58:41] Steward he wants you to
[58:43] be under a man that he's
[58:46] called that has surrendered his life and
[58:49] gift back to
[58:51] God for your
[58:53] edification so that you can come to the
[58:55] fullness
[58:58] Jesus
[58:59] Christ mark
[59:02] 10:4 it said
[59:04] for let's begin in
[59:08] 43 but so shall it not be among you
[59:11] Jesus
[59:13] said whosoever will be great among you
[59:16] shall be your
[59:21] minister and whosoever of you will be
[59:23] the chiefest shall be sh shall be
[59:26] servant of
[59:30] all for even the son of man came not to
[59:33] be ministered
[59:37] unto this son of man was the king of the
[59:42] Jews this son of man was the Lamb of
[59:47] God Son of Man was your
[59:50] savior and this son of man came minister
[59:54] to you help you to lift you up not for
[59:59] you to serve
[1:00:01] him as as as as one would serve a king
[1:00:04] on this
[1:00:06] Earth where the Kings live in
[1:00:10] luxury and the people imp
[1:00:12] poverty not this King he says I want to
[1:00:16] bring you
[1:00:17] up into my kingdom hallelujah amen so
[1:00:21] that you two can
[1:00:23] live kings and queens
[1:00:27] for even the son of man came not to be
[1:00:29] ministered unto but to minister and to
[1:00:32] give his life a ransom for
[1:00:40] many as the ministry of Jesus
[1:00:44] was so he wants the five full ministry
[1:00:48] who he
[1:00:50] calls to be just like him remember
[1:00:53] Ephesians
[1:00:54] 4:11
[1:00:56] where Paul said he gave
[1:00:58] some these Ministries and these
[1:01:02] gifts but some will not give their lives
[1:01:05] with the gift back to
[1:01:09] him to edify his
[1:01:12] children remember we quoted from that
[1:01:15] message the 20th century
[1:01:19] Prophet it spoke to us of a man A A
[1:01:23] Gifted Man gifted evangelist
[1:01:28] who who was praying for the
[1:01:31] sick in a certain
[1:01:34] church and and and he he used his
[1:01:38] gift to call out a
[1:01:41] woman but when he called her
[1:01:43] out he publicly denounced her as a
[1:01:48] witch this a sister who had been a
[1:01:51] member of this church there for many
[1:01:54] years
[1:01:56] it shocked
[1:01:58] her it shocked the
[1:02:00] church people looked at her now very
[1:02:04] differently though they've known her for
[1:02:07] years and the Evangelist they didn't
[1:02:10] know but because he had a
[1:02:15] gift and he called her a
[1:02:19] witch and it was it was destroying her
[1:02:24] relationship with the brethren in the
[1:02:29] church it was destroying her friendships
[1:02:32] of many
[1:02:34] years it was turning friends into
[1:02:40] enemies and one day she went to another
[1:02:45] meeting where another she thought
[1:02:48] evangelist was praying for the
[1:02:51] sick because this had so affected
[1:02:54] her she physically was feeling
[1:02:58] sick she thought she had was having
[1:03:01] heart
[1:03:04] problems and by the grace of God he was
[1:03:07] given a prayer
[1:03:09] card and her number was
[1:03:13] called and the man that was going to
[1:03:15] pray for
[1:03:16] her was a man called William Mariam BR
[1:03:20] William to the world he was a man with a
[1:03:25] gift of heal
[1:03:27] that prayed for the sick but he was
[1:03:30] more and when she stood in front of this
[1:03:34] Gifted
[1:03:36] Man now remember the last one had a gift
[1:03:41] too remember the last one claimed he
[1:03:43] believed in Divine
[1:03:50] Healing and now she's coming before
[1:03:52] another
[1:03:54] man
[1:03:57] and as she walks up brother brandham
[1:04:00] goes
[1:04:02] to speaking to
[1:04:06] her and he says uh I see you have uh
[1:04:10] heart
[1:04:12] problems he says but I also see there's
[1:04:14] a black
[1:04:16] sheet that's been following you for some
[1:04:19] time
[1:04:20] now everywhere you go this black sheet
[1:04:23] is following you
[1:04:27] he said wait a
[1:04:29] minute that black
[1:04:31] sheet that's a lie that someone told
[1:04:34] about
[1:04:35] you he says and that's what's affecting
[1:04:38] your
[1:04:39] heart you don't have heart
[1:04:42] problems this is just making you very
[1:04:45] nervous this is breaking you
[1:04:48] down he says oh
[1:04:51] yes now I see
[1:04:53] it he says there was a man man who who
[1:04:56] who who believed in Divine
[1:04:59] Healing he was praying for the sick in
[1:05:02] church and he said you were a
[1:05:05] witch and the woman begins to cry and
[1:05:09] Shake he said yes it's
[1:05:11] true he says you're no
[1:05:15] witch a lie
[1:05:18] he and yet he was A Gifted
[1:05:24] Man remember
[1:05:28] Ephesians chapter 2 and two we read
[1:05:32] there where it
[1:05:36] says we have tried them that have called
[1:05:40] themselves
[1:05:43] prophets and are not and we have found
[1:05:47] them to be Liars in other words they
[1:05:50] were not God's
[1:05:53] Apostles they were born with a gift
[1:05:57] God gave it but they never gave the gift
[1:06:01] back for the edifying of the people of
[1:06:05] God for the perfecting of the saints of
[1:06:08] God no but they kept the
[1:06:11] gift and they used it because they were
[1:06:14] men who were never born again they were
[1:06:18] men without the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:21] Ghost and get a gift like that in their
[1:06:24] lives you say where does the Bible speak
[1:06:27] of something like
[1:06:29] that you go and read
[1:06:32] it there in Matthew chapter 10 God
[1:06:37] ordains 12
[1:06:40] men he called some of them to be
[1:06:45] Apostles to establish the
[1:06:48] church New Testament Church to establish
[1:06:52] Elders in this new
[1:06:54] testament them later he tells
[1:06:58] us I have called 12 of
[1:07:01] you I've given you gifts of
[1:07:04] healing he says but one of you is a
[1:07:08] devil was it that
[1:07:12] way it repeats and has
[1:07:15] repeated all the way into our Century
[1:07:18] over
[1:07:20] again because though
[1:07:23] gifted never born again
[1:07:26] never receive the Holy Ghost and
[1:07:28] Fire oh they can preach like a like a
[1:07:32] fire on a windy
[1:07:34] day they can turn and speak horrible
[1:07:37] things to
[1:07:39] you for they've never been born again
[1:07:43] they don't have the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:46] Ghost they love
[1:07:48] popularity love to be lifted up in
[1:07:52] h but they don't edify the church
[1:07:56] they seek their own
[1:08:00] edification one Gifted
[1:08:03] Man born with a gift was destroying this
[1:08:07] woman
[1:08:08] with with his
[1:08:12] gift another Gifted
[1:08:15] Man with his
[1:08:17] gift surrendered to God and his life
[1:08:21] also set this woman
[1:08:24] free Discerning that the other
[1:08:28] Ministry was a
[1:08:30] liar with a
[1:08:32] gift it stumbles the people so
[1:08:37] much how can he be
[1:08:40] that so
[1:08:45] gifted and do what he does to the people
[1:08:47] of
[1:08:49] God because he's never been born
[1:08:52] again never received the baptism of the
[1:08:54] Holy
[1:08:57] like the Pharisees in the days of
[1:08:59] Jesus they had a
[1:09:02] Zeal for God they
[1:09:04] said and the and the Zeal was so
[1:09:08] strong that like Cain they were willing
[1:09:12] to kill for their
[1:09:14] God even it was even if it was their own
[1:09:18] brother do you see the two Spirits all
[1:09:22] the way from Eden coming down
[1:09:27] because they haven't been born again
[1:09:30] because they won't be born
[1:09:34] again like
[1:09:36] Judas have not I jesus chosen 12 of
[1:09:42] you but I want to tell
[1:09:45] you despite that I have chosen you
[1:09:49] 12 one of you is the
[1:09:54] devil
[1:09:56] is it possible for a man to be called of
[1:10:00] God to
[1:10:02] minister and still be found a
[1:10:06] liar who makes merchandise of God's
[1:10:11] people Jesus said yes even I have chosen
[1:10:16] 12 of
[1:10:17] you one of you is a devil and then I
[1:10:21] chose 70
[1:10:23] more and they all walked away from
[1:10:26] I he ordained 70
[1:10:29] more he gave them a gift to help God's
[1:10:36] people but because he had entered the
[1:10:38] third pool of his
[1:10:41] ministry the
[1:10:43] word and he said if you don't eat my
[1:10:46] flesh and drink my
[1:10:48] blood you have no part with me and the
[1:10:52] 70
[1:10:53] said we keep the
[1:10:57] gift we'll tell people we're ordained of
[1:11:00] Jesus of
[1:11:02] Nazareth but you should have stayed an
[1:11:05] evangelist because these doctrines
[1:11:07] you're preaching
[1:11:09] now contrary to our
[1:11:13] organization contrary to what what what
[1:11:16] other men have taught
[1:11:18] us they contrary to our
[1:11:21] churches to our Creeds and
[1:11:24] dogas we will keep the
[1:11:27] gift but we're not following
[1:11:30] you we won't take your yoke upon
[1:11:36] us so they stopped
[1:11:38] learning matter of fact they never even
[1:11:42] started that was their starting
[1:11:46] day day one
[1:11:49] start day two they walked away turned
[1:11:54] their back on Jesus Christ The Living
[1:12:06] Word just like this
[1:12:09] woman who this unj
[1:12:12] Steward had brought so much pain to her
[1:12:16] life but yet Jesus Christ
[1:12:20] said so we want to go back to where we
[1:12:22] left off on
[1:12:24] Sunday
[1:12:26] there in St John
[1:12:28] 14 just like the woman at the
[1:12:32] well this woman but the woman at the
[1:12:35] well represents more than just a
[1:12:40] woman who had been turned out by Mom and
[1:12:45] Dad who had gone off to live a life as a
[1:12:51] prostitute and she had come to a place
[1:12:55] where she had lost all
[1:12:57] trust in
[1:13:00] everyone let's begin there in St John
[1:13:02] chapter
[1:13:04] 4 and what we're really looking at
[1:13:07] here not just the scene of a woman
[1:13:10] defrauded and
[1:13:16] defiled but we're watching this scene of
[1:13:19] a church
[1:13:21] defrauded and defiled by unjust stewards
[1:13:28] fful
[1:13:30] Ministry that gave their hearts to the
[1:13:35] devil get very
[1:13:37] religious and get with gifts in their
[1:13:40] lives Ephesians 4:11 said and he gave
[1:13:44] some Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:13:49] evangelist and some pastors and some
[1:13:52] teachers he gave some
[1:13:55] because he didn't give all of them that
[1:13:57] claim they're
[1:14:00] his as a matter of
[1:14:02] fact many are the children and the
[1:14:06] Ministers of the bonds
[1:14:14] woman but few are the
[1:14:19] children and the
[1:14:21] ministry of the free
[1:14:23] woman like like Sarah sah and
[1:14:28] Hagar St
[1:14:30] John 4:
[1:14:35] 3 Jesus he says he left Juda and
[1:14:39] departed again into
[1:14:44] Gile and he must needs go through
[1:14:48] Samaria Samaria then cometh he to a city
[1:14:51] of Samaria which is called
[1:14:54] Saar
[1:14:57] near to the parcel of ground that Jacob
[1:15:00] gave his son
[1:15:04] Joseph now Jacob's Well was
[1:15:07] there Jesus therefore being wearied with
[1:15:10] his
[1:15:12] journey sat thus on the
[1:15:15] well and it was about the sixth
[1:15:21] hour it was about the time that the the
[1:15:24] the the six seal was
[1:15:27] unfolding which is about the time of
[1:15:30] World War
[1:15:33] II in other words God knew about this
[1:15:38] before the foundation of the
[1:15:40] world and when the season
[1:15:43] came daughter was on the
[1:15:45] earth he came to meet with
[1:15:48] her give her a lifechanging
[1:15:53] experience
[1:15:56] verse six now Jac now Jacob's Well was
[1:15:59] there Jesus therefore being wearied with
[1:16:02] his journey sat thus on the
[1:16:08] well and it was about the sixth
[1:16:11] hour in other words getting ready to go
[1:16:16] into the seventh
[1:16:19] hour remember how many husbands she
[1:16:23] had six
[1:16:25] but she was getting ready to meet her
[1:16:29] seventh the one that really loved her
[1:16:32] the one that really would care for
[1:16:34] her the one that she could really trust
[1:16:36] and depend
[1:16:40] on verse seven there cometh a woman of
[1:16:44] Samaria to draw
[1:16:47] water Jesus saith unto
[1:16:50] her give me to drink and he knew he was
[1:16:54] breaking all the
[1:16:57] rules that he'd been taught as a
[1:17:01] Jew never talk to a
[1:17:04] Samaritan never travel to a Samaritan
[1:17:07] City and never be caught talking with a
[1:17:10] prostitude in
[1:17:13] public these were things that you should
[1:17:16] never do as a
[1:17:18] Jew he was
[1:17:21] known dressed and looked like
[1:17:26] a
[1:17:28] Jew three things already broken you
[1:17:33] could say it was strike three and he
[1:17:34] barely
[1:17:38] started
[1:17:42] strikes verse
[1:17:44] eight for his disciples were gone away
[1:17:47] into the city to buy
[1:17:51] meat then saith the woman of Samaria
[1:17:54] unto
[1:17:56] him how is it that thou being a Jew
[1:18:00] askest drink of
[1:18:03] me which I'm a woman of
[1:18:06] Samaria for the Jews have no dealings
[1:18:09] with the
[1:18:12] Samaritan she was quick to correct
[1:18:15] him she had no trust for
[1:18:20] anyone she was there alone because she
[1:18:23] wasn't allowed to come with the
[1:18:25] respectful women of the
[1:18:29] city the heat of the
[1:18:32] day the
[1:18:36] morning just the fact of the time of day
[1:18:39] she was
[1:18:41] there marked
[1:18:45] her as a woman a
[1:18:49] prostitute and a
[1:18:53] Samaritan Jesus answered and said unto
[1:18:57] her if thou knewest the gift of
[1:19:01] God a gift of healing a gift of
[1:19:05] Salvation a gift of
[1:19:08] redemption a gift of
[1:19:10] discernment every gift was in this
[1:19:14] man he said if you'd only know the gift
[1:19:17] of
[1:19:19] God and who it is that saith to
[1:19:22] thee give me a drink
[1:19:25] well tonight he's asking every one of
[1:19:28] you if you knew the gift of
[1:19:32] God you'd be saying give me a drink
[1:19:36] Lord
[1:19:38] thirst give me a
[1:19:40] drink that thou would have asked of
[1:19:43] him and he would have given thee Living
[1:19:46] Water you see how he said it if thou
[1:19:49] knewest the gift of
[1:19:51] God and who it is that sayith to thee
[1:19:54] give
[1:19:56] thou would have asked
[1:19:57] me he didn't say
[1:20:01] me God the
[1:20:05] Creator the almighty
[1:20:07] one
[1:20:09] deliver your hope
[1:20:14] mine he said and
[1:20:18] he thou would have asked of
[1:20:21] him and you know what he would have done
[1:20:23] tonight
[1:20:25] he would have given you the Living
[1:20:31] Water the woman sayth unto
[1:20:34] him sir thou has nothing to draw
[1:20:38] with all she could see was what was her
[1:20:42] with her
[1:20:43] eyes Jesus had
[1:20:46] said she couldn't see
[1:20:49] him she just saw the reflection of who
[1:20:52] he was on the
[1:20:53] Earth but in him this man Jesus wel the
[1:21:00] fullness God
[1:21:03] bodily oh he was all
[1:21:06] God but she just saw a
[1:21:09] man the woman saith unto her sir thou
[1:21:12] has nothing to draw with and the well is
[1:21:17] deep when then has thou The Living
[1:21:21] Water art thou greater than our father
[1:21:26] Jacob well and drank thereof
[1:21:30] himself and his
[1:21:33] children Jesus answered Jesus answered
[1:21:35] and said unto
[1:21:37] her
[1:21:38] whosoever drinketh of this
[1:21:41] water shall thirst
[1:21:44] again but whosoever drinketh of the
[1:21:47] water that I shall give
[1:21:49] him shall never
[1:21:51] thirst but the water that I shall give
[1:21:54] him shall be in him a well of
[1:21:58] water springing up into Everlasting
[1:22:05] Life Born Again
[1:22:09] experience it's the baptism of the Holy
[1:22:12] Ghost it's what makes you and I a new
[1:22:16] creation and when that
[1:22:19] happens we can never be the same
[1:22:22] again what will be now is more like him
[1:22:27] every
[1:22:30] day but remember what he
[1:22:33] said take my yoke upon
[1:22:37] you the woman of the
[1:22:39] well was about to do just
[1:22:45] that the woman saith unto
[1:22:48] him sir give me this water that I thirst
[1:22:53] not neither come hither to
[1:22:57] draw I'm tired of coming here at this
[1:23:01] time of
[1:23:02] day you don't know how it makes me
[1:23:05] feel it's
[1:23:08] embarrassing people look down on
[1:23:10] me everybody knows why I come at this
[1:23:14] time because it's the way I've been
[1:23:19] living I don't want to come here anymore
[1:23:22] and be identified this way
[1:23:26] give me this water so I don't have to
[1:23:29] come at this time this
[1:23:35] way she was still thinking very
[1:23:40] natural Jesus saith unto
[1:23:44] her go call thy
[1:23:47] husband and come
[1:23:50] here because what I'm about to discuss
[1:23:53] with you
[1:23:55] I'd like your husband to be
[1:23:58] present the woman
[1:24:00] answered she was thinking she was
[1:24:05] StreetWise very
[1:24:08] StreetWise very
[1:24:10] quickly it was that fast moving
[1:24:15] mind that got her in so much trouble
[1:24:17] over the
[1:24:20] years quick to always pick the wrong man
[1:24:23] again
[1:24:26] the woman answered and
[1:24:28] said what shall I tell him now I know I
[1:24:33] have no husband in other words I don't
[1:24:36] have a
[1:24:38] husband she thought that's really not a
[1:24:42] lie because I actually I'm already had
[1:24:44] five of
[1:24:46] them so if I tell him I I don't have one
[1:24:50] husband I'm not really lying to them cuz
[1:24:54] he seems like a good
[1:24:56] man there is no better man than
[1:24:59] Jesus for you and I
[1:25:02] tonight the woman answered that I have
[1:25:04] no
[1:25:06] husband Jesus said unto her you liar no
[1:25:11] no no no no no no he caught it he saw
[1:25:15] what she was
[1:25:16] doing you know what he said thou has
[1:25:20] said
[1:25:22] well I have no husband
[1:25:25] I don't have just one you've said well
[1:25:29] very well
[1:25:31] said he says for thou now he begins to
[1:25:36] discern now he goes to the root of the
[1:25:39] problem now he's going to set her free
[1:25:42] he says for thou has had five
[1:25:45] husbands and he whom now now has is not
[1:25:48] thy
[1:25:50] husband so she had six she was on number
[1:25:53] six
[1:25:55] in that thou said us
[1:25:59] truly the woman saith unto him
[1:26:02] sir I
[1:26:04] perceive that
[1:26:06] thou are a
[1:26:13] prophet our fathers worshiped in this
[1:26:16] mountain and you say that in Jerusalem
[1:26:19] is the place where men ought to
[1:26:22] worship now she's getting sensitive to
[1:26:25] the
[1:26:26] spirit now she's speaking on on
[1:26:28] different
[1:26:30] terms now she's approaching it more
[1:26:34] correctly said our fathers worshiped on
[1:26:36] this
[1:26:38] mountain and he say that in Jerusalem is
[1:26:41] the place where men ought to
[1:26:43] worship she was getting ready to say
[1:26:47] Jerusalem is the
[1:26:48] place even though I'm a
[1:26:51] Samaritan I'll go there tell me where to
[1:26:55] go and I'll go there I want Living
[1:27:02] Water Jesus said unto her woman believe
[1:27:05] me the hour cometh when NE when you
[1:27:09] shall neither in this
[1:27:11] mountain yet at
[1:27:13] Jerusalem worship the
[1:27:15] father ye worship ye know not
[1:27:19] what we know what we
[1:27:22] worship for salvation is of the
[1:27:25] Jews the hour
[1:27:27] cometh when is that hour
[1:27:29] coming right
[1:27:31] now the hour cometh and now is right now
[1:27:37] tonight we know what we worship the
[1:27:41] salvation of the
[1:27:43] Jews but the hour cometh and now is when
[1:27:47] the true
[1:27:50] worship because the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:27:52] has been open
[1:27:56] and the first seal has been pulled
[1:27:58] off and part one was unfolding
[1:28:03] here the woman of the
[1:28:06] well this was all happening at the
[1:28:09] opening of the first
[1:28:11] seal all happening at
[1:28:14] the in the days of
[1:28:17] Jesus he was the lamb who opened the
[1:28:21] first seal John said in Revelation 6
[1:28:25] I saw when the
[1:28:27] lamb opened this first seal when did he
[1:28:31] see it
[1:28:33] happened in Matthew
[1:28:35] 11 Jesus opened
[1:28:37] it because he was the
[1:28:40] lamb but we saw it in
[1:28:43] reality in Matthew 11 John saw it in a
[1:28:47] symbol in
[1:28:50] Revelation and we've seen the opening of
[1:28:52] The Seven seal
[1:28:55] everyone else reads it in the book The
[1:28:59] Prophecy and they see
[1:29:01] nothing but we see the
[1:29:04] prophecy becoming history in our
[1:29:08] day Jesus
[1:29:10] said God is a
[1:29:12] spirit and they that worship Him must
[1:29:16] worship Him in spirit and in
[1:29:20] truth that's how we need to
[1:29:23] come to every
[1:29:25] service with a Heart of
[1:29:28] Thanksgiving with praise and worship in
[1:29:30] our
[1:29:32] mouths brings his presence
[1:29:35] down then we can renew our vow with
[1:29:39] him a marriage
[1:29:43] vow and take his yoke upon
[1:29:46] us be born
[1:29:48] again the woman saith unto him I know
[1:29:52] verse 25 I know the Messiah cometh which
[1:29:56] is called Christ when he is come he will
[1:29:59] tell us all
[1:30:06] things now she was moving into the
[1:30:09] channel look at the things she's saying
[1:30:12] now she's digging way
[1:30:17] deep of times when she was a little
[1:30:20] girl and she heard the gospel
[1:30:22] preach the holy spirit is bringing this
[1:30:26] back to her
[1:30:27] memory it seems like I can
[1:30:30] remember Messiah
[1:30:33] comes Jesus com at the second coming is
[1:30:38] Christ and when he comes he'll tell me
[1:30:41] he'll
[1:30:43] tell are in our lives he can make and
[1:30:47] cleanse us
[1:30:49] all Jesus said unto
[1:30:51] her I that speak unto to
[1:30:55] the I'm
[1:30:57] here I'm
[1:31:01] here it's me and I'm here
[1:31:06] tonight and I'm speaking to your
[1:31:10] hearts this
[1:31:13] woman the entire five full
[1:31:18] ministry that she came in contact
[1:31:22] with Jesus told
[1:31:25] when she said I don't have a
[1:31:29] husband he said you've said truth
[1:31:32] because because you've had
[1:31:35] five the entire fivefold
[1:31:40] Ministry that she came in contact
[1:31:43] with were unjust
[1:31:47] stewards how is it
[1:31:49] possible to go from one bad pastor to
[1:31:52] another
[1:31:55] but it
[1:31:57] happens but if you're a daughter of
[1:32:00] God if you're the church if you're part
[1:32:03] of this
[1:32:05] bride you'll finally bump in to
[1:32:10] Jesus the chief
[1:32:12] Pastor evangelist of
[1:32:15] evangelist your high priest and
[1:32:19] apost so the entire fful Ministry that
[1:32:22] she came in contact with
[1:32:26] were unjust
[1:32:28] stewards you see all you see they all
[1:32:31] run in the same
[1:32:33] circles to get out of that
[1:32:36] cycle you have to
[1:32:39] change you've got to change
[1:32:42] husband one who's preaching from an open
[1:32:46] book will bring just
[1:32:50] stewards who who also ministered to you
[1:32:53] these divinely revealed mystery
[1:33:02] truths what did a prophet say about
[1:33:06] this in the seventh
[1:33:08] seal he said this he said I'd like to
[1:33:11] add
[1:33:12] this that of all the services I've ever
[1:33:15] had in my
[1:33:17] life I believe this
[1:33:20] week has been the most glorious time
[1:33:25] of all my life in
[1:33:28] services in the message of the seven
[1:33:33] seal and the recommendation of many
[1:33:36] pastors
[1:33:37] is we don't need the Seven
[1:33:41] Seals they're too
[1:33:44] controversial and we don't need them for
[1:33:46] our
[1:33:49] Salvation unjust
[1:33:52] steward I'm
[1:33:54] sorry because that's not what a prophet
[1:33:58] said he said I'd like to add
[1:34:02] this that of all the services I've ever
[1:34:05] had in my
[1:34:06] life I believe this week has been the
[1:34:09] most glorious time of all my life and
[1:34:14] services I'm sure Jesus was feeling the
[1:34:17] same
[1:34:19] way of all the services I've
[1:34:22] had coming to restore this daughter
[1:34:27] tonight is one of the most glorious
[1:34:31] times to bring
[1:34:33] Salvation to bring
[1:34:35] Deliverance to cleanse the hearts and
[1:34:37] minds
[1:34:40] of I bet Jesus was thinking the same
[1:34:44] thing the woman had
[1:34:46] six the seventh was talking to
[1:34:52] her
[1:34:54] no matter he said I've seen great
[1:34:56] Miracles
[1:35:00] performed of course before in healing
[1:35:05] services but this is beyond
[1:35:09] that this is this what we're
[1:35:13] experiencing this is beyond a healing
[1:35:18] service it's been one of the great
[1:35:22] times highlights of my
[1:35:24] life is to be here the opening of the
[1:35:28] word is healing for the soul it's the
[1:35:32] adoption of
[1:35:34] sons that takes us back to
[1:35:38] Eden Jesus Christ showed
[1:35:41] us how all these
[1:35:43] Ministries should function in the
[1:35:47] restoration of both the Fig Tree and the
[1:35:50] bride
[1:35:52] tree he came as the as the chief
[1:36:03] Shepherd in Hebrews 13 and
[1:36:06] 20 he says now the God of
[1:36:10] Peace that brought again from the dead
[1:36:13] our lord
[1:36:22] Jesus that great Shepherd of the
[1:36:25] sheep through the blood of the
[1:36:27] Everlasting
[1:36:30] Covenant our
[1:36:32] pastor
[1:36:34] tonight Jesus
[1:36:37] Christ verse
[1:36:39] 21 and may he make you perfect in every
[1:36:42] good
[1:36:44] work to do his will working in you that
[1:36:48] which is well
[1:36:52] pleasing like he did for the woman of
[1:36:54] the
[1:36:55] well through Jesus Christ to him be
[1:36:58] glory forever and
[1:37:02] ever amen
[1:37:04] amen he was he's the great
[1:37:07] Shepherd he's the great
[1:37:09] Pastor in Hebrews 3 and
[1:37:12] 1 it says wherefore holy
[1:37:15] Brethren partakers of the Heavenly
[1:37:18] calling consider the Apostle and high
[1:37:21] priest of our profession Christ Jesus
[1:37:29] [Music]
[1:37:30] Jesus he was the first
[1:37:33] Pastor he's the first
[1:37:36] Apostle as you all remember in St John
[1:37:39] 3 where it says there was a man of the
[1:37:43] Pharisees named
[1:37:45] Nicodemus a ruler of the
[1:37:47] Jews and said that the same came to
[1:37:50] Jesus by
[1:37:52] night said unto him
[1:37:55] Rabbi we
[1:37:59] know us
[1:38:01] Priest
[1:38:03] usit Us
[1:38:05] teachers us ministers
[1:38:09] in we know that thou are a
[1:38:13] teacher come from God for no man can do
[1:38:16] these Miracles that thou do
[1:38:19] us except God be with
[1:38:22] him Jesus answered and said unto
[1:38:25] him verely verely I say unto
[1:38:28] you except the man be born
[1:38:31] again unless you take my yoke upon
[1:38:36] you you cannot see the kingdom of
[1:38:39] God you see how he's preaching the Born
[1:38:41] Again
[1:38:44] experience every
[1:38:47] Parable us you must be born again you
[1:38:51] must be born again you must be born
[1:38:56] again you must take my yoke upon
[1:39:01] you and then we say well that's the
[1:39:05] problem that sounds like it that sounds
[1:39:08] like it won't let me have any fun
[1:39:12] anymore but he discerned the
[1:39:14] crowd he said I see the part that
[1:39:17] bothers
[1:39:19] you my
[1:39:21] yoke let me remind you
[1:39:24] my yoke is
[1:39:26] easy unlike the devil's
[1:39:28] yoke it's
[1:39:30] hard my burden is
[1:39:34] light unlike the burden that the devil
[1:39:36] puts on
[1:39:38] you it's heavy you'll Bend under the
[1:39:43] Lo and you'll die in
[1:39:46] sin won't you take my
[1:39:50] Yol Nicodemus answered and said unto him
[1:39:55] how can these things
[1:39:57] be Jesus answered and said unto
[1:40:00] him art thou a master of
[1:40:04] Israel and knowest not these
[1:40:07] things he didn't know but Jesus a
[1:40:11] teacher and a revealer of the
[1:40:15] word Upon This Rock I'll build my

[1:40:48] me Jesus pastor Pastor Apostle my apost
[1:40:55] teacher and in Deuteronomy 18:15
[1:40:59] inom a prophecy coming from the very
[1:41:02] lips of
[1:41:05] Moses he said the Lord thy God will
[1:41:07] raise up unto thee a prophet from the
[1:41:09] midst of
[1:41:14] thee of thy
[1:41:17] Brethren like unto like unto me unto him
[1:41:22] ye shall Heen

[1:41:27] P Moses anointed of the Holy
[1:41:31] Spirit an apostle would been born again
[1:41:35] receive the baptism
[1:41:38] of God brings to his memory by
[1:41:42] Revelation what Moses had said over 2000
[1:41:46] years
[1:41:47] ago and he said this
[1:41:49] day these scriptures have come to pass
[1:41:54] St John
[1:41:57] 146 Jesus setting this church
[1:42:02] free Jesus setting this woman
[1:42:06] free Jesus said unto her go call thy
[1:42:10] husband and come
[1:42:12] hither the woman answered and said I
[1:42:14] have no
[1:42:17] husband Jesus said unto her thou has
[1:42:20] well said I have no husband
[1:42:24] in other words I don't have one husband
[1:42:25] she's
[1:42:27] saying he said that's very well

[1:42:33] five a
[1:42:35] pastor an evangelist a teacher a prophet
[1:42:40] an apostle and all five of them were
[1:42:43] unjust

[1:42:48] down to
[1:42:49] pieces and they've broken families
[1:42:59] yes he says and he whom thou now
[1:43:04] has is not thy
[1:43:06] husband and that said thou
[1:43:10] truly the woman saith unto him

[1:43:16] perceive that thou are a
[1:43:18] Prophet this prostitute

[1:44:09] her and when the Lord saw her he had
[1:44:12] compassion on
[1:44:15] her and said unto her weep

[1:49:07] work oh
[1:49:09] it's been over a year
[1:49:13] ago and I was as I was
[1:49:17] traveling heading
[1:49:21] north and thinking

[1:49:46] again and as I was
[1:49:49] thinking some words Dro down
[1:49:54] it's a
[1:49:56] poem and it goes like
[1:49:58] this sitting in a
[1:50:02] church singing All the Right
[1:50:05] songs staying away from what they tell
[1:50:08] me is
[1:50:12] wrong wanting to be a better person than
[1:50:15] I
[1:50:17] am but I'm not being
[1:50:20] changed in my deep Inner Man
[1:50:23] a prophet said the words been
[1:50:28] revealed the lamb opened the
[1:50:31] book Loos the Seven
[1:50:34] Seals but I am not

[1:50:41] break from the flesh to the
[1:50:44] spirit and no longer be a
[1:50:47] fake I must be born again no more
[1:50:51] pretend
