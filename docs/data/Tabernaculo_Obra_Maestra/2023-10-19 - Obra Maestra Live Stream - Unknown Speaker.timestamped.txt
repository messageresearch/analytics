[49:46] home and we're ready to Face
[49:50] Tomorrow one day at a time lord
[49:54] Jesus is all we're
[49:57] asking we U going to continue on this
[50:00] what we were speaking on on
[50:04] Sunday For Whom Shall I
[50:06] fight and what shall be the weapons of
[50:09] my
[50:11] Warfare and seeing seeing the day that
[50:15] we're
[50:17] living and there's always been Wars
[50:19] raging Civil Wars of all
[50:24] kinds but when Israel goes to
[50:28] war then the T the then the clock is
[50:33] ticking it's it's it was called the
[50:35] Doomsday
[50:40] Clock and it was a the scientific
[50:46] community and the political
[50:49] community and they all came
[50:52] together and it's not a real clock
[50:57] that you hang on the
[50:58] wall and yet it's a very real
[51:02] clock because they got
[51:05] together to to watch what's happening in
[51:08] the
[51:09] world because they were they feared
[51:12] Another
[51:14] War they feared a they fear and they
[51:16] fear it yet
[51:18] today a third world
[51:20] war because of the technology that all
[51:23] the nations have
[51:27] one one
[51:29] man putting his finger on one
[51:33] button with with the bombs that are
[51:37] available to every major
[51:41] country and even Israel such a small
[51:45] country has the nuclear
[51:49] capability to bring the world to an
[51:52] end in 19 in the in the war of 19 19 was
[51:56] it 66 or
[51:59] 67 Six Day War of
[52:03] Israel when all the Arab nations came in
[52:07] to destroy
[52:10] Israel I believe the Prime Minister that
[52:13] time was a man called manin
[52:19] bean and and at the
[52:22] time it didn't look too good for Israel
[52:28] at all their borders the Syria and Iran
[52:31] and all these already were mounting
[52:33] hundreds and hundreds of thousands of
[52:35] soldiers and and
[52:42] equipment and and the Prime Minister
[52:44] minan Bean went on National
[52:51] Airways and he says I want to remind all
[52:54] our enemies and the world
[52:57] world that we have we have nuclear
[53:02] weapons and if it appears to us that
[53:05] you're going to take us
[53:08] down then I want the world to know
[53:12] everyone that if we go down say the
[53:15] world goes down with
[53:17] us so it it was quite a
[53:22] statement and of course uh Israel has
[53:25] been known to back up its
[53:31] statements their their generals and
[53:33] their Prime
[53:36] Ministers are
[53:38] anointed they're anointed to protect the
[53:43] land and they're anointed to protect
[53:49] 144,000 it's true not all Israel is
[53:53] Israel not every Jew is going to going
[53:55] to be slave
[53:57] saved just like not every Gentile in the
[54:00] world will be
[54:02] saved but there is a chosen
[54:05] people both Jewish and
[54:08] Gentile that God is holding back the
[54:10] wrath of
[54:12] his so you and I and a little group in
[54:17] Israel can prepare our
[54:19] hearts so the question is For Whom Shall
[54:23] I fight and what shall be the
[54:26] weapons of my Warfare want to begin by
[54:30] reading that quote once
[54:33] again the prophet spoke of in a
[54:38] message show us the father and it will
[54:40] satisfy
[54:43] us but he says looking around at the
[54:47] nature of
[54:51] people seeing that we're in the spirit
[54:53] of the last day
[54:57] he said now they had to get in the
[54:59] spirit of the anti- deluvian
[55:04] world that was the days of
[55:07] Noah they had to get in that spirit in
[55:10] that day before they could be
[55:14] destroyed they have to be in the spirit
[55:16] of
[55:18] War before they can have
[55:20] War we've got to get in into the spirit
[55:23] of peace before we can make
[55:27] peace he says he said God let us be in
[55:30] the spirit of Christ
[55:34] tonight so we can have
[55:36] Christ let us be in the spirit of
[55:40] repentance Spirit of Faith give it give
[55:43] it to us tonight our
[55:45] father of these great Treasures of
[55:49] Life they're so
[55:51] freely just by
[55:53] asking and realizing the greatest things
[55:56] of
[55:57] life and the only real lasting
[56:01] things are the
[56:04] Unseen turn with me to the to the Book
[56:08] of
[56:09] Matthew Matthew chapter
[56:13] 4 and verse
[56:18] 8 the the the devil was making Jesus an
[56:23] offer just like in the beginning he made
[56:27] Eve an
[56:29] offer but this time he didn't know who
[56:33] he was messing
[56:35] with he didn't realize who this
[56:39] was that this was the this this was the
[56:41] Fulfillment of the woman's
[56:44] seed this was God
[56:47] Emmanuel can in in Matthew 4 and:
[56:51] 8 Bible says again the devil taketh him
[56:54] up into an exceeding high
[56:58] mountain and showeth him all the
[57:00] kingdoms of the world and the glory of
[57:05] them
[57:08] Lucifer Satan has all the kingdoms of
[57:11] the world in his
[57:14] hands and he anoints him for natural
[57:18] War he anoints them for for
[57:22] killing he's he's been that he's done
[57:24] that since the beginning in
[57:27] Eden when there in a time when there was
[57:30] only a few people on the face of the
[57:34] Earth Adam
[57:37] Eve Cain and Abel he swept down and
[57:41] anointed one of them Cain to kill his
[57:46] brother the Bible says he is a murderer
[57:49] and a liar from the
[57:53] beginning
[57:55] verse
[57:56] n and saith unto him all these things
[58:00] will I give thee if thou will fall down
[58:02] and worship
[58:05] him and he's made the same
[58:08] offer to the elite and Rich of this
[58:12] world and we can see today that they
[58:14] have all accepted his
[58:17] offer and they Fallen at his at his
[58:20] Dragon
[58:23] feet
[58:25] and are worshiping
[58:27] Satan even even the churches
[58:31] today have fallen at the
[58:33] feet of Lucifer and they think they're
[58:36] worshiping Jesus
[58:39] Christ but they're not verse 10 then
[58:43] sayith Jesus unto him get thee H Satan
[58:47] for it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[58:50] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[58:53] serve
[58:59] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[59:02] once again this
[59:03] even for it was in the evening time when
[59:07] you would come down and visit with your
[59:10] children back in
[59:12] Eden before they
[59:15] fell Lord Jesus may you once
[59:18] again be in our midst this
[59:21] evening in Jesus name amen amen may be
[59:30] seated Lucifer Lucifer according to the
[59:34] scriptures he's in control of all the
[59:37] kingdoms of the
[59:39] world he's in control of all the
[59:43] governments he anoints them and moves
[59:46] them and they don't even know they're
[59:49] being anointed and moved of
[59:52] Satan in the days of Jesus
[59:55] Lucifer was in
[59:57] control of two major
[1:00:00] Powers
[1:00:02] one was was was was the the church that
[1:00:06] followed
[1:00:08] Moses one was the the the
[1:00:11] Jews Satan was in control of the Jewish
[1:00:15] Church Satan was in control of the
[1:00:18] Jewish high
[1:00:20] priest and Satan was in
[1:00:23] control of Roman of course and both of
[1:00:26] them were
[1:00:28] enemies and yet he influenced both of
[1:00:31] them to do violence and persecute the
[1:00:36] church and the Believers that were
[1:00:39] following Yeshua Jesus of
[1:00:42] Nazareth Messiah that those that had
[1:00:45] caught the
[1:00:47] Revelation that this man was the Lamb of
[1:00:49] God that this man was their king king of
[1:00:52] the
[1:00:53] Jews and who was persecuting these
[1:00:57] Believers the Jewish church and
[1:01:00] Rome enemies of each
[1:01:03] other but both anointed of
[1:01:07] Lucifer so if you
[1:01:10] fight even for your nation
[1:01:13] today who are we really fighting
[1:01:16] for it's the devil
[1:01:18] himself and he's a liar and a murderer
[1:01:21] from the
[1:01:22] beginning the spirit of War
[1:01:25] natural is anointing
[1:01:28] men and women in what is called even the
[1:01:32] message
[1:01:33] today they don't know who they're
[1:01:35] fighting
[1:01:38] for or what the weapons of their Warfare
[1:01:42] are that's why men will use their
[1:01:46] pulpits to publicly denounce each
[1:01:51] other in the message that the What's
[1:01:53] called the God's sacred
[1:01:58] desk has become bully pulpits for men
[1:02:00] and
[1:02:04] pastors they cause churches to go to war
[1:02:07] with each
[1:02:10] other
[1:02:12] they they're being
[1:02:15] Anointed with the same Spirit of this
[1:02:18] world for their own
[1:02:21] destruction oh we don't want to be
[1:02:23] partakers
[1:02:26] of this
[1:02:27] sin we we are in a in a battle
[1:02:30] ourselves it's a spiritual
[1:02:33] warfare but in this battle as a believer
[1:02:36] in
[1:02:37] Christ you know who your greatest enemy
[1:02:41] is this
[1:02:43] flesh this
[1:02:46] flesh in Matthew 6 and verse
[1:02:51] 9 it was it was it was a prayer that God
[1:02:54] gave
[1:02:57] us
[1:02:59] and this prayer that Jesus prayed was so
[1:03:04] contrary to what the people were going
[1:03:08] through in their
[1:03:10] time the Jewish people were in
[1:03:14] slavery the Jewish people by Rome were
[1:03:16] being
[1:03:19] persecuted the Jewish people lived in
[1:03:21] their land but it wasn't their land
[1:03:26] they didn't control
[1:03:27] it and and in Matthew 6 and verse
[1:03:31] 9 Jesus comes to them in this violent
[1:03:36] time and he's going to teach them he's
[1:03:39] going to change the way they they
[1:03:42] pray because that's what he came for to
[1:03:46] bring change to
[1:03:48] Israel he he he came to change
[1:03:51] everything about how they were
[1:03:53] living
[1:03:55] he said Can in verse n he says after
[1:03:57] this manner therefore pray
[1:04:00] ye and the multitude is listening to
[1:04:03] him Our Father which art in heaven
[1:04:07] Hallowed be thy
[1:04:10] name and most everyone the multitude
[1:04:13] says okay I'll accept
[1:04:16] that and then he says thy kingdom come
[1:04:20] thy will be done on Earth as it is in
[1:04:23] heaven
[1:04:25] and the multitude listening saying it's
[1:04:27] getting
[1:04:29] better and then he says give us this day
[1:04:32] our daily
[1:04:35] bread and he got a 100% amen from the
[1:04:38] crowd
[1:04:39] now he got their
[1:04:42] attention they're listening and then he
[1:04:44] says then forgive us our depts as we
[1:04:47] forgive our
[1:04:52] deor then they stopped for a
[1:04:55] minute okay where is he going with
[1:04:59] that because and lead us not into
[1:05:02] temptation but Deliver Us from Evil for
[1:05:05] thine is the kingdom and power and Glory
[1:05:07] forever
[1:05:13] amen and the multitude thought okay he's
[1:05:15] on the right track so
[1:05:18] far then in verse 14 he
[1:05:20] says for if you for forgive men their
[1:05:23] trespass FES your heavenly father will
[1:05:26] also forgive
[1:05:31] you and they said Moses didn't said
[1:05:35] that find that in the Bible
[1:05:38] Jesus no
[1:05:40] no don't you remember it's an eye for an
[1:05:44] eye it's a tooth for a
[1:05:49] tooth for if ye forgive men their
[1:05:52] trespasses your heavenly father will
[1:05:54] also forgive
[1:05:59] you forgive us they
[1:06:01] said This is Our
[1:06:04] Land God gave it to Abraham and to his
[1:06:08] descendants that's us the Romans are the
[1:06:11] squatters the Romans are The
[1:06:14] Intruders and the multitude started
[1:06:17] dispersing and
[1:06:20] leaving verse 15 but if you forgive not
[1:06:23] many your trespasses neither will your
[1:06:26] father forgive your
[1:06:31] trespasses and he was left
[1:06:34] alone and all had walked
[1:06:36] away because they were living in a
[1:06:39] time of violence where their children
[1:06:42] were being
[1:06:43] killed where their mothers were being
[1:06:46] killed where their grandfathers were
[1:06:48] being
[1:06:50] killed where they were being thrown in
[1:06:52] prison and persecuted
[1:06:56] and the multitude said nice prayer but
[1:07:00] your timing is all
[1:07:03] wrong don't you know Hamas just
[1:07:08] attacked he knew better than
[1:07:11] all that the timing was
[1:07:14] perfect Matthew 15 and verse
[1:07:19] 22 For Whom Shall I
[1:07:22] fight and what shall be the weapons of
[1:07:24] my
[1:07:26] Warfare and Wars are
[1:07:30] fought because an offense will not be
[1:07:35] forgiven and men and women
[1:07:38] divorce because of offense will not be
[1:07:42] forgiven and friends take their their
[1:07:45] their their two different
[1:07:47] ways because there's an offense that
[1:07:49] took
[1:07:50] place that one or both say I can't
[1:07:54] forgive this I won't forgive
[1:07:59] it Matthew
[1:08:01] 15 verse
[1:08:03] 22 and behold a woman of Canaan came out
[1:08:07] of the same coast and Cried unto him
[1:08:10] saying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son
[1:08:13] of David my daughter is grievously vexed
[1:08:16] with the
[1:08:22] Devil
[1:08:28] she she was a
[1:08:30] gentile she wasn't a Jew and the
[1:08:33] ministry that Jesus was
[1:08:36] fulfilling was King of the Jews even his
[1:08:40] Apostles he had commanded him go only to
[1:08:43] the house of
[1:08:45] Israel don't go to the
[1:08:48] Samaritan don't go to the Gentiles go
[1:08:51] only to the house of Israel because that
[1:08:54] was the
[1:08:55] season Jesus the lion of the tribe of
[1:08:59] Judah according to Matthew
[1:09:02] 5 he would open the book and loose the
[1:09:06] Seven
[1:09:07] Seals that just means he that a new
[1:09:09] testament was opening
[1:09:12] up with a plan of redemption with a Plan
[1:09:16] of
[1:09:17] Salvation with a plan to change you and
[1:09:20] I our hearts and
[1:09:22] Minds
[1:09:24] so here's this woman a
[1:09:27] gentile here's Jesus king of the Jews he
[1:09:31] was focused on his
[1:09:33] ministry and who he was sent to
[1:09:36] First and that was Israel the Elder
[1:09:40] son verse
[1:09:42] 23 but he answered her not a
[1:09:46] word he ignored
[1:09:49] her someone could already take offense
[1:09:51] with
[1:09:52] that
[1:09:55] and his disciples came and besought him
[1:09:57] saying send her away for she crith after
[1:10:05] us strike
[1:10:08] too someone could take more offense with
[1:10:13] that but he answered and said I am not
[1:10:16] sent but unto the LW sheep of the House
[1:10:18] of
[1:10:22] Israel then came she and worshiped
[1:10:26] him she had already been things had been
[1:10:30] told to her that were already quite
[1:10:35] offensive even the disciples offended
[1:10:38] her get rid of her
[1:10:41] Jesus we don't need
[1:10:45] her and then the next thing it
[1:10:48] says when these offenses started lining
[1:10:52] up the Bible says then came
[1:10:56] she and worshiped
[1:10:59] him pushed away her
[1:11:02] feelings because it was the
[1:11:06] word then came She and worsted Him
[1:11:08] saying Lord help
[1:11:11] me but he answered and said it's not
[1:11:15] meat to take the children's bread and
[1:11:18] cast it to the
[1:11:22] dogs that was reason to be
[1:11:27] offended that was reason to go to
[1:11:31] war to be called a
[1:11:33] dog verse 27 and she said truth
[1:11:39] [Music]
[1:11:40] Lord she was doing all the right
[1:11:44] things at every
[1:11:47] step at at every offensive
[1:11:51] point this woman was doing the right
[1:11:54] thing because she was doing it by
[1:11:59] faith verse
[1:12:00] 27 and she said truth
[1:12:04] Lord yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
[1:12:07] which fall from their master's
[1:12:11] table then Jesus answered and said unto
[1:12:14] her oh woman great is thy
[1:12:17] faith be it unto thee even as thou
[1:12:21] will and her daughter was made whole
[1:12:23] from that very
[1:12:25] hour her response to the
[1:12:29] trespass God was testing her it showed
[1:12:33] her level of
[1:12:35] faith it showed the real depth of her
[1:12:41] Revelation what was her
[1:12:44] Revelation she had a revelation of Jesus
[1:12:50] Christ she knew who he was
[1:12:54] how did she know it she just knew it
[1:12:57] down in her heart she just knew
[1:13:00] it and he said woman great is thy faith
[1:13:05] what a woman of prayer she must have
[1:13:09] been second Corinthians chapter
[1:13:14] 10 beginning at verse
[1:13:16] one the Apostle
[1:13:18] Paul speaking here he says now I Paul my
[1:13:23] self beseech you by the Weak by the
[1:13:26] meekness and gentleness of
[1:13:32] Christ Paul was a man that had been
[1:13:35] changed because Paul was a violent man
[1:13:39] Paul persecuted the
[1:13:40] church Paul put them in
[1:13:43] prison Paul put them to death and now
[1:13:46] here's that same Paul he says now I Paul
[1:13:50] myself beseech you by the meekness and
[1:13:52] gentle Ness of
[1:13:56] Christ who in presence and base among
[1:13:59] you but being absent and bold toward
[1:14:07] you but I beseech you that I may not be
[1:14:10] bold when I am present with that
[1:14:12] confidence wherewith I think to be bold
[1:14:14] against some which think of us as if we
[1:14:17] walked according to the
[1:14:22] flesh
[1:14:28] here it is listen to
[1:14:30] this verse three for though we walk in
[1:14:34] the
[1:14:35] flesh we do not war after the
[1:14:39] flesh the unbeliever the make believer
[1:14:43] He Walks In the Flesh he Wars In the
[1:14:45] Flesh he's anointed of a different
[1:14:49] Spirit verse
[1:14:51] four Paul says for the weapons of our
[1:14:55] Warfare are not carnal But Mighty
[1:14:59] through God to the pulling down of
[1:15:04] strongholds what kind of
[1:15:06] strongholds Paul's going to tell us in
[1:15:08] verse 5
[1:15:10] now this kind of
[1:15:12] strongholds casting down your
[1:15:16] imaginations and every High thing that
[1:15:19] exalted itself against the knowledge of
[1:15:22] God
[1:15:24] and and bringing into captivity every
[1:15:27] thought to The Obedience of
[1:15:31] Christ these are the
[1:15:34] strongholds that Paul is telling us that
[1:15:37] we need to pull them
[1:15:40] down because the weapons of our
[1:15:43] Warfare are not
[1:15:45] carnal if we're truly fighting for
[1:15:49] Christ then the weapons of our
[1:15:52] Warfare are not
[1:15:57] carnal we need to bring down these
[1:15:59] strongholds
[1:16:02] Paul the strongholds of the spirit
[1:16:07] man and and and the spirit has five
[1:16:11] senses memory
[1:16:14] imagination conscience
[1:16:17] affections
[1:16:19] reasoning and the flesh body has five
[1:16:22] senses
[1:16:25] sight
[1:16:27] taste hearing
[1:16:30] smell
[1:16:32] touch and of all these
[1:16:34] senses of the spirit man and the flesh
[1:16:38] man none of them were given to
[1:16:40] you to contact God none of you none of
[1:16:44] them were given to
[1:16:46] you to have a a friendship restored with
[1:16:49] the
[1:16:50] father there's just one sin
[1:16:54] that's faith faith is what touches him
[1:16:57] faith is what moves
[1:16:59] him faith is what keeps us from from
[1:17:02] from being
[1:17:05] offended and letting it become a root of
[1:17:07] bitterness in our
[1:17:09] hearts will we get
[1:17:12] offended yes but faith will keep us from
[1:17:16] going down that
[1:17:20] road Ephesians 6 and verse 10
[1:17:25] Apostle
[1:17:26] Paul finally my brethren be strong in
[1:17:29] the Lord and the power of His
[1:17:35] might put on the whole armor of God that
[1:17:38] you may able to stand against the Wilds
[1:17:40] of the
[1:17:44] devil for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:17:47] and blood but against principalities
[1:17:50] against Powers against the rulers of the
[1:17:52] dark darkness of this world against
[1:17:55] spiritual wickedness in high
[1:18:06] places wherefore take on to you the
[1:18:09] whole armor of God that you might be
[1:18:11] able to withstand in the evil day and
[1:18:14] having done all to
[1:18:21] stand
[1:18:23] what a tremendous message Paul was
[1:18:26] preaching and yet Paul when he wrote
[1:18:30] this
[1:18:31] epist he was in
[1:18:33] prison when he wrote
[1:18:36] Ephesians
[1:18:38] colians Philippians
[1:18:41] fiman he was in
[1:18:44] prison he was in
[1:18:47] Chains he was in
[1:18:51] bondage
[1:18:53] and look it to the things he's
[1:18:55] writing he's saying stand therefore
[1:18:58] having your LS G about with truth and
[1:19:00] having on the breastplate of
[1:19:07] righteousness and he's in prison and
[1:19:10] your feet shot with the preparation of
[1:19:12] the gospel of
[1:19:15] peace and he's in prison above all
[1:19:18] taking the shield of Faith wherewith ye
[1:19:21] shall abide to quench all the fiery
[1:19:23] darts of the
[1:19:28] wicked and he's in prison can take the
[1:19:32] helmet of salvation and the sword of the
[1:19:34] spirit which is the word of
[1:19:38] God and he's in
[1:19:40] prison praying always with all prayer
[1:19:43] and supplication the spirit can where on
[1:19:45] can watching there too with all
[1:19:48] perseverance and supplication for All
[1:19:51] Saints
[1:19:58] and he's in
[1:20:00] prison for whom shall we
[1:20:02] fight and what shall be the weapons
[1:20:06] of of my
[1:20:09] Warfare verse
[1:20:12] 19 and for me that utterance may be
[1:20:15] given unto me that I may open my mouth
[1:20:18] boldly to make known The Mystery of the
[1:20:21] Gospel
[1:20:29] and he's in
[1:20:30] prison
[1:20:32] alone now maybe there was a rat or two
[1:20:34] roaming
[1:20:36] around but the man's in
[1:20:39] prison and look at the things look at
[1:20:42] the faith look at the Revelation that
[1:20:45] was holding him
[1:20:48] up he was in a different
[1:20:51] Spirit now not the not the spirit of
[1:20:54] War not the spirit of
[1:20:57] hatred that was amongst the Jews and the
[1:21:02] Romans he was he was living in a
[1:21:04] different
[1:21:06] world his mind and heart had been
[1:21:11] transformed looking around at the nature
[1:21:14] of the
[1:21:16] people seeing that we're in the spirit
[1:21:18] of this last
[1:21:20] day they had to get in the Spirit of the
[1:21:23] anti- delvian
[1:21:27] world before they could be
[1:21:30] destroyed they have to be in the spirit
[1:21:32] of War before you can have
[1:21:37] War but in this time of war and a spirit
[1:21:41] of War all around
[1:21:45] us let us be in the spirit of Christ
[1:21:50] tonight so we can have Christ

[1:22:01] father of these great Treasures of
[1:22:05] life so freely just by
[1:22:08] asking and realizing that the greatest
[1:22:10] things of
[1:22:12] life and the only real lasting
[1:22:17] things are the
[1:22:19] Unseen and may thy Spirit come tonight
[1:22:23] and feel every heart reclaim every
[1:22:27] backslider save every
[1:22:30] sinner and may those who are seeking the
[1:22:33] baptism of the Holy
[1:22:36] Spirit may come tonight and fill every
[1:22:39] heart May the sick be
[1:22:42] healed God receive
[1:22:44] glory for we ask in the name of his
[1:22:46] beloved Son Jesus our
[1:22:50] lord and it was a time of War
[1:22:53] as it is
[1:22:54] tonight the world is at
[1:22:57] War they're demanding you take
[1:23:01] sides we
[1:23:03] have we've taken sides with
[1:23:06] Jesus the man Christ
[1:23:09] Jesus who taught us how to
[1:23:12] pray led us by
[1:23:14] example in Luke chapter
[1:23:18] 23 and verse
[1:23:20] 33 Bible reader
[1:23:24] you remember this
[1:23:27] passage Jesus on the
[1:23:29] cross and verse
[1:23:32] 33 and when they were come to the place
[1:23:34] which is called
[1:23:38] Calvary There They Crucified
[1:23:40] him and the malf factors one on the
[1:23:43] right hand and the other on the
[1:23:47] left then said
[1:23:51] Jesus father for forgive them for they
[1:23:54] know not what they
[1:23:55] do and they parted his reignment and
[1:23:58] cast
[1:24:00] lot and the people stood
[1:24:04] beholding as the rulers also with him
[1:24:07] derided
[1:24:09] him saying he saved
[1:24:12] others let him save himself if he be
[1:24:16] Christ The Chosen of
[1:24:18] God but because he was Christ The Chosen
[1:24:21] of God
[1:24:23] because he was the Lamb of
[1:24:25] God he wouldn't come off that cross
[1:24:28] because he did it for you and he did it
[1:24:31] for me and he wouldn't be
[1:24:34] offended and to say I'll show you who I
[1:24:38] am I'll get off this cross I'll show you
[1:24:42] my power no he did show his
[1:24:45] power he wouldn't be
[1:24:48] offended he was going to stay there for
[1:24:51] die for you and I
[1:24:55] and the people stood beholding and the
[1:24:57] rulers also with him derided him saying
[1:24:59] he saved others let him save himself if
[1:25:02] he be Christ The
[1:25:10] Chosen you see he never did change his
[1:25:12] mind about that
[1:25:16] prayer or or how to
[1:25:19] pray God will never ask you to do
[1:25:21] something
[1:25:24] that he hasn't already done
[1:25:26] himself more than
[1:25:29] once Mark
[1:25:35] 11:23 verse 23 reads like
[1:25:39] this for verily I say unto you that
[1:25:41] whosoever shall say unto this mountain
[1:25:44] be thou removed and be thou cast in the
[1:25:46] sea and shall not doubt in his heart but
[1:25:49] shall believe that those things which he
[1:25:51] saith shall come to to pass he shall
[1:25:53] have whatsoever he
[1:26:03] saith this is an end time
[1:26:06] promise and a
[1:26:08] prophecy to to be
[1:26:11] fulfilled in our
[1:26:13] Day verse 24 therefore I say unto you
[1:26:17] what things soever you desire When you
[1:26:19] pray believe that you receive them and
[1:26:22] you shall have
[1:26:26] them and when you stand praying
[1:26:31] forgive if you had ought against
[1:26:34] any that your father also which is in
[1:26:39] heaven May forgive your
[1:26:41] trespasses but if you do not
[1:26:44] forgive neither will your father which
[1:26:47] is in heaven forgive your
[1:26:51] trespasses this change for
[1:26:54] Israel was more than they could
[1:26:58] take they couldn't they wouldn't accept
[1:27:02] it they wouldn't accept God opening the
[1:27:05] book of
[1:27:08] Salvation they wouldn't accept these
[1:27:10] Seven Seals being
[1:27:13] loosed which is seven parts of a divine
[1:27:18] plan to change you and I and one of the
[1:27:22] first things revealed under these seven
[1:27:25] Parts was Jesus coming to
[1:27:29] Nicodemus Nicodemus in this time of
[1:27:33] violence and War and

[1:28:10] all
[1:28:11] prayer and
[1:28:13] supplication in the
[1:28:17] spirit you might
[1:28:20] ask does God have a a going away
[1:28:26] plan he does
[1:28:28] indeed in the first
[1:28:31] seal brother R says here's the plan of
[1:28:36] it the first thing
[1:28:39] happens there's an announcement in the
[1:28:41] heavens
[1:28:43] first you
[1:28:46] know like a
[1:28:49] star that was seen across the
[1:28:54] heavens but only three men saw
[1:28:56] it three wise
[1:28:59] men it was a sign in the
[1:29:02] heavens here's the plan of it the first
[1:29:05] thing
[1:29:07] happens there's an announcement in the
[1:29:09] heavens
[1:29:10] first what happened a seal is
[1:29:16] open and who knew it nobody who
[1:29:20] understood it nobody
[1:29:24] God hid
[1:29:26] it from the eyes of the wise
[1:29:29] and but he's making us sensitive to his
[1:29:33] presence so we can see what he did at
[1:29:36] the first
[1:29:37] coming and see the pattern of how he'll
[1:29:40] do it at his
[1:29:42] second so we can recognize our day in
[1:29:44] its
[1:29:46] message and realize his his he is so
[1:29:50] close taking a bride
[1:29:53] away to a resurrection of the Dead
[1:29:57] Saints say where the dead in Christ
[1:29:59] shall
[1:30:00] rise and we which are alive and
[1:30:03] remain will be caught up to meet him in
[1:30:05] the
[1:30:07] air that means there'll be a people in
[1:30:09] this
[1:30:10] day I hope it's every one of us that we
[1:30:14] won't be we won't be we won't see
[1:30:17] death we will be changed
[1:30:20] supernaturally from a ter cesal body to
[1:30:23] a Celestial
[1:30:25] body from a creature of time to a
[1:30:28] creature of
[1:30:30] Eternity that's our
[1:30:32] promise if we don't get out caught up in
[1:30:35] the spirit of War of this
[1:30:39] world here's the plan of it the first
[1:30:42] thing happens there's an announcement in
[1:30:45] the heaven first what happened a seal is
[1:30:49] opened what is that a mystery
[1:30:52] unfolded and when a mystery
[1:30:55] unfolds then a trumpet
[1:30:57] sounds it declares a
[1:31:00] war or a plague
[1:31:02] Falls a church age
[1:31:05] opened see what's the see what is the
[1:31:07] war
[1:31:09] part the angel of the church cast
[1:31:12] catches the mystery of
[1:31:14] God not fully yet
[1:31:18] revealed but when he does he catches
[1:31:21] this of God then he goes forth to the
[1:31:26] people after the mystery has been given
[1:31:28] to him Goes Forth to the people what
[1:31:32] does he do there he begins to Proclaim
[1:31:35] that
[1:31:36] message and what does it start a
[1:31:39] war a spiritual
[1:31:42] war in the days of in the days of
[1:31:46] Jesus before he was
[1:31:50] born there was a sign in the
[1:31:53] heavens one that had been
[1:31:57] prophesied a star would
[1:32:00] appear and it would lead three wise
[1:32:05] men to the birth of
[1:32:08] Christ the star was
[1:32:11] declaring he's on Earth he's here now a
[1:32:16] star represents a
[1:32:18] messenger a star represents a prophetic
[1:32:20] Ministry
[1:32:23] then come John the
[1:32:26] Baptist again a Ministry that was
[1:32:30] prophesied but nowhere in the prophecy
[1:32:33] did it give John's
[1:32:35] name Isaiah 40 was the ministry of John
[1:32:39] we know it now but it never
[1:32:43] said that that that that
[1:32:46] Messenger to Israel that that his name
[1:32:48] would be John the
[1:32:50] Baptist
[1:32:53] Malachi 3 spoke of
[1:32:55] him neither did it mention that his name
[1:32:57] would be called
[1:33:00] John neither did it say when he would
[1:33:03] come Malachi 4 verse
[1:33:06] 6 spoke of John's Ministry
[1:33:10] also that he would be the Elijah
[1:33:12] Ministry to
[1:33:14] Israel at the first coming of
[1:33:17] Christ and and this Prophet would come
[1:33:20] first to make a way for
[1:33:23] messiah to make a way for Jesus he would
[1:33:27] introduce Israel he would tell them what
[1:33:30] the ministry of Jesus was going to be
[1:33:34] about it was going to be about change
[1:33:37] change change change everything you do
[1:33:41] would be would God would change
[1:33:46] it if you used to cheat on your
[1:33:50] taxes you used to cheat on your
[1:33:56] taxes you ain't doing it no more because
[1:33:59] Jesus come to change
[1:34:01] that if you used to steal from your
[1:34:06] employer you don't do that no more
[1:34:09] because Jesus said he'll
[1:34:11] change if if you if you used to sit down
[1:34:14] and hear rock and roll music all night
[1:34:16] and all day
[1:34:19] long you won't do it no more because
[1:34:22] Jesus is changing
[1:34:23] you changing your
[1:34:26] appetite pulling your mind and heart out
[1:34:28] of spiritual
[1:34:32] Amnesia now you realize who you
[1:34:35] are I'm a son and daughter of
[1:34:39] God and he's Lifting me
[1:34:50] up
[1:35:00] he says and then God takes his messenger
[1:35:02] with the elect of that
[1:35:06] age and lays them away to
[1:35:08] sleep then he drop drops a plague upon
[1:35:11] them who rejected
[1:35:14] it temporary
[1:35:17] judgment then and then after that is
[1:35:19] over then he goes on and they denominate
[1:35:25] and bring in
[1:35:27] denominations and start off with the
[1:35:29] man's work like of
[1:35:32] Wesley and all of the rest of them and
[1:35:35] then it gets all in a scrapple again
[1:35:40] confusion and then another mystery comes
[1:35:44] forth then what happens another
[1:35:47] messenger arrives on the earth for a
[1:35:49] church
[1:35:50] age
[1:35:52] that's what the seven churches are
[1:35:54] about in The Book of
[1:35:56] Revelations starting with the Ephesian
[1:35:58] Church
[1:36:00] age there's seven of
[1:36:03] them from
[1:36:05] Ephesus to pergamus to thra to Sardis to
[1:36:11] to to Philadelphia
[1:36:13] to Revelations chapter 2 and 3 speaks of
[1:36:17] seven
[1:36:20] churches there there are seven churches
[1:36:22] that actually existed in the days of the
[1:36:26] Apostles and the days of Jesus but here
[1:36:30] they're being used as a
[1:36:33] symbol to
[1:36:35] represent a gentile
[1:36:38] Generation The Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:36:41] from the days of Jesus his first coming
[1:36:45] to his last to his second
[1:36:48] coming seven Church ages
[1:36:51] and a cycle would repeat throughout
[1:36:53] these
[1:36:55] ages because God has a
[1:36:58] bride
[1:36:59] and and God's waiting for the last one
[1:37:02] to be born on the face of the
[1:37:06] Earth to take this little bride
[1:37:10] home that's what he's been waiting
[1:37:12] on that's why time has
[1:37:17] carried you say why has God waited so
[1:37:20] long
[1:37:22] because he's waiting for the last son
[1:37:24] and daughter to be born on the face of
[1:37:26] the
[1:37:28] Earth so he can give them a born again
[1:37:32] experience so he can give them rapturing
[1:37:35] Faith so he can give them victory over
[1:37:39] the lust of the flesh over the lust of
[1:37:41] the eyes over the pride of life over
[1:37:44] this old carnal
[1:37:46] nature so you pray
[1:37:49] Lord find that last a child of God soon
[1:37:52] so we can go
[1:37:58] home he says then God takes his
[1:38:00] messenger with the
[1:38:02] elect of the age and lays them away
[1:38:07] asleep he say oh it's a great plan until
[1:38:11] it comes to the last
[1:38:13] Angel because for every Church age there
[1:38:16] was seven angels which means seven
[1:38:20] Messengers seven prophetic
[1:38:23] Ministries that in every age for the
[1:38:26] last 2,000 years or more God always
[1:38:29] raised up a
[1:38:31] prophet to point the people back to the
[1:38:33] word of
[1:38:34] God because every time theyd stray away
[1:38:37] like
[1:38:39] Isel and God had to God had a voice to
[1:38:43] call his children
[1:38:44] back pull you out of the world pull you
[1:38:48] out of
[1:38:49] denomination pulled you out of
[1:38:51] slavery pull you out of every kind of
[1:38:55] bondage he said oh it's a great
[1:38:58] plan until it comes to the last
[1:39:01] angel now he has no certain
[1:39:03] mystery but he gathers up all that's
[1:39:06] been lost in those other
[1:39:08] ages all the truth that wasn't truly
[1:39:11] revealed
[1:39:13] yet as the Revelation
[1:39:15] comes then he reveals those things in
[1:39:18] this
[1:39:19] day he says if you want to read it there
[1:39:22] it is in Revelations
[1:39:25] 101 he said you'll get it all
[1:39:27] right God rich and
[1:39:34] mercy in the message I will restore
[1:39:36] sayith the
[1:39:39] Lord oh how theology has scrupled up the
[1:39:43] plan of
[1:39:46] God it's a
[1:39:48] disgrace we're living in the days of
[1:39:50] evil
[1:39:54] and evil usually
[1:39:56] comes from the
[1:40:03] pulpits that's where it's the most
[1:40:07] deceptive and evil usually comes from
[1:40:10] the
[1:40:12] pulpit if the pulpit would have stayed
[1:40:15] clean and
[1:40:19] straight we wouldn't have all all this
[1:40:21] stuff spread over the world
[1:40:24] today and people acting and living the
[1:40:27] way they're doing in
[1:40:31] unbelief some great teacher on the west
[1:40:35] coast met me the other
[1:40:37] day and he was going on about a certain
[1:40:41] man over there that's got a big
[1:40:46] church he said Reverend
[1:40:48] Branham do you think that man's a
[1:40:53] Christian I said I have no other reason
[1:40:55] than to believe he's a
[1:40:59] Christian he said all that Divine
[1:41:02] Healing and stuff you all are talking
[1:41:06] about he said you know a long time
[1:41:09] ago he said we have a great fine
[1:41:14] church I won't call its name because I
[1:41:17] don't believe in talking about
[1:41:19] anybody
[1:41:21] but he said we have the greatest
[1:41:23] churches on the west
[1:41:26] coast and Along Came the call The Cult
[1:41:29] of Christian
[1:41:35] Science and you know what they stripped
[1:41:37] our
[1:41:39] churches I said if you a great
[1:41:44] church would have stayed with the
[1:41:46] principles of Jesus
[1:41:48] Christ and taught Divine Healing like
[1:41:51] the Bible
[1:41:53] did they would have had they would have
[1:41:56] had to have no cult to come to the
[1:42:01] coast and these people is Hing about
[1:42:04] tearing up churches and things like
[1:42:08] that brother hungry children will eat
[1:42:11] out of a garbage
[1:42:15] can feed them with the word of God and
[1:42:19] they'll stay where they where they ought
[1:42:21] to
[1:42:22] be that's the truth
[1:42:26] certainly hungry people every man is
[1:42:29] trying to look behind the
[1:42:34] curtain to see where he come
[1:42:36] from and where he's going if you won't
[1:42:40] teach it in your
[1:42:41] church and give them the Salvation that
[1:42:44] he needs to his
[1:42:46] soul he's a Son of God in his Fallen
[1:42:50] estate
[1:42:52] yet he's a Son of God and he wants to
[1:42:54] see out long long
[1:42:58] Yonder God help us
[1:43:02] ministers to get to the place when we
[1:43:06] where we can introduce
[1:43:08] him Jesus Christ the true Living God and
[1:43:13] the thing that their soul hungers
[1:43:17] for after they have
[1:43:19] confessed
[1:43:21] and become
[1:43:23] Christians and
[1:43:25] closing I'd like to read one more quote
[1:43:36] here it's in the message only
[1:43:49] believe he says in in time and in time
[1:43:53] the old Wheels grind
[1:43:59] slow but it grinds
[1:44:04] sure very last
[1:44:09] paragra it's got to be just the way God
[1:44:12] said it was going to
[1:44:16] be no matter how unreal it
[1:44:19] seems but it's going to be that way as
[1:44:23] we talked last
[1:44:24] night one time they didn't have
[1:44:28] electricity but some man believed there
[1:44:30] was such a
[1:44:32] thing and he kept working tireless
[1:44:36] hours until he discovered what it
[1:44:40] was and the same thing by television and
[1:44:43] the
[1:44:44] automobile God put all these things here
[1:44:47] for our
[1:44:49] benefit and he says now if we who are
[1:44:55] acquainted with a
[1:44:57] supernatural would just take a
[1:45:00] man where where the man in his
[1:45:03] senses is limited to a
[1:45:06] senses but a man and his spirit is
[1:45:10] unlimited see the the tree of knowledge
[1:45:13] can only climb so
[1:45:17] far and it breaks back but the Tree of
[1:45:20] Life life goes
[1:45:21] on
[1:45:23] forever and look how science how that
[1:45:27] science look at how that science has
[1:45:30] taken men
[1:45:34] farther with his five
[1:45:37] senses than we have with his
[1:45:40] soul that's where we're at
[1:45:43] tonight with the world of
[1:45:46] computers with the world of
[1:45:48] technology it appears
[1:45:52] like
[1:45:53] science has taken man
[1:45:57] further with his five
[1:46:00] senses than we have with his
[1:46:02] soul he says well he says we've got
[1:46:05] untapped
[1:46:07] resources where all things are
[1:46:11] possible if we can
[1:46:18] believe God is one take you
[1:46:23] further than what science has taken
[1:46:28] you and yet with what they have in
[1:46:32] computers sometimes we stand in
[1:46:39] awe you know that they can make a video
[1:46:43] with you in
[1:46:46] it show you doing all kinds of things
[1:46:52] and it never was
[1:46:55] you
[1:46:58] science they can make it they can make a
[1:47:01] whole scene where you where you where
[1:47:03] you murdered
[1:47:07] someone and with our eyes we see it and
[1:47:09] we say yes that was that's brother
[1:47:11] Daniel that's that's
[1:47:15] him and yet they can do that with
[1:47:19] technology and it was never
[1:47:24] me and there's no way to know that it
[1:47:26] wasn't
[1:47:27] you once they make
[1:47:32] that and yet God wants to take you an ie
[1:47:38] further than what science has taken
[1:47:43] us God wants to take us back to
[1:47:46] Eden God wants to take us back into his
[1:47:49] presence
[1:47:50] God wants us to break us back from time
[1:47:53] into
[1:47:55] eternity everything that man
[1:47:58] does brings death
[1:48:02] electricity it can kill you
[1:48:05] automobiles it can kill you I've lost
[1:48:09] many a
[1:48:12] relative in an automobile
[1:48:15] accident every everything that man has
[1:48:18] stood in awe and said wow
[1:48:21] that's
[1:48:23] incredible you think of how far science
[1:48:26] has Pro progressed
[1:48:30] medically we're in awe of what they can
[1:48:35] do by hip was
[1:48:37] completely
[1:48:42] deteriorated they reconstructed the
[1:48:44] pelvis
[1:48:46] bone they they put me another bone made
[1:48:49] out of titanium
[1:48:53] steel they popped it all
[1:48:55] together and here I am and we go wow wow
[1:49:01] and the doctor
[1:49:02] says if you treat it
[1:49:04] right you're good for 20
[1:49:07] years I said hey Doc but the first one
[1:49:12] lasted me 66
[1:49:14] years he says no not this this is
[1:49:16] man-made that was God
[1:49:19] made God
[1:49:22] does and yet this is a fallen
[1:49:25] body but if this terrestrial body he if
[1:49:29] it falls away God says I've got another
[1:49:33] one waiting for you a Celestial
[1:49:37] one and that one's built to live in a
[1:49:40] better
[1:49:42] world among the family of God where
[1:49:46] there's no sickness no pain no trouble
[1:49:50] oh God has a promise for
[1:49:59] us so
[1:50:01] knowing the promises that God has for
[1:50:05] us of eternal
[1:50:08] life for whom shall we
[1:50:12] fight and what shall be the weapons of
[1:50:15] our
[1:50:19] war we don't fight against flesh and
[1:50:22] blood Paul
[1:50:24] said our battle is
[1:50:29] different our battle is not of this
[1:50:34] flesh it's a
[1:50:36] spirit he says and in this spiritual
[1:50:42] battle

[1:50:46] enemy when you can overcome self
[1:50:51] and surrender all to

[1:52:04] physical he yet he was
[1:52:07] free though he was a prisoner of
