[52:45] Albuquerque and also our brother
[52:49] Roberto to have a few
[52:52] services like between the middle or
[52:54] towards the end of January
[52:56] a Friday
[52:59] Saturday and and finishing a
[53:04] Sunday with the Holy
[53:08] supper participating of the Holy
[53:11] supper and the washing of the
[53:16] feet the the last promises that Jesus
[53:19] left the last rituals the last rituals
[53:21] that Jesus left for us to do
[53:28] and he placed in the word to be blessed
[53:29] in His holy
[53:31] name and to participate of this
[53:34] communion and the washing of the
[53:37] feet just those
[53:42] things and to keep them as something
[53:44] that's
[53:46] sacred something that is very
[53:48] sacred like just like the
[53:51] communion like the
[53:53] baptism like the cleansing of theet
[53:56] because the
[53:58] significance it is great for our
[54:01] lives the symbolism what it speaks to us
[54:05] it is
[54:09] great and most of the time a week or two
[54:14] before we preach over that
[54:17] subject to prepare our
[54:20] prayers to be
[54:22] participants of the word of God
[54:26] this is what the Lord Jesus left
[54:28] us this
[54:32] Friday the ones that can and would like
[54:34] to come we have a Bible
[54:36] study at
[54:39] 7 and the ones that could come may God
[54:41] bless
[54:42] you may you stand on your
[54:45] feet to read the word of
[54:49] God we were speaking over that subject
[54:56] before the brother Roberto came and we
[54:58] made the
[54:59] services and we would like to continue
[55:02] on
[55:05] that once again I'm going to begin in
[55:07] the
[55:10] beginning just like how some some time
[55:16] passed to bring it once again to our
[55:19] memory and the title
[55:24] Perfection through the a restored
[55:26] friendship with the father and the
[55:31] subject the process of
[55:33] adoption and
[55:35] Perfection the the
[55:39] crownstone Psalms
[55:42] 51 beginning with the first verse to
[55:45] verse
[55:45] 10 and it reads this
[55:48] wave this Psalm how you may
[55:54] know it was the time when Nathan came to
[55:58] David and Nathan came to David and told
[56:01] him he told him a
[56:03] parable a
[56:07] story of a rich
[56:11] man but even so he went to a poor
[56:15] man and he was going to throw a big
[56:21] feast and instead of getting his own
[56:23] sheep because he had lot
[56:29] instead of getting a goat or a lamb of
[56:31] his own
[56:32] flock he went he took a
[56:37] lamb of a man that only had
[56:40] one and he asked
[56:44] David what do you say oh King with all
[56:46] of your
[56:48] wisdom what is the man deserve that does
[56:51] such
[56:52] thing right
[56:54] away David Rose up
[56:58] and I believe he put his hand on his
[57:00] shoulder that man deserves
[57:06] death I'm sure that he he might have
[57:08] thought oh bring him to me I want to
[57:10] kill
[57:12] myself and Nathan with the prophetic
[57:14] eyes he said he said David you are that
[57:18] man and from there these
[57:22] words when he

[1:00:57] that could bring forth these attributes
[1:01:00] can be can be able to be
[1:01:02] made it's not
[1:01:06] possible it wasn't possible to live in
[1:01:08] that
[1:01:09] day but now in this
[1:01:11] night it is more than
[1:01:14] possible to receive
[1:01:16] it to live a life worthy of the Gospel
[1:01:20] let's pray Heavenly
[1:01:23] Father we give you thanks once again
[1:01:27] father bless your
[1:01:28] word just how you know how to do
[1:01:31] it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:01:34] amen amen you may be
[1:01:40] seated
[1:01:45] Perfection for a friendship restored to
[1:01:47] the
[1:01:50] father in Matthew
[1:01:54] 548 how we how we spoke in the in this
[1:01:57] past
[1:01:58] service Jesus says
[1:02:08] [Music]
[1:02:11] this and it says be ye therefore perfect
[1:02:14] even as your father which is in heaven
[1:02:16] is
[1:02:19] perfectus it was a conclusion a
[1:02:23] statement to what he was speaking
[1:02:26] here a
[1:02:30] conclusion it is the last word that a
[1:02:32] person
[1:02:34] says after speaking for a certain amount
[1:02:36] of time the Lord
[1:02:39] Jesus he had spoken for
[1:02:42] 47 and here he
[1:02:45] revealed he was speaking on
[1:02:49] Perfection it says be
[1:02:51] ye therefore perfect
[1:02:57] be for us 47
[1:03:00] verses in which through a
[1:03:04] parable I have hidden this mystery of
[1:03:06] how to come to the
[1:03:08] perfection in Hebrews chapter
[1:03:12] 6 Hebrews chapter 6 verse one
[1:03:27] therefore leaving the principles of the
[1:03:29] doctrine of Christ let us go on unto
[1:03:31] Perfection not laying again the
[1:03:32] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:03:35] and of the faith toward
[1:03:37] God the word perfect or
[1:03:41] perfect it means to complete
[1:03:44] something to finish
[1:03:46] something to bring something
[1:03:51] forth to add to what is missing
[1:03:56] in order to surren to give up or
[1:03:57] something
[1:03:59] complete it brings to an end a Finish
[1:04:02] Line goal a
[1:04:06] goal to bring a
[1:04:09] closing a
[1:04:11] fulfillment of of an
[1:04:14] event like the Prophecies of the
[1:04:17] scriptures like when
[1:04:20] Jesus naare reading there in the
[1:04:22] synagogues in Nazareth
[1:04:26] of the prophet
[1:04:28] Isaiah and when he
[1:04:33] finished the priest had extended him the
[1:04:35] scroll of
[1:04:38] Isaiah he stood up and read a certain
[1:04:42] portion and he said this day this
[1:04:46] scripture filled before our eyes
[1:04:48] fulfilled before our
[1:04:50] eyes that was the perfection
[1:04:56] those were the the the pleasing
[1:04:58] words the precious
[1:05:00] words to be able to say to read the
[1:05:06] scripture and say today in this day it
[1:05:08] is
[1:05:11] fulfilled beautiful those are precious
[1:05:14] words that help us
[1:05:18] identify message and messenger in our
[1:05:23] day James says chapter 1 vers
[1:05:34] four but let patience have her perfect
[1:05:37] work and ye may be perfect and entire
[1:05:40] wanting
[1:05:42] nothing so the Perfection is a
[1:05:47] process and the Lord Jesus was the first
[1:05:49] one to bring us forth a
[1:05:51] teaching of all the
[1:05:54] components that bring us to
[1:05:56] Perfection the process is
[1:05:59] called the adoption of the children Sons
[1:06:02] and Daughters of
[1:06:04] God in that process to to come to the
[1:06:09] adoption it is called the three steps of
[1:06:12] Grace and these bring
[1:06:14] us toward the
[1:06:23] Perfection the AP
[1:06:28] chapter 4 beginning in verse
[1:06:35] 5 to redeem to redeem them that were
[1:06:38] under the law that we might receive the
[1:06:40] adoptions of
[1:06:48] sons and because you are Sons God hath
[1:06:51] sent forth the spirit of the son into
[1:06:53] your hearts crying ABA father
[1:06:59] wherefore thou are not more servant but
[1:07:01] a
[1:07:04] son and if a son there an he of God
[1:07:07] through
[1:07:08] Christ the man that is born
[1:07:11] again the woman that is Born
[1:07:15] Again baptized with the Holy
[1:07:19] Spirit Paul says you receive the spirit
[1:07:21] of your
[1:07:22] son the Holy Spirit
[1:07:26] the holy spirit that is
[1:07:27] inside crying out to the
[1:07:29] father father
[1:07:33] always
[1:07:35] and of the crying out
[1:07:38] of crying out to the
[1:07:40] father and when the father hears
[1:07:44] that he identifies you look that is my
[1:07:49] son Ephesians
[1:07:53] 4 beginning with the verse
[1:07:56] 4 Ephesians
[1:07:59] 44
[1:08:02] uh sorry it's Ephesians
[1:08:12] 1:4 according as he hath chosen us and
[1:08:15] be formed the foundation of the world
[1:08:17] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:08:19] before him and love
[1:08:29] having predestinated us unto the
[1:08:31] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[1:08:32] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:08:35] of his
[1:08:36] will how how Paul spoke
[1:08:39] here he chose us in
[1:08:43] him before the foundations of the
[1:08:48] world where the land Lamb of God was
[1:08:51] slain it was a great plan of God
[1:08:55] before there was anything here over the
[1:08:57] face of of the
[1:08:58] Earth the in the mind of God was a
[1:09:02] plan the the book of the Lamb's Book of
[1:09:06] Life your name and my name were already
[1:09:09] written he had already chosen
[1:09:11] us before the foundations of the world
[1:09:14] for a
[1:09:18] purpose or without blemish before
[1:09:21] him but of ministri
[1:09:26] that want want to maintain always
[1:09:29] feeling that you are dirty that you're
[1:09:31] filthy that you are
[1:09:33] weak that you need
[1:09:37] them they never lift you up any higher
[1:09:39] in the promis
[1:09:41] of but Paul brought
[1:09:43] forth to the
[1:09:45] heights some great
[1:09:49] Heights so we were holy and without
[1:09:52] blemish before the Lord father Romans
[1:09:57] 8 chapter
[1:10:10] 15 for ye have not received the spirit
[1:10:12] of bondage against fear but ye have
[1:10:15] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:10:17] we cry ABA
[1:10:19] father we are no longer slaves
[1:10:22] God has given us the freedom
[1:10:27] it is it is said in the old
[1:10:29] times here in the United
[1:10:32] States Abraham Lincoln when the
[1:10:36] President Abraham
[1:10:38] Lincoln he made a
[1:10:41] proclamation in such day in such day
[1:10:45] such hour the sun
[1:10:50] RIS all of the people of the of the
[1:10:52] black
[1:10:53] people they were no longer
[1:10:56] slaves and they were going to be
[1:10:59] free on the sunrise of the
[1:11:03] sun on a certain
[1:11:06] day all God prepared it
[1:11:10] says a great
[1:11:13] Farm of
[1:11:14] slaves of people of
[1:11:18] color some elderly people that can
[1:11:21] barely walk
[1:11:39] think
[1:12:02] may God bless you
[1:12:46] testing
[1:12:51] testing amen amen
[1:12:56] just a small
[1:12:59] disturbance Galatians
[1:13:03] 5 and beginning with the verse
[1:13:06] 19 and Paul says this
[1:13:16] way now the works of the flesh are
[1:13:18] manifest which are thou adultery
[1:13:23] fornication that was the falling in the
[1:13:28] beginning that was the act that that
[1:13:31] happened
[1:13:32] there that broke up the family of
[1:13:35] God the rest that I'm about to
[1:13:38] read that Paul placed in the Holy
[1:13:42] scri are the attributes of this
[1:13:46] act of the adultery and fornication
[1:13:55] exist in the lives of the men and women
[1:13:56] that practice these
[1:13:58] vices with that way of thinking we read
[1:14:01] it once
[1:14:06] again now the works of the flesh are
[1:14:08] manifest which are those adultery and
[1:14:11] fornication now the
[1:14:16] attributes of fornicating and adulter
[1:14:18] people IM uncleanliness lasia lishness
[1:14:24] idolatria
[1:14:25] idolatry
[1:14:27] witchcraft hatred Varian ulation wrath
[1:14:33] Strife
[1:14:35] sedition heres en
[1:14:40] EnV murders
[1:14:42] drunkness
[1:14:45] re and such
[1:14:49] like as I have also told you in the time
[1:14:52] of that they have wish I do such things
[1:14:59] that they which do such shall things not
[1:15:01] inherit the kingdom of
[1:15:04] God adultery and
[1:15:06] fornication it was the act in the
[1:15:10] beginning that brought forth all of
[1:15:12] these
[1:15:13] attributes that are
[1:15:15] connected to the
[1:15:18] infidelity being physical being
[1:15:21] spiritual
[1:15:25] but Paul says in verse
[1:15:28] 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love
[1:15:33] joy peace longsuffering gentl goodness
[1:15:38] Faith meekness
[1:15:42] Temperance against such there is no
[1:15:45] law and they that are
[1:15:49] Christ have crucified the flesh with th
[1:15:52] affections and lusts
[1:15:55] if we live in the
[1:15:57] spirit let us also walk in the
[1:16:00] spirit let us not be desirous
[1:16:04] of provoking one
[1:16:08] another envying one
[1:16:11] another what was Paul speaking
[1:16:14] about what the Lord Jesus spoke
[1:16:18] about a restored friendship with the
[1:16:21] father entering in a
[1:16:23] journey
[1:16:28] adoption but before we come to this
[1:16:32] relationship as
[1:16:34] children being
[1:16:36] adopted there are three
[1:16:38] steps three steps of
[1:16:40] Grace justification through the
[1:16:44] faith that
[1:16:46] signifies that you have the
[1:16:48] individual truly and sincerely has
[1:16:53] believed that the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:55] Christ has died for
[1:16:59] me not the recognition that he died for
[1:17:01] the
[1:17:05] world oh I believe Jesus was a slain
[1:17:09] lamb his his blood was shed to the
[1:17:14] world but when it's
[1:17:17] justification a personal
[1:17:19] experience you become the owner of
[1:17:22] that and you believe God Jesus
[1:17:26] Jesus died for
[1:17:27] me as an individual for
[1:17:31] me you remember
[1:17:34] Matthew verse 17
[1:17:56] and it says and Jesus answered unto him
[1:17:59] and said blessed art thou Simon barah
[1:18:02] for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it
[1:18:04] unto thee but my Father which is in the
[1:18:17] heavens and I say also unto thee that
[1:18:19] thou art Peter and upon the rock I will
[1:18:21] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:18:23] shall not prevail against
[1:18:26] it here
[1:18:29] Peter he had received here a
[1:18:34] revelation but he still did not have the
[1:18:36] new
[1:18:39] birth he had not received the baptism of
[1:18:42] the Holy Spirit he entered in a stage
[1:18:46] justified by the
[1:18:48] faith he was able now to
[1:18:52] see that by the law he was never going
[1:18:55] to be
[1:18:58] perfected by the law he can never have
[1:19:00] the rest that God was willing to give
[1:19:02] him because every error that he
[1:19:06] committed if before he was not worthy
[1:19:10] now
[1:19:12] less but a revelation captured his heart
[1:19:15] that he was
[1:19:18] Jesus that Jesus was his Savior and
[1:19:22] here Peter was justified if by the
[1:19:27] faith Sanctified by the
[1:19:31] spirit that begins to free
[1:19:36] us of the negative
[1:19:38] behavior of this
[1:19:43] flesh and we begin to dress in a
[1:19:45] different way speaking
[1:19:48] differently our walk is
[1:19:51] different the great holy spirit of God
[1:19:55] can change you in such a
[1:19:57] way that now your friends your family
[1:20:01] they no longer know
[1:20:02] you they tell you you are no longer the
[1:20:06] same what
[1:20:07] has is because you're passing through
[1:20:09] the the steps of the
[1:20:11] Fai justified by the Fai Sanctified by
[1:20:14] the spirit the prophet of God
[1:20:18] said this is God working with
[1:20:23] you freeing
[1:20:25] us of our
[1:20:28] characteristics of the sexual
[1:20:31] birth of the the birth of the
[1:20:36] flesh now now we
[1:20:38] ha to be aggressive AR to be
[1:20:43] arrogant bigant
[1:20:46] in bigoted FR
[1:20:51] blunt critic critical Egoista
[1:20:56] cynical
[1:20:58] dishonest distant envious
[1:21:02] greedy
[1:21:04] guarded because we
[1:21:06] say you know you don't
[1:21:09] know how much wrong they have done to
[1:21:14] me we come to be very guarded to the
[1:21:23] max and getting away from the True
[1:21:26] Fellowship of the brothers and sisters
[1:21:27] that can help us hle
[1:21:29] hostile indifferent in
[1:21:33] intolerant
[1:21:35] irresponsible
[1:21:38] jealous jealous to the negative
[1:21:42] things
[1:21:45] pessimistic
[1:21:47] prideful
[1:21:50] resentful the root of bitterness
[1:21:52] grows rude
[1:21:57] simply we we say because I
[1:22:01] can too
[1:22:05] sad
[1:22:08] skeptical uh
[1:22:12] suspicious thoughtless
[1:22:16] suspicious a
[1:22:20] thoughtless when we should consider
[1:22:23] ourselves if we have have been born
[1:22:27] again through a new
[1:22:30] birth these attributes that are
[1:22:32] here need to
[1:22:38] Surge we push him down once
[1:22:40] again because we've
[1:22:42] had a new
[1:22:45] birth the one that hasn't had
[1:22:48] it he lets loose with those
[1:22:51] attributes he he can't resist the devil
[1:22:55] because he has not been born
[1:22:59] again and the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:23:01] with
[1:23:02] fire and these
[1:23:05] three bring us with a restored
[1:23:07] friendship with the
[1:23:09] father that is called
[1:23:11] adoption it makes forth the
[1:23:14] Perfection Paul told the
[1:23:17] Hebrews in Hebrews chapter
[1:23:20] 7 verse
[1:23:22] 18 listen
[1:23:31] for there is verely a dising of the
[1:23:33] Commandment going before for the
[1:23:35] weakness and unprofitableness
[1:23:39] thereof for there is verely
[1:23:43] dising in other words
[1:23:46] canel of the the Commandment
[1:23:51] before for the weakness and unpr
[1:23:54] profitableness
[1:23:58] for the law made nothing
[1:24:02] perfect Paul here reveals to
[1:24:05] us of the Commandment which he was
[1:24:07] speaking and not only one of the
[1:24:10] 10 because the Ten
[1:24:13] Commandments that God gave
[1:24:15] Israel it was a
[1:24:18] proverb that it was going to never
[1:24:22] bring it would count them as are
[1:24:26] guilty in every negative
[1:24:38] attribute for the law made nothing
[1:24:40] perfect but the bringing of inner hope
[1:24:42] better did by the which we draw nigh
[1:24:44] unto God correct
[1:24:47] correct Paul was
[1:24:49] speaking of the Ten
[1:24:51] Commandments and Jesus in the parable
[1:24:55] of adoption and
[1:24:56] Perfection which is Matthew 5 6
[1:25:01] and he also mentions and tells
[1:25:05] us how they were going to be
[1:25:09] canell
[1:25:13] invalidated here it
[1:25:15] is the amation of God admonition
[1:25:23] admonition opening the book that Adam
[1:25:29] lost and telling us things that were
[1:25:31] hidden before the foundations of the
[1:25:33] world you
[1:25:35] know the prophecy in Revelation 5 it
[1:25:38] tells
[1:25:40] us the first one to open the
[1:25:43] book and let loose the Seven
[1:25:46] Seals it was the Lord Jesus
[1:25:49] Christ no no William Bram someone says
[1:25:51] no no it was William Bram no no no
[1:25:55] no the first one to open the
[1:25:58] book The Book of the the Lamb's Book of
[1:26:03] Life the book that was sealed with the
[1:26:05] Seven
[1:26:06] Seals it was the lion of the tribe of
[1:26:10] Judah and he opened this book of
[1:26:13] redemption to
[1:26:16] Israel because Israel was a
[1:26:19] son it was the elderly son
[1:26:24] and to him it pertained all the
[1:26:26] inheritance of
[1:26:27] father and God does not his word he
[1:26:30] fulfills his
[1:26:35] word so he firstly offered Redemption to
[1:26:38] Israel he opened the
[1:26:41] book and he let loose the Seven
[1:26:46] Seals of chapter 4 of
[1:26:49] Matthew to
[1:26:51] 23 in the Gospels
[1:26:54] the Lord
[1:26:56] Jesus was opening the
[1:26:59] book to
[1:27:02] Israel of the new
[1:27:05] birth of the
[1:27:07] Perfection of The
[1:27:09] Eternity of the
[1:27:12] predestination all
[1:27:13] everything the Lord Jesus in
[1:27:18] Parable everything that was in the
[1:27:21] book The Apostles came forth
[1:27:26] they added more
[1:27:28] details through the Same
[1:27:37] Spirit a a language that is more
[1:27:42] elevated Peter spoke of the same things
[1:27:44] that Jesus
[1:27:46] spoke so that the fishes would be able
[1:27:48] to
[1:27:50] understand rough strong men of strong
[1:27:53] characters
[1:27:57] God had an apostle for all
[1:28:00] personality there's a more bland
[1:28:03] person there is
[1:28:08] John the one that would put his head on
[1:28:11] the on the chest of the Lord
[1:28:15] Jesus Matthew
[1:28:19] 13 remembering the ministry of the Lord
[1:28:22] Jesus he did not
[1:28:25] preach Jesus opened the
[1:28:27] book he let loose the Seven
[1:28:31] Seals he did everything in
[1:28:35] par that is how it was spoken by the the
[1:28:38] prophets in the old
[1:28:40] times he was going to speak in
[1:28:43] Parables and without
[1:28:46] Parables he did not
[1:28:49] speak but in
[1:28:52] Parables he was going to R his entire
[1:28:56] book and let
[1:28:58] loose what is a
[1:29:01] parable it is a prophetic
[1:29:04] word speaking in
[1:29:09] symbols are common things that you and I
[1:29:12] know but they were symbols and not
[1:29:16] L Matthew 13 verse4
[1:29:26] all these things spake Jesus unto the
[1:29:27] multitude in Parables and without a
[1:29:29] parable spake he not unto
[1:29:32] them but why
[1:29:44] Lord that it might be fulfilled which
[1:29:46] was spoken by the prophet saying I will
[1:29:48] open my mouth in Parables I will utter
[1:29:51] things which have been kept secret from
[1:29:53] the foundation of of the
[1:29:56] world it says I will bring things
[1:29:59] say I will bring forth
[1:30:03] things that only the ears of Adam have
[1:30:22] heard then Jesus sent the multitude away
[1:30:24] and went into the house and his
[1:30:26] disciples came unto him saying declare
[1:30:28] unto us the parable of the tears of the
[1:30:34] field between the great
[1:30:40] multitudes the one that the Lord Jesus
[1:30:42] Christ expressed the words through
[1:30:43] Parables thousands
[1:30:47] 8
[1:30:49] 20,000 they would just go
[1:30:54] and just a handful will just
[1:30:58] return still even not
[1:31:01] understanding but
[1:31:06] Lord we we didn't understand you
[1:31:09] either explain to
[1:31:12] us the parable of the tears of the
[1:31:16] field give us the
[1:31:18] revelation of your
[1:31:21] book he answered and said unto them
[1:31:26] he that Seth The Good
[1:31:28] Seed is the son of
[1:31:33] man in many ways the good seed is
[1:31:38] seed when we go to visit
[1:31:40] someone when someone comes to our
[1:31:43] homes they begin to speak you
[1:31:47] say that doesn't appears correctly to
[1:31:51] me that doesn't look right
[1:31:57] so we know it's not the son of man
[1:31:58] speaking to
[1:32:01] him he has to be in the
[1:32:04] word so that when somebody comes to have
[1:32:08] fellowship and have something of the
[1:32:10] Bible and it says you know that
[1:32:13] today this
[1:32:16] day in in in
[1:32:19] our in our time the scripture has been
[1:32:22] fulfilled the seed of
[1:32:30] God for the first time god father spoke
[1:32:33] to his son
[1:32:37] Adam lip to ear lip to
[1:32:40] ear now
[1:32:42] speak to the Fallen race of Adam you and
[1:32:46] I the same
[1:32:48] way that he spoke to
[1:32:51] Adam speaking to us today
[1:32:55] and this is what Adam heard in the day
[1:32:58] of
[1:32:59] Eden before his
[1:33:03] fall God spoke to him
[1:33:07] the because the word of God is an
[1:33:09] eternal
[1:33:12] word if you read it in the New
[1:33:15] Testament it's not that it's a new
[1:33:17] thought of
[1:33:19] God this word of God was in his mind
[1:33:22] before the foundation of the world
[1:33:25] he does not have a new
[1:33:26] thought so when Jesus
[1:33:30] said be their
[1:33:37] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:33:40] the heaven is
[1:33:41] perfect it was
[1:33:43] something that he told
[1:33:46] Adam before the
[1:33:50] creation and this is the admonition
[1:33:56] and the Divine
[1:33:57] teaching of which Adam and Eve
[1:34:04] fell these are not admonitions of only a
[1:34:07] new
[1:34:09] testament this was in the mind of God
[1:34:11] before the foundations of the
[1:34:14] world be therefore
[1:34:17] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:34:19] heaven is
[1:34:21] perfect that is a parable
[1:34:24] it is written it's a
[1:34:26] mystery the Revelation is
[1:34:31] required to what the Lord Jesus
[1:34:33] said and the Revelation is
[1:34:36] required when he said be
[1:34:43] ye it is because of the 47 verses before
[1:34:47] that for years we read the
[1:34:51] Bible like reading an newspaper and
[1:34:56] magazine and we come to the verse
[1:34:59] 48 be therefore
[1:35:02] perfect in our hearts we say it sounds
[1:35:07] good but we can't be
[1:35:09] perfect can you
[1:35:12] imagine that is the man of
[1:35:20] Flesh he read the 47 verses in the Bible
[1:35:24] just to read verse
[1:35:26] 48 and say it's not possible it's not
[1:35:30] possible and the Lord
[1:35:33] Jesus for 47 vers telling
[1:35:36] us it's
[1:35:40] possible and these are the small steps
[1:35:42] to come to
[1:35:46] it justification by faith brings peace
[1:35:51] peace with God
[1:35:56] it is the beginning of what we call the
[1:35:57] Born Again
[1:36:00] experience that is the beginning of a
[1:36:03] change sanctification by the spirit it
[1:36:07] brings forth
[1:36:09] strength to abstain from
[1:36:11] fornication
[1:36:13] immoralities a filthy life to be
[1:36:18] abusive have a toxic
[1:36:21] personality sanctification through the
[1:36:23] spirit
[1:36:24] brings forth more
[1:36:26] change how he spoke it changes
[1:36:30] us we're no longer
[1:36:33] aggressive with their wife with
[1:36:37] children with brothers in
[1:36:39] Christ with our mother and
[1:36:43] father we are no longer
[1:36:46] arrogant we're no we're no longerot
[1:36:54] we are no longer so blunt that we cause
[1:36:56] problems at our
[1:36:59] homes God is changing
[1:37:03] us through a new
[1:37:06] birth for the three steps of
[1:37:09] Grace by the baptism of the holy
[1:37:13] spirit because refilling after refilling
[1:37:16] of after of his
[1:37:18] Spirit Psalms 51:2
[1:37:25] it
[1:37:27] says
[1:37:35] David restore unto me the joy of thy
[1:37:38] salvation and uphold me with thy free
[1:37:47] spirit then will I teach the
[1:37:49] transgressors thy ways and sinners shall
[1:37:51] be converted unto thee
[1:37:55] the soul of this
[1:37:57] man was crying out for a new
[1:38:01] birth because he said if I can if I'm
[1:38:04] able to receive
[1:38:06] this then only
[1:38:09] then I will teach the trans
[1:38:12] transgressors the
[1:38:14] way I'm going to be able to tell them
[1:38:17] did you know me
[1:38:19] before now you can see I'm no longer the
[1:38:21] same
[1:38:24] come and receive what I have
[1:38:28] received and
[1:38:30] sinners shall be converted unto
[1:38:34] thee because I am also a
[1:38:37] person Lord Jesus that you have
[1:38:41] converted the baptism of the Holy
[1:38:44] Spirit it restores a friendship with the
[1:38:48] Father the refilling of the holy
[1:38:51] spirit that increases our our loving
[1:38:54] Faith taking us to
[1:38:57] Perfection the baptism of the Holy
[1:39:00] Spirit it is another
[1:39:02] change A Change Is to
[1:39:05] grow and growing towards
[1:39:09] Perfection
[1:39:13] Matthew 5 verse
[1:39:17] 6ap the chapters 5 six and seven it is
[1:39:21] Jesus
[1:39:23] teaching us on
[1:39:26] Perfection it is a process that takes us
[1:39:29] to the
[1:39:30] adoption through the Holy Spirit and the
[1:39:34] adoption it is a
[1:39:37] friendship restored with the
[1:39:40] father what are our three
[1:39:42] steps justification by
[1:39:46] faith sanctification by the
[1:39:52] spirit the baptis the baptism of the
[1:39:54] Holy Spirit through a restored
[1:39:56] friendship with the father but it does
[1:39:58] not end
[1:40:03] there because after you receive the Holy
[1:40:05] Spirit of of
[1:40:08] fire you will come out to this world and
[1:40:12] you will be tested every
[1:40:16] day the devil will attack
[1:40:22] you so if you you have received the
[1:40:24] baptism of the Holy
[1:40:28] Spirit what's
[1:40:30] next with each
[1:40:33] test each hard
[1:40:36] battle that you can see look
[1:40:39] back that the Lord has set you free it
[1:40:42] gave you strength to
[1:40:45] overcome like a true
[1:40:49] gentleman like a true daughter of God in
[1:40:51] truth
[1:40:54] and you thought oh I'm never going to
[1:40:55] get out of
[1:40:57] this this trial it will finish
[1:40:59] me and we all look back and we say glory
[1:41:04] to the Lord I have been set free you
[1:41:08] know what that
[1:41:09] was what gave you the freedom what gave
[1:41:12] you the
[1:41:12] strength what gave you the
[1:41:16] encouragement it was a refilling of the
[1:41:18] Holy
[1:41:20] Spirit the refilling are not given
[1:41:24] because we behave a good for an entire
[1:41:29] week no
[1:41:32] no the refilling of the Holy
[1:41:35] Spirit the Lord gives you
[1:41:38] them to overcome a new
[1:41:42] battle overcome a new
[1:41:45] tribulation to overcome a
[1:41:49] sickness to overcome to
[1:41:51] overcome a STP a
[1:41:56] cold Matthew 8 and verse
[1:42:00] one are now closing in this
[1:42:04] evening and it
[1:42:08] says when he was come down from the
[1:42:11] mountain great multitudes followed
[1:42:15] him and he was preaching to
[1:42:17] them the
[1:42:21] Redemption he was the Lamb of
[1:42:24] God but the lamb people people did not
[1:42:28] understand anything he spoke it in
[1:42:31] Parables but the season would
[1:42:33] come when God was going to bring them
[1:42:36] the
[1:42:43] Revelation through a ritual to be born
[1:42:47] again and receive the baptism of the
[1:42:49] Holy Spirit here in Matthew 8
[1:42:53] he brought forth his
[1:42:56] teaching with a few State statements to
[1:42:59] close but he did not place he placed a
[1:43:04] comma because men of God
[1:43:07] were Anointed with the
[1:43:10] holy men that were born
[1:43:14] again to also bring word over
[1:43:18] word line over
[1:43:20] line how like Peter in
[1:43:24] Paul that were going to
[1:43:27] continue to add even more
[1:43:30] details to this Plan of
[1:43:34] Redemption through the anointing of the
[1:43:36] Holy
[1:43:40] Spirit and where Jesus began his
[1:43:43] teaching in the
[1:43:45] Perfection it was in Matthew Chapter
[1:43:48] 5 in verse
[1:43:50] one and here it says this way
[1:43:55] and seeing the
[1:43:56] multitudes he went up into the
[1:44:01] mountain and when he was said his
[1:44:03] disciples came unto
[1:44:07] him and he opened his mouth and taught
[1:44:09] them
[1:44:12] saying blessed are the poor in
[1:44:15] spirit not in
[1:44:18] money not in invest not in in cars
[1:44:24] not in a new
[1:44:26] vehicle blessed are the poor in
