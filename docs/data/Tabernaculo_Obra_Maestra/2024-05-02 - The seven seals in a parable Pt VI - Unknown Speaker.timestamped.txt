[49:00] escondió en tres medidas de harina hasta
[49:03] que todo fue
[49:10] leudado muchas veces la
[49:14] levadura se tipifica a una
[49:20] doctrina y aquí en la
[49:23] parábola y dice el reino de los cielos
[49:28] semejante a la
[49:34] levadura durante la celebración de
[49:37] Israel de las fiestas de levadura que
[49:39] ellos
[49:42] hacían no debería tener levadura en ese
[49:45] pan es pan sin
[49:48] levadura sin
[49:51] doctrina no
[49:52] dogmas no credos ni opinión
[49:59] de
[50:02] Deer es representaba
[50:08] Jesucristo
[50:13] jes el hombre no vivir solamente del
[50:20] pan toda la palabra que sale de la boca
[50:22] de
[50:30] pero aquí la parábola dice que el pan
[50:33] estaba
[50:35] leudado la mujer lo
[50:40] tomó y le puso tres medidas de
[50:45] harina hasta que todo estaba
[50:52] leudado Jesús lleó
[50:58] y su iglesia estaba mezclada con
[51:03] levadura y la el pan que tenían ya no
[51:06] era la palabra de
[51:08] Dios verso 34
[51:12] dice eso es un una cita concluida
[51:27] todo esto habló Jesús por parábolas a la
[51:31] gente y sin parábolas no les
[51:35] hablaba todo en
[51:38] parábolas sin
[51:41] parábolas no habría su
[51:44] boca y el 35 nos dice por
[51:52] qué Si usted es lector de la Biblia le y
[51:56] respuesta

[52:29] libro un libro que estaba sellado con
[52:33] siete
[52:34] sellos desde la fundación del
[52:37] mundo el libro que Adán
[52:42] perdió y Jesús dijo Estas son las
[52:45] cosas que se iban
[52:49] desenvolver abriré mi boca en parábolas
[52:56] declararé las cosas que estaban secretas
[52:59] desde antes de la fundación del
[53:01] mundo en otras
[53:05] palabras son los Profetas del Antiguo
[53:09] Testamento que habían
[53:12] profetizado Así dice el
[53:14] Señor
[53:16] Jesús va a abrir el
[53:20] libro y Jesús abrirá los siete sellos en
[53:24] parábolas

[1:15:25] Jesús caminó adentro a ese
[1:15:30] jardín como rey de los
[1:15:35] judíos pero caminó con un
[1:15:38] propósito é sabía cuando é entró
[1:15:44] adentro el padre pidiéndole que dejara
[1:15:48] su corona
[1:15:55] a su manto
[1:15:57] real y lo iba a vestir como

[1:17:39] tenemos
[1:17:40] escrito estaba escrito en
[1:17:43] libros tenemos los
[1:17:52] libros ciertamente mois lo dijo
[1:17:56] Y usted puede encontrar esas citas en
[1:17:58] los
[1:17:59] libros pero no fue así en el
[1:18:03] principio en el
[1:18:05] principio Dios hizo varón y hembra en el
[1:18:11] principio los dos serán
[1:18:14] uno principio

[1:18:20] juntó que el hombre no los separe
[1:18:25] en el
[1:18:27] principio no era no había
[1:18:30] divorcio ese era el plan divino de

[1:19:00] mandamientos con el amor de Dios Así
[1:19:02] dice el Señor en nuestras vidas eso es
[1:19:05] lo que
[1:19:06] Dios nos trajo una vez más este Cordero
[1:19:10] de
[1:19:12] Dios abriendo el
[1:19:14] libro y Desatando los siete
[1:19:17] sellos se

[1:19:33] hizo el
[1:19:35] león Era Jesús de Nazaret en su primera
[1:19:40] venida es exactamente lo que
[1:19:44] hizo Pero entonces vemos leemos el
[1:19:47] siguiente
[1:19:49] versículo y habla de Un cordero
[1:19:55] y vi Un cordero como
[1:20:00] imolado porque estamos moviendo a la su

[1:20:37] patrón y tráigalo a revelaciones
[1:20:42] c y cuando Juan dice vi un
[1:20:45] león y él abrió el
[1:20:48] libro y él desató los siete sellos y
[1:20:52] luego dice
[1:20:56] Y también vi Un cordero como
[1:20:58] inmolado que tenía siete cuernos siete
[1:21:04] ojos y tenía un libro en su
[1:21:08] mano y fue y tomó el
[1:21:12] libro de la mano del que estaba sentado
[1:21:14] en el
[1:21:15] trono qué es lo que estaba
[1:21:18] representando un cambio
[1:21:21] Ministerial de León a Cordero

[1:21:30] libro y desatar sus este

[1:21:57] León como
[1:21:59] León le dijo a sus
[1:22:02] discípulos vayan solamente a la casa de
[1:22:06] Israel pero como
