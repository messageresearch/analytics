is chosen his beloved the one whom he died for to restore you back to himself so he could spend eternity with in an in an in here in an invisible Union but he wants to take us from this world he wants to take us from time into eternity so that the union is no longer invisible but but that it'll become visible and we'll walk with him hand in hand throughout all eternity this morning we'd like to speak on the Lamb's wife and the Lamb's bride who is she when is she the wife when was she the bride is she the same one and that's what we'd like to share this morning or at least begin turn with me to Revelations 19 Revelations 19 and ver starting at verse seven Revelations 19 and verse 7 verse having having a little problems finding Revelations 19 well I guess it's all part of getting older Revelations 19 and7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife had made herself ready a woman that is now ready is a wife a bride is the wife but she's a wife in preparation being adorned for her husband for a coming event called The Marriage of the lamb in a union that will bring you together then after that takes place that marriage ceremony he carries his wife away to the wedding supper of the Lamb let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife had made herself ready and to her was granted that she should be ar raid in fine linen clean and white to her which is who the bride so to the bride is granted that she should be a raid in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints so so the bride is is the woman who's being adorned and prepared for the marriage ceremony but the bride is the wife she's wife to be she is bride and she is wife but it'll come a time that through a through a through a through a process that she is being being adorned and prepared for this wedding ceremony where the where the bridegroom and the bride being the same person will now become man and wife in a public ceremony for all the world to see that the bride was always the wife but waiting for an appointed time the bridegroom was waiting for the bride to go through a process to to become to finally be announced the wife and him the husband but prior to that it's bride and bridegroom waiting an appointed time that they would officially if you could say it that way become husband and wife verse eight and to her was granted that she should be ar raay in fine linen clean and white for the fine linen is the righteousness of the Saints and he saith come to me right blessed are they which are called unto the marriage supper of the lamb and he saith unto me these are the true saints of God it's the bride who's called to this to this marriage supper of the lamb and the supper follows immediately after that the marriage is complete and their man and wife and what does the man do then he carries his wife away who was his bride to be with him eternally in the heavens above let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this add your blessings to your word Lord you are the revealer of the word and if I can say but one thing and if your people can catch but one thing it'll be you opening the eyes of their understanding that they might be blessed that they might be edified that they might be in this process of a bride being adorned for that wedding day from go to go from bride to go to to wife to be carried away to live eternally with her husband The Living Word we thank you now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated you'll turn with me to St John chapter 3 and verse 29 and it reads like this he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled this was this was John the Baptist the Elijah to the first coming of Christ and he said he said he must increase John a prophet introducing Jesus Christ he had many followers for he was bringing change to Israel this but he told all his followers I've come to introduce you to the bridegroom and and as much as you appreciate the ministry and the prophetic word he says I'm just a vessel that God has used to bring you the changes but John was coming to the end of his ministry and he said he said he must increase before your eyes I must decrease he said every true prophet of God always pointed back to God always pointed back to Jehovah always pointed to the Lamb of God verse 31 he that Cometh From Above is above all he that is of the earth is Earthly and speaketh of the earth he that Cometh From Heaven is above all verse 29 once again he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom which standeth and heareth him rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice this my joy therefore is fulfilled the bride is is a woman in the Old Testament under the under the Orthodox Jewish Traditions when a woman was betrothed to a man today we use the word uh being engaged and it's it's it is is in essence it is the same thing and yet it's not for under under the Jewish Traditions a woman betrothed to a man uh was a woman who was wife now and yet during the time from the time of betrothal to to the time to the time of a of a wedding ceremony that woman had to go through a process a process of [Music] adornment a process of CLE different rituals of cleansing a process to be prepared with a certain dress and gown for this for this event she was the bride and and the bride was already wife but she was being prepared for this for this time when they would be declared man and wife publicly but it was already a covenant that the woman could not walk away from now the man could divorce the woman even before the wedding ceremony took place because according to the law she was already wife you'll remember when Joseph when he realized that Mary with his child and the Bible says because he was a just man he was he was thinking about putting her away privately because she was already wife to him but yet they had not lived together as husband and wife but she was already wife so a wife to be was the bride and the bride was the wife preparing herself for a great public ceremony and she was a a woman being adorned and prepared for this Union and at and at the fullness and completion of this Union the husband would now take her as wife to live together spiritually live together eternally bride and wife Revelations 21 and verse 2 Revelations 21 and verse 2 and I saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband bride was a woman being prepared bride was a woman betroth to a husband bride was the a wife already but bride was a woman being prepared and adorned for her husband going through cleansings being being dressed now different L now now she was being dressed in a way that her husband liked to see her so perhaps her old way of dressing it was all going to change the way she dressed the way she adorned herself cuz now she was adorning herself to to for one specific man because the bride this this ride this woman [Music] betroth was already wife to this man but now she was being adorned in a way to just please this one particular man and no other and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so this bride that's adorned here for her husband is is a woman ready to enter into the next stage of being a wife into a into a union with the husband and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God this is now the wife dwelling with the husband Revelations 21 and verse 9 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven V full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the woman being prepared the Lamb's wife I will show the the bride a woman preparing adorning herself for her husband comma the Lamb's wife the marriage was consummated the bride was fully adorned she was she was dressed and washed in a way that pleased the husband she was ready she entered in into this invisible Union and then it says in verse 10 and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from God typing this holy Jerusalem the supernatural descending to the Bride of Christ the Lamb's wife Revelations 22 Revelations 22 and verse 16 and I Jesus have sent my angel to testify unto these things in the church I am the root and off spring of David and the bright and morning star and the spirit and the bride say come and let him that Hearth say come and let him that is a thirst come and whosoever will let him take the Water of Life freely what time is it it's a time of a bride being united to the groom it's the time of the wise virgin being raptured the rapturing of the Bride is a transition from bride to wife where now God is gathering his bride who's been washed who's been cleansed who's been adorned who has changed the way she dresses who has changed the way she talks who have changed the way she conducts herself she's been adorning herself in other words she's been she's been she she has been changing to please her her husband so that when he comes to take her away she is just exactly the apple of his eye she does everything the way he likes it she has read in the scriptures how to please him and now she's following this process of being born again of receiving the Holy Ghost of being sensitive to the refilling of the holy spirit this is the bride being adorned for her husband and the rapturing time is when the husband says you're you're just the way I like you you're just perfect in every way this I Won't Wait Another moment I'm caring you off so we can live together together eternally oh the word bride is mentioned in the scriptures including in the Old Testament beginning from Isaiah the word bride is used in Genesis 24 there when elaser receives the commission from Abraham and he's to get a wife for his son Isaac and there there in Genesis 24 the the the word bride isn't used eler is isn't called to go get a bride for Isaac he's he's Abraham calls him to take bring a wife for Isaac consider in verse one of Genesis 24 and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abraham in all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand under my thigh he was going to give elazer his servant a commission probably the most important commission he had ever given him to go give a wife for his son Isaac he said can he tells him in verse four but but Thou shalt go into my country and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac in verse 7 he says then the Lord God Of Heaven which took me from my father's house and from the land of my Kindred and which spake unto me and that swear unto me saying unto thy seed will I give this land he shall send his Angel before thee and thou shalt take a wife unto my son Rebecca long before she ever knew it was already wife to Isaac because in the Old Testament a woman betr was already wife she was called bride but she was wife because bride was the preparation time bride was the cleansing and washing time bride was the time when ornaments would be given to her so she could prepare for this encounter with the bridegroom her husband elaser took these adornments eler took these jewels and and he was to and he would be placing them upon Rebecca that that would be a claim on this woman that to to whom this adornment belonged if she would receive it then to be dressed and adorned in this fashion already was a claim claiming Rebecca as wife to Isaac and the dormant of our life as a bride which bride is the preparation time you are the bride of Christ because we're being prepared to the and are adment is a contrite spirit our adornments is the faith that he gives us our adornments is what we can add to that Faith the virtue of God our adornments are the very patience of God our adornments is the temp that he gives us our adornments is the brotherly kindness that comes to our life our adornments is that we'll serve the Lord Our God our husband and him only shall we serve and from a born again experience from repent and be baptized in his name is a bride being prepared a bride being cleansed that's you you're being prepared you're being cleaned that's what makes you the bride is that you submit to the word of God to the prophetic word and you're saying Lord get me [Music] ready because you're the bride are you wife to be you are the wife the wife preparing for the wedding is the bride so the bride time is a preparation time the bride time is repentance time the bride time is the Born Again experience the bride time your preparation is the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are you are a wife being prepared to live with the groom eternally and when you arrive he's not going to change one thing about you because he's been changing you now here and the final change will be a Rapture this terrestrial when it comes to an end why will it end because the marriage has come do you realize that the death of a Christian of a Believer is them moving from bride to the wife and God says I can't live without you another moment I'm taking home no longer bride wife so there's no debate of Bride and wife just like there's no debate who was Jesus was he the lion of the tribe of Judah or is he the Lamb of God who is he he's both those are his ministries well guess whatch chur of God your ministry begins when you're baptized in the name of Jesus you accept to be the bride of Christ now you're a woman being prepared for the husband to finally look down and he looks down at you he says he says wow what a beauty I'm taking her now she's going home with me at 90 years old Jesus will look down and if you've been in the word growing in Christ he says wow wow prettiest girl I ever seen I'm taking her now the husband because you've allowed him you've entered into a preparation the Bride is a woman a wife preparing for an invisible Union with Christ the husband Jewish in Jewish custom a bride was a man's wife already but they were awaiting a future wedding ceremony when they would publicly be pronounced man and wife and then live together in our case eternally not so under the law but under the law a man could divorce and put away his wife for any reason but if the reason was unjust even under the law the woman was free to marry again under the law you see a man could put a woman away for a term called and say she's unclean and yet she had done nothing wrong and yet she she was not found in fornication or adultery she had done nothing wrong it was just a general term for a man that all realized I don't really like this woman and he could put her away in divorcement but under the of Moses though it was allowed under the law of Moses yet that woman who had been treated unjustly was free to marry someone else under the law but when Jesus come the custom would end for a gentile people and not only only a gentile people but for all people at the first coming of Christ a prophet came and taught us the truth of marriage and divorce putting scripture together for us remember the first coming of Christ was going to bring five things for Israel according to the prophecy of Isaiah 40 and the changes would come through a prophetic Ministry of John the Baptist he would introduce the changes he would introduce the Lamb of God who would add great detail to the changes and what John came to do was exactly that and the five things that Isaiah spoke of that John would bring was change change change change and when Jesus came he would tell us in detail what those five changes were and he started in in Matthew 28 in Matthew 19 turn with me to Matthew 19 we'll begin at verse one a great change came to Israel one that they couldn't accept and yet it was thus saith the Lord yet it was the great a change that would bless their lives yet it was a change that would bring peace to their families and they couldn't accept it verse one and it came to pass that when Jesus had finished these Saints he departed from Galilee and came into the coast of Judea Beyond Jordan and great multitudes followed followed him and he healed them there and the Pharisees also came unto him despite the miraculous Ministry they didn't come to see if God with this was with this man no the Bible says the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause they asked him a question to which they thought they already knew the answer and to they asked him a question that they felt Moses would back them up and he answered and said unto them in verse four have ye not read that that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man leave father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and they twain shall be one flesh wherefore there are no more Twain but one flesh what therefore God hath joined together let not man put aunder this was thus sayith the Lord this was God bringing chain this was the grace of God and they couldn't accept the grace of God they've been under the law for so long they they'd been under church dogmas for so long they they've been under the propaganda of too many preachers that didn't know the word for so long now they say unto him verse seven why why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and put her away they thought they had an answer and they had him in a corner because what Jew would dare to contradict Moses a great Exodus prophet they thought they they thought they had put him in a corner but they didn't know who they were talking to they were talking to Jehovah himself who had come to bring change they're talking to almighty God who was going to extend the king's scepter to Israel to be bright and WI but Israel would reject the betral Israel would reject to be bride Israel would reject to be wife he saith unto them Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you to be put away to put away your wives listen to this but from the beginning it was not so God allowed Fallen man he allowed Moses to give them a writing of a divorcement it was either that or have Jewish men or in abundance murdering their wives to take another one Moses said Lord what do I do God allowed him because of the hardness of their hearts to let them give a writing a divorce instead of pull a knife and butcher the women this is is true but it wasn't so from the beginning before man's fall before the human race was mixed with the DNA of The Serpent and before the characteristics of that serpent were in this flesh body a liar and a murderer from the beginning you say no I've never killed anyone not with a gun but with our tongues with our words and lies I stopped counting mine and just started asking for forgiveness amen there's many that I'm sure I don't remember as a Young Man growing up but I'll bet everyone I told them to they remember Jesus says I say unto you who soever shall put away his wife except be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and whosoever Marth her which is put away doth commit adultery can it be more clear than that his disciples say unto him this ain't the Pharisees speaking now this isn't the sadu speaking this isn't the lawyers of the law speaking they were shocked they didn't know what to say but his disciples said unto him if the case of man be so with his wife his disciples you know like Peter James John Andrew men that were following him the phes weren't following him they were tempting him but when he come to this place here his disciples say unto him if the case of the man be so with his wife it's not good to marri if I can't get rid of her when I when I think I've had enough of her marriage isn't a good thing anymore that's the way these men were thinking that's the way these men had lived for 4,000 years but Jesus was bringing change to Israel bring Jesus was bringing change to both Gentile and Jews Jesus is bringing change both to Saint and sinner because the word of God thus sayith the lord it's not just for the believer it's for the unbeliever because on Judgment Day God will judge the World by his word he won't judge us by the Catholic church he won't judge us by the Lutheran Church he won't judge us by the the rules of the Baptist Church he won't judge us by the Pentecostal church and their rules no sir the whole world will be judged by the word of God Jesus Christ the husband it's just that only the believer is interested in keeping his word the unbeliever isn't interested and yet the very thing he's not interested in is what will judge him the word of God but the bride wants to be adorned with his word because she wants to come to that ceremony to be called wife and carried away in an invisible Union to be with her husband eternally verse n and I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery and who so Marth her which is put away do commit adultery God is speaking to the man here who at one point was saying Moses gave us a writing of divorcement and we can put her away for any reason Jesus said it wasn't so from the beginning and the reason I've come the reason I've come in the in flesh is to show you all how to get back to the beginning I'm not even taking you back to the to the to the days of Abraham I'm not trying to take you back to the days of Moses I'm not trying to take you back to to to to the even to the days of Abel and Cain no I'm wanting to take you back before man ever fell I'm wanting to take you back to that day when there was no sin on planet Earth and he says I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication then the question Rises well then what's fornication brother some say fornication is the same as adultery so if if you marry your wife and and and she lived clean and she was virgin but yet 5 10 years later she runs off with another man commits adultery then the man can put her away that's one side of it the other says no fornication uh only takes place between single people and adultery is is a term used for people already married who are living immorally so there's another argument and others say no let's go to the dictionary and see what the dictionary says and then the dictionary tells us both it's unclean immoral living so so then uh when Jesus said whosoever shall put away his wife accept it before fornication and shall marry another committeth adultery so the word is fornication so who has the right interpretation where is the true definition found so we'll know what the truth is it's not found in a dictionary and it's not found in a group of men debating ministers where could we find find it I think we have to go back to the beginning that the definition for fornication lays in Genesis because God is his own interpreter so what happened in the beginning turn with me to Genesis chapter 3 beginning at verse one Eve was Adam's wife she was bones of his bones Spirit of his Spirit flesh of his flesh you couldn't get no more closer a man and a woman than what Adam and Eve were and even though she was wife they had not lived together intimately as husband and wife she was wife but she was a woman betr she was Adam's bride and a wife to be and there and what and God was tutoring this couple to bring forth the family of God but in Holiness by the spoken word so here in Genesis 3 it says now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field so the serpent was the title of this being but the serpent wasn't a reptile the serpent was a mammal like man and it was the and it was the most subtile beast of the field so of all the animals in God's kingdom with exception of man the serpent was a smartest so the serpent was the link between the animal kingdom and human beings it it is what science calls today The Missing Link because science says there is a missing link between the chimpanzee and the human race they can take take they can take all the life that was created and mix one seed that's next to the other and create some kind of a creature none of them never live long but they can interbreed them and science has tried the same between the chimpanzee and man and as much as they have tried to conceive something by mixing the seed of a chimpanzee with the human being nothing happens so then science has said there's a missing link between the Animal Kingdom and man because we can mix everything else and produce some kind of a mutation but when they came to the chimpanzee and man nothing happens no life is made because the link that was missing was the serpent that God cursed and we realize now what happened in Genesis 3 was the serpent anointed of Satan to offer Eve another seed you see God in his mercy and Grace offered Adam and Eve the woman's seed so the prophecy of the woman's seed here in Genesis wasn't because of the Fall the prophecy of the woman's seed is the seed that Eve rejected and the one she accepted was the seed of the serpent the woman's seed was the spoken word that would bring forth a Manchild that would bring forth the family of God you see God never had an afterthought all his thoughts are original so to think that the prophecy of the woman's seed was an after thought would be naive of us would be very childish of us let's turn in Genesis 3 inesis in verse verse 10 or verse let's go to verse nine man had fallen Eve had fallen and the Bible said in verse 9 Genesis 3 and the Lord called unto Adam and said unto him where art thou God knew where he was at he was outside of the protection of the word of God and he said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself the holy Veil from their eyes had been ripped to pieces he said who told thee that thou was naked has thou eaten of the the tree wherefore I commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and the woman said and the man said the woman whom thou gavest to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the serpent because thou Hast done this Thou Art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field watch what the curs did to the serpent upon thy belly shalt thou go it was a curse telling us that this creature was never on its belly this creature stood upright like you and I on two feet he said Thou Art cursed above all cattle above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and thus shal thou eat all the days of thy life now the this serpent was was cursed now this beast of the field that was the most subtile it was so subtle it could speak Eve's language it was so sub he could manipulate her it was so subtle that what took place in the garden was an act of fornication why fornication because Eve Adam's wife when when when she met with the serpent was a virgin but she had never been with her husband so Jesus when he said in in in Matthew 19 and gave to the man now not any reason but only one reason one reason why a man could now put his wife away in verse 9 of Matthew 19 he said I say unto you whosoever shall put away his wife except it be for fornication and the answer lies in Genesis what took place in Genesis while Eve was the bride to Adam a woman betroth to her husband a woman engaged to to to enter into a wedding ceremony and before she was ever with her husband intimately she received seed from another man that's the fornication that Jesus was speaking and the only reason why today a man could put away his wife because you see once you have a vow once you're engaged to be married that young lady is your wife you've made a promise the two of you and what God has put together let no man put us under the only reason that God gives a man a right to divorce not so much the divorce men aren't worried about the divorce part they want to know if I leave this woman I want to get married again that's the question you may divorce her you may put her away you can do all the paperwork according to to man but in the eyes of God that woman is still your wife and if you marry again you are committing adultery so what's the only reason is when a woman betroth to a man engage she has accepted a vow yes I will be your wife and then she has a relationship ship with another man before the marriage before she ever has a relationship with her husband who she made a vow to then that man has a right to put her away and remarry does he have an obligation he must no no can the man forgive her he can he can forgive her and justify her for the marriage and when he does that he releases his right to put her away and remarry again now the woman according to God's word even today once she takes the vow and cons and consents to be married to a man she is bound to that man only death only the death of that man will ever allow her to remarry you say what if it's a terrible husband she don't have to stay with a terrible husband while that man lives she she doesn't have a scriptural right to remarry fathers do you see how serious it is for you to stand and intercede for your daughters it's their whole future it's their whole life don't be silent intercede for that girl not mad I'm just a dad three daughters and when I saw that it was my duty to stand between my daughter and some immature young man I did it I was criticized but you know today my daughters are married to some of the finest young men that love them watch over them treat their children my grandchildren with great kindness heads of your homes the the father in the home if I would have known the responsibility as a Christian man in a home I may have never gotten married because the burden and the weight is tremendous you are responsible no brother Daniel if you knew my wife I no no if you knew the word you could be born again if you as a man could get the Holy Ghost you'd realize you have to stand in the gap for that little family you have to stand in the gap for that little lady your wife amen you've got to put on the harness like they do in Oxen and that oxin pulls the weight and they never put two old oxin together they take the biggest the strongest the well the well trained and they put a younger one next to it because he's going to train that one he'll have the strength to pull that younger one even if he wants to go a different way but he's in the same yoke with him and he just pulls them and they go and he teaches them how to make a straight line he teaches them how to go from the cross of Calvary to eternal life teaches them his wife and his children about the baptism of the Holy Ghost we speak of a five-fold Ministry but there's a sixfold Ministry that isn't spoken of much that's the head of each home you are the last word in your home not me you are the head of your home not me I must set a pattern in the assembly before almighty God judge me on that day of judgment if I don't set the pattern of God's word for you I must keep the church in order and the husband must catch the Revelation ding wait a minute I also need to keep my home in order I need to be careful who I let in my home I need to be careful who I let my children go off with my family my flesh family my brothers my sisters living in sin their children growing up worldly they were all about the same age and my mom told me she says why don't you visit your brothers and sisters why don't you let your children play with their cousins I said Mom I would be a fool to let my children go with their cousins knowing that in their homes they're putting on television every day of the most most wicked and immoral movies and I would send my children to be there and sleep over for two or three nights that's like that's like leading them to the doorstep of hell and say stay here with the devil I'll be back in three days that is if your minds and little Souls survive it I said Mom while they're living for the devil I'll not mix my children with these with these Philistine children and it was my own brother it was my sister you say but they were just children they were just children who used the foulest of language already one time as little children I seen one of their cousins reach over put to put their hands on my little girl I stopped it my little girls didn't know what was taking place my nephew was shocked that I saw him because already their hearts and mind Minds had been perverted do you see dads you must be a Watchman in the house how can two walk together unless they be agreed unless we're all striving for the same thing to be like Jesus Jus the Bride is a is a wife preparing for a marriage and and immediately following the marriage this bride who is being adorned prepared and washed prepared for the marriage prepared for the wedding ceremony because as soon as the marriage ceremony takes place the groom takes her away to live with her eternally bride wife it's your ministry it's where you start and what you come to just like Jesus the lion of the tribe of Judah and the Lamb of God which one was he he was both but it was his ministry unfolding the bride or the wife which one are you you're both what is bride it's the wife being adorned washed cleansed prepared for the wedding ceremony Jeremiah chapter 2 and verse 32 let's start in verse 31 oh generation see ye the word of the Lord have I been a Wilderness unto Israel a land of Darkness wherefore say my people we are Lords we will come no more unto thee then God says to them through the mouth of Jeremiah can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire can she can once she's called once she's made a vow can she forget that she's preparing to be wife and made forget her ornaments or a bride her attire yet my people have forgotten me days without number and when Jesus came at his first coming that was Israel like the story of Esther in the Book of Esther do you realize that that Old Testament allegory a parable is speaking of two churches the Orthodox Jewish church and a New Testament Church the bride of Christ when vasti the king's wife would no longer be obedient to his voice like Israel was when Jesus came what did Jesus say when he came to Israel I came to you as great Jehovah Eagle no he didn't say that he didn't he said how often as a h tries to gather her brood so here is God typing in self to a hen it sounds terrible to say but Jehovah hen he says I came to you Israel you're not a House of Prayer you're a den of Thieves you're a chicken [Music] yard pecking on the ground in the dirt looking at the Earth all the time and never looking up from where cometh your Redemption Israel was vashy and she refused to come to be wife to the King King Jesus so he chose a new bride he went looking for a Bride for a wife that would be obedient that would be adorned in the fashion that he would like her to be he was looking for a woman that would be chained because that's what Jesus brought to Israel change change change change I'm going to change the way you fathers judge your children under the law a rebellious son the father would take him call the Elders by force they would walk him into a field and if the father said this son has been rebellious the father and the elders would Stone the son to death guess what Jesus came to change that way of raising your kids under the law it was said spare the rod and spoil the child but Paul said when he says don't provoke your children to anger everything had changed I want you to know this morning that everything has changed for the believer in Christ first of all in a marriage [Music] covenant God leaves no room for a man just to live his wife for any reason once The Vow is made once the Covenant is in place unless unless that the woman would be unfaithful before the marriage takes place and the man cannot divorce his and marry another you say well what if my wife commits adultery later five years later 10 years later well I'm sure there's many things that attributed to her not wanting to be with you no more but that's not the fornication that Jesus was speaking CU if you married her and she was a virgin and she commits adultery later that's not the fornication that Jesus was speaking can you put her away sure can you remarry no no change come do we want the changes that Jesus has for us or do we want to still live as legalists under the law of Moses instead of the grace of God As We Stand to our feet Jeremiah said Can a maid forget her ornaments or a bride her attire he said yet my people have forgotten me days without number is Israel refused to be wife and then so God put Israel away and took to him a new wife a bride you and I so the Bride of Jesus Christ is a gentile woman not the Jewish Church she's not bride she's not wife she never was she never conceived seed in Revelations chap 12 it's a prophecy but this is the bride of Christ this is the Lamb's wife listen as we're closing and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun a woman clothed with the sun fine linen Sun represented the grace of God and the moon under her feet represented the law of Moses and upon her head a crown of 12 Stars represented the 12 apostles and she being with child CED travailing in birth and pain to be delivered Israel was never with child Israel rejected Christ Israel rejected to be wife Israel never travailed and birth and pain to be delivered of Christ inner the so who is this woman here this woman is the Lamb's wife this woman is the bride of Christ now in a very literal sense this woman was little Mary and who did this little virgin girl who did she represent little Mary a little Jewish girl represented the bride of Christ the Lamb's wife because she received the spoken word the original SE Eve received the seed Mary received the seed that Eve rejected because it wasn't an afterthought the woman's seed was the spoken word seed The Original Seed it would have brought forth the family of God and when she would have been faithful to Adam she would have been faithful to God and brought forth the family of God into eternity there would have been no fault but Eve rejected the spoken word seed and instead received the seed of the serpent but this woman of Revelations 12 this is the bride of Christ this is the wife because she's with child she's clothed in in the Sun in Amazing Grace she's got the law at her feet and pained to be delivered the Lamb's wife has made herself ready and has taken God at his word let's pray Heavenly Father we give you thanks we pray you continue to open to us your word that the Bible that's written Black Ink on white paper that it'll become to us the revealed word and every
