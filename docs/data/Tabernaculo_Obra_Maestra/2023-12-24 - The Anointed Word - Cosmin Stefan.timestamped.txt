[36:45] word the psalmist said in Psalms
[36:49] 23 the Lord is my

[37:27] death I will fear no evil for thou art
[37:31] with me thy rod and thy staff they
[37:35] comfort
[37:37] me then he said thou preparest a table
[37:41] before
[37:42] me in the presence of my
[37:45] enemies thou anointest my head with oil
[37:48] my cup
[37:52] runthe goodness and

[41:03] to be in the house of the
[41:05] Lord I don't believe it's by

[41:11] in his
[41:12] mind before the foundation of the

[45:31] that we just thank you again for brother
[45:33] Daniel and the invitation he's made for
[45:38] us and I'll say it this
[45:43] way let the word of God be the center of
[45:45] our
[45:48] life these meetings are beautiful and
[45:50] they're
[45:52] good but don't let it stop

[46:03] Lord where now you could search for him
[46:08] closer where now you can dig into the
[46:10] word
[46:11] deeper now your life could line up with
[46:14] the word of
[46:16] God amen amen amen let's just turn to
[46:19] our
[46:21] scriptures we'll just read Hebrews
[46:23] chapter
[46:24] 1
[46:26] verses 1 through
[46:31] 4 and keep your Bibles
[46:35] out we we're just going to walk through
[46:38] scripture we're going to continue from
[46:40] last
[46:42] night and so we're just walking into
[46:44] this
[46:46] direction to us a son was
[46:49] given amen amen so let's just read
[46:52] verses 1 through 4 and you can have your
[46:54] seat
[46:58] God who has suned times and in diver
[47:04] manners spake in the time passed unto
[47:07] the fathers by the
[47:10] prophets had in these last days spoken
[47:13] unto us by his
[47:17] son whom he had appointed Heirs of air
[47:20] of All
[47:22] Things by whom also he made the
[47:27] world who being the brightness of his
[47:32] glory and the expressed image of his
[47:37] person now think about
[47:39] this the express image of his
[47:43] person
[47:46] God and upholding All Things by the word
[47:50] of his
[47:53] power when he had by himself purged our
[47:59] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[48:02] Majesty on
[48:04] high being made so much better than the
[48:09] angels as a as he had by inheritance
[48:13] obtained a more excellent Name than
[48:18] they Lord we just ask a blessing upon
[48:20] the word we ask for more time that you
[48:22] would be with us that you would have a
[48:24] special anointing on your
[48:26] word Jesus Christ name amen God bless
[48:30] you you can have your
[48:33] SE
[48:35] so as we were talking about last
[48:38] night just to just to uh come to an
[48:43] image to bring us up to where we were
[48:45] last
[48:47] night there was a promise that was given
[48:49] to
[48:51] Isaiah the word was spoken by a
[48:54] prophet the Prophet was able to prophesy
[48:57] what would come to
[48:59] pass and this word this logos started
[49:03] traveling and it traveled and there was
[49:06] a day when Christ decided for this word
[49:10] to take
[49:11] flesh and it took flesh in the virgin's
[49:16] womb now the love of the
[49:20] Virgin was let it be to me according to
[49:23] your
[49:24] will
[49:27] humility she wanted she wanted to know
[49:30] that this is what's
[49:32] happening I'm sure she knew the law I'm
[49:36] sure she read the law I'm sure she
[49:38] understood that something like this
[49:40] would probably take
[49:42] place so when the angel came to her she
[49:45] didn't question it she believed upon the
[49:48] word of
[49:49] God and she knew that if she believes on
[49:53] this
[49:54] word that the Holy Ghost will fulfill
[49:58] it she walked with her attitude knowing
[50:01] that it's not
[50:04] her but it's God that will send the holy
[50:08] ghost that would lead
[50:11] her okay okay so now this promised son
[50:14] has been given to
[50:17] us you know today's
[50:20] Eve you know the Christmas Eve is what
[50:22] people
[50:24] say tonight is the night where Santa
[50:27] Claus goes through the U the
[50:32] chimney I'm sorry this is this is what
[50:34] the world
[50:36] believes we just have to be
[50:38] honest so this man that's
[50:42] overweight tries to squeeze
[50:45] down this this chimney to bring
[50:50] gifts to our
[50:52] children right to give gifts so that way
[50:56] when they open the
[50:57] gifts they will feel happy they will
[51:00] feel rejoiced they would be they would
[51:02] be
[51:04] rejoicing we catch away their
[51:08] attention from the meaning of what life
[51:12] means substitut it to a worldly
[51:17] pleasure think about it a
[51:20] substitute to take away the joy in the
[51:24] Lord place it into something that has
[51:27] death now now of course it will make him
[51:31] happy but eventually they'll get
[51:34] bored eventually gets thrown
[51:37] away so what did that
[51:41] do you see the
[51:43] substitution you see the ways of man you
[51:46] see where it goes you see the direction
[51:49] that it's
[51:51] going and it's a story it's not a true
[51:54] story it's a f story it's something that
[51:58] has no life so now people are trying to
[52:00] teach our
[52:02] children that there's this this
[52:05] Santa actually if you turn the letters
[52:08] between them it's Satan they just have
[52:10] to put the a with the T and
[52:13] then it's right it's there but he comes
[52:18] as an angel of
[52:19] Light he wants to
[52:22] deceive he's he's he's a lie there's no
[52:25] truth in him he's an accuser he's a
[52:29] blamer he's the one that tries to get
[52:31] you to
[52:34] fall right amen and then there's a son
[52:38] that lifts you up that puts you in
[52:40] Heavenly
[52:42] places that gives you life amen amen so
[52:47] this is what people believe what
[52:49] Christmas
[52:52] is now just like we mentioned yesterday
[52:56] [Music]
[52:58] the prophet says that Jesus was not born
[53:02] in the month of
[53:03] December because it was too cold in
[53:05] Judea for that month to be able to be
[53:07] born in a barn like
[53:11] that but Jesus was born around April or
[53:16] May right because that's when the
[53:18] Shepherds were be on the
[53:20] field that's when the barn would be and
[53:23] it it wasn't cold
[53:26] so so
[53:28] now the
[53:30] son that came had a
[53:34] power and he created the world by this
[53:39] power so think about this the very word
[53:42] that was prophesied that came into
[53:46] Mary was a
[53:49] word but the word had to be
[53:52] anointed for it to take flesh
[53:58] the life of Jesus Christ had to be
[54:02] anointed by the Holy Ghost for it to
[54:05] take
[54:07] flesh so I want to continue tonight or
[54:09] this
[54:10] morning and talk to you about the
[54:12] anointed
[54:15] word the anointed
[54:17] word because the word of God will never
[54:20] remain
[54:21] dead when something that God had spoken
[54:25] has to come to
[54:27] pass right amen who it says verse two in
[54:32] in Hebrews we
[54:34] continue had in this last days spoken
[54:37] unto us by his
[54:40] son whom he had appointed heir of All
[54:45] Things by whom he also made the
[54:47] [Applause]
[54:50] world the son made the
[54:54] world
[54:56] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[54:58] and
[54:59] forever who be in the brightness of his
[55:04] glory Express image of his expressed
[55:07] image of his
[55:09] person upholding on things by the word
[55:12] of his
[55:15] power and he had by himself purged our
[55:20] sins sat down on the right hand of the
[55:22] Majesty on
[55:24] high
[55:26] now when a man's born
[55:27] again he receives the spirit of
[55:30] Christ and now it's no longer him that
[55:33] live it but it's Christ that lives
[55:34] inside of
[55:36] him amen so now I have to
[55:42] die my burden my
[55:45] cross is to let go of all I
[55:48] have pick up my
[55:50] cross and follow
[55:53] him because the foot footsteps of the
[55:56] righteous they're ordered of the Lord so
[55:59] how do you know the Lord unless you walk
[56:01] in his
[56:03] footsteps what did he
[56:05] do he sacrificed
[56:08] himself he let everything go of what he
[56:13] desired and he had you in his
[56:16] mind and as he was walking his
[56:21] Road he was thinking about you because
[56:24] he knew knew that out of him had to come
[56:27] a
[56:29] bride so he suffered he let go of his
[56:36] selfishness he let go of his
[56:38] pride for me and you so we can take his
[56:43] footsteps walk only by what he shows
[56:47] us through his word amen amen now listen
[56:51] to what brother Braham says
[56:53] here
[56:57] 1964 and I want I want you to catch uh
[57:00] the vision
[57:01] here the anointed
[57:04] word the word was given it took flesh
[57:09] and then the word had to be
[57:12] Anointed The Same Spirit that was in
[57:14] Christ Jesus if he dwells in
[57:18] US mortal
[57:21] bodies that's what that word does Qui
[57:25] your moral body it takes us from death
[57:29] brings us into
[57:31] life every day every moment not just one
[57:36] time it's a
[57:38] process a
[57:41] masterpiece becomes more
[57:43] beautiful the more you work on it the
[57:46] more detail it has in its
[57:49] character the more he
[57:51] presents the image that was in the mind
[57:53] of God
[57:56] and Jesus Christ was the expressed image
[57:58] of
[57:59] God that came in a spoken word
[58:03] seed that would be perfect a spot with a
[58:08] wrinkle that would be an
[58:11] overcomer and live a perfect
[58:13] life so I can
[58:16] overcome so I can
[58:20] overcome because he's the only way to
[58:23] overcome
[58:27] now listen to
[58:28] this because sometimes people could take
[58:31] things out of
[58:33] context I want you to catch the humility
[58:36] of the
[58:37] prophet and how he tries to keep the
[58:39] balance of what's
[58:43] important my brother
[58:45] Bram could could Jesus look like
[58:48] you or you be
[58:51] Jesus or something like
[58:53] that he said says one sense of the word
[58:55] that's exactly the
[58:58] truth another sense of the
[59:00] word is an
[59:03] antichrist okay so in one sense of the
[59:06] word is
[59:07] true but on the other side of the sense
[59:11] the let's follow
[59:14] this that's the difference between right
[59:17] and
[59:18] wrong to make me the person of the Lord
[59:21] Jesus
[59:23] Christ that would be an
[59:26] antichrist for that person of the Lord
[59:29] Jesus is sitting at the right hand of
[59:32] God of the right hand of the Majesty of
[59:34] on
[59:40] high and will come again in a great
[59:43] power and
[59:46] Glory but for his
[59:50] life that was in him being upon me
[59:57] and upon you who have him it's exactly
[1:00:00] the
[1:00:01] truth you become
[1:00:05] Christ remember my message on
[1:00:09] Messiah says the word Messiah means the
[1:00:13] anointed
[1:00:15] one now there you are if you have the
[1:00:18] Holy
[1:00:19] Spirit you become the anointed
[1:00:22] one amen amen amen amen
[1:00:26] amen now listen to this he keeps
[1:00:29] going then there's all kinds of anointed
[1:00:34] ones now
[1:00:36] watch if a Bible anointed
[1:00:40] one many of them are
[1:00:43] anointed the whole thing is in such a
[1:00:46] great
[1:00:48] conglomeration and every kind of
[1:00:51] mixup and Satan with all his cunningness
[1:00:56] they come in and impersonate
[1:01:00] it justed to the
[1:01:03] dot it says almost to the
[1:01:06] dot there's only one way you can
[1:01:09] absolutely be
[1:01:12] sure so remember this there's also
[1:01:16] impersonators around
[1:01:18] us they're also
[1:01:21] anointed they're anointed
[1:01:25] and so now because they're
[1:01:27] anointed we have to know the true from
[1:01:30] the
[1:01:32] false and how is it that we're going to
[1:01:34] do that now listen to The Prophet it
[1:01:37] says it says there's only one way you
[1:01:39] can absolutely be
[1:01:43] sure word by
[1:01:46] word word by
[1:01:48] word that's the only way you
[1:01:53] can you'll know them by their
[1:01:56] character you'll know them by their
[1:01:59] fruits and it's not just
[1:02:02] words it's not just
[1:02:04] saying it's not just testifying about
[1:02:07] it it's a way of living it's a way of
[1:02:11] life it's a way of how we carry our
[1:02:16] atmosphere now listen to this he says
[1:02:19] that's the only way word by word word by
[1:02:23] word it says say but to me as a
[1:02:26] person William Bram or any other man or
[1:02:31] woman to be the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:02:35] Our that is an
[1:02:37] error but to be Anointed with the
[1:02:40] spirit which brings his own person of
[1:02:43] his life into
[1:02:46] you amen
[1:02:49] amen he says let this life that was in
[1:02:52] Jesus Christ be in you
[1:02:56] this is the life that we carry this is
[1:02:58] the life that was restored into our
[1:03:01] generation the life of Jesus Christ the
[1:03:04] restoration of the Holy
[1:03:06] Ghost not only in spirit not only in the
[1:03:09] Pentecostal
[1:03:11] move I was the
[1:03:14] Pentecostal I'm sorry I was a
[1:03:17] Pentecostal and I grew up around
[1:03:20] Pentecostals and there's things that
[1:03:22] Pentecostal denominated on
[1:03:25] that that remained in the tradition of
[1:03:28] Pentecost but never wanted to move
[1:03:30] forward they received the
[1:03:32] word because what they did is they sold
[1:03:35] out for a
[1:03:37] sensation they sold out for a
[1:03:39] move I wasn't there I was
[1:03:42] involved I knew exactly what was
[1:03:45] happening and there was something inside
[1:03:47] my heart Lord there's something more
[1:03:49] than
[1:03:50] this came to the altar so many
[1:03:53] times
[1:03:55] I come out and I go out
[1:03:57] again something's not
[1:03:59] changing I keep I I'm come to the altar
[1:04:02] every
[1:04:03] service I find myself a sinner every
[1:04:06] service but Lord something's got to
[1:04:08] change me I keep I can't stay in this
[1:04:12] condition any
[1:04:14] longer and then the word
[1:04:16] came and the word changed me without
[1:04:21] sensation all all of a sudden one day
[1:04:25] this let
[1:04:26] go this let go this let go you just lose
[1:04:30] the taste because the more of him and
[1:04:34] the less of you the more you lose
[1:04:39] yourself but how is it that we can do
[1:04:42] that by watching
[1:04:45] television by being on Facebook Facebook
[1:04:48] by being on
[1:04:49] Snapchat by posting
[1:04:52] videos by losing our time
[1:04:56] and then here's God wanting to have a
[1:04:59] relationship with his
[1:05:01] bride we're too
[1:05:05] busy I'm too
[1:05:07] busy I never have that I I never have I
[1:05:10] never make time for the
[1:05:13] Lord I wake up in the morning I'm all
[1:05:15] stressed
[1:05:16] out all I start going to work things go
[1:05:21] wrong my attitudes gets bad all of a
[1:05:24] sudden I come home I'm
[1:05:27] disappointed and I just
[1:05:29] realized that my day didn't start
[1:05:32] right maybe if I would have got
[1:05:35] up and stayed on my knees for a little
[1:05:38] bit and ask the Lord for his Blessing
[1:05:41] and said Lord be with me today anoint me
[1:05:45] today what would you have for me today
[1:05:48] Lord what can I do for you
[1:05:50] today how is it that you can feed me
[1:05:53] today
[1:05:54] this morning this bread of life because
[1:05:57] we have to eat bread every
[1:05:59] day every day we have to
[1:06:03] eat if you don't eat every day let me
[1:06:07] ask you a
[1:06:11] question if we're soldiers in the army
[1:06:14] of God and we're supposed to be with
[1:06:18] faith
[1:06:20] muscles how are we going to overcome a
[1:06:23] battle
[1:06:25] when we're only eating twice a
[1:06:27] week and even then we don't really eat
[1:06:31] because we come for the
[1:06:34] entertainment I would be a skeleton the
[1:06:37] natural right if I will only eat twice a
[1:06:40] week on Wednesdays
[1:06:42] and I wouldn't even be able to I
[1:06:44] wouldn't even have the energy to stand
[1:06:45] up before
[1:06:48] you I wouldn't even be able to I mean if
[1:06:50] if this brother came to me and pushed
[1:06:52] me I would fall
[1:06:56] down so how can we fight in the
[1:06:59] spiritual how is it how is it that I can
[1:07:02] fight in all the battles that come
[1:07:05] across to
[1:07:06] me if I don't have the word if I don't
[1:07:09] have the sword if I don't have the
[1:07:11] shield I don't have the helmet of
[1:07:13] salvation if I don't have if I don't
[1:07:16] have the armor of
[1:07:18] God I I will never
[1:07:21] overcome that's why it's important
[1:07:25] to be
[1:07:26] constantly Fellowship Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ
[1:07:35] 1964 when Jesus was on
[1:07:38] Earth he said he was the word of
[1:07:42] God they condemned him he said why would
[1:07:47] you condemn me when I say I am the Son
[1:07:50] of
[1:07:52] God when you called those who the word
[1:07:55] came to
[1:07:58] God Abraham was considered a
[1:08:01] god Elijah was a god Isaiah was a God
[1:08:06] because the word of God came to
[1:08:09] them and they were in portion it says
[1:08:14] Gods Jesus said they
[1:08:16] were he said you call them
[1:08:20] Gods now you see when the man was was
[1:08:24] anointed like Joseph he portrayed
[1:08:29] Christ Moses was anointed he portrayed
[1:08:33] Christ when David was anointed he
[1:08:36] portrayed Christ all leading up to
[1:08:40] Christ and he was the fullness of the
[1:08:43] [Applause]
[1:08:44] word and the Word was made manifest in
[1:08:48] him and he was the complete anointed
[1:08:52] one they had it in
[1:08:55] portions we have it by
[1:08:58] portion he was the anointed one the
[1:09:02] entire plan of God laid in
[1:09:07] him so when the son was the entire plan
[1:09:12] of
[1:09:13] God Amen the fullness of the
[1:09:18] word it says God's plan before the
[1:09:21] foundation of the
[1:09:22] world to redeem a lost world it say was
[1:09:26] in him he was the word he still the word
[1:09:31] the same yesterday today and forever it
[1:09:34] says remember he came to the fathers for
[1:09:37] the
[1:09:39] prophets he made himself known through
[1:09:41] the
[1:09:42] prophets and in the last day through his
[1:09:47] son
[1:09:48] Jesus he was God made
[1:09:52] manifest
[1:09:54] am amen amen he was God's made
[1:10:02] promise and it was
[1:10:05] manifested not partial the fullness of
[1:10:09] the God had bodily in his
[1:10:16] son when he was on the cross he said it
[1:10:20] is finished and it truly was because he
[1:10:24] conquered the greatest thing that ever
[1:10:26] took
[1:10:27] place and that was
[1:10:31] death and death by
[1:10:34] Revelation to the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:10:38] is
[1:10:39] life amen that's right but it takes
[1:10:42] Revelation to see that
[1:10:45] life you can't intellectually try to
[1:10:47] produce the life without
[1:10:51] dying
[1:10:52] death
[1:10:54] let's turn to First
[1:10:59] John verses 18 to
[1:11:05] 24 the anointed
[1:11:08] word there was a son that was
[1:11:11] given by a
[1:11:14] promise the promise
[1:11:16] came
[1:11:18] testified it was
[1:11:22] anointed and now he dwells Among Us is
[1:11:25] in
[1:11:27] us so listen to what John says here in
[1:11:30] first
[1:11:34] John my little
[1:11:37] children let us not love in
[1:11:40] word neither in
[1:11:42] tongue but indeed and in
[1:11:46] truth so first John 3:
[1:11:52] 18
[1:11:55] and hereby we know that we are of the
[1:11:59] truth and shall assure our hearts before
[1:12:04] him now listen to this for if our hearts
[1:12:08] condemn
[1:12:09] us God is greater than our
[1:12:12] heart know all
[1:12:15] things
[1:12:17] beloved if our heart condemn us
[1:12:20] not then we have confidence towards God
[1:12:27] so if the heart condemn
[1:12:30] us then God is greater than our heart
[1:12:34] and he knowth all
[1:12:36] things but the beginning of Life comes
[1:12:39] with
[1:12:41] repentance the beginning of Life comes
[1:12:43] with
[1:12:44] death so yes we make
[1:12:47] mistakes and God is greater than our
[1:12:51] mistakes and he forgives our mist
[1:12:53] mistakes and we learn from our
[1:12:56] mistakes but don't do it
[1:12:59] again you know a mistake cannot be a
[1:13:03] mistake if you do it over and over and
[1:13:05] over sorry at that point it's it's no
[1:13:08] longer used by a
[1:13:10] mistake a mistake is when you do
[1:13:13] something and and you find yourself as
[1:13:16] as doing it without even realizing
[1:13:18] you're doing it and then God comes and
[1:13:21] condemns you and then you repent and you
[1:13:25] leave those things
[1:13:26] behind but when you keep doing the same
[1:13:29] thing over and
[1:13:30] over that's called
[1:13:33] iniquity
[1:13:35] amen so if your heart condemns
[1:13:38] you God is greater than your
[1:13:42] heart and he knows all things so
[1:13:45] therefore by
[1:13:46] repentance by by dying to
[1:13:50] ourselves God could God could give us
[1:13:52] the confidence
[1:13:55] but if our heart condemn us
[1:13:57] not if our life is lined with the word
[1:13:59] of
[1:14:00] God God is the center of my
[1:14:03] life if now I pray if now I eat if now I
[1:14:08] grow now we can have
[1:14:11] confidence now you can have
[1:14:14] confidence just like I could have
[1:14:16] confidence in my
[1:14:17] wife knowing that she would make the
[1:14:19] right choice I trust
[1:14:22] her she trusts me she knows that if I
[1:14:26] was to go across the
[1:14:28] sea that I wouldn't do something that
[1:14:30] would hurt
[1:14:31] her that I wouldn't be disobedient to
[1:14:35] her that I would keep to my veil all the
[1:14:37] days of my
[1:14:39] life I wouldn't go live against
[1:14:41] her and she would know that and she
[1:14:44] would know
[1:14:46] me that's the point of relationship the
[1:14:50] confidence the more that God can trust
[1:14:53] you with his
[1:14:54] word the more you can put your
[1:14:56] confidence in him and he comes upon the
[1:14:59] scene for you every
[1:15:02] time because his word is
[1:15:05] Everlasting Saints the word of God never
[1:15:09] changes people change things change
[1:15:13] atmosphere is
[1:15:14] changing God never
[1:15:19] changes his word never
[1:15:22] changes it's the same
[1:15:25] word it's the same word and this is how
[1:15:28] we walk by the word of
[1:15:31] God amen
[1:15:34] amen and this is his
[1:15:38] commandment
[1:15:40] 23 let's go 22 and whatsoever we
[1:15:45] ask we receive of him because we keep
[1:15:50] his
[1:15:51] Commandments and do those things that
[1:15:53] are pleasing in his
[1:15:57] sight and this is his
[1:15:59] Commandment that we should believe on
[1:16:02] the name of his son Jesus
[1:16:05] Christ and love one
[1:16:08] another as he gave us
[1:16:11] Commandments and he that keepeth his
[1:16:14] Commandments dwelleth in
[1:16:16] him and he in him you see the
[1:16:21] relationship the Union
[1:16:23] between the bride and the
[1:16:26] groom amen you respect him you reverence
[1:16:30] him your reverence is you he comes upon
[1:16:33] the Saints he brings your deliverance he
[1:16:36] brings your healing he brings all that
[1:16:38] you have need of all you got to do is
[1:16:40] seek the kingdom of
[1:16:42] God but how can you have
[1:16:44] confidence if you don't have a
[1:16:47] relationship amen amen it's all into the
[1:16:52] relationship
[1:16:53] and hereby we know that he abided in
[1:16:58] Us by the spirit which he had given
[1:17:04] us the spirit of
[1:17:06] Truth amen Amen brother Bram says this
[1:17:09] in the
[1:17:12] token it says now it says now you are
[1:17:16] his because he is we have the right to
[1:17:20] all that he had purchased for us
[1:17:25] the word of God it says every promise in
[1:17:28] the Bible is
[1:17:33] yours it belongs to
[1:17:36] you when this token is upon you and God
[1:17:39] has sealed
[1:17:42] you now it says we want to check oursel
[1:17:44] just for a
[1:17:47] moment when God has give you the true
[1:17:50] baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:53] then the life of Jesus Christ is within
[1:17:57] you now that's true and every theolog
[1:18:01] will have to admit that to
[1:18:03] be yes sir it's a new birth you are born
[1:18:07] a
[1:18:09] new of the Holy Ghost and because that
[1:18:13] God had did
[1:18:14] this and you know you're no good in
[1:18:18] yourself and you accept what God has did
[1:18:23] then he seals you into his
[1:18:26] kingdom by the Holy
[1:18:28] Spirit and everything that Jesus
[1:18:32] purchased and promised
[1:18:35] you in the Bible is
[1:18:38] yours it's your property because it's
[1:18:41] paid
[1:18:44] for it says amen amen life is mine he
[1:18:48] paid for it life is yours he paid for it
[1:18:52] healing is mine he paid for it healing
[1:18:56] is yours he paid for it freedom is mine
[1:19:00] he paid for it Heaven is mine he paid
[1:19:04] for it he paid the price everything he
[1:19:08] purchase belongs to the man that holds
[1:19:11] the
[1:19:15] token he holds the
[1:19:17] token it says pass my
[1:19:20] token upon the street car
[1:19:23] on that Judgment Day it says on that day
[1:19:26] of the
[1:19:27] Judgment it says I'll come pass over you
[1:19:31] it says holding it in holding your
[1:19:33] confession in that word that Jesus
[1:19:36] Christ has died for
[1:19:38] you and when he does it he displays
[1:19:41] himself through
[1:19:43] you it says yes when you recognize the
[1:19:48] token the life that it took for the
[1:19:50] blood to speak
[1:19:55] it's the blood that spoke for
[1:20:00] Abel out of the ground the blood was
[1:20:03] speaking out of that
[1:20:07] son it's the blood that was shed upon
[1:20:10] this
[1:20:11] world that by the power of the Holy
[1:20:14] Ghost when a cleanse the born against
[1:20:20] believer now could could could could ask
[1:20:23] anything in go in in the name of Jesus
[1:20:26] Christ it's no longer the man that's
[1:20:29] speaking but it's the blood that's
[1:20:32] interceding and is speaking for you so
[1:20:35] what do you have need of
[1:20:38] today what do you have need of today
[1:20:42] apply the token the anointed
[1:20:46] word how are you approaching the word
[1:20:49] how is your reverence to the
[1:20:51] word time are you giving to yourself to
[1:20:54] the
[1:20:57] word amen amen our life should be a
[1:21:03] worship the service is not where we you
[1:21:06] know a lot of time in the church
[1:21:10] service we consider the worship
[1:21:14] service the song
[1:21:16] service but
[1:21:17] Worship Is A Life That's pleasing to God
[1:21:24] I can worship in my
[1:21:26] car I can worship in my
[1:21:28] bedroom I can worship at my
[1:21:31] job I can worship while I'm
[1:21:34] driving I can think about the Lord while
[1:21:36] I'm
[1:21:37] eating I can talk to the I can talk to
[1:21:39] the Lord anytime I
[1:21:40] want this is the
[1:21:43] relationship this is the
[1:21:45] worship when you start dying out to
[1:21:49] yourself and you continually introduce
[1:21:53] the word of
[1:21:54] God amen amen this is him the
[1:21:58] word amen amen the anointed
[1:22:05] word so
[1:22:08] Christmas brought a
[1:22:10] son there was
[1:22:13] gifts that was brought to him he was the
[1:22:17] life of
[1:22:18] God 100% man says 100% God God the
[1:22:24] fullness of the godhead
[1:22:26] bottle he died he
[1:22:30] resurrected he restor he He restored
[1:22:33] himself a
[1:22:35] bride we received the Malachi 45
[1:22:38] Ministry re the Revelation 107
[1:22:43] Ministry and now the word is
[1:22:45] continuing now the word is continuing to
[1:22:48] do what to redeem the bride to get her
[1:22:52] to the position that she needs to
[1:22:54] have amen amen because we have to go
[1:22:57] into a
[1:22:59] rapture we have to go to a body
[1:23:01] change that's the promise for this day
[1:23:04] this is the scripture that we're looking
[1:23:06] forward
[1:23:07] to because there's a bride that's going
[1:23:10] to be caught
[1:23:11] away and she'll be without spot she'll
[1:23:15] be without wrinkle she'll be word of his
[1:23:17] word she be flesh of his flesh should be
[1:23:20] the very identity of who he is she's not
[1:23:23] going to be any different the only
[1:23:25] difference is going to be this Corporal
[1:23:27] body but it's the same exact
[1:23:33] spirit it's the same Spirit that's why
[1:23:37] it has nothing to do with the
[1:23:39] flesh the flesh will never receive
[1:23:42] Glory because God does not share his
[1:23:44] glory with no
[1:23:47] man but when we recognize what he
[1:23:50] does he receives our worship
[1:23:54] so the word of
[1:23:56] God let's turn to Revelations
[1:24:04] 19 we're just going to go through the
[1:24:09] scripture brother Brandon brings some
[1:24:11] beautiful things out of
[1:24:13] this and he ties this brother BR ties
[1:24:17] Revelations
[1:24:21] 19 Isaiah
[1:24:24] 9 he takes Isaiah
[1:24:26] 9 unto us his son is
[1:24:29] born a child is
[1:24:32] given okay his name shall be
[1:24:34] counselor of Peace wonderful Mighty
[1:24:38] God Everlasting father and he ties this
[1:24:42] with Revelations
[1:24:44] 19 so let's see what Revelation 19 tells
[1:24:50] us the anointed word
[1:24:54] and after these things I heard a great
[1:24:56] voice of much people in heaven say
[1:25:01] saying hallelujah Hallelujah Salvation
[1:25:05] and Glory and Honor and power unto the
[1:25:09] Lord Our
[1:25:10] God for the true and righteous are his
[1:25:16] judgments for he had judged the great
[1:25:21] which did corrupt the Earth with
[1:25:24] her
[1:25:27] fornication and had Avenged the blood of
[1:25:30] his servants at her
[1:25:35] hand and they said
[1:25:37] again Allelujah Hallelujah and her smoke
[1:25:40] rose up forever and
[1:25:43] ever so you realize what the great harot
[1:25:45] did
[1:25:47] here she created the
[1:25:51] fornication okay okay and she Avenged
[1:25:53] the blood of his servants at her hand
[1:25:57] she was so
[1:25:59] deceiving that she was able to to to
[1:26:02] avenge the blood of his
[1:26:05] servants and listen to
[1:26:07] four and the four and 20
[1:26:10] elders and the four beasts fell down and
[1:26:14] worshiped God at his throne on his
[1:26:19] throne saying amen Allelujah and a voice
[1:26:23] came out of the throne
[1:26:25] saying praise our God all his
[1:26:29] servants and ye that fear
[1:26:32] Him both small and
[1:26:35] great you see how important it is the
[1:26:38] fear of God the rence of the word of
[1:26:41] God how we handle the word of
[1:26:45] God how we handle the word of God in our
[1:26:50] midst and I heard as it was the voice of
[1:26:53] a great
[1:26:55] multitude and as the voice of many
[1:26:58] water and as the voice of Mighty
[1:27:02] thundering saying hallelujah hallelujah
[1:27:05] for the Lord God omnipotent

[1:32:04] mystery the

[1:32:13] word by his original
[1:32:17] headship
[1:32:20] amen by his original
[1:32:25] headship now listen to this verse
[1:32:28] eight and to her was granted that she
[1:32:31] would be a raid and fine
[1:32:34] linen clean and
[1:32:36] white for the linen is the righteousness
[1:32:40] of the
[1:32:45] Saints light has to shine in
[1:32:49] darkness there's no doubt about it
[1:32:52] this whole room could be
[1:32:55] dark pitch
[1:32:57] black you turn on the smallest
[1:33:01] light you can
[1:33:03] see you can see where you're going all
[1:33:07] you have to do is choose to turn on the
[1:33:11] light amen amen choose
[1:33:15] light the Bible says if I walk in the
[1:33:19] light as he is in the light we can have
[1:33:23] Fellowship one with
[1:33:26] another how can we have
[1:33:28] Fellowship by constantly sharing the
[1:33:32] light and the blood of Jesus
[1:33:35] Christ cleanses us from all
[1:33:37] unbelief because we're constantly
[1:33:39] applying the
[1:33:40] token constantly applying the word con
[1:33:45] washing we're constantly cleansing we
[1:33:48] we're constantly dressing we we're
[1:33:50] constantly dying
[1:33:52] and all of a sudden you're walking with
[1:33:54] the
[1:33:54] Lord and the things of the world just
[1:33:56] start fading
[1:33:57] away you start walking like Enoch
[1:34:01] did before you know you wake up and
[1:34:03] you're in
[1:34:05] heaven because it didn't matter if you
[1:34:08] died because you're going to resurrect
[1:34:13] anyway it's the
[1:34:15] spirit that was in Christ Jesus if that
[1:34:18] Spirit dwells in you it'll Quicken your
[1:34:27] bodies proving his
[1:34:31] word now we say he's raised from the
[1:34:35] dead I didn't say it the word here said
[1:34:40] it raised from the
[1:34:42] dead
[1:34:47] paragraph he said he's the same
[1:34:49] yesterday today and forever
[1:34:53] you believe that he promised these
[1:34:55] things would happen in the last
[1:34:58] days the same son of man would be made
[1:35:03] manifest now remember that was not Jesus
[1:35:07] talking to Abraham
[1:35:10] there that could discern the thoughts in
[1:35:12] Sarah's mind
[1:35:15] behind he says that was not Jesus he had
[1:35:19] not yet been
[1:35:20] born but it was a man in human
[1:35:24] flesh that Abraham called
[1:35:27] Elohim the great
[1:35:30] Almighty
[1:35:31] showing and Jesus
[1:35:35] said as it was in the days of
[1:35:38] s now watch
[1:35:43] close in the days of
[1:35:46] Sodom so will it be at the coming of the
[1:35:49] son of man when the son of man is being
[1:35:54] revealed not no more as a
[1:35:57] church not no more the bride is
[1:36:01] called see in that day the son of man
[1:36:05] will be
[1:36:06] revealed to join the church to the
[1:36:10] head to unite the marriage of the Bride
[1:36:15] the bride goom call will come right
[1:36:17] through
[1:36:18] this when the son of man will come
[1:36:22] down and come in human flesh to unite
[1:36:26] the two
[1:36:27] together amen amen the church has to be
[1:36:31] the
[1:36:32] word he is the word and the two unites
[1:36:36] together and to do that it will take the
[1:36:39] manifestation of the revealing of the
[1:36:41] son of
[1:36:42] man not a CL
[1:36:45] man those are Creeds and
[1:36:48] doctrines
[1:36:49] it's Amen the life of Jesus
[1:36:54] Christ it says do you see what I mean
[1:36:57] it's the son of man Jesus Christ will
[1:37:01] come down in human flesh Among
[1:37:03] Us and will make his words so
[1:37:07] real that it'll unite the church and him
[1:37:10] as
[1:37:12] one the bride and then she'll go home to
[1:37:16] the wedding
[1:37:19] supper amen amen she is already
[1:37:22] united we go to the wedding supper not
[1:37:25] to the
[1:37:26] marriage then she'll go home to the
[1:37:29] wedding supper
[1:37:31] amen she's already
[1:37:33] united we go to the wedding supper not
[1:37:37] to the
[1:37:40] marriage it says fill your
[1:37:44] flesh fill your
[1:37:48] flesh cuz the marriage of the Lamb has
[1:37:50] come
[1:37:56] it says but the Rapture is going to the
[1:37:58] wedding
[1:38:02] supper when the word here unites the
[1:38:05] person and they become
[1:38:08] one and then what does it do it
[1:38:11] manifests the son of man
[1:38:13] again not the church
[1:38:16] Theologian the son of man and the word
[1:38:19] and the church becomes one
[1:38:23] whatsoever the son of man
[1:38:25] done he was the word the church does the
[1:38:29] same
[1:38:32] thing she had made herself
[1:38:37] ready there was a preparation in the
[1:38:39] word of
[1:38:41] God God was wanting to show
[1:38:45] her the lovely
[1:38:47] secrets that no man could understand but
[1:38:50] him he himself can reveal to
[1:38:55] her a lot of people claim to know Jesus
[1:38:58] Christ a lot of people can talk to you
[1:39:01] about Jesus
[1:39:04] Christ but who is Jesus Christ to
[1:39:08] you what does he mean to
[1:39:13] you amen
[1:39:17] amen verse 9 Revelations
[1:39:20] 19
[1:39:22] and he said unto
[1:39:24] me
[1:39:26] write blessed are they which are called
[1:39:29] unto the marriage supper of the
[1:39:33] lamb and he said unto me these are the
[1:39:37] true sayings of
[1:39:40] God so everything that God says is
[1:39:45] true everything that God says is
[1:39:48] true that's how you'll know them
[1:39:50] remember we read I quot
[1:39:52] earlier is by the word word of word by
[1:39:56] word because the word could only Testify
[1:40:00] the
[1:40:01] word a word will not testify of anything
[1:40:04] else of what the word is it say about
[1:40:07] the
[1:40:08] word
[1:40:10] amen and I fell at his feet to worship
[1:40:13] him look at
[1:40:15] 10 and he said unto me see do thou do it
[1:40:20] not
[1:40:22] now look at the humility here John is a
[1:40:25] type of the
[1:40:26] bride and here he is one the bow down to
[1:40:29] the
[1:40:31] angel and he says don't do it I am thy
[1:40:35] fellow
[1:40:37] servant and I it says and of thy
[1:40:39] Brethren that have the testimony of
[1:40:43] Jesus worship
[1:40:47] God now listen to this for the the
[1:40:51] testimony of Jesus is the spirit of
[1:40:57] Prophecy who is Jesus Christ to
[1:41:02] you the for the testimony of
[1:41:05] Jesus is a spirit of test is a spirit of
[1:41:10] Prophecy you know when the Lord called
[1:41:12] me to the
[1:41:13] message just a quick
[1:41:17] testimony I grew up in the Pentecostal
[1:41:19] Church my whole life
[1:41:22] I served since I was eight years old I
[1:41:25] used to travel with my father and go
[1:41:28] from church to church sing and sing and
[1:41:32] sing and play instruments the Lord had
[1:41:34] gifted me to play an
[1:41:36] instrument so since I was eight years
[1:41:38] old I was traveling with my
[1:41:41] father and I would miss
[1:41:43] school and just you know just what
[1:41:46] happens and 20 years I spent my life in
[1:41:51] the Pentecostal
[1:41:56] culture and the Lord came and spoke to
[1:41:59] me
[1:42:00] personally and he said you've been a
[1:42:02] religious person for 20
[1:42:05] years but if you were to testify who
[1:42:08] Jesus Christ to you
[1:42:10] is you would have no you would have no
[1:42:13] words you wouldn't be able to testify
[1:42:15] who this person
[1:42:17] is and I said Lord that's true
[1:42:24] I may claim that I may know Jesus
[1:42:28] Christ a lot of people claim to know
[1:42:33] him but it's so different when he
[1:42:35] reveals himself and he gets to know
[1:42:41] you because it's that
[1:42:44] privilege that he gets to love
[1:42:48] us the only way I exist
[1:42:51] is because there was a love that was
[1:42:53] shed for me
[1:42:56] first and the only way I can recognize
[1:42:59] that accepting that love of
[1:43:03] God so now by the restoration of the
[1:43:07] word now it's being restored back pure
[1:43:09] and clearcut to
[1:43:11] us to receive that true
[1:43:14] word is the spirit of
[1:43:17] Prophecy Jesus Christ
[1:43:19] himself what are you feeding
[1:43:22] on what are you
[1:43:26] eating look at 11 and I saw heaven
[1:43:30] open and behold the White
[1:43:33] Horse and he that sat upon him was
[1:43:36] called faithful and
[1:43:40] true faithful and
[1:43:44] true and in righteousness that he judge
[1:43:47] and make
[1:43:49] war he eyes were as a flame of
[1:43:52] fire and his head were many
[1:43:55] crowns he had a name
[1:43:58] written that no man
[1:44:01] knew no man knew this
[1:44:04] name a lot of people like to point to a
[1:44:07] man no man knew this
[1:44:10] name but he
[1:44:13] himself and he was clothed with the
[1:44:16] vesture dipped in
[1:44:18] Blood and his name is called the word of
[1:44:25] God now remember Isaiah 9 was talking
[1:44:29] about a
[1:44:31] war and how with every remember it says
[1:44:33] with every word there's
[1:44:36] confusion how how their garments were
[1:44:38] dipped in
[1:44:40] Blood and it was only it was only by
[1:44:43] that blood that they were able to be
[1:44:46] redeemed follow this it says and his
[1:44:49] name is called the word of

[1:45:26] the
[1:45:27] nations and he shall rule them with a
[1:45:29] rod of
[1:45:31] iron and he trended the white press of
[1:45:34] the fearness of the of the wrath of
[1:45:36] almighty
[1:45:39] God and he had on his vesture and on his
[1:45:43] tie a name
[1:45:46] written king of kings and Lord of
[1:45:49] lords
[1:45:51] and I saw an angel standing in the
[1:45:53] Sun and he cried with a loud
[1:45:56] voice saying to all the flows to the
[1:46:00] fowls that fly in the midst of
[1:46:04] Heaven Come and gather yourself together
[1:46:08] unto the supper of the great
[1:46:13] God the angel standing in the
[1:46:17] sun crying with a loud voice
[1:46:21] to all these
[1:46:23] Eagles that are soaring in Heavenly
[1:46:25] places in Christ
[1:46:28] Jesus calling them Gathering them mother

[1:47:30] horses and to and of them that sit upon
[1:47:33] them and the Flesh of all men both free
[1:47:37] and born small and
[1:47:40] great and I saw the Beast and the great
[1:47:44] Kings of the earth and their
[1:47:48] armies gathered together to make war
[1:47:51] against
[1:47:54] him that sat on the horse and against
[1:47:58] his
[1:48:03] army you realize what's happening
[1:48:06] S as as as Jesus Christ is having an
[1:48:09] invisible
[1:48:12] Union there's another Army that's rising
[1:48:15] up that wants to it wants to
[1:48:19] annihilate to destroy the very Army of
[1:48:22] the Living
[1:48:23] God but we know that she won't be
[1:48:26] deceived because she has the word of God
[1:48:30] and she has the faithful and true
[1:48:31] sayings of
[1:48:32] God and it's the only way that she'll be
[1:48:35] able to make it to that wedding
[1:48:37] supper is by the continuation of the
[1:48:40] word worshiping
[1:48:43] God worshiping god king of kings the
[1:48:46] Lord of Lord It's the transition to the
[1:48:49] millennium
[1:48:53] amen
[1:48:55] amen and the Beast was
[1:48:59] taken and with him the false prophet
[1:49:02] that wrought Miracles before him now
[1:49:05] watch the
[1:49:07] Saints which he deceived
[1:49:10] them that had received the mark of the
[1:49:15] beast and them that worshiped His
[1:49:19] image
[1:49:20] see the mark of the beast has an
[1:49:24] image and if if we don't if we're not
[1:49:27] careful in the proper way of our
[1:49:30] thinking we be deceived and receive that
[1:49:35] image but remember Jesus Christ was the
[1:49:39] image of
[1:49:43] God it's the only way there's only one
[1:49:46] mediator between God and man and Jesus
[1:49:50] right the son of
[1:49:52] man amen
[1:49:55] amen and to it says to them that
[1:49:57] worshiped His
[1:50:00] Image these gold were cast alive into
[1:50:03] the Lake of Fire Burning with
[1:50:07] Brimstone and the remnant were slain By
[1:50:10] The Sword of him that set upon the
[1:50:14] horse sword proceeded out of his
[1:50:19] mouth
[1:50:21] and all the fowls were filled with their
[1:50:26] flesh now look at what brother bam says
[1:50:29] here says now in Revelations
[1:50:32] 19 not only is he getting ready but
[1:50:36] Christ is getting ready to meet
[1:50:39] him catch this real
[1:50:41] carefully it says the battle is going to
[1:50:44] be hot and
[1:50:47] heavy Christ and revelation
[1:50:51] 19 Gathering
[1:50:53] his it says not it says not from all
[1:50:57] from the four corners of the
[1:50:59] Earth because they're going to be a
[1:51:01] little bitty
[1:51:04] Remnant what's he doing he's Gathering
[1:51:08] them from the four corners of
[1:51:11] Heaven he says we'll get to them Souls
[1:51:14] under the altar tomorrow
[1:51:16] night see whether it's right or not four
[1:51:20] corners of Heaven on a Snow White
[1:51:25] Horse he also has a name not death but
[1:51:30] the Word of Life the word of
[1:51:33] God life it says God I write down on his
[1:51:36] thigh
[1:51:37] here the word of God that's the only
[1:51:41] life because God is the only source of
[1:51:44] eternal
[1:51:48] life
[1:51:51] a
[1:51:52] zo
[1:51:55] life he's got
[1:51:57] life riding on a white
[1:52:00] horse and here's a man with three
[1:52:03] different
[1:52:06] powers Called Death the mark of the
[1:52:09] beast watch this Gathering his
[1:52:12] Earthbound
[1:52:15] delegates and Christ is gathering his
[1:52:17] heaven born subjects
[1:52:21] he God death wrote on him Christ is God
[1:52:25] life wrote on
[1:52:27] him these with him on white horses
[1:52:31] also called the before the foundation of
[1:52:35] the
[1:52:36] world Amen Hallelujah that makes me
[1:52:40] happy and they are faithful to the
[1:52:43] word I like that it is called chosen
[1:52:48] before the foundation of the world
[1:52:51] the faithful of the word by
[1:52:54] choosing all
[1:52:56] stimulated new wine and oil just riding
[1:53:01] Right
[1:53:02] Along coming down to meet
[1:53:05] him they know the Thunders will issue
[1:53:08] the thing pretty for
[1:53:12] soon now watch what he
[1:53:14] does so if he is the word and his name
[1:53:18] is the word word is
[1:53:21] life the
[1:53:23] Antichrist anything it says anything
[1:53:27] anti is
[1:53:29] against so anti is against
[1:53:33] Christ the word so it's got to be a
[1:53:36] Creed or
[1:53:38] denomination that is against the word of
[1:53:42] God that's why they're trying to take
[1:53:46] you away from the Life of
[1:53:48] Christ
[1:53:50] it's the only source of
[1:53:53] life it's the only source of true life
[1:53:58] was because of that life that
[1:54:00] came the one that was born out of a
[1:54:03] virgin the one that was without spot or
[1:54:05] wrinkle and because of that blood now we
[1:54:09] have the same opportunity to called the
[1:54:11] word of
[1:54:12] God because we're part of his we're part
[1:54:15] of
[1:54:17] himself so anything outside of the word
[1:54:19] of
[1:54:20] God is
[1:54:25] anti and you will be
[1:54:27] deceived and you'll catch the mark of
[1:54:29] the
[1:54:31] beast now watch what brother B says here
[1:54:35] 1964 the Feast of the
[1:54:38] trumpets
[1:54:40] notice while that group is
[1:54:44] writing making themselves ready to stomp
[1:54:47] out everything that won't agree with
[1:54:49] them
[1:54:53] this is beautiful
[1:54:54] listen there's another group being made
[1:54:58] ready after a
[1:55:00] while says Revelations
[1:55:03] 19 the next time the church is
[1:55:08] heard she comes also not upon exactly
[1:55:13] horses but the Bible said he was on a
[1:55:16] horse on a white
[1:55:18] horse the host of heaven was following
[1:55:21] him upon white
[1:55:24] horses says that's right while this
[1:55:27] group down here has got 2,000 years
[1:55:30] bound at the river
[1:55:37] Euphrates and has been bound for 2,000
[1:55:42] years also that church has bound the
[1:55:46] Holy
[1:55:48] Ghost for nearly 2,000
[1:55:51] years under Mar
[1:55:55] martyrum uh back there under the church
[1:55:59] ages has been
[1:56:01] bound not at the river
[1:56:04] Euphrates but at the doors of Creeds and
[1:56:09] dogmas that the Holy Spirit can't work
[1:56:12] in the
[1:56:14] church because of a man-made
[1:56:17] system but she's going to be
[1:56:20] liberated she's coming back that's what
[1:56:23] the Bible
[1:56:24] says and two and it says when those two
[1:56:27] meet one
[1:56:32] another verse 8 paragraph
[1:56:35] 83 it says uh and those two meet one
[1:56:39] another on the
[1:56:41] Battlegrounds Lucifer and
[1:56:44] Michael again like in the beginning so
[1:56:47] remember the spirit's always been there
[1:56:50] the spirit of antichrist was always
[1:56:52] there to find the
[1:56:54] Christ like that from the beginning
[1:56:56] that's what Lucifer
[1:56:59] did he was anti the word he didn't want
[1:57:02] to Humble himself to the word he didn't
[1:57:05] want to listen to what the word
[1:57:07] said cast
[1:57:12] down it was always a battle from the
[1:57:16] beginning and let me tell you who won in
[1:57:18] the beginning
[1:57:20] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah
[1:57:22] hallelujah who won in the beginning it
[1:57:24] was God's
[1:57:25] Army the battles already won my all we
[1:57:29] have to do is be obedient to the word of
[1:57:31] God and walk into the footsteps that
[1:57:34] have been predestinated for us to walk
[1:57:36] into and catch the life of this
[1:57:41] hour amen he's the I am he's
[1:57:47] omnes if we can recognize him in our our
[1:57:51] mid they've been bound for 2,000 years
[1:57:55] almost almost 2,000 years it says not
[1:57:59] exactly
[1:58:00] 2000 because the Romans kept going
[1:58:03] on it says the that Titus in ad
[1:58:07] 96 and on down like that to kill the
[1:58:11] Jews the
[1:58:12] Romans he says who was it that killed
[1:58:14] the
[1:58:15] Jews who was Titus a Roman general and
[1:58:19] the blood rolled out of the gates down
[1:58:23] there slaughtered and women and children
[1:58:25] and
[1:58:27] everything didn't Ezekiel n say that
[1:58:30] they'll
[1:58:32] do go through the midst of the city and
[1:58:34] set a mark upon the
[1:58:38] people C the Holy Spirit and the rest of
[1:58:42] them the
[1:58:44] slaughtering come forth that that would
[1:58:47] have been bound to try to hold them hold
[1:58:51] them until they went forth and
[1:58:53] slaughtered everything that was in
[1:58:56] there Little Women children babies and
[1:58:59] everything
[1:59:00] else and they were all Slaughters now
[1:59:03] watch
[1:59:04] this
[1:59:05] exactly here it is again repeating
[1:59:09] itself and here is that ecclesiastical
[1:59:12] system coming right
[1:59:16] back tramping out everything that's
[1:59:18] called
[1:59:21] and they got their
[1:59:22] systems they got their systems
[1:59:25] organization and
[1:59:27] denomination but they have nothing to do
[1:59:29] with what the Bible
[1:59:32] says they'll tell you quick they don't
[1:59:35] even believe in
[1:59:39] it yes sir say what the church
