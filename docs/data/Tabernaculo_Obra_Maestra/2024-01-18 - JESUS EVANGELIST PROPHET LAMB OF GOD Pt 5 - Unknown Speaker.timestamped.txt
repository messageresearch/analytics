[47:49] evil so that we can do
[47:52] good and not evil yeah as we stand to
[47:56] our
[47:57] feet this
[48:01] evening and we will continue in what
[48:03] we've been speaking
[48:05] here part
[48:07] five Jesus
[48:10] evangelist prophet and Lamb of
[48:14] God turn with me to
[48:21] Matthew and we'll be reading first from
[48:25] Matthew
[48:28] a scripture we've gone to
[48:32] often but uh but a scripture that I
[48:36] believe is just as as
[48:41] profound even as as Hebrews 13
[48:46] and8 that Jesus Christ is the same
[48:49] yesterday today and
[48:51] forever so let's read there in Matthew
[48:54] 13
[48:57] and beginning at verse
[49:01] 34 this this was the parable of the
[49:06] sewer and that's what it's
[49:08] called because Jesus in this Parable is
[49:11] speaking a lot about the sewing of
[49:16] seeds but it's really Jesus
[49:20] teaching on the generation of Jesus
[49:24] Christ and a eration of
[49:26] vipers it's really Jesus teaching on two
[49:31] seeds the seed of God and the seed of
[49:34] the
[49:35] serpent but if you take this Parable
[49:38] naturally then you just simply call it
[49:41] the parable of the
[49:44] S it's like if you take Matthew
[49:49] 28:19
[49:51] naturally
[49:53] literally where Jesus said go into
[49:56] baptize in the name of the father and
[49:57] the son of the Holy
[50:00] Spirit if you take it
[50:02] literally you've gone as far as you're
[50:04] going to go with that
[50:06] par you place a period
[50:10] there and if you take Matthew
[50:14] 13 literally you say wow Jesus speaks on
[50:19] on sewing of
[50:21] seeds why that's just ex why why that's
[50:24] a god of nature
[50:27] and you stop there you close your Bible
[50:30] you put it on the
[50:31] shelf and you go do something else for
[50:34] the day but when Revelation
[50:37] strikes it goes beyond the the the
[50:41] literal we really do start reading
[50:44] between the
[50:45] lines that's called
[50:48] Revelation so Matthew
[50:50] 13 verse
[50:53] 34 all these things spake Jesus unto the
[50:56] multitude in
[50:59] Parables and without a
[51:02] parable spoke he
[51:05] not this was his
[51:08] ministry this is the way he would
[51:12] speak and the reason he would speak this
[51:16] way is so that it might be
[51:19] fulfilled which was spoken by the
[51:22] prophet saying I will open my my mouth
[51:25] in
[51:27] Parables I will utter things which have
[51:30] kept been kept secret from the
[51:31] foundation of the
[51:34] world he preached this way he talked
[51:38] this way he walked this way to fulfill
[51:43] the prophecy of the prophets you and I
[51:47] God wants us to talk a certain way he
[51:50] wants us to walk a certain
[51:52] way he wants us to treat each other a
[51:55] certain certain
[51:56] way and when we do we're fulfilling the
[52:01] Prophecies of the prophets that have
[52:03] spok of how a Believer would act what
[52:07] his conduct would
[52:09] be of how a father would act how a
[52:12] husband would should be how a wife
[52:15] should be how the how the children
[52:18] should
[52:19] respond
[52:21] home when you do it God's way you know
[52:24] why you're able to do it because you're
[52:26] being
[52:27] anointed of the Prophecies of the
[52:30] prophets that were
[52:35] spoken verse
[52:38] 35
[52:40] Jesus spoke in
[52:43] multitudes in in Parables and without us
[52:47] Parable sping not unto the
[52:52] multitudes because that it might be
[52:55] fulfilled which was spoken the the
[52:58] prophet saying I will open my mouth in
[53:04] Parables I will utter
[53:06] things in these
[53:08] Parables which have been kept secret
[53:11] from the foundation of the
[53:14] world I'm bringing them now and yet the
[53:18] parable itself is a
[53:20] mystery but now that I'm here I will
[53:24] reveal it to you
[53:26] that's the way I'm going to
[53:28] build this New Testament Church word
[53:32] upon word line upon line Revelation to
[53:36] your hearts and
[53:39] Minds verse
[53:42] 36 then Jesus sent the multitude away
[53:45] and went into the
[53:49] house he's in the
[53:52] house with his disciples it's always
[53:56] been his
[53:58] way and his disciples came unto him

[55:24] simple

[55:36] teaching on
[55:41] Perfection the way back into his
[55:45] presence is what this teaching and
[55:47] Perfection was
[55:50] about in this natural body so that we
[55:54] can find the way
[55:56] to feel his presence to live in his
[55:59] presence Matthew 6 and 7 the teaching un
[56:03] Perfection
[56:05] continues to unfold to
[56:08] Israel he bringing
[56:11] Israel things that have been hidden
[56:14] since the foundation of the world he's
[56:17] telling them things that only the ears
[56:19] of Adam had ever
[56:21] heard but Adam failed to keep that word
[56:25] but my word shall not return to me void
[56:27] it he has
[56:29] said so we're looking for a
[56:32] people for a man looking for a woman
[56:36] will take him at his

[58:10] Quicken that seed
[58:13] within God rich and mercy
[58:17] unfolding a fful Ministry in Matthew
[58:22] 8 Jesus comes down from the
[58:25] mountain he had he had finished saying
[58:29] all that he's going to tell us on
[58:33] Perfection what is

[59:07] beginning and every word of God
[59:10] fulfilled and the Prophecies of the
[59:12] prophets is what eternity will
[59:16] be in Matthew 8 he comes down from the
[59:20] mountain and he continues now back into
[59:23] his ministri andang
[59:27] he heals the
[59:29] leper who had been in these
[59:32] meetings who had been here listening to
[59:34] these
[59:35] teachings who was there when he went up
[59:38] the
[59:39] mountain and he was there when he came
[59:41] down the
[59:42] mountain after the leper had heard
[59:45] everything he
[59:46] heard he said this man if he wants to he
[59:52] can heal me of this leprosy
[59:55] and you know what I'm going to ask him
[59:59] if you've got a need if you got a desire
[1:00:02] if you've got something you want to ask
[1:00:05] him ask him and believe that he can do
[1:00:10] it just like this leper said so the
[1:00:14] leper is
[1:00:15] healed Jesus tells him tell no
[1:00:20] man but go to the
[1:00:22] synagogue go back to church
[1:00:25] offer the gift of that Moses
[1:00:28] commanded it will
[1:00:31] declare to everyone in that
[1:00:34] synagogue the
[1:00:36] testimony you'll be a testimony that
[1:00:39] though you were covered with
[1:00:40] lepry no you were in your last days of
[1:00:44] life no you were living in in in pain
[1:00:47] and
[1:00:48] suffering that God has healed you and
[1:00:52] when they ask you
[1:00:55] you won't be able to hold
[1:00:57] back where did who healed you Jesus of
[1:01:03] Nazareth so the leper goes you remember
[1:01:06] the story you remember the gift that a
[1:01:09] leper was supposed to
[1:01:11] offered been healed he was to take two
[1:01:15] turtle
[1:01:16] doves to the priest and the priest was
[1:01:19] to was to St stand there and take the
[1:01:23] two doves at the altar
[1:01:27] one of those one of those one of those
[1:01:29] turtle doves he would put in a vessel of
[1:01:33] clay and in the vessel of
[1:01:36] clay killed that
[1:01:38] bird it
[1:01:40] represented God in flesh who gave his
[1:01:44] life and died for you and
[1:01:46] us and by the sprinkling of his
[1:01:49] blood wash our sins
[1:01:52] away us takes away the
[1:01:56] complexes the the very
[1:01:59] ritual oh the
[1:02:02] anointing if you knew what you were
[1:02:07] doing the
[1:02:10] anointing on the
[1:02:12] ritual when you know what you're
[1:02:15] doing is a lifechanging
[1:02:21] experience like the Lord's Supper
[1:02:25] and the washing of
[1:02:28] feet when you
[1:02:30] partake if you really know what you're
[1:02:34] doing and what it
[1:02:36] means every time it's a
[1:02:40] sovereign
[1:02:43] lifechanging
[1:02:46] experience because you understand what
[1:02:50] it
[1:02:50] represents and when this leper went
[1:02:55] and gave his
[1:02:57] offering this offering was a
[1:03:01] testimony of what God had
[1:03:05] done for this leper through the blood of
[1:03:09] Christ but he wasn't dead
[1:03:12] yet in the eyes of God the lamb had been
[1:03:16] slain before the foundation of the
[1:03:20] world then the priest would take the
[1:03:23] blood of this dead bird and they take
[1:03:27] the live
[1:03:28] one the Dead one in the vessel of
[1:03:32] clay Jehovah God in flesh who died on
[1:03:37] the cross and Spilled his blood now the
[1:03:40] blood of that of that dead
[1:03:43] bird is sprinkled on the live
[1:03:46] one seven times
[1:03:51] the that represents the believer
[1:03:55] through seven Church
[1:03:56] ages from the days of Jesus our days now
[1:04:01] if you can believe that he's the turtle
[1:04:04] dove that he's God in a vessel of C he
[1:04:09] died Cross of
[1:04:10] C by his blood you are Sanctified by his
[1:04:14] blood you are clean by his blood you are
[1:04:17] saved by his blood you have a victory
[1:04:23] every then you are that
[1:04:26] bird that was
[1:04:28] sprinkled and then they would take that
[1:04:30] bird to an open
[1:04:32] field and they'd set it
[1:04:36] free and the Bible says as it went
[1:04:40] flying with the blood stains all over
[1:04:45] it it was crying holy
[1:04:48] holy unto the Lord God
[1:04:52] Almighty chapter eight
[1:04:54] he continues his
[1:04:56] ministry as an
[1:04:58] evangelist praying for the
[1:05:00] sick a
[1:05:02] Centurian a gentile comes to
[1:05:05] him he had already told he was about to
[1:05:09] set his church in
[1:05:11] order he he was here he he came as king
[1:05:14] of the
[1:05:16] Jews he was also fulfilling the part as
[1:05:19] Lion of the tribe of
[1:05:22] Judah he didn't come to the Gentile
[1:05:25] peoples but this
[1:05:27] Centurion who like the
[1:05:30] leop his ministry had caught the
[1:05:32] attention of this
[1:05:35] Centurion this Centurion had always been
[1:05:38] in
[1:05:41] awe of power and
[1:05:45] authority and when he saw Jesus he said
[1:05:48] I've never seen
[1:05:50] power and authority
[1:05:53] like my servant is
[1:05:56] sick I'm going to go ask
[1:06:00] him I'm going to go ask him to do
[1:06:04] something that I believe he can do
[1:06:08] because he's done it
[1:06:12] before he's healed us he's saved us he's
[1:06:17] put food on the table he's given us jobs
[1:06:20] that we
[1:06:21] needed if he's done it before we can
[1:06:24] always believe you've done it before I
[1:06:28] know you can do it
[1:06:30] again it builds our
[1:06:35] faith and this
[1:06:38] Centurion goes to him and he says my
[1:06:41] servant is sick
[1:06:45] of Jesus said and he's a gentile
[1:06:48] now he says go I'll follow you
[1:06:53] listen oh no no it's I that need to
[1:06:57] follow you not to follow me no no I
[1:07:01] understand how Authority and power
[1:07:04] works I wouldn't dare ever walk in front
[1:07:07] of
[1:07:08] you I wouldn't dare ever tried to lead
[1:07:13] you no
[1:07:15] no you're the powerful one you are the
[1:07:20] authority you're Are the
[1:07:22] Healer the
[1:07:25] you're the one Mighty in battle every
[1:07:27] battle I
[1:07:29] face I follow you but this time you
[1:07:34] don't even have to come just speak the
[1:07:38] word and that's good enough for
[1:07:41] me just speak the
[1:07:43] word I'm a gentile I'm a
[1:07:49] Roman I'm not worthy that you come into
[1:07:52] my house Pagan house I haven't set my
[1:07:56] house in
[1:07:58] order I've got a lot of things in there
[1:08:00] that I wouldn't want you to
[1:08:03] see and yet he had
[1:08:05] Faith he saw the power The
[1:08:09] Authority a
[1:08:11] centurion the Evangelistic
[1:08:14] Ministry
[1:08:17] continues Matthew
[1:08:19] 8 verses 11 and
[1:08:22] 12 is a prophecy of
[1:08:25] Israel how Israel would be
[1:08:28] scattered throughout seven Church
[1:08:31] ages why did Jesus speak it in a
[1:08:34] parable that it might be
[1:08:37] fulfilled what the prophets like Ezekiel
[1:08:41] had spoken of the scattering of
[1:08:44] Israel and how that only a Remnant would
[1:08:48] remain how they would be
[1:08:50] persecuted the world over how they would
[1:08:52] be killed how they would be scattered in
[1:08:55] all the
[1:08:57] world and yet a Remnant would
[1:09:00] remain that's Israel
[1:09:03] today there is a Remnant
[1:09:07] there that's God's people not every
[1:09:11] Jew is God's people not every Israelite
[1:09:15] is God's
[1:09:17] people not every
[1:09:19] Gentile is the generation of Jesus
[1:09:22] Christ but there is a little
[1:09:25] flock God has a people Jew and
[1:09:30] Gentiles he died on the cross of
[1:09:37] Calvary Matthew
[1:09:40] 8 verses 16 to
[1:09:43] 18 the Bible says now great multitudes
[1:09:46] are
[1:09:48] following he's
[1:09:50] God but he's just one man
[1:09:55] in the physical
[1:10:01] one in Matthew
[1:10:04] 826 he
[1:10:07] surprised and he even shocked his
[1:10:13] disciples they were on a
[1:10:15] boat a storm in the sea began to begin
[1:10:18] to
[1:10:20] brew a dangerous one
[1:10:24] one that even them as Sailors became
[1:10:26] scared and
[1:10:30] fearful the Bible says and Jesus
[1:10:35] slept but he wasn't really
[1:10:37] asleep he was
[1:10:40] testing he was proving
[1:10:42] them and he was going to show them his
[1:10:47] power they thought what a great
[1:10:50] man he heals the sick he raises the
[1:10:56] dead but when they were on this
[1:11:00] storm and Jesus rises up in that
[1:11:03] boat and he speaks to the
[1:11:07] storm and the wind and the Sea obey
[1:11:12] him the disciples the Bible says were
[1:11:19] shocked they knew he could
[1:11:22] heal
[1:11:24] they knew he could command men and
[1:11:28] women they knew he could deliver people
[1:11:31] who were possessed with violent
[1:11:36] Devils but they still didn't believe he
[1:11:38] could do everything or
[1:11:43] anything that's why when he spoke to the
[1:11:46] Sea when he spoke to the
[1:11:48] wind and there was an instant
[1:11:52] calm
[1:11:54] shocked they said what manner of man is
[1:11:59] this that even the winds and the SE obey
[1:12:04] him this man was
[1:12:07] God this man was
[1:12:10] Jehovah this man was the creator of
[1:12:12] heavens and
[1:12:14] earth this man was the turtle dove and
[1:12:16] the vessel of
[1:12:19] clay what manner of man is this this was
[1:12:23] the man of Isaiah
[1:12:25] 7 this was the man of Isaiah
[1:12:29] 9 unto us a child is
[1:12:32] given us a son is
[1:12:35] born this was the man of Isaiah
[1:12:38] 53 bringing
[1:12:41] Revelation who has believed our
[1:12:44] report and to
[1:12:46] whom is the revelation of Jesus
[1:12:49] Christ that's what Isaiah 53 was that's
[1:12:53] what Isaiah 53 is it was the opening of
[1:12:57] a new C it was the opening of the first
[1:13:00] SE was the opening of part
[1:13:03] one of a new
[1:13:08] testament
[1:13:10] God rich in
[1:13:13] Mercy and Matthew 9 as you
[1:13:17] remember the Evangelistic Ministry
[1:13:22] continues verses 9
[1:13:24] 1-8 Jesus is
[1:13:27] [Music]
[1:13:29] healing he continues as an
[1:13:37] evangelist let me turn to Matthew
[1:13:52] 9
[1:13:58] Bible says and he entered into a
[1:14:01] ship and passed
[1:14:04] over and came into his own
[1:14:07] City sounds like
[1:14:10] Nazareth and they they brought to him
[1:14:12] sick
[1:14:13] people sick of the
[1:14:18] py a man and when he looked at this sick
[1:14:22] man of the PA
[1:14:26] he said to him
[1:14:28] son be of good
[1:14:30] cheer thy
[1:14:32] sins be forgiven
[1:14:35] thee didn't speak to him
[1:14:37] healing he still had the
[1:14:41] policy but you know what had been washed
[1:14:45] away all his
[1:14:48] sins he was still sick in
[1:14:51] body but you know where he was wasn't
[1:14:53] sick
[1:14:54] anymore in that Soul he
[1:15:03] wasn't and some of the
[1:15:07] scribes said within
[1:15:10] themselves in their hearts
[1:15:13] mind this man
[1:15:16] blasphemeth they'd obviously never been
[1:15:19] in any of his
[1:15:21] meetings they didn't know him all they
[1:15:25] knew about him is what the high priest
[1:15:28] had told them what the denomination had
[1:15:30] told them stay away from this
[1:15:33] man fellowship with this
[1:15:36] man FAL
[1:15:38] Doctrine
[1:15:42] teaching he says and Jesus knowing their
[1:15:48] thoughts now he enters into the
[1:15:50] prophetic
[1:15:52] Ministry a discerner of the thought
[1:15:54] intents of the
[1:15:56] heart and he tells them wherefore think
[1:15:59] ye evil in your
[1:16:04] hearts this
[1:16:06] here this prophetic
[1:16:09] Ministry of Discerning the
[1:16:11] hearts this here where he said to this
[1:16:14] man sick of the
[1:16:17] py son be of good
[1:16:21] cheer thy sins be for for given
[1:16:24] Thee I I used to think and I've said
[1:16:28] it that I believed that Jesus began his
[1:16:33] ministry as Lamb of
[1:16:35] God when he entered
[1:16:38] Gethsemane I keep reading and looking
[1:16:40] into the
[1:16:43] scriptures I believe he entered into his
[1:16:45] lamb Ministry before
[1:16:50] that I I believe here in chapter n
[1:16:55] Jesus was
[1:16:57] transitioning Jesus was going from King
[1:16:59] of the
[1:17:00] Jews to Lamb of God because what did he
[1:17:05] do he
[1:17:06] declared thy sins be forgiven
[1:17:10] thee who can forgive sins but
[1:17:14] God who will shed his blood but the
[1:17:17] lamb who can do that but Jesus
[1:17:21] Christ the lamb
[1:17:23] Ministry so here it is
[1:17:27] evangelist Prophet King of the Jews now
[1:17:30] he's
[1:17:32] moving as Lamb of God is entering into
[1:17:36] the lamb
[1:17:38] Ministry all these Ministries in this
[1:17:40] life they're starting to
[1:17:43] overlap and as he had has
[1:17:46] need it steps into one it steps into
[1:17:50] another today is evangelist
[1:17:53] tomorrow he's Prophet now he's Lamb of
[1:17:56] God all the time he's moving
[1:17:59] around according to the particular
[1:18:03] need the person he's speaking to he'll
[1:18:07] be to you what you need him to
[1:18:11] be because he is all of
[1:18:15] it the Great I
[1:18:21] Am and Jesus knowing their
[1:18:25] thoughts wherefore think he evil in your
[1:18:29] hearts then he asked them a
[1:18:32] question what's easier to
[1:18:36] say in your
[1:18:38] opinion you're scribes that means you're
[1:18:42] educated you've gone to you went to the
[1:18:45] Community
[1:18:47] College you graduated from
[1:18:51] ASU you not only got a
[1:18:53] bachelor's now you have a master's some
[1:18:57] of you here have a
[1:18:58] PhD so let me ask you a
[1:19:01] question what's easier to
[1:19:04] say thy sins be forgiven
[1:19:07] thee or rise and
[1:19:11] walk they couldn't answer
[1:19:15] him neither
[1:19:17] one is
[1:19:19] easy for men and women born in sin
[1:19:23] shaped
[1:19:25] iniquity coming to this world speaking
[1:19:29] Li and the more educated you
[1:19:32] get the more difficult this question
[1:19:37] becomes Jesus
[1:19:40] said that you might
[1:19:43] know that the son of man now he drops
[1:19:47] into his prophetic
[1:19:49] Ministry hath power on
[1:19:51] Earth
[1:19:53] not a son of
[1:19:55] man but the son of
[1:19:57] man God the prophet not Moses the
[1:20:01] prophet not Paul the prophet not Peter
[1:20:05] the prophet not William Bram the prophet
[1:20:08] God the prophet Jesus
[1:20:14] Christ that you might know that the son
[1:20:17] of man have power on Earth to forgive
[1:20:21] sins
[1:20:25] because it's here on this
[1:20:27] Earth in this flesh body where you have
[1:20:31] to know that your sins are
[1:20:34] forgiven or you won't know when you
[1:20:37] leave this
[1:20:38] body if you made it or
[1:20:42] not you must
[1:20:44] know here on Earth in this
[1:20:48] body but that you might know that the
[1:20:50] son of man have power on Earth to
[1:20:52] forgive sins then saith he to the sick
[1:20:55] of the py arise take up thy bed and go
[1:20:59] into thy
[1:21:07] house now the
[1:21:09] multitudes they
[1:21:11] marveled they glorified
[1:21:16] God who has given such
[1:21:21] power to this man who is this
[1:21:26] man he's not your he's not your regular
[1:21:29] kind of a
[1:21:33] man that much they were
[1:21:38] understanding but they couldn't quite
[1:21:40] get it out of their mouths
[1:21:43] yet this is Christ this is the Son of
[1:21:46] God this is God made
[1:21:49] flesh but God was
[1:21:55] unfolding his personality his
[1:21:58] person showing himself as an
[1:22:01] evangelist showing himself as a prophet
[1:22:05] showing himself as a
[1:22:07] teacher himself as one who forgives sins
[1:22:10] L of
[1:22:12] God and he goes
[1:22:15] on speaking on
[1:22:18] healing in verse
[1:22:21] 15 he declares
[1:22:24] himself the
[1:22:26] bridegroom and you and I his
[1:22:29] bride in a
[1:22:32] parable it's
[1:22:35] Jesus because some of John's disciples
[1:22:38] come to
[1:22:40] him said we have a question for
[1:22:44] you they were John's
[1:22:47] disciples they had gotten out of their
[1:22:50] denominations they believed they were
[1:22:52] following a
[1:22:53] prophet and they were they had been
[1:22:57] baptized unto
[1:23:03] repentance they think they're in the
[1:23:06] word and they
[1:23:10] are but the problem
[1:23:12] was many were putting a
[1:23:15] period and saying this is
[1:23:18] it and it wasn't they needed to put a
[1:23:21] comma
[1:23:23] because when that Forerunner goes off
[1:23:24] the
[1:23:26] scene who was the messenger now the Holy
[1:23:30] Spirit Jesus Christ
[1:23:33] himself the
[1:23:36] bridegroom but they come to
[1:23:39] Jesus John's
[1:23:41] disciples they say why do we and the
[1:23:45] Pharisees fast
[1:23:51] of but th disciples fast
[1:23:54] not Jesus said unto
[1:23:57] them in a
[1:24:00] parable can the children of the Bride
[1:24:03] chamber
[1:24:07] mourn can the
[1:24:10] bride who's received a proposal of
[1:24:17] marriage can she be
[1:24:20] sad can she be moaning and
[1:24:24] groaning no no she's a
[1:24:28] bride adorning herself getting her
[1:24:31] wedding dress
[1:24:33] ready because she's got a promise one
[1:24:37] day he's riding down and taking me away
[1:24:42] to live with my husband
[1:24:46] eternally can the children of the
[1:24:48] bridegroom can the bride mourn as long
[1:24:51] as the bridegroom is with
[1:24:57] him how many of
[1:25:02] you when your husband ask who's not your
[1:25:04] husband asks you will you marry
[1:25:08] me and you said
[1:25:11] yes and he's happy and you're happy then
[1:25:16] he goes home he comes back to visit you
[1:25:19] the next
[1:25:21] day
[1:25:24] does the does the young lady that's
[1:25:26] accepted this proposal of
[1:25:29] mar does she say oh no he's back
[1:25:33] again no
[1:25:36] no I'm so glad to see you again why it's
[1:25:40] been a whole 24
[1:25:42] hours I missed you that's what Jesus was
[1:25:46] saying to
[1:25:48] them chapter
[1:25:50] n he's going going through all these
[1:25:55] changes
[1:25:57] evangelist Prophet King of the Jews the
[1:26:01] Lamb of God savior
[1:26:05] healer he's vindicating his
[1:26:09] word so that all that the prophets have
[1:26:14] said are coming to pass his every
[1:26:19] move is the word being fulfilled
[1:26:23] of what the prophet
[1:26:25] spoke and we've got to come to that
[1:26:28] place where we
[1:26:29] realize our every
[1:26:31] [Music]
[1:26:33] move it's not the devil moving us like a
[1:26:36] little pond on a
[1:26:40] board God is moving Us in this world and
[1:26:45] when we realize there's a purpose a
[1:26:49] Divine
[1:26:50] Purpose a character building
[1:26:58] purpose then we
[1:27:00] realize it's because I'm his
[1:27:02] bride and I'm being
[1:27:04] adorned with the character of Jesus
[1:27:07] Christ and I'm not going to be sad about
[1:27:10] it because the end
[1:27:13] result is the wedding
[1:27:17] supper with my
[1:27:19] bridegroom for eternity
[1:27:27] Jesus the
[1:27:29] Evangelist a woman touched the Hem of
[1:27:31] His
[1:27:34] Garment she was
[1:27:38] healed Peter goes into the
[1:27:41] house of Peter's house Jesus
[1:27:45] does and Peter's mother Peter's mother's
[1:27:49] wife is
[1:27:51] sick she has a
[1:27:54] temperature he touches her you
[1:27:58] see though he had already manifested
[1:28:00] himself as a
[1:28:03] prophet and the
[1:28:04] bridegroom and the Lamb of
[1:28:07] God this little
[1:28:09] lady needed a touch of
[1:28:12] healing and he drops into his evangelist
[1:28:16] Ministry because there's healing in his
[1:28:19] hands he just touches her doesn't say a
[1:28:23] word the fever's
[1:28:26] gone he moves in and
[1:28:29] out of his fful
[1:28:31] ministry to fulfill the need that you
[1:28:34] have at the
[1:28:37] time it may not be an evangelist you
[1:28:39] always
[1:28:41] need you might need the
[1:28:43] pastor you might need a
[1:28:46] teaching and if you do guess what Jesus
[1:28:51] has provided
[1:28:53] it's his very
[1:28:54] nature that he's given
[1:28:57] us he heals the
[1:29:01] blind just by touching
[1:29:06] them there was a first pull of his
[1:29:10] ministry he was in the second pull of
[1:29:12] his
[1:29:13] ministry but though he was in the second
[1:29:15] pull of his
[1:29:18] ministry the gift of healing wasn't gone
[1:29:23] he could still turn around and touch
[1:29:26] someone as an evangelist though he was
[1:29:30] prophet though he was King of the Jews
[1:29:33] though he was Lamb of
[1:29:34] God he never lost that the he never lost
[1:29:39] a Ministry when he moved into the
[1:29:42] next it's just that the other Ministries
[1:29:45] became a
[1:29:48] minor and as he took steps the the next
[1:29:51] steps forward forward that became the
[1:29:53] major role he was
[1:29:56] playing but he could but he could always
[1:29:59] turn around and touch
[1:30:01] someone and heal them because that's
[1:30:03] what he
[1:30:05] is healer
[1:30:08] savior a quickening power for you and
[1:30:15] I the Bible
[1:30:18] says there was a dumb
[1:30:20] man POS possessed with the
[1:30:23] devil and when that devil was cast
[1:30:26] out the dumb spoke you know that reveals
[1:30:30] something to
[1:30:32] us that the devil he was possessed
[1:30:36] of was in the natural
[1:30:42] realm not the spiritual
[1:30:45] realm he wasn't possessed of a devil
[1:30:47] that made him that made him
[1:30:50] violent that's a spiritual
[1:30:55] realm he wasn't possessed of a devil
[1:30:57] that that that made him a
[1:31:01] liar that's a spiritual
[1:31:03] realm he wasn't possessed of a devil
[1:31:06] that made him an arrogant
[1:31:09] man that's a spiritual
[1:31:12] man the devil he was
[1:31:15] possessed was in the natural
[1:31:18] realm and he couldn't
[1:31:20] speak he was
[1:31:25] mute he was a nice
[1:31:28] man he was probably a good
[1:31:31] dad a great
[1:31:34] worker but but in the natural
[1:31:37] realm a demon had possessed
[1:31:40] him and he couldn't
[1:31:45] speak and
[1:31:47] Jesus cast it out with his words
[1:31:53] and once again the multitudes
[1:31:57] Marvel you know why they
[1:32:00] Marvel because the last prophet Israel
[1:32:04] had had been
[1:32:06] Malachi 400
[1:32:09] years for 400 years they hadn't had
[1:32:13] a for 400 years they hadn't seen the
[1:32:16] power of God
[1:32:19] move for 400 years
[1:32:24] 400 years back was about the time a a a
[1:32:28] group rose
[1:32:31] up in the Church of
[1:32:34] Israel they called themselves
[1:32:38] Pharisees they were the they were
[1:32:40] legalists to the
[1:32:44] maximum they added burden upon burden
[1:32:48] upon burden
[1:32:50] upon
[1:32:53] they added rule upon rule upon rule upon
[1:32:55] the
[1:32:58] people what kind of rules ridiculous
[1:33:02] rules you got a
[1:33:06] cold you got to stay in your home for
[1:33:08] two
[1:33:10] weeks you're sick that's it shut down
[1:33:13] the
[1:33:15] business I heard you sneeze why AR you
[1:33:18] wearing a mask shame on you
[1:33:23] H it's the same
[1:33:26] spirit and it's a spirit of death and
[1:33:30] it's a spirit of
[1:33:31] Lies Spirit of
[1:33:33] denomination Spirit of the great
[1:33:35] heart Spirit of his
[1:33:37] daughter Harlot
[1:33:40] daughters chapter
[1:33:43] n Jesus sees the crowds and the
[1:33:47] multitudes growing that are
[1:33:50] following
[1:33:53] in verse 35 he says Jesus went about all
[1:33:56] the cities and
[1:34:00] Villages teaching in their
[1:34:03] synagogues they were still allowing him
[1:34:05] some of the priests to teach in their
[1:34:09] churches men like
[1:34:11] Nicodemus though they were getting in
[1:34:13] trouble for doing
[1:34:15] it and there he was preaching the gospel
[1:34:18] of the
[1:34:20] Kingdom and healing every
[1:34:23] sickness and every disease among the
[1:34:28] people but the Bible says but when he
[1:34:31] saw the
[1:34:32] multitudes he was moved with compassion
[1:34:35] on
[1:34:36] them because they
[1:34:39] fainted and were scattered
[1:34:41] abroad as sheep having no
[1:34:45] Shepherd wait a minute brother Daniel
[1:34:48] they were all members of this great
[1:34:50] denomination
[1:34:53] that's
[1:34:54] right that's why he had compassion on
[1:34:57] them that's why they were
[1:35:01] fainting that's why they were
[1:35:04] scattered that's why there was no unity
[1:35:07] in the
[1:35:08] people because the very Ministry kept
[1:35:11] them
[1:35:13] divided the very Ministry kept them in
[1:35:17] fear the high priest of Israel
[1:35:20] himself
[1:35:21] was at fault for this characteristics in
[1:35:24] the
[1:35:26] people he said they were
[1:35:29] sheep having no
[1:35:31] Shepherd they didn't have a
[1:35:35] leader to lead
[1:35:38] them into the presence of Christ as a
[1:35:42] matter of fact the leader would say to
[1:35:45] them don't
[1:35:47] anyone ever
[1:35:49] dare to go into the the holies of
[1:35:52] holies because if we don't kill
[1:35:55] you God will kill you to walk in that
[1:36:00] place and while they're preaching that
[1:36:02] in their
[1:36:04] pulpits Jesus is
[1:36:06] listening and his
[1:36:10] goal was to bring down the
[1:36:15] curtain so that you and I could walk
[1:36:18] into his
[1:36:19] presence you see the
[1:36:22] difference between
[1:36:25] denominationalism even in this thing
[1:36:27] that's called the
[1:36:30] message Lord have
[1:36:34] mercy and when Jesus saw
[1:36:38] this he said the Harvest truly is
[1:36:43] plenteous but the labors are
[1:36:46] few as a matter of fact it's just me and
[1:36:50] John right now
[1:36:55] and John was just a few days
[1:36:58] away from the ending of his
[1:37:02] ministry Herod would take him
[1:37:05] prisoner and bead
[1:37:10] him then Jesus says in the last verse of
[1:37:13] chapter
[1:37:15] nine pray ye therefore the lord of the
[1:37:20] Harvest and he was the lord of the
[1:37:25] Harvest why did he say it that way he
[1:37:29] was speaking in a
[1:37:31] parable and it takes a
[1:37:34] revelation to catch what he was saying
[1:37:38] it must be quickened to you and
[1:37:41] I for Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:37:45] church and the Gates of Hell will not
[1:37:48] Prevail
[1:37:49] against pray therefore the lord of the
[1:37:52] Harvest that he will send forth labors
[1:37:55] into his
[1:38:02] Harvest chapter
[1:38:06] 10 Jesus
[1:38:09] begins to set the church in
[1:38:13] order what he
[1:38:15] said in the last verse of chapter
[1:38:19] nine was a
[1:38:22] prophecy of of this Prophet
[1:38:25] Jesus and now he's going to unfold the
[1:38:30] prophecy why that it might be
[1:38:33] fulfilled what he just
[1:38:36] said now he's going to bring it to pass
[1:38:39] because God is his own
[1:38:43] interpret in verse n he
[1:38:45] prophesies in verse
[1:38:47] 10 he interprets the prophecy
[1:38:57] he's he says and when he had called unto
[1:38:59] him his 12
[1:39:04] disciples Matthew
[1:39:06] 9:38 was
[1:39:08] prophecy Matthew
[1:39:10] 10 is prophecy being fulfilled becoming
[1:39:16] history and when he had called unto his
[1:39:18] 12 disciples he gave them power against
[1:39:21] unclean
[1:39:24] spirits to cast them out to heal all
[1:39:28] manner of
[1:39:29] sickness and all manner of
[1:39:31] disease and as of
[1:39:35] yet none had been
[1:39:38] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:39:42] Christ they may have been baptized for
[1:39:47] repentance but the
[1:39:49] revelation of the name of
[1:39:52] God to make the
[1:39:54] baptism a quickening
[1:39:57] power hadn't come yet and they were not
[1:40:01] partakers you say how can that
[1:40:04] be because thus is it thus it's
[1:40:08] written gifts and
[1:40:10] callings are even
[1:40:13] without
[1:40:19] repentance let's stand to our feet we'll
[1:40:23] stop
