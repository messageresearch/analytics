[Music] amen God bless you all this morning it's good to be back once again and give unto the Lord Jesus all our worship all our praise grateful to be here among Saints of like Precious faith so we'd like this morning once again continuing and begin reading there in Revelations chapter one Mr manana and verse one foreign The Book of Revelations it's the it's the whole book in symbols but it's it's the whole book of uh of a new testamento it's the it's a whole book of a divine plan of God to save us to restore us to take us back to Eden of course the Old Testament spoke of it also had many of these things written within the pages but it was written in in the allegories It Was Written In in metaphors and the lives of the Old Testament Patriarchs and the lives and the of the Old Testament Patriarchs they they were actually living out a part of this you can see they didn't realize it and and we didn't realize it until God sent a prophet in this 20th century and begin to point out the the small details and can and what those times and the lives of these Old Testament Patriarchs represented and he spoke to us of the life of Joseph which was also he said a type of Christ he was loved of his father and hated of his Brethren it was representing the life of Jesus who his Brethren the Jewish Community they would hate him but the father loved him and his life continued to to unfold showing forth the Life of Christ and as many times as a child as I read it and my mother would read it to me we thought it was just a story of a man that lived thousands of years ago but it was really the story of a man that would actually come and live in us it was the story of Jesus Christ he was falsely accused he was he was he was sold by his Brethren bendito for a few pieces of silver he was falsely accused and put in prison foreign but there in in the time that he was in prison the prison was blessed the prisoners were blessed the the man in charge of the prison was blessed because he was represented the Prince of Peace and and one was the one that served wine to the pharaoh of Egypt they too were in this prison they had dreams in the dreams he told one of them he would he would he would again again be restored to the right hand of pharaoh but he told the other one he says your dream represents and you'll be lost you'll be put to death it represented two thieves on the cross one would be given life one would be given death oh the simple details but the details that's why a prophet said if you read your Bible and you can't see Christ go back and read that part again because this entire Bible from Genesis to Revelations it's all about the revelation of Jesus Christ oh you need a revelation of the messenger for your day you need a revelation to be able to know if the man's a prophet or not but if he is that's all he is he's God's Prophet he's God's Pastor he's God's Apostle he's God's evangelist but it's none of us were God made flesh but not just for the prophet himself but you and I God in US Open the hope of glory but there's only one man the diet and the cross for us and rose again and it's the revelation of him that will bring us salvation and when you can have a revelation of Jesus Christ then by Revelation you can see who his Faithful Servants are Revelations and appreciate whom God sends to to help you look through the details in the scriptures and catch the revelation for we don't follow a man we follow the lamb and the only man we follow is the man Christ Jesus Christ but with a revelation of Jesus Christ the revelation of Jesus Christ you learn to appreciate your brothers and sisters in Christ regardless of whatever title they might have you simply appreciate the body of Christ from the prophet to the janitor because you have a revelation of Jesus Christ who your lord and savior is Salvador is and you just start treating everybody the same with the love of God in your heart Revelations chapter 1 and verse one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which will shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John revelation who bear record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand [Music] there's no blessing for not reading no there is only a blessing for reading and there's no blessing for for not hearing there's only a blessing for hearing and there's blessings for hearing the words of this prophecy everything else you might hear doesn't carry a blessing of eternal life so then we got to consider what we're hearing and how much we're hearing of all the different things we do here some we have to say I'm going to hear this lesson until we finally get to the word of God and with the revelation of Jesus Christ you'll have to say I need to hear this the most I need to read this the most because this is where the blessings of eternal life lay okay let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again this morning and we truly ask your blessings we come as worshipers first of all and and pray that you have received our worship and praise from our hearts and if you have then come and speak something to every heart [Music] something to encourage us to keep pressing on following the lamb and this we ask in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated we'd been speaking on this first chapter in the first chapter of Revelations is lifting up Jesus Christ King of Kings Lord of lords the great high priest it's tell it told us in here how that how he would return at his second Communists and it says in verse seven it said behold he cometh with clouds and throughout the years and the hundreds of years people have tried to discern what that meant and most of the time they take it literally so they were they're actually waiting for him to come in clouds clouds that bring rain water clouds that give us shade naturally but when he cometh when these clouds it says every eye shall see him now as you know if you're watching and looking at a cloud straight up from this from from Phoenix Arizona there's no way the brothers in Congo Africa can see the same clouds but when it comes in these clouds at his at his second coming it's at every I would see so now we realize by the witness can the testimony of a prophetic Ministry is that these clouds were not natural clouds that this part of the Book of Revelations is like every part of the Book of Revelations it's a symbol these clouds here that it's speaking of it is that every eye would see him so he says behold he cometh with clouds and every eye shall see him now now it's calling the clouds him now it's calling the clouds him so this clouds were exactly what we call a revelation of today these clouds were seven angels and these clouds were there were taking a picture in the Life Magazine okay and and this magazine went around the world and every eye saw this Cloud but it wasn't a cloud it wasn't a mystery it was a mysterious Cloud because there were seven angels and when you turned that picture of that cloud and you turn it to the right who do you see okay look away we see him this was written in prophecy about 80 90. [Music] and in 1963 over 1900 years later this prophecy is fulfilled in scripture this now is history for us when John saw it in a vision he saw it coming he said behold he comes with clouds how does he come with clouds he was one of those angels he was the one that was most notable he was the one with the swept back wings he was in the photography he came down with this cloud of Angels In This Cloud he was the same one that spoke to Moses In This Cloud he was the same one that spoke to to to Paul on the road to Damascus In This Cloud he's the same one that spoke to a 20th century Prophet is verse 7 was prophecy so now we have a date for verse seven that it was 1963. in Life magazine in the in the March issue This Cloud was shown no more prophecy but verse 7 become history in 1963. when seven angels came down and every eye saw it because Life Magazine was an International magazine and it went it would go to every country in the world and every eye saw him but they didn't know what there was him we know it's him a little flock knows it's him Believers know it's him and Believers are still seeking him behold he cometh with clouds in 1963 and every eye saw him and they also which um and they also which pierced him Israel the Jewish people and all kindreds of the Earth shall wail because of him a future prophecy at the end time then he says I'm Alpha and Omega the beginning and the ending who was the alpha omega this one he that came with these clouds he that was the seventh angel in this constellation he is the beginning and the end saith the Lord which is which was which is to come the Almighty then verse 9. then John begins to declare and give his own testimony he says I'm your brother I'm your companion and tribulation and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ I'm your brother in Christ I'm just like you are but but I've been called to be placed on this on this island called Patmos and I was placed here for the word of God yes and I realized that I was placed on this deserted island for the testimony of Jesus Christ for the life I was living and and for wanting to put all the writings of the Apostles in a book okay and and I was placed here because I was trying to put all the writings of the new testamentos so that all the world could have it for they could have the plan of God the Plan of Salvation so they could have the plan of how to how to go on to perfection so they could understand that when it comes to Perfection that we all begin at the same place and that is blessed are the porn spirit amen in other words when it comes to Perfection we all started in the same spot born in sin shaped in iniquity come into this world speaking lies oh but it's the soul that's in you it is a child of God then you're ordained to come into perfection John in verse 10 says the Visions had begun he had been he broke into another dimension he was he was now unconscious that he's sitting on a rock there they're next to the ocean in an island called Patmos because now he's entered into the spirit now he's catching Visions it's just like you and I when we come to church we can also get lost in the spirit we can also come here and [Music] as a trumpet to me and he was speaking to me of his of the deity of Christ and I understood that he's Alpha he's Omega I understood he was he's the first he's the last I understood that what I was looking at the writings in the book is something that God ordained it's something that God sent to me you see you got to make it personal John said I said John said he heard a voice of a Greek trumpet verse 10. saying I'm Alpha and Omega the first and the last and what thou see is verse 11 can what thou see is write in a book they say send it unto Kenny send it to Jonathan send it to Leo send the two Ismail I smile send it to my children send it to a little flock through seven Church ages send it to the Saints and Ephesus all the seven Church ages send it to the Believers but God makes it personal because God wants you to understand that if you get in the spirit that is sent it directly to you then John says in verse 12. I turn to see the voice that spoke with me I'm being turned I saw seven golden candlesticks and in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the son of man what John meant is that this man that I saw was like unto Jesus of Nazareth yes it looked like him but he was clothed with the Garment to the foot verse 13. listen um and gird about the paps with a golden girdle foreign but he was dressed differently and his hair wasn't what what wasn't dark hair like it used to be is his head and his hairs were a white like Woolen as white as snow and his eyes were a flame of fire and his feet like into fine brass they burned in a furnace and his voice is the sound of many Waters and he had in his right hand Seven Stars and out of his mouth when a sharp two-edged sword and his countenance was the sun shineth in his strength it was Jesus but John had never seen him dressed and looking this way because now he was dressed as a judge now he was dressed as Supreme deity to judge the whole world now he was now he was going to be moving throughout seven Church ages in the form of the Holy Spirit where he could speak and talk so he could speak and talk and speak to his people lip to ear and everyone could have a personal relationship with the son of man in verse 18. verse 17. and when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me fear not I'm the first and the last piece this Jesus of Nazareth was the same God that sat on the throne it was this is the same Creator this is the created heavens and earth the same one that said let there be light the same the same one that made Adam in His image and likeness this same God became the second Adam and here he's the great Holy Spirit now he's going to be moving in the midst of these seven churches and in these seven churches they actually existed in the days of Jesus in the day in the days of the Apostle Paul and John apostle Paul some of these places still exist today they're outside of Israel in a place called Asia Minor is they they they they were literal places and churches and groups of Believers but they were really used here symbolically they were also representing the Bride of Jesus Christ a gentile people whom God by the Holy Spirit would be moving amongst his people amongst throughout seven Church ages today for over 2 000 years the Holy Spirit moving and there's been a remnant of believers so the Bride of Jesus Christ is not just us here in the time of laodicea no no no the Bride of Jesus Christ is made up of all the Believers from the days of Jesus from the days of John the Baptist when the message of the hour began began to be preached and John began that message with the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand it was the first coming of Christ it was his it was the first coming of Elijah it was the opening of the first seal the opening of this first seal it is the first coming of Christ and the white horse rider yeah and the white horse rider Blanco began in the days of John the Baptist oh you can read it in the Bible in Matthew 11. when Jesus said that in the days of John is when this white horse rider begin to ride [Music] and the plan of God of Salvation and to restore his family back into his presence it had begun but the white horse rider began writing because the lion had began had brought the message of Salvation and of change to Israel for Israel because it was the opening of the first seal because it was the opening of part one part one of God bringing Gathering back his family you see do you see the first coming of Christ it began the Gathering time you say how do we know that because Jesus said to Israel as a hand gathers her brood s so I've tried to gather you so the opening of the first seal part one of restoration and salvation was God coming to gather his children back into his presence like he had tried to gather Adam and Eve and they fell from his from his presence because they walked out of his presence but it's always been God's desire to be gathered with his children the father with his daughter the father with his son the Father the husband with his bride oh it's a great plan to gather you back to himself don't get so busy and that you haven't got time to let God gather you in your prayer closet to enter into a fellowship Divine with him part one part one had begun in the days of Jesus and we emphasize part one because it's a pattern of how part seven would unfold part one would unfold with a forerunner of John the Baptist who would forerun the first coming of Christ part one is the opening of this first steal it was the lamb who opened up okay foreign because the book that the lamb was opening this book sealed with Seven Seals this book of redemption this book of Salvation this is the the Lamb's Book of Life the lamb is the only one that can open it because it's a it's a book of redemption he was the one that opened it and when this book opened was in the days of Jesus the first coming of Christ is the opening of This Book of Salvation the first coming of Christ is the loosing and opening of the first seal is Seven Seals seven parts of one divine plan that God wants us to put our vision on okay that he can reveal it to us word by word and Page by Page and we can see his plan for our lives so Revelation 6 1 unfolded and happened Revelation 6 1 is the prophecy but the manifestation where it opened and Jesus himself declares it was Matthew 11. so in Matthew 11. we can say that day this scripture of Revelation 6 1. came to pass it manifested it happened the vision unfolded in reality it says in Revelation 6 1 the first seal we've read it often because it's a pattern of our day of things to come and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and I heard as it was the noise of thunder foreign and a prophet tells us what is a thunder okay in the Bible a thunder is the voice of God when a seal is open so it sounds redundant here can I solve when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder um and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder so the noise of Thunder was the opening of one of the seals that's why a prophet told us what is the thunder it's the voice of God when a seal opens and what is this first talent what is this first verse telling us that the noise of Thunder represents the opening of one of the seals it was there all the time so simple but yet God used the way it was written to hide it from the eyes of the wise included Israel so who took it to Israel Israel was not waiting for for the Lamb of God Israel was waiting for messiah Israel Israel was waiting for the king of the Jews that's who that's the prophecies that Israel was waiting on but it's the Lamb's Book of Life that was going to be presented to them but it had to be the lamb presenter it had to be the lion presenting it to them it couldn't be the lamb it was the Lion's Ministry and he was going to take the Lamb's part Israel Israel God's people and he was going to present to them the kingdom of God the kingdom the kingdom of heaven that John the Baptist had already been preaching to them calling them to repent and be baptized that thy sins would be forgiveness that being baptized in water okay and submerged in water represented a supernatural baptism um John said I will baptize you with water but when he comes he will baptize you with the Holy Ghost and Fire the water baptism was just an outward expression of an inward work of this son of man of the pride of life that allow you to put your life in order and Revelation 6 1. the lamb opened the seal but it was one of the four beasts that said come and see Ben it was the lion because of the four beasts because of the four beasts because of the four beasts the first was the lion you can read it in Revelation this was the first seal it was the opening of The Plan of Redemption this was the first coming of Christ and the first Beast was the lion the lion of the tribe of Judah Messiah was going to take the the Lamb's Book of Life to Israel no more the law on the prophets he was bringing a life-changing book to them under the law they were not changed so under the law they were penalized [Music] they were chastened even unto death thou shall not kill if you kill the penalty was death or anything in his home don't cover his house don't cover his wife don't covet his children don't covet his work the penalty was always death but Jesus of Nazareth as line of the tribe of Judah he takes the open book the Lamb's Book a book of life not a book of law a book of redemption for God's children and the lion begins to teach it to Israel in Matthew 11. Jesus begins to share with them the opening of this book we've read it often because we want you to to catch it because the the opening of the first seal the first coming of Christ the the Forerunner Elijah Ministry it was all to repeat it would be a pattern again in our day that once again God would bring a forerunner an Elijah Ministry to reintroduce us to the Lamb of God reintroduce us to the Lamb's Book of Life because there's far too many legalists today in this message already amen that means they don't have a revelation of this Lamb's Book of Life that means they don't have a revelation of Jesus Christ because a revelation of Jesus Christ brings you hope of salvation for you for your wife for your children because it's the Lamb's Book of Life is being revealed to you a book of life not a book of letters but the spirit give us life God yes took the book the Lamb's Book of Life opened the first seal what does that mean he opened part one Redemption salvation and restoration had begun for God's family and where do we all begin yeah blessed are the porn spirit because we've all been born in sin shaped iniquity and we've come into this world speaking lies the soul that's laying within you is a child of God then this book is for you then you are part of this Kingdom then you have a promise of eternal life then you can go on to Perfection yeah it's 48 verses away but all you have to do is take God in his word and take the first step and take the second step and the third and the fourth and the fifth because there was 47 verses of Jesus teaching us that will arrive into Perfection meaning eternal life meaning Rapture in faith thank you so Revelation 6 1 was the beginning of a Teaching Ministry and the lion saying I know if you've had problems in your life I know you've had struggles in your life I know you've got complexes in your life and and the lion said to Israel all I want you to do is all I want you to do is get into the spirit all I want you to have is an ear to hear what the spirit is saying to you this morning and the Teaching Ministry begins at the first coming of Christ at the opening of the first seal where did it begin where did it open the prophecy was revelation 6. of this first seal that opened of this part one of seven parts that's where the prophecy is written but where did it actually happen and open Matthew Matthew 11. Jesus begins and it says that it came to pass Matthew 11 1. and it came to pass when Jesus made an end of commanding his twelve disciples and what did he command them go ye to the house of Israeli Don't Take This Book of Life to the Gentiles or don't take it to the Samaritans this ministry this message first is going to the firstborn Israel it must go to him first and it must be Messiah the lion that takes it because he's King of the Jews and this Lamb's Book of Life was first presented to the Jews and when the Jews rejected the Lamb's Book of Life when they rejected it then the Lamb's Book of Life [Music] when they rejected it the Lamb's Book of Life was given to a gentile people do you see it but Matthew 11. Jesus begins teaching the ministry of John is over the Elijah Ministry is done the Baptist is now sitting in a Roman prison waiting to be executed he's done his work he's finished his ministry he will not come back again because he did what he had to do okay he introduced Jesus Christ to the world whether you accepted him or rejected him this Lamb of God John the Baptist introduced him the word living the word made flesh and he was done he was finished God took him off the scene then Begins the Teaching Ministry of Jesus Christ in the lion Ministry and it came to pass when Jesus made an end of commanding his twelve disciples he departed then to teach and preach in their cities the opening of the first seal is a Teaching Ministry teaching us about this Plan of Redemption it says verse 2 now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent two of his disciples just a few months prior this John had had openly baptized Jesus in the Jordan saw a supernatural manifestation take place there he heard a voice saying this if my beloved Son and who I'm well pleased John himself said Behold the Lamb of God who take it away the sins of the world but now John's in prison he's been sitting there for days or months foreign did I just dream all of this did I give my life for nothing unto them go show John again these things which you do hear and see verse 4. this is how you'll know this is the details of the opening of the first seals of how the opening would begin did you catch it these are details that Jesus is giving us at the opening of the first year then wouldn't it also be details then then wouldn't it also be details of the same pattern that when we see it happen in our day to show that the seven seal is opened Jesus says the blind received their sight when the first seal opened the lame walked when the first seal opened the leopards were cleansed when the first seal opened the deaf here when the first seal opened the dead or raised up when the first seal opened the poor had the gospel preached to them then how would it be when the seven seal opens seventh second coming of Christ then what would it be will it be Christ Ed if in our date if we could say we've seen a Revival in the 20th century we're blind received their sight we're lame where lepers were cleansed were deaf heard where the dead were raised up I talked to brother Edmund way an Englishman he was the man that dropped dead in the prophet there in Jeffersonville Indiana well brother Brandon was preaching his wife Ruth screamed out you see sister Ruth was a registered nurse she saw his eyes roll back where it was just nothing but white she took his pulse and there was none the Breath of Life brother Edmund way was dead okay he said brother Edmond what do you remember just when brother Branham said brother Edmond just quietly and he called back to life and he opened his eyes he's laying on the ground and he sees brother Branham over and praying in this 20th century we've seen the blind receive their sight we watched the lame walk we've seen lepers cleansed we've seen the death here in in in a message brother Branham gives a testimony of a very young lady comes up to be prayed foreign and he says I sense there's a deaf Spirit did you say um and the young lady tells them she says I am they said see in one ear I've been deaf since I was a little girl and he goes on to discern foreign and she had been married once she has been married twice she had been married three times and her life hadn't been Pleasant at all then the gospel was preached unto her revealed to her condition and a prophet said is this true and she said it's all true and she was about to faint and fall down and a prophet said your sins which are men are all forgiven and he says at that moment he said God healed her deafness and she began to scream and shout out with a joy unspeakable he says not only did God heal her deafness and forgive all her sins he says but right there on that platform he baptized her with the Holy Ghost so here at the opening of the first seal these are details of this pattern that was to follow that when the first seal opened there was a healing Revival Ministry [Music] and the blind received their sight and the lame walked and the lepers were cleansed foreign follow the pattern of God's word and while Jesus is revealing these details Jesus there are people in this multitude that he's preaching to um many are being offended because then he says in verse 6 and blessed is he is whosoever shall not be offended in me because he was sensing that many were being offended by this because they said he's making himself God he's making himself that's who he's making himself to be the multitude the multitude as they departed because they have become offended they couldn't take the preaching of the seals they can't take it today they'd rather walk away then hear about this Plan of Redemption salvation an overcoming power in our lives of how to get into Perfection What are the steps Where Do We Begin you begin with repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's how the first seal began it's the foundation Stones even of the Seven Seals and as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went down to the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the Wind um Jesus is unfolding to them the first coming of Christ and yet it's not history no more what he's unfolding is happening right before their eyes how many things in this Bible have happened right before our eyes and we fail to see it because we must be in the spirit to see spiritual things now Jesus begins speaking of the Forerunner Elijah yes at the first coming of Christ at the opening of the first scene as they departed Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John verse 7 what went down to the Wilderness to see a reed shaken with the Wind Raymond Israel hadn't seen a prophet in over 500 years they didn't hardly know what a prophet looked like they couldn't hardly believe that God still had Prophets for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee is now Jesus is bringing in scriptures and he puts John's name into this scripture if there's something that's offensive to the religious people of this world is when you put a name on the scriptures whether it's John's whether it's yours or whether it's William Branham even the name of Jesus Christ is not popular in religion today oh they'll say oh no no we believe in Jesus ask them how were you baptized and why won't you be baptized in the name of Jesus watch the anger raise up because there's something they lack there's something they lack the revelation of Jesus Christ verse 11. verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there have not risen a greater than John the Baptist now we're standing he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is here Jesus was speaking of the wheat and the tears amongst the tears amongst the seed of the serpent is there's not a greater man than John Mayor even the little Grandma [Music] it's greater than John yes for John was sent to serve God's people and he is the first fruits of a faithful Ministry who are sent to serve God's people not to be Lords over God's people but to be Servants of things to come under the opening of the seventh seals when the seven seal would also open with those same details as when the first seal opened Muertos it was the first coming of Christ it was the opening of the first seal and the seventh unfolded exactly in the same way but it'll be just a little flop that catches it'll just be a little group of Believers that a Remnant that will catch the revelation of Jesus Christ [Music] and can see him in his word verse 12. now Jesus is teaching he's teaching about his first coming but it isn't coming it's there already it's in the midst of Israel it's first coming it was made flesh the plan of unfold or the plan of redemption's unfolding grace and mercy and changes being is being given to Israel that's what Israel rejected they rejected the opening of the Lamb's Book of Life they rejected these seven parts of redemption and salvation and the Bible says in verse 12. John has now first Jesus spoke of himself did you see the teach in Matthew 11 is mainland John comes his disciples come they say John wants to know are are you Messiah are you the king of the Jews so on the teaching of his first coming Jesus declares first I am the Christ I am the alpha I am the Omega I am the king of the Jews go tell John what the men how the ministry has begun and by these details foreign [Music] leaving now then he begins to speak on the Forerunner of how this seal would open up and it would begin with the ministry of John yeah who was going to be told who was going to be told you'll no longer preach the law but now the prophets under a New Covenant under a new testament Al we preach the kingdom of heaven will preach the Lamb's Book of Life people begin with Divine Healing for the body so that we can get the attention of the people who have been living in so much carnal paganism for so long so the thing God could deliver to them just like I have a healing for your body I want what I really want to give you is healing for the soul yes amen because the fullness of healing for the soul is eternal life that's Perfection and from the Day verse 12 of Matthew 11 and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force now Jesus brings in the ride of the white horse rider Lucifer Lucifer Satan satanas so in Matthew 11 Jesus identifies himself as the Christ the son of God then he identifies John in the scripture as Elijah then he tells us that in the days of the Elijah the white horse rider would begin right from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence the Kingdom of Heaven is what okay the Kingdom of Heaven is the children of God who are watching the ministry of Jesus and we're catching a revelation of Jesus Christ that this was Messiah that this was Jehovah being flesh oh it was just a little handful of people and this Kingdom of Heaven this little group of Believers in the days when John the Baptist was still alive we're suffering violence and these violent ones yes we're taking the Believers by force and placing them in prisons and feeding them to the Lions and burning them at Stakes it had begun the right of the Antichrist this is the Fulfillment of Revelations let's read it just for a moment as we've read it many times before but I want to say it over and over till you catch the pattern because it's verse one and two that is the unfolding of part one the first seal and in verse verse 2 that says John says and I saw him Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and with this bow in this Crown yes and with this bow can with this crown the writer on the White Horse when forth conquering and to conquer in other words he went out he went out causing violence and taking the children of God by violent Force how was he doing it with this bow with this bow and with this crown but the bow had no arrows and the crown he was not crowned with his crown no he just possessed this Crown well the bow was the Jewish Church and the Jewish church had no arrows because they were dominated by Rome can Rome took away all their rights to put anyone to death by the cross and the crown was Pagan Rome and in Pagan Rome and this big denomination even though they were enemies Lucifer used them both you know Lucifer can use enemies Kings of the earth residents of Nations they hate each other but he'll use all the nations of the world and the people to come forth as a flood to persecute this little bribe to come forth as a flight to persecute this little bride is the revenue and he's not changed his ways today [Music] the countries of the world and the nations of the world our enemies the religious denominations of the world don't kid yourself they're not friends is not in love with the Pentecostal people they don't like they don't love the lutherans the Presbyterians or any of the others but through flattery they're going to try to bring them all together under their domain Dominion right here verse two this was Lucifer in the Days of Elijah and and Satan had Israel Israel the church and Rome the Pagan nation in his hands and you know well that the Jewish Church in the days of Jesus we're a violent people and you know well that Pagan Rome in the days of Jesus was a violent Nation but Israel had no arrows to put Jesus to death but uh but then you roam had many arrows and Israel the high priest Lucifer was anointing him Lucifer Long Hill to take get one Arrow from Rome do you remember where they got it they're at that Tribunal before Pontius Pilate when pilate after four days out of interrogating Jesus he comes out before Israel he comes out before the high priest and he says what shall I do with Jesus who's King of the Jews and the high priest said don't say that he's King of the Jews say that he said it hello punches finally says no what shall I do with Jesus king of the Jews and Lucifer Lucifer Whispers in the year of the high priest this is your chance to get the arrow that you want tell them really say it out loud before Pontius Pilate and the Roman people and he whispers Lucifer Whispers in the caiapha's ear and the high priest is Anointed he thinks it's a personal revelation he thinks that it's a personal revelation and it was but it came from Lucifer it came from Satan and the high priest says this that's it sold himself to the devil's bidding were they the Church of God were they all holy holy they were not they sold their soul to the devil Diablo and Lucifer helped the bow get the one Arrow they thought they wanted um they thought when they got that arrow that it would give them more power in Israel that they thought killed Jesus was the arrow that scattered Israel for 2 000 years don't let anger get get in your life to such a place that you feel like if I can just tell this person such and such a thing put them in their place destroys your relationship with Jesus Christ Israel was the bone and when they finally got the arrow they thought would give them power and they got it from their enemy Rome and Luther Lucifer was using both of them they were all puppets the Nations that were all puppets in the hands of Satan and God is using them to bring violence to the Christians even today in this 21st century God is still anointing the rulers and the kings of the earth to persecute a little flock called The Bride of Jesus Christ the Jewish Church the Jewish church when Jesus came was in the hands of Lucifer did you catch that the Jewish church when Jesus came was in the hands of Lucifer and Jesus came he Jesus to break the chains and they rejected their freedom this morning Jesus wants to break your chains from the power of Satan and make you free yes sir Libre in Christ Jesus Christ Jesus you don't have to be a bow you don't have to be a bow with no arrows in the hands of Lucifer anymore you can be free for all that the spirit has set free or free indeed is Libre in the vision John said and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow had the Jewish church and a crown had the Pagan Rome in his hand and was given and they were given unto him and with the and with Israel the church and Pagan Rome he went forth conquering and to conquer and I saw a white horse provincial Israel was the bow the family of God that was the vision where did it come to pass Matthew 11. in verse 12. is where this prophecy this Vision happened and from the days of John the Baptista that's Elijah this is Elias until now the day that he's preaching the revelation of Jesus Christ the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by foreign also these things have already happened Elijah has come Elias avenido there was a great healing Revival we did see it and we've also seen just as the white horse rider began in the days of this Elijah guess when the pale horse riders started writing foreign we believe God sent a prophet they say no no the law and the prophets prophesied until John they say he said no no no no you should say what does that have to do with God having sent another prophet because immediately in the 14th verse verse 13 says for all the prophets in the law prophesied until John and if you'll receive it in verse 14 this is another Prophet I'm sending you which is to come this is the Elijah Ministry now Jesus is connecting John Jesus behold I send you Elijah before the great and terrible day of the Lord so Jesus in the teaching of the first coming declares John and Malachi 3. declares John and Malachi 4. then he says ears to Here let him hear it was the first time that phrase was ever spoken hardly in the Bible but it would be spoken throughout seven Church angels and this morning let him here okay do you love them this morning God's been so good to us open in the eyes of our understanding so we could see how great his grace and his Mercy has actually been in our lives to see when we were once lost in sin [Music] like the songwriter wrote we were like that little girl dead in all our sins till Jesus
