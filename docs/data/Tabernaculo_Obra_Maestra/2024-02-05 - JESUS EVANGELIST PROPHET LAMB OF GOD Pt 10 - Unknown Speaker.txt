happy to be back in the house of the Lord and uh happy to see everyone here and we want to continue um on part [Music] 10 of what we've been speaking on Jesus evangelist Prophet Lamb of God watching the pattern of God's word there was a time when we read our Bibles and it seemed like if each chapter of the Bible was a little story all by itself and we couldn't put it all together but but we now realize that there's a pattern laying in all of God's word from Old Testament to New Testament and the lives of the Patriarchs was a pattern of things to come and hidden in the stories were prophecies even as Jacob when he was blessing his sons there in uh believe Genesis 49 and and and and for each son he he he be he gave a blessing and some for for some it was not a blessing for some he described their nature and and what they would do and it was all it was a prophetic word for Jacob was a prophet and then he gets to his son Judah and and it was indeed a a prophecy and and and it was through Judah that that the woman's seed would come it was through Judah that Messiah would come and when he told Judah thou art a lion even a lion's welp it was was it it he was speaking to Judah but it was a prophetic word and it was really speaking of Christ to come that he would be the lion of the tribe of Judah that that that that that old lion was the father God and that young lion would be God in a young lion which would be Jesus Christ the King of the Jews Lion of the tribe of Judah but then we realize as we're reading the gospels that though he was born lying of the tribe of Judah he never stepped into that position as a as as a king like men would want kings to be his kingship was different his kingship was one that he would give his life for his for his people for his children for his family this was a different kind of King no king of the Earth would ever do what this King did and then we read in the book of Samuel where Israel asked for a king and Samuel told them let me show you the way of the Kings let me tell you what he's going to do to let me tell you how he'll take your sons and draft them into his armies and many many will die in the [Music] battlefields and when they die he'll just bring more of your sons to the battle he say the king will he Kings will take your daughters use them as Cooks make them slaves cause them to serve in in in your in in in in your mansions in your in everything he says the king will see what land you possess and he'll choose the best and let you keep the worst he says that's what Kings do of the earth even the best of them at some point they can't help themselves but get lifted up and the more they get lifted up the more they want as a billionaire once said said a Rockefeller Rockefeller there was President there was governor of California in 1963 he was already a billionaire he come from a family a wealthy family and they asked him how much he says you could spend millions of dollars a day and you wouldn't spend it all before you die I just like to know what your opinion is of what you think is enough money and he said well just a little bit more he said that's that is the nature and that's what Kings come to but this one who was born King of the Jews when he entered into his kingship he entered in as a servant he came as an evangelist he didn't run to to he didn't run to a great mansion He didn't take anything from anyone but this King came giving and giving this King came praying for for the sick this King came healing virtue raising the dead making the cripples walk making the blind eyes to see giving hearing to the deaf [Music] ears he was born King of the Jews and he began his kingship in in servitude to the people oh never lived a king like this [Music] before but the kings of the Earth are completely different and the longer they Reign the more they want and take from the people it is the nature of man but this King Jesus king of the Jews we see his attributes unfolding we see his message to the people it was a message of preparation he said behold the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and then he began to serve them and heal them and give them life then he began to teach them them and bring forth the message of the Kingdom not the law anymore but a new message a message of life he opened to Israel the Lamb's Book of Life you see when Adam and Eve fell in the beginning they lost this book they lost this plan but nonetheless what God did what Moses wrote in Genesis is that when God kept his word said in the day that you eat thereof of this tree this tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil that day you'll surely die death will strike you and when you fall all creation will fall with the trees that give fruit no longer will the fruit just stay on the tree till you want to eat it but even the trees on the fruit will have a lifespan and when it's plucked off its life it will die but even if you don't take the fruit off the tree death has struck them the fruit will rot right on the tree after a certain season you see death had struck the trees the fall of Adam and Eve had brought death to the trees the fall of Adam and Eve had brought death to the cattle the fall of Adam and Eve had brought death to everything and when they fell all creation fell with them from the Beast to the field to the fouls of the earth to mankind to everything that liveth and breath to every plant and tree that's on the face of the Earth nothing was living forever now death had struck everything and as God puts his son and daughter out of Eden he gives them a sign in a symbol and the Bible says and Adam created and God created skins to cover his children and their nakedness he didn't cover them because God was ashamed he covered them because he was speaking to us prophetically that though your my children have fallen yet are they covered and the skins with which they are covered represents that something has died for them that that they could become covered and the covering was a protection protection now from the cold before the fall there was no cold protection now from extreme heat before the fall there was no extreme heat it all spoke of death the Four Seasons we look at it we say wow wow Four Seasons they all have their beauty and as as men and women and humans they do but nonetheless all four seasons speak of a cycle of life and death because of the Fall because of Disobedience that had taken place in the beginning and all creation fell when the first Adam fell but God made a promise and even in clothing Adam and Eve it was a symbol that something had died for them so that they could be covered the Bible doesn't say it was lamb skins just God created skins for them but the Bible does said in Revelations 13 he said that the lamb was slain since the foundation of the world and the creating of these skins represented the sacrifice that was already done for God's children in the mind of God but the plan of restoration went into the hands of the father that's the book that the father was hiding that he was holding in his hands in Revelations 5 where the scripture says where John is seeing a vision and he he says and I saw one sitting on the throne with a book in his hand sealed with seven seeds that was the Lamb's Book that was the that was the book of restoration that would restore everything that the Locust had eaten everything that the caterpillar had eaten everything that these four worms had eaten representing the ride of Lucifer twisting and perverting all of mankind but Genesis the skins that God created it was a prophetic creation it was a spoken word creation declaring something has died so that you can live a lamb the lamb that was slain in the mind of God since the foundation of the world and God had a book in his hand that was the Lamb's Book that was a new covenant we have it now we've had it I've had it all my life it's called the Bible it's called the New Testament the old was a shadow of things to come the new was the plan being put into effect and the first coming of Christ was the opening of part one called the first seal and when the seal is taken off the scroll the seal can be tossed it was wax it it could be a leather or strap or of linen cloth they would tie the knot some would then take wax and pour it over the knot and put an emblem of their ring on it the to show it was a sealed scroll it was a sealed book it was a sealed message but that but that book had someone that it was specifically going to and this Lamb's Book of Life was made specifically to go to you you were the one God would Open the Eyes of your understanding you were the one who would seal the who would see the seal loosed and torn off you were the one that God wanted you to put your hands on his book and unfolded and see the promises of salvation of healing of change of making us men and women to the stature of a perfect man Jesus Christ oh that's what we've been seeing unfolding in this Gospel of Matthew in this Lamb's Book of Life we' been seen the unfolding DET detail upon detail eyes of understanding open oh what a book only God could write a book like this 66 authors well less than that because some wrote more than one gospel more than one epistle I think it was like 40 some scribe es of 66 books the written thousands of years apart but with Revelation they all come together just every type every symbol every proverb every Parable they come perfectly together then they come perfectly together in the Lamb's Book of Life for the Lamb's Book of Life is the book of restoration the Lamb's Book of Life was God's plan to take away the curse from us individually loose us from the curse of a natural birth to a supernatural birth to an Immaculate birth just like Jesus had say oh wait a minute we can't have a birth like Jesus we must his birth was ordained of the father and totally Supernatural and spoken word your Born Again experience is totally Supernatural it makes it an Immaculate birth for by one Spirit are we born into one body and made partakers of the promises in the Lamb's Book of Life on how to be perfect in other words how to return and get back into the channel of eternal life which was the original promise for Adam and Eve had they stayed in the word not looked for a shortcut you realize the message that Lucifer the serpent took to Eve was still a message that you can be like God the same message that God had was teaching Adam that he could be a chip off the old block that he could be just like God God was teaching Adam how to handle the spoken word that this son could do the same works as as the father and by the spoken word bring the family of God into existence the serpent went to Eve and said that's a great message I believe that too but I've got a shortcut for you and you can get there faster matter of fact I can take you there to that promise like that then you can go show Adam and then both of you can go show God and see look we did it without you aren't you proud of us oh you see Satan works the same trap today is that what you believe well I know how to get there quicker you just have to sidestep the word of God and I'll get you there much quicker Satan Lucifer The Serpent and we see the pattern of God's word it allows us to recognize our day in its message when we can recognize how part one unfolded first seal will begin to recognize how part seven the seventh seal the second coming unfold because the pattern Remains the Same because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so in visions of the last book in the Bible here the prophetic word is also unfolding This Book of Revelations is also God's Plan of Redemption and every symbol is mentioned for a Divine Purpose this is how Jesus said it in Matthew 11 he said at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and prudental them unto babies Matthew 11:25 so what things had he hid the 24 verses before verse 25 had been in Matthew 11 and what was Matthew 11 Jesus teaching us his first coming not that I'm going to come not that it's prophesied that I'm going to come he was teaching them I have come I am here Elijah from the Baptist was already his ministry had ended he was sitting in a in a Roman prison a prisoner of Herod he was soon to be beheaded their Ministries overlapped a bit and when John was placed in prison Jesus had started already his ministry and he saw John matter of fact he knew when John was placed in prison he knew he would be beheaded he knew it was his time to begin the teaching out of the Lamb's Book of Life and how we could be restored how we could be changed John had already begun the teaching he had laid down the foundation for Israel to be saved for Jewish men and women to be changed the foundation until the opening of the first seal was this repent and be baptized but more would be added the power of the name would be added the name of the Lamb would be added so that we could understand our Salvation so we could see that a key gave his life for us that we could be covered with the wedding dress of his word Jesus in Matthew 11:25 at that time Jesus answered and said I thank thee oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things what things the 24 verses before the verse 25 you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent and has revealed them unto babies not little children literally it's symbolic prophetic statement but those of his children who were born in sin and now have been born again these are the babes the Born Again children Jesus Christ these are the ones would be given Revelation that the wise and The Prudent of this world they they cannot get it because they must be born again together and they don't believe in being born again so can they receive it no you must be born again or you cannot see the Kingdom of Heaven you might say brother Daniel you think that was a good idea well in verse 26 Jesus said even so father for so it seemed good in thy sight God said it I believe it that settles it people want to enter into arguments that women can preach I say the Jud the judish the the church that God established in the wilderness and the ministry he established he did not Place women in Ministry that was the Judgment of Jehovah in the New Testament Paul continued with the same thought under a New Covenant and he did not Place women in God's Prophet God himself if you think different take it up with God I believe it I will stand with it because I know I'm standing with the Lord Jesus I know I'm standing with Jehovah God I'm standing with a man who sits on the throne with a book in his hand God didn't make women to do everything a man could do God made the sisters to do the many things that we cannot do yeah and God didn't make man to try and do everything a woman could do obviously he can't God made man God made woman he made him different in in his mind in his Sovereign mind he knew exactly what he was doing I'll stay with Jesus I'll stay with the word I'll follow the god that created heavens and earth who became flesh who was born King of the Jews and in his kingship role he immediately entered into into servitude to his people and the purpose of watching part one unfold be to watch the pattern of God's word and that and to see that he's indeed unchanging in all of his ways as we stand to our feet this morning SC turn with me to Hebrews 13 and8 Hebrews 13 and8 it reads like this the Apostle Paul a prophet an apostle he served as a pastor for a season to the Church of Ephesus he did the work of an evangelist he had a gift in his life to pray for the sick and God used them in all these ways as he used many men as he used William brandham William yes William brandom said I can't be a prophet if I'm an evangelist be a pastor I I you can't you can't mix these Ministries and yet that's exactly what God had him to do it's not what he wanted to do he wanted to say God make me one thing and I'll just do that no he said I'm going to have you unfold the pattern of God's word like I myself you're going to come as an evangelist like I myself I'm going to give you a gift to pray for the sick lift up the faith of the people like I myself I'm going to speak to you and tell you the intents of the hearts of the people it'll prove the ministry is prophetic like myself I'm going to have you teach about this seventh seal you're going to be an evangelist you're going to be a pastor at some point you're going to be an apostle and you'll travel the world seven times you you are Elijah the prophet you see the pattern of God's word again in Paul just like in Christ in William brandom it's just like in Paul it's a pattern of God's word Hebrews 13 and8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you that you're opening the eyes of understanding and giving us revelation we thank you now in Jesus name amen amen you may be seated if you turn with me in your Bibles because we've uh we've arrived at Matthew 11 in this teaching entitled Jesus evangelist Prophet Lamb of God we began at uh verse one we actually began at verse at the chapter 4 and then we drop back to verse one and followed through and we've pre repeated ourselves much and that was on purpose that was planned until we have arrived now to chapter 11 of the book of but chapter 11 is parallel with Revelations 61 and2 one is the prophecy the other is the prophecy being fulfilled one was the spoken word one is the Manifest manifestation of that spoken word so Revelation 6 verse one and two and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of [Music] thunder so what the Bible is saying is that the noise of a thunder represents the opening of a seal did you see that it was there all the time it was there all the time this divinely revealed mystery truth and it says and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and and I heard as it were the noise of thunder so now we know that the noise of Thunder that symbol represented the opening of a seal what if it would have said seven Thunders uttered their voices what would that represent would it represent the revealing and unfolding of Seven Seals it could and it did one of the four beasts so a thunder represented the opening of this first seal you might say brother Daniel it didn't say the first seal it just said one of the seal but when you but when you get to Revelations 63 it says and when he had opened the second seal so what was the seal before that wouldn't it be the first you know what you're doing this morning you're reading between the lines Revelation is striking our heart the book has become a new book William brandom said after he preached the seals the Bible has become a new book a brand new book he was receiving Revelation like he never before the Lamb's Book of Life was opening up to him he was a prophet but you and I have prophetic Insight because we're the Lamb's wife we're if the if the mind that was in Christ the husband be in you it will Quicken your mind to know what the father wants done with his word in your life and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of thunder and I heard as it were the noise of of Thunder 61 so a thunder the noise of a thunder represented one of the seals now the lamb opened the seal but it was one of the first beasts that began the teaching when did the lamb do this when the first seal opened when he was the lion of the tribe of Judah the symbol of the two animals is not the symbol of the two animals isn't it's not two animals it's two ministries of one man Jesus the Christ why was it the lamb that had opened one of the seals or the the first one because this is the Lamb's Book of Life That's opening lamb Ministry was salvation for all all people Gentile lamb Ministry was to All Nations T the lamb Ministry is the opening of The Book of redemption the lamb Ministry is the beginning of a new testament and like all founders of a book it tells us when he was born it tells us the life and Ministry he had it tells us when he died it tells us when he was buried but the founder of this book he rose again and it tells us he rose again and we have experienced through a personal experience Jesus Christ that he is risen because he's leading us because he's guiding us because he's convicted us of sin because we see we're changing we are being better fathers we are wanting to be better mothers we are wanting to be better sons and daughters do you see what's happening the promises of this lamb in this Lamb's Book of Life but it's not for all it's for a chosen people for there's two seeds upon the Earth the seed of the serpent the tears and the seed of God the children the kingdom Revelations 13 and8 it says this and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship him it was speaking of the Beast it was speaking of the Dragon it said and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship this Beast shall worship this Dragon whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world that means in Genesis where God created skins representing this lamb he had slain in his mind in this book that would be called the Lambs those skins that God created came from that lamb that he had slain at the foundation of the world when his children fell he immediately went into action they might have fallen but they won't be lost they might test T they're going to taste Death In the Flesh and yet I'll give them eternal life they will still live forever because I've got a plan and part one has begun unfolding the opening of the first seal and this and this Lamb's Book of Life had seven parts to save us to change us Genesis 321 remember it's Moses that wrote the book when did he write it when it was happening he was there to see it all he was not there to see it Moses didn't wasn't born for another 1500 or 2,000 years later but he did see it he saw it by Vision just like it happened in that day verse Genesis 3:21 and unto Adam also and to his wife that the Lord God make coats of skin and clothe him did he kill a lamb for the skins or did he just create the skins and in the mind of God God's lamb had been slain and he was covering them and cover covering them was a symbol of how he would cover all his children when he covered Adam and Eve in his mind he covered you and I in his mind he was covering all that dwell under the Earth and are worshiping him this morning remember Revelations 13 and8 and all that dwell upon the Earth shall worship Him the dragon the Beast Rome the great Harlot and all her Harlot daughters from the Catholic to the Pentecostal you can't be part of those systems and also be part of the mystical body of Jesus Christ it's a lie of the devil that we're all the same God's children are different God's seed is different and you are God's seed that's what has made you different all your life even when you were still living in sin you were different you didn't understand the difference the difference troubled you why can't I just be Happ happy doing all this what my friends do you you couldn't be because you were another seed your name was written in another book in the Lamb's Book of Life Revelations 6 and2 and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow it's a sybol symbol from the White Horse to the bow to the crown that we'll be reading of to the Conquering and going to conquer it's all symbolic it's not literal and yet the manifestation would be literal but the terms to hide and describe it are symbolic that's how God hides it in the eyes of the wise and but once he opens your eyes to it you say wow wow that's simple Revelation 62 John and I John I saw this and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him he wasn't crowned a crown was simply given to him and and with this bow and with this Crown he went forth conquering and to conquer the rider wasn't crowned and the bow had no arrows and yet he was able to use this both the crown and the bow to go forth conquering and to conquer now in verse one one of the four beasts John said come and see come and see is not an exhortation come and see is not a rebuke come and see is not an admonition come and see is a teaching come and see is a teaching I tell come over here come come see what I'm going to do here in his mind he goes oh no not again but my intentions to teach himself come and see was a teaching so in this teaching of Revelations 61 and2 so in this teaching is a lamb it's a symbol all are symbols representing something in this teaching is a thunder in this teaching is one of the four beasts in this teaching is a bow and no arrows and in this teaching is a crown given to him the rider so who is the Lamb what is the thunder which of the four Beast is this who who or what is the bow with no arrows because the bow is a who the bow is a what until we find out what it is but the bow is not a natural bow it is a symbol brother preached the message he called it you argue with him about it Revelations book of symbols he didn't understand all the symbols at first the Revelation started unfolding to him after he preached the seals day by day month by month the last couple of years is when the prophetic word really opened to him and open to us Bible questions have Bible answers so who is this lamb simply said it's Jesus Remember in St John chapter 1 and verse 29 John the Baptist speaking here John giving us the testimony of it it says the next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him and saith Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world so who was this lamb that that he saw loose this this first seal it was Jesus he is the Lamb so what is this thunder in the message the first seal paragraph 263 the prophet said this we found what the thunder means we found what it meant too this morning H we found what he found whoa it must be the same one speaking this morning that spoke back in 1963 today we're catching the revelation of what's spoken and he said we found what the thunder means that's perfectly we know that see then he says the Thunder was the voice of God when the seal opened isn't that what the first verse said so William brandham wasn't inventing anything God was just opening his eyes as he's opening your eyes to see the prophetic word yes it's true he said it first but it's one thing to say I believe it because he said it it's another thing to say I see what he said is in the Bible I see what he said is in the scriptures so who was the Beast that was teaching because the lamb opened the first seal but it was this Beast that was doing the teaching so who was this beast in Revelations 61 that was doing the teaching it's a Bible question so it has a Bible answer Revelations 47 it says and the first Beast was like a lion question question ask question answer the Bible prompted the question and the Bible answered the question we just have to let our fingers do the walking through the Bible Pages and as they're walking say Lord I can walk through these Pages all day long what I need is a revelation for Upon This Rock I'll build my church I'll build you as a man I'll build you as a woman I you as children as a teenager as a young man and old man on this Ro I will build my church and the first Beast was like a lion and the second beast like a calf and the third Beast had the face as a man and the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle the bow that was given that this Rider had in his hand the bow was Israel and Israel the Jewish Church wanted something they wanted to be a bow with an arrow they were not in other words they were a powerless church and a powerless Nation held in slavery the lack of even one Arrow was symbolic of what they didn't have the power to put Jesus to death on the cross but Rome would give them that Arrow have you read the gospels have you read when Rome gave them the power unfolded David said in Prophecy concerning Jesus Christ the son of God in Psalm 64 Psalm 64 beginning at verse one it says this it's a Psalm of David because not all the Psalms were written by David it says hear my voice oh God in my prayer preserve my life from from from Fear of the enemy oh it's a beautiful prayer he says hide me from the secret Cil of the wicked from the Insurrection of the workers of iniquity who wet their tongue like a sword you see the symbolic language the Bible and bend their bows to shoot their arrows even bitter words it was the bitter word words of the of of the high priest towards Pontius pilot that would that that that that would cause him to give Israel the arrow to put Jesus to death verse four that they may shoot in secret at the perfect it was a prophecy who is the perfect who was that perfect Jesus said in Matthew 5:48 be ye therefore perfect as my Father which is in heaven perfect the King was the perfect one and they were going to shoot in Secret at this perfect one suddenly do they shoot at him and fear not the bow the church Israel the nation Rome turn with me to Psalm 78 and verse 55 Psalm 78 verse 55 you say brother Daniel where do you get it from that Israel was the bow verse Psalm 7855 he cast out the Heathen also before him and divided them in inheritance by line and made the tribe of Israel to dwell in their tents in other words he blessed them verse 56 says yet despite all these blessings yet they tempted and provoked the most high God and kept not his testimony but turned back and dwelt unfaithfully like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful bow what's a deceitful bat when a man pulls a bow and let's say he's looking at brother orley stop right with your are or I'll shoot you in the chest with this Arrow brother orley says you pulled the string back you don't have no Arrow that's dece you have a deceitful bow but turn back verse 57 and dwelt unfaithfully like their fathers they were turned aside like a deceitful Israel the bow it's in the Bible it's in the scriptures we've read it hundreds of times but now the eyes of our understanding are being open and the Bible this book has become a new book to us the crown the crown was Rome Pagan Rome the rider was not crowned at this time even brother brandom tells us so but he had a crown the the crown was Rome Pagan Rome and the bow the deceitful bow needed an arrow that only Rome could give him crown in the message the second seal paragraph 142 Prophet says this you remember the white horse rider now had no Crown when he started out uh I think that's a Spanish one you remember the white horse rider had no Crown when he started out then he he was given a crown why he was the nickan spirit to be begin with then he began then he be became incarnate in a man and then he was crowned that was in the pergamus church age that was the third Church age for this white horse rider rode through three Church ages because it's not one seal for every Church age a prophet teaches us that he and he says he was the nician spirit to begin with and then he become incarnate in a man a pope in the Nan Council about 300 years after the death of Christ then he was crowned and received the throne and was crowned that's called the the Roman Catholic church and then he then then he served that for a long time as we will see as as we will see as the seals break the revelation of the seals breaking for when he preached this in 1963 all the seals all seven Parts had opened up because when Elijah's Ministry was finished John the Baptist when he finished his ministry and during his ministry the first seal had opened because the opening of the Lamb's Book of Life was the opening of the first seal part one Redemption had begun restoration had begun that's what these seven parts are all about that's what these Seven Seals are all about Israel the bow Rome the crown church and state in an invisible Union to crucify the word made flesh and it repeats again in the last age Le in the last seal the seventh Revelations 6 and verse 1 and 2 again and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals part one of the Lamb's Book and the lamb is opening his book and I heard as it were the noise of a thunder so a thunder is the voice of God when a seal is open and one of the four be say so the lamb opened the book but the first one to start speaking and [Music] teaching was one of the four beasts we now know that that was the lion Beast and the lion said come and see who was the lion the same one who was the lamb it was another Ministry of the king lion lamb evangelist Prophet Apostle Pastor evangelist teacher the five Ministry is the ministry of the king that's what he gave to the church when he arose and went on high he never left us did he he's always been with us in some form or another he never left his children in some form he's never left you there's been ways that he touched your heart God did through some person some brother that you can remember that chased you down and wouldn't leave you alone and you said why don't this man leave me alone because it was Jesus coming after you calling you pulling you Revelation 6 and I saw when the lamb opened one of the seals and I heard as it were the noise of Thunder one of the the four Beast saying come and see and I saw him Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and he went forth conquering and to conquer we can never read it the same again for now we see it the white horse rider was Lucifer and he had both the Orthodox Jewish Church in his hand the bow and Pagan Rome in his hand the crown Lucifer had them both you say the church the biggest denomination of that day Lucifer had in his hand and it hasn't changed today he's got the church the biggest denominations in the world in his hand he's got Joe Biden in his hand he's got Putin in his hand he he had Chavez in his hand he's got Bui in his hand he's got all the leaders of the nation in his hand along with all the churches he's planning to do the same thing again he thinks he's got a greater Army to to support him now he wants to crucify the word destroy it the words is being made flesh in you and I but he can't kill a Son of God he can only send us home soon and as soon as we leave this body we're in a new body if you don't have no hair on your head as soon as you change into you say wow wow I got hair on my head you look at your hands you say those hands look young you start walking around see that whole hip replacement doesn't bother me at all no more oh Hallelujah you see what it's like when the eyes of understanding when we start seeing Jesus in the word then we start seeing Jesus in US Glory the fact that the boat had no arrows simply meant that the judeo church under the law of Moses claiming to be Abraham's children had no power to put Jesus of Nazareth to death they needed to enter into an invisible Union with Rome and Lucifer made it possible he's making it possible yet today the Orthodox Church was no longer the Church of God they were a deceitful bubble in the hands of Lucifer and I saw verse two of Psalm of Revelation 6 and I saw can Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him and with this bow and with this crown with Israel the church and Rome the Pagan Nation Lucifer went forth conquering and to conquer but who did he go to conquer the Believers the were now following Jesus that believed that he was Messiah King of the Jews those are the ones he went to conquer we no longer believe the old Dogma that this was Jesus's followers taking Kingdom by force with violence how do you follow Jesus and remain a violent man how do you follow Jesus and remain a violent woman this wasn't Jesus's followers this was Israel the church and Pagan Rome both in the hands of this white horse rider and he's rushing forward now to try to stop this move of God to put an end to this evangelist that's having great success praying for the sick and now he's begun teaching them teaching them things contrary to the law he said you have heard by them of old Thou shalt not kill but I say unto you whoa stop right there I don't want to hear no more that the crowd said I only accept what the prophet said mes and if he didn't say it that way Moses I want nothing to do for it huh they say that today oh stop I don't remember brother bam said that and I only accept and I'll stay with only what a prophet say is made that statement and it cost them it cost them they were thrown into tribulation after tribulation seven Church ages that were scattered the world because a greater than Moses had come to to give to give them the revelation of the proverb Thou shalt not kill to give them the revelation of the proverb Thou shalt not commit adultery to give them the revelation of all of those Proverbs that's what Ten Commandments were Proverbs that would be changed for a better Covenant Proverbs of whom of which you would be given the revelation of a life that you could live that would make you worthy of the Gospel found in the Lamb's Book of Life and in the word here and I saw and behold a white horse rider and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto him the word and connects the bow and the crown and this riter with this bow and this Crown connected he went forth conquering and to conquer so the word and is the merger and it's the union of church and state Jewish church and Pagan Rome and he Lucifer the white horse rider used them both to crucify him Jesus king of the Jews and when he merged them together and when he merged them together church and state then he used them and went out conquering and to conquer the Disciples of John and of Jesus the kingdom of God suffereth violence and in the days of the first Elijah John the Baptist the bow and the crown were already persecuting the mystical body of Jesus Christ the bow was the Orthodox Church under the law of Moses and the crown was Pagan Rome and anointed of Lucifer they had already begun their rid in the Days of Elijah you know that's what how it's written they had already begun their ride Days of Elijah when the first seal open when the the Lamb's Book of Life part one was released to the world it's a Plan of Salvation it still is today it's a plan of change it still is today it's a plan for his children to be reunited with the father it's a plan for the bride to be caught away to the wedding suppers of the Lamb husband and wife together again like it was in Eden before the fall both the bow and the crown were Violent Men the judeo church the hierarchy from the high priest to the lowliest levite were men of violence you say the church make one mistake break one of their traditions and most of the time the sentence was Stone him to death so both the ball and the crown were Violent Men and they brought violence to the king of Heaven even in the days of the first Elijah John and thus it had begun a Plan of Redemption for the Fig Tree and the bride tree the first shield was loosed the book that was closed now open in the days of John the Baptist in the days of Jesus in the days of this Lamb of God the lamb opened it the lamb Ministry opened it the lion Ministry at the opening of the first SE began revealing it began teaching it Redemption had begun and the price that had been paid before before the foundation of the world was now to be manifested on earth as the lion Ministry would be paused for a moment so the lamb Ministry could do its part salvation for all people and when and when salvation for the Bride of Jesus Christ when the last member of this mystical body is raptured then the king comes down again Lion of the tribe of Judah King of the Jews and once again he takes the same message to Israel again to 144,000 he won't let his word return voy he will bring Salvation to Israel to his chosen people not every Israelite is chosen not every Jew is part of that remnant just like not every Gentile is the seat of God we've been chosen we were in the mind of God before the foundation of world and it's for you he died for his family his children for his daughter for his son Revelation 62 apocalypsis says and I saw him Behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow so now we realize not everything white in scriptures means it's God sometimes it's the Devil Himself and I saw and behold a white horse and he that sat on him had a bow and a crown was given unto to him and he went forth conquering to conquer so what also had begun here was a time of great violence that's what conquering means when Rome conquered the world it was great violence for the world when the Ottoman Empire conquered Rome it was great violence for the the people so this one comes and he went forth conquering to conquer so it began in the days of John the Baptist for the children of God and for the people of the world time of great violence a time of vandalism a time of looting a time of persecution a time of of censorship a time of boycotts against a New Testament Church rising up in the days of Jesus this is all happening today in our day you know why because the pale horse rider he wants you off the scene you make him nervous he's afraid you won't stop witnessing and bring in another son and daughter of God [Music] he's afraid that our testimony will break the shackles that's holding someone he's got a hold of he's acting with all his violence because he's more scared of you than you think he is because we're Sons and Daughters of God and we don't fear Him this was the opening this day of the loosing of the first seal part one of seven parts to save you baptize you fill you and refill you make you perfect even as my Father which is in heaven is perfect God rich in Mercy in closing turn to Matthew 11 Matthew 11 and verse 1 and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his 12 disciples of setting his church in order remember the unfolding of his ministry how did he get here he began as an evangelist and it goes unfolding evangelist a teacher in Matthew 56 and7 a prophet in Matthew 9 he said to a man sick of the py shaking he'd been AF afflicted for years he said my son go in good cheer thy sins are all forgiven he didn't do that to make the scribes angry he did that to show us who he was for who can forgive sins but the Lamb of God go God in that Ministry God in that attribute God in that body he shed his blood he's washed you and I with the blood of the lamb and our sins which are many all forgiven Hallelujah Matthew 111 Jesus teaching them that the first seal has opened and he'll even tell us when it will and it came to pass when Jesus made an end of commanding his 12 disciples he departed then to teach and to preach in their cities what was the opening of the first seal come and see a teaching it had begun the Revelation had begun the actual opening of the seal began with the ministry of John the Baptist so by the time Jesus teaches on it it had been open for a while already just like by the time the Holy Spirit speaks to us of the opening of The Seven Seals in 1963 they' already been open for a while you see the pattern of his word a teaching now when John had heard in the prison The Works of Christ he sent his two disciples Elijah is about to leave this world in a terrible car accident but his ministry is over it's done you well what was going to follow what do we do without John the Baptist who's to come after Jesus the lamb The Lion The Savior verse three and said unto him art thou he that should come now when John had heard verse two in prison the works of Christ he sent two of his disciples John was struggling he had great complexes of rejection he's sitting in prison wonder if I made a mistake you know people are saying you you only said that John cuz he's your cousin we see how you two cousins are trying to get together on this thought and he's laying in prison he said is said him is it not him we didn't really grow up together I don't really know him that well I don't even know why that day I said Behold the Lamb of God it just came out of my mouth Lord was that you speaking through me he's thinking all these thoughts as he's waiting to be beheaded so he sends two of his disciples and they say art thou that are he that should come or do we look for another Jesus answered and said unto them I want you to stay in the meeting I want you to listen to The Gospel preached then go back and tell John as Witnesses of what your eyes have SE Jesus answered and said unto him verse four go and show John again those things which you do hear and see in this teaching that I'm bringing the blind receive their sight the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf here the dead are raised up and the poor all of these poor have the gospel preached to them because one day the blind that see will pass away one day the lame that walked will pass away one day the lepers that were cleansed will pass away one day the deaf that hear will pass away one day the dead that were raised up will die again but the poor to whom the gospel is preached they will never die this is a life this word is the resurrection to your this is what will raise you up again and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me between verse 5 and six Jesus discerns the the people that are listening and he said whoa there's a lot of people resenting what I just said that's almost the majority of thisd he discerned their hearts he caught their thoughts and he didn't speak to the ones that were offended instead he gave a blessing to that little flock in the midst of these thousands he said blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me and those that were not offended they said thank you Jesus that helps me because your word don't offend me oh must be something deep within me there must be something within me that's been holding the rain and keeping me loving you serving you standing back up when I fall oh it's had to be you all the time and as they Departed the offended ones Jesus began to say unto the multitudes John he's teaching us how the first seal open it's a pattern and since they be parted Jesus began to say unto the multitudes concerning John what went ye out unto the Wilderness to see regardless if it's the Wilderness of Judea or the Wilderness of Kentucky what went ye out to see a re shaken with the wind but what went you out to see a man clothed in soft rment like some pink velvet coat behold they that wear soft clothing are in King's houses and you know what Kings have done to their people but what when you out to see a prophet yay and I say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom Whom It is written behold I send my messenger before thy face he's quoting now the words of Malachi 3 which shall prepare the way before thee then he says verely I say unto you among them that are born of women there has not risen a greater than John the Baptist not withstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he for John was sent to serve God's people and not be a lord over them and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force what was Jesus teaching Us in the days of John the Baptist the first seal open the white horse rider who came out conquering to conquer it began in the ministry of John began in the ministry of Elijah the opening of the first seal then what would the opening of the seventh seal be when would it have begun could it be that the seventh seal open happened in the Days of Elijah also like the first seal had opened in the Days of Elijah could the pattern carry over to the second coming also I think so because the scripture we read Hebrews 138 Jesus Christ is the same as the opening of the first seal as he is at the opening of the seven and from the days of John the Baptist Elijah until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent and the white horse rider had a bow and a crown and he went forth conquering causing violence and with violence trying to take the children of God by force and they did they killed them they murdered them they put them in Roman prisons they scattered them till there wasn't one of them left in Jerusalem Lucifer lucif and the first seal opened in the days of this Elijah at the first coming of Christ just like the seventh seal open in the Days of Elijah the second coming of Christ because he's the same yesterday today and forever but verse 12 and 13 brother Daniel doesn't say he was Elijah verse 14 so when you ask the question don't say I don't know no say you need to keep reading verse 14 says and if you'll receive it this is Elijah which was to come in Malachi 4 6 this is the Elijah that would turn the hearts of the fathers to the children comma then 2,000 years would pass and at the second coming Elijah would be again and he would turn the hearts children back to the Pentecostal [Music] father he that has ears to hear let him here as we stand to our feet the pattern of God's word it's it's just perfect each and every time let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you once again for the attented for the attention of your people those here and those listening in we pray that Revelation would strike their hearts that they could see that there's no mediator between God and man except the man Christ Jesus the only one our Lord Our Savior our baptizer the Lamb with a plan to restore us change us save us bring us
