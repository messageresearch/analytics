[21:13] scripture and the Book of Romans it says
[21:16] Romans 14:1 17 to 19 it says for the
[21:20] kingdom of God is not in meat and drink
[21:23] but righteousness and peace and joy in
[21:25] the Holy Ghost for he that in these
[21:28] things serveth Christ is acceptable to
[21:31] God and approved of men let us therefore
[21:35] follow after the things which make for
[21:38] peace and things wherewith one may edify
[21:42] another and then the second the last
[21:44] scripture I want to read is 2
[21:46] Corinthians chap 3 verse

[22:11] declared to be the Epistle of Christ
[22:13] ministered by
[22:15] US Written not with
[22:18] ink written not with
[22:21] ink but with the spirit of the Living
[22:26] God not in tables of stone own but in
[22:29] fleshly tables of the
[22:32] heart praise
[22:35] God we we just want to praise the Lord
[22:38] and you know brother brandom said
[22:41] that he would rather
[22:44] you rather than you preach him a sermon
[22:47] he'd rather you live him a sermon and
[22:49] that's
[22:50] what by God's spirit we desire to do
[22:53] we've fallen short many times but God
[22:56] knows our heart and our desire is to
[22:59] follow him and and to live a life that
[23:01] would be pleasing to him Lord help each
[23:04] one of

[43:15] Lord it would come to
[43:19] pass and he spoke at 500
[43:23] years it sat for 500 years
[43:28] years and came to pass one
[43:32] day there in the city of
[43:35] Jerusalem Isaiah 9 and verse
[43:43] 9 Rejoice greatly oh Daughter of
[43:48] Zion Oh daughter of
[43:52] Jerusalem Behold thy King cometh unto

[44:01] and riding upon an
[44:06] ass and upon a cult and the fo of an
[44:10] ass it was a
[44:13] prophecy that one day the King of Kings
[44:17] would ride into
[44:21] Jerusalem and the people would throw
[44:23] Palms down down down before him on the
[44:26] road into
[44:30] Jerusalem and the same Palms they would
[44:32] take and wave them before
[44:37] him it was a a
[44:40] symbol it was a tradition in those
[44:44] days it's what people
[44:46] did when they were honoring giving
[44:49] respect to to to a great conqueror that
[44:52] was coming back
[44:56] home
[44:58] a great
[45:01] conqueror or they would do it to honor a
[45:03] king coming into the
[45:08] city and this truly was a
[45:11] king was the King of Kings he was the
[45:15] king of
[45:17] Jerusalem he was the king who would have
[45:19] a bride and a
[45:25] wife verse n again Rejoice greatly oh

[47:06] be
[47:10] seated this this
[47:14] morning we'd like to speak on a
[47:18] subject of what does Jesus really look
[47:24] like this is as many of you know it's
[47:28] it's called Palm
[47:33] Sunday the the world celebrates it as
[47:35] Palm
[47:39] Sunday Palm Sunday was the Sunday before
[47:42] the
[47:46] crucifixion the next Sunday would be the
[47:52] crucifixion on on this
[47:54] day on a Sunday
[47:57] that we now celebrate as Palm
[48:02] Sunday on that day over 2,000 years
[48:07] ago the Common
[48:10] People heard Jesus
[48:17] gladly and that particular
[48:21] day he asked his disciples to do
[48:25] something for him
[48:29] he chose two of
[48:31] them he said I have a job for you to do
[48:34] this
[48:36] morning I want you to go down to such
[48:39] and such a
[48:43] corner and there you're going to find an
[48:48] ass and the cult of an
[48:52] ass and I want you to bring both of them
[48:55] back to me
[48:59] what was
[49:01] happening was thus sayth the Lord been
[49:04] spoken 500 years
[49:08] ago they didn't know it but they were in
[49:11] the
[49:12] vision it was happening that
[49:15] moment oh in this morning there's many

[49:38] future will take
[49:40] it to see the prophecies that are
[49:45] happening that are anointing us there
[49:48] should be anointing us that should be

[49:55] strength
[49:57] prophecies oh that should be restoring
[50:00] the joy of our Salvation to our
[50:04] hearts so here they
[50:06] were it was Palm
[50:09] Sunday and
[50:11] Jesus the anointing came
[50:14] down of thus sayth the Lord of what
[50:18] Zachariah had
[50:19] said turn with me to Matthew
[50:25] 21
[50:30] you remember the
[50:33] scripture it's when Jesus is riding
[50:37] in Matthew chapter
[50:41] 21 we'll start at verse
[50:45] one and it reads like this and when they
[50:49] drew nigh unto Jerusalem and were come
[50:51] to Beth Page unto the Mount of olive
[50:54] then sent Jesus two
[51:05] disciples two chosen
[51:09] men they didn't know what they were
[51:12] doing they they didn't understand what
[51:15] was going to happen that
[51:18] morning in the Simplicity of what they
[51:21] were asked to
[51:23] do they were fulfilling thus saith the
[51:27] Lord did you catch that in the
[51:32] Simplicity Jesus asking
[51:35] them there's a couple of
[51:38] donkeys and they're tied
[51:42] somewhere they're right there they're
[51:43] they're tied on a post at the 67th in
[51:49] Glendale and I want you to go untie
[51:53] them and bring them to me they didn't
[51:56] know that they were
[51:59] walking in the power of the spoken
[52:03] word SP 500 years
[52:07] before they thought they were just doing
[52:09] something
[52:12] nice they they they said well if we find
[52:16] them um who are
[52:19] they it doesn't matter who they
[52:23] are but the owner will come out
[52:27] and he'll
[52:29] say what are you doing with my
[52:33] donkeys you tell
[52:35] him the
[52:37] master has need of
[52:42] them you won't you don't know
[52:45] him he doesn't know
[52:48] you but you tell him the master has need
[52:51] of
[52:54] them and he'll smile
[52:57] SM and he'll say of course take it was
[53:02] [Music]
[53:04] Supernatural they were walking into a
[53:07] supernatural
[53:11] scene and none of them knew
[53:15] it they couldn't even feel it
[53:19] perhaps they just thought it's something
[53:23] strange oh maybe you feel it's something
[53:25] strange this
[53:29] morning walked into a
[53:32] scene predestinated before the
[53:35] foundation of the
[53:37] world the Holy Spirit wants to speak to
[53:41] your
[53:42] heart he wants to share something with
[53:46] you thus sayth the Lord for a need you
[53:52] have or something you're struggling
[53:55] with
[53:58] sickness something tormenting
[54:01] you this morning the king wants to walk
[54:06] into your
[54:11] life verse
[54:14] two he sends two of his
[54:18] disciples saying unto them go into the
[54:20] village over against you and straight
[54:23] way you shall find an ass tide and a
[54:26] cold with her loose them and bring them
[54:29] unto
[54:39] me so now the word is
[54:44] unfolding and Jesus is adding
[54:47] [Music]
[54:48] details that Zachariah didn't speak
[54:52] of that's the way prophecy
[54:55] works
[54:57] you can't take just one
[55:01] prophecy put a period on
[55:04] it and then say what it
[55:07] means or what you think it
[55:10] means Bible
[55:12] prophecy interprets Bible
[55:19] prophecy you add prophecy upon
[55:23] prophecy word upon word
[55:27] line upon
[55:29] line that's how God interprets his own
[55:34] word so now
[55:36] Jesus is adding
[55:39] detail to the prophecy of
[55:42] Zariah that's unfolding
[55:44] here part of the prophecy
[55:47] was that Zechariah didn't
[55:51] say was that this man
[55:54] Jesus would send two disciples
[55:59] to go get those two
[56:02] donkeys part of the prophecy what Jesus
[56:07] added that they would go to the Village
[56:10] next to
[56:15] them which Isaiah didn't
[56:19] mention so this was Jesus
[56:22] now this is Jehovah this is the creator
[56:26] of heavens and
[56:28] earth adding more detail to the
[56:34] prophecy and he said unto
[56:38] them and if any man verse three say
[56:41] ought unto ye you shall say the Lord
[56:43] hath need of them and straight way he
[56:46] will send
[56:55] them how can you just get up one
[56:59] morning and the Holy Spirit anoints you
[57:02] to go
[57:05] somewhere and go and speak to
[57:11] someone and then and them fulfill a need
[57:15] that you
[57:16] have and and and
[57:22] they thus sayth the Lord God ordained it
[57:26] in your life before the foundation of
[57:28] the
[57:31] world you go because he sends
[57:34] you but you don't know what's happening
[57:39] next but if God is in the
[57:44] mix it's because he's going to bring
[57:46] something to
[57:48] pass and verse four it tells us why all
[57:53] this was
[57:55] happening
[57:56] it says all this was
[58:00] done the two
[58:03] disciples the two the two
[58:06] donkeys going off into a little village
[58:09] somewhere what was the
[58:12] purpose what was anointing this to
[58:16] happen all this was done that it might
[58:18] be fulfilled which was spoken by the
[58:24] prophet Z
[58:27] who said tell ye the daughter of
[58:31] Zion Behold thy King cometh unto
[58:37] thee like no other
[58:41] king is
[58:43] Meek sitting upon an ass and the
[58:47] cult of an
[58:51] ass and the disciples
[58:54] went and did as Jesus commanded
[58:58] them even though they didn't
[59:03] understand even though they didn't
[59:05] remember the prophecy of
[59:08] Zechariah verse seven says and they
[59:10] brought the ass and the cold and put and
[59:13] put them and put on them their clothes
[59:17] and they set him
[59:24] thereon they decorated
[59:27] it they
[59:31] decorated as when a
[59:33] king or a great
[59:36] conqueror his horse comes
[59:41] decorated with beautiful
[59:45] robes and then this conqueror this King
[59:47] rides into the city with
[59:52] it and the
[59:54] disciples anointed of God
[59:57] not knowing
[59:59] why they took off their
[1:00:02] robes and they draped it over this
[1:00:06] donkey they said Lord now you can ride
[1:00:09] on
[1:00:10] it on
[1:00:14] it Andrew said to
[1:00:16] John why' you do
[1:00:19] that I don't know it just seemed like
[1:00:21] the right thing to
[1:00:24] do have you ever done anything that
[1:00:27] seemed like the right thing to do and it
[1:00:35] was it was God anointing
[1:00:37] you to bring something to
[1:00:41] pass in your
[1:00:44] life never be
[1:00:47] afraid of doing
[1:00:50] something that'll help
[1:00:52] someone because it's God anointing
[1:00:57] no they might say it's none of your
[1:01:01] business what if they don't like at me
[1:01:03] helping
[1:01:05] them oh put away the feeling of
[1:01:10] rejection and be anointed of the Holy
[1:01:16] Spirit do
[1:01:18] something for a fellow member of the
[1:01:20] Bride of Jesus
[1:01:24] Christ
[1:01:27] verse six says and the disciples went
[1:01:29] and did as Jesus commanded

[1:09:58] it because it was
[1:10:00] written my house shall be called The

[1:10:07] Prayer not a house of
[1:10:10] debate a House of
[1:10:12] Prayer not a house of
[1:10:16] sin not a house of buying and
[1:10:21] selling my house will be a House of

[1:11:40] ministers that won't make
[1:11:44] it that'll wind up in a lake of
[1:11:48] fire instead of God's
[1:11:52] Millennium because of what they have
[1:11:54] done
[1:11:57] to the
[1:11:58] doves to the
[1:12:00] Lambs of
[1:12:08] God verse

[1:12:14] him in the

[1:12:30] him in the temple and he healed
[1:12:36] them that's what the temple was
[1:12:40] for not for
[1:12:43] selling not for
[1:12:46] buying not to make merchandise of the

[1:12:54] in
[1:12:57] that he might heal the
[1:13:02] lame that he might give the blind
[1:13:07] sight that he might give those that are
[1:13:09] depressed
[1:13:12] joy that he could take away the
[1:13:14] arrogance from some and give them a
[1:13:16] spirit of
[1:13:22] meekness so that you could come to God's
[1:13:24] house
[1:13:27] and learn that
[1:13:29] you can be a
[1:13:32] peacemaker in your
[1:13:35] home it doesn't have to be a
[1:13:39] home where you fight with your sons and
[1:13:41] daughters all
[1:13:44] day it shouldn't
[1:13:46] be it should be a

[1:20:32] God raise up unto you of your
[1:20:37] brethren unto
[1:20:39] me him shall ye hear in all
[1:20:44] things whatsoever he shall say unto
[1:20:48] you and it shall come to
[1:20:51] pass that every
[1:20:53] soul
[1:20:56] which will not hear that
[1:20:58] Prophet shall be destroyed from among
[1:21:01] the
[1:21:03] people that Prophet is
[1:21:06] Jesus yay and all the prophets from
[1:21:11] Samuel and those that follow
[1:21:13] after as many as have
[1:21:17] spoken have like why for told of these
[1:21:23] days then Peter said ye are children of
[1:21:27] the
[1:21:29] prophets and of the Covenant which God
[1:21:31] made with our
[1:21:33] fathers saying unto Abraham in thy seed
[1:21:37] shall all the K of the earth be
[1:21:41] blessed unto you first
[1:21:44] God having raised up his son
[1:21:47] Jesus sent him to bless you in in
[1:21:51] turning away every one of you
[1:21:56] from his
[1:21:58] iniquities Jesus
[1:22:03] alone Jesus
[1:22:07] alone can turn
[1:22:10] you from your
[1:22:13] iniquities no man can do
[1:22:17] that God can use
[1:22:20] men but it wasn't the man that turned
[1:22:23] you
[1:22:25] if your heart was
[1:22:27] turned it's a supernatural work of the
[1:22:30] Holy
[1:22:34] Spirit here Jesus tells
[1:22:37] us this
[1:22:40] Prophet is
[1:22:44] Jesus in Hebrews chapter
[1:22:51] 3 Jesus's prophet
[1:22:58] Hebrews chapter
[1:23:01] 3 beginning at verse
[1:23:04] one the Apostle Paul once
[1:23:07] again a great man of
[1:23:09] God he wrote almost half of the New
[1:23:15] Testament he wrote it but he didn't make
[1:23:19] it
[1:23:21] up no God told told
[1:23:25] him what to
[1:23:27] say to
[1:23:29] write because it was God's
[1:23:34] word verse one wherefore holy Brethren
[1:23:38] partakers of the Heavenly
[1:23:44] calling consider the Apostle and high
[1:23:47] priest of our
[1:23:51] profession who is it Christ
[1:23:56] Jesus so Jesus Peter said he's a
[1:24:02] prophet Paul said he's
[1:24:05] Apostle he he he is Apostle and high
[1:24:08] priest of our
[1:24:11] profession he's
[1:24:15] Prophet so Jesus is both
[1:24:20] Prophet Apostle long before anyone else
[1:24:24] could fulfill these
[1:24:31] Ministries Jesus these are the
[1:24:34] ministries of Jesus
[1:24:36] Christ in St John chapter
[1:24:42] 3 St
[1:24:45] John chapter
[1:24:47] 3 you remember the
[1:24:49] story Jesus goes to Nicodemus uh
[1:24:55] Jesus
[1:24:58] goes and in and in verse one of John
[1:25:02] 3 Bible says there was a man of the
[1:25:07] Pharisees named
[1:25:09] Nicodemus a ruler of the
[1:25:12] Jews the same came to Jesus by
[1:25:17] night you know why he
[1:25:20] came because the Holy Spirit pulled him
[1:25:26] it may have looked to
[1:25:29] people like he went to
[1:25:34] Jesus no doubt he thought about
[1:25:38] it day after day weeks
[1:25:42] passed months passed finally something
[1:25:46] gave him the
[1:25:50] courage it was the Holy Spirit that gave
[1:25:53] him the courage
[1:25:56] has there ever been something in your
[1:26:01] life that you know you knew you had to
[1:26:03] make right with
[1:26:07] somebody and days passed and weeks
[1:26:11] pass and it won't leave
[1:26:14] you maybe a year
[1:26:18] passed and you say no I can't take it no
[1:26:23] more finally you go and ask for
[1:26:29] forgiveness because it was God that
[1:26:32] pulled you
[1:26:33] finally it was the spirit that gave you
[1:26:36] the courage that you didn't have
[1:26:40] within that was
[1:26:44] Nicodemus verse two says the same came
[1:26:46] to Jesus by night and said unto
[1:26:52] him rabbi
[1:26:55] we
[1:26:56] know me and other
[1:26:59] rabbis me and other denominational
[1:27:05] preachers me and other me other pastors
[1:27:08] in the
[1:27:11] message we know that thou art a teacher
[1:27:13] come from
[1:27:16] God for no man can these
[1:27:20] Miracles th doest except God be with
[1:27:26] him Jesus answered and said unto
[1:27:30] him oh well thank you I'm glad you can
[1:27:33] recognize my Ministry and and how great
[1:27:35] I
[1:27:42] am how great I
[1:27:44] am he didn't say
[1:27:46] that he didn't have time to waste
[1:27:51] words he knew who he was
[1:27:55] what he wanted that
[1:27:57] morning he wanted Nicodemus to recognize
[1:28:00] who he
[1:28:03] was and the opportunity that laid before
[1:28:07] him of a born again
[1:28:11] experience of a refilling of the Holy
[1:28:14] Ghost he wanted
[1:28:17] Nicodemus to
[1:28:19] see what was before him the opportunity
[1:28:23] he had this
[1:28:26] morning Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:28:29] verely verely I say unto
[1:28:32] you except a man be born
[1:28:35] again he cannot see the
[1:28:38] kingom who was
[1:28:41] Jesus a
[1:28:43] teacher Peter said he's a
[1:28:46] prophet Paul said he's a chief
[1:28:53] Apostle
[1:28:56] Nicodemus
[1:28:57] said he's a teacher
[1:29:01] Prophet
[1:29:03] Apostle
[1:29:06] teacher Matthew chapter
[1:29:09] 4 and verse
[1:29:23] 12
[1:29:28] now when Jesus had heard that John was
[1:29:32] cast into prison he departed into
[1:29:39] Galilee the ministry of
[1:29:43] Elijah the
[1:29:45] Forerunner had
[1:29:47] ended he was going off the
[1:29:51] scene God was successful
[1:29:56] in the ministry of the first
[1:30:00] Elijah and when that first Elijah went
[1:30:02] off the
[1:30:05] scene it's because he had done
[1:30:07] everything God wanted him to
[1:30:12] do now maybe John had things he wanted
[1:30:16] to
[1:30:18] do but God said no it's over it's
[1:30:22] done you have
[1:30:25] done everything I wanted you to
[1:30:29] do Elijah I'm taking you home
[1:30:34] now and the pattern of the first
[1:30:37] Elijah at the first
[1:30:39] coming is the pattern of the second
[1:30:43] Elijah at the second
[1:30:46] coming because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:30:50] yesterday today and
[1:30:52] forever
[1:30:55] he's unchanging in all his
[1:30:58] ways if
[1:31:00] Jesus God was
[1:31:05] successful in the ministry of John the
[1:31:09] Baptist first
[1:31:11] Elijah because it wasn't John's it
[1:31:14] wasn't John in
[1:31:17] control God in control of
[1:31:20] John then God was successful again
[1:31:26] coming in the second Elijah's
[1:31:31] Ministry to introduce the Lamb of God
[1:31:34] Jesus
[1:31:36] Christ to us and when and when the
[1:31:40] second Elijah went off the
[1:31:43] scene killed in an automobile
[1:31:51] accident in December 19
[1:31:56] 1965 it's because God in control of all
[1:32:05] things amen had his Prophet say
[1:32:08] everything he wanted him to
[1:32:13] say and if we're still not understanding
[1:32:16] what that Prophet
[1:32:20] said we don't need him to come back
[1:32:25] we need Jesus to come to
[1:32:29] us and reveal to
[1:32:32] us what he
[1:32:34] said through the mouth of a
[1:32:37] prophet or else we break the pattern of
[1:32:41] God's
[1:32:45] word because Jesus
[1:32:47] Christ is the same
[1:32:50] yesterday
[1:32:51] today and forever
[1:32:57] so when John
[1:32:59] went who did the poor people have to
[1:33:02] lead
[1:33:06] them
[1:33:09] Jesus and when William brandham
[1:33:13] left who did all these poor people us
[1:33:15] have to lead
[1:33:20] us you and
[1:33:22] I who will lead us the Holy
[1:33:27] Spirit Jesus Christ the Lamb of God the
[1:33:32] one who died on the cross of
[1:33:35] Calvary for you and
[1:33:45] me Matthew
[1:33:47] 4 and verse
[1:33:49] 12 now when Jesus had heard that John
[1:33:52] was cast into prison
[1:33:55] he departed into
[1:34:05] Galilee you know why John was finally
[1:34:08] cast into
[1:34:13] prison because God allowed
[1:34:17] it CU he was going to take him
[1:34:20] home he had said everything that he
[1:34:23] wanted him to
[1:34:27] say he had suffered long
[1:34:31] enough in his short life of 30
[1:34:38] years and God was taking him
[1:34:43] home verse
[1:34:45] 13 and leaving Nazareth he came and
[1:34:47] dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea
[1:34:49] Coast in the borders of Zebulon and
[1:34:52] nephthalim
[1:35:01] all this was
[1:35:03] happening John going off the
[1:35:07] scene being cast in
[1:35:11] prison was going to be
[1:35:17] beheaded Jesus was beginning his
[1:35:21] ministry and it was all happening
[1:35:24] happing verse
[1:35:26] 14 that it might be fulfilled which was
[1:35:28] spoken by Isaiah the
[1:35:32] prophet saying the land of zebon and the
[1:35:35] land of
[1:35:39] Naim by the way of the
[1:35:42] sea Beyond
[1:35:44] Jordan Galilee of the
[1:35:47] Gentiles the people which sat in
[1:35:49] darkness saw great
[1:35:52] light and to them which sat in the
[1:35:55] region and shadow of death light is
[1:35:56] sprung
[1:36:01] up and from that
[1:36:03] time Jesus began to
[1:36:06] preach to say repent for the Kingdom of
[1:36:11] Heaven is at hand and Jesus began his
[1:36:17] ministry as an
[1:36:19] evangelist praying for the
[1:36:21] sick calling soul to come and
[1:36:25] repent for the Kingdom of
[1:36:28] Heaven is at
[1:36:33] hand Jesus J Prophet Propet Apostle AP
[1:36:39] teacher evangelist turn with me to First
[1:36:52] Peter first Peter chapter
[1:36:58] 5 and we'll be begin reading at verse
[1:37:03] one and it says like this the Apostle
[1:37:07] Peter Apostle
[1:37:11] Prophet the elders which are among you I
[1:37:22] exhort it was a calling that few men
[1:37:27] had it was a
[1:37:33] calling and that was an
[1:37:36] elder who God would
[1:37:39] use to exort
[1:37:44] Elders it says who am also an elder and
[1:37:47] a witness of the sufferings of
[1:37:51] Christ and also a part partaker of the
[1:37:54] glory that shall be
[1:37:58] revealed he's saying there's great
[1:38:00] Revelations
[1:38:02] coming because Jesus died was
[1:38:07] buried and he is
[1:38:09] risen and he's opening the Lamb's Book
[1:38:12] of Life to
[1:38:14] us he's Ling the seals that have it
[1:38:18] shut he's opening our blinded eyes and
[1:38:22] giving us understanding
[1:38:25] so that we can know what he once done
[1:38:27] with his
[1:38:33] word verse
[1:38:37] two feed the flock of God which is among
[1:38:43] you who is Peter speaking
[1:38:46] to to the
[1:38:51] elders don't make mer merchandise of the
[1:38:57] flock don't be a dictator over the
[1:39:02] flock don't tell them where to live and
[1:39:04] what to do and where to
[1:39:07] go no tell them you're praying for
[1:39:11] them that if they think they have to go
[1:39:14] somewhere
[1:39:16] else you'll be praying for him that God
[1:39:18] takes them where he wants them to
[1:39:22] be
[1:39:26] for a
[1:39:27] pastor to tell
[1:39:30] you you can't leave here you can't go
[1:39:34] nowhere you got to stay right
[1:39:37] here that's a
[1:39:41] dictator you know a prophet said
[1:39:45] that he said I'm not a
[1:39:49] dictator to tell you where to live
[1:39:54] and where to
[1:39:55] go you ask God to lead
[1:39:59] you and I'll
[1:40:01] pray that the leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:40:03] comes to your
[1:40:06] life but
[1:40:09] today men
[1:40:12] practice they've actually been
[1:40:16] practicing for the last 7,000
[1:40:19] years men controlling people
[1:40:28] Cain when he realized he couldn't
[1:40:31] control
[1:40:34] Abel he killed
[1:40:41] him men in their pulpits
[1:40:44] today when they realize they can't
[1:40:46] control
[1:40:49] you they try to kill your testimony
[1:40:56] it's been happening for 7,000
[1:41:01] years you say why do they do that
[1:41:03] brother
[1:41:05] Daniel because even though they're in
[1:41:07] the
[1:41:11] Pulpit they're not in
[1:41:14] Christ
[1:41:16] ministers not all of them have been born
[1:41:20] again ministers not all of them have the
[1:41:23] baptism of the Holy
[1:41:27] Ghost how will you know
[1:41:31] them because they'll feed the flock of
[1:41:36] God Peter said to
[1:41:39] them speaking to the elders in verse two
[1:41:43] of Peter
[1:41:44] 5 feed the flock of God which is among
[1:41:50] you taking the oversight there
[1:41:56] of not by constraint but
[1:42:02] willingly not for filthy
[1:42:06] looker in other words don't be a
[1:42:08] minister because you're gonna because
[1:42:10] you're GNA make a lot of money doing
[1:42:13] it don't do it he
[1:42:17] said don't do it for the
[1:42:20] money do it cuz you're called of God
[1:42:25] feed the flock of God to make the house
[1:42:29] of God a House of
[1:42:32] Prayer not a den of
[1:42:35] Thieves and the larg and the biggest
[1:42:40] thieves are in the
[1:42:45] pulpits not for filthy
[1:42:48] ler but of a ready
[1:42:52] mind neither as being Lords over God's
[1:42:58] Heritage but being examples to the
[1:43:05] flock and when the chief Shepherd shall
[1:43:10] appear you shall receive a Crown of
[1:43:14] Glory that fth not
[1:43:17] away Peter in the book of
[1:43:20] Acts he said Jesus
[1:43:23] was that
[1:43:25] Prophet Paul in the book of
[1:43:28] Hebrews he said Jesus was our
[1:43:32] Apostle Nicodemus in the Book of
[1:43:37] John he said Jesus we know thou art a
[1:43:40] teacher come from
[1:43:45] God in Matthew
[1:43:47] 4
[1:43:48] Matthew writes
[1:43:50] down the ministry of an
[1:43:55] called Jesus of
[1:43:58] Nazareth and
[1:44:00] Peter tells us
[1:44:02] here
[1:44:04] Jesus he's the chief
[1:44:09] Shepherd so the five full
[1:44:13] ministry was the was the
[1:44:16] gifts that God sent
[1:44:19] down from his very own
[1:44:22] lifeu
[1:44:24] so God has taken his five full
[1:44:30] ministry it's the characteristics of his
[1:44:36] nature that he
[1:44:39] manifested when he first
[1:44:42] opened the Lamb's Book of
[1:44:45] Life you know he was also the Lamb of
[1:44:51] God you know what book he was was
[1:44:55] opening he was opening his
[1:44:58] book to
[1:45:01] us so if the lamb is opening his book to
[1:45:06] us then isn't that the Lamb's
[1:45:10] Book and if his
[1:45:13] life isn't his book A book of
[1:45:18] life so isn't that the Lamb's Book of
[1:45:20] Life
[1:45:21] then
[1:45:23] turn with me to
[1:45:27] Revelations chapter one chapter 6 excuse
[1:45:36] me Revelations chapter 6 and verse
[1:45:40] one it's it's known to Bible readers as
[1:45:43] the first
[1:45:48] seal and the first
[1:45:50] seal is part one of seven
[1:45:55] parts that reveal to
[1:45:58] us the Lamb's Book of
[1:46:01] Life so it's the Lamb's Book of
[1:46:04] Life that was sealed with Seven
[1:46:08] Seals those seven seals are seven Parts
[1:46:14] unfolding A
[1:46:16] Plan of
[1:46:17] Salvation of
[1:46:19] redemption of how you can be justified
[1:46:22] by faith
[1:46:26] how you can be Sanctified by the
[1:46:31] spirit how you can be baptized with the
[1:46:33] Holy
[1:46:35] Ghost how all the these three things is
[1:46:38] the Born Again
[1:46:42] experience how then after this Born
[1:46:44] Again
[1:46:45] experience you can be a son and daughter
[1:46:49] being
[1:46:50] adopted to be to be Eternal as imperfect
[1:46:54] as the father is imp
[1:46:57] perfect oh that's what these Seven Seals
[1:47:02] held that's what these seven parts were
[1:47:04] all
[1:47:06] about it was it's about getting you back
[1:47:09] into his
[1:47:12] presence living daily in his
[1:47:16] presence being sensitive to his
[1:47:20] presence saying Lord
[1:47:23] I need more of
[1:47:27] you so now I
[1:47:29] realize to get more of
[1:47:33] you then I have to give
[1:47:37] you more of
[1:47:48] me
[1:47:49] I need more of
[1:47:51] him
[1:47:54] I'm not going to get
[1:47:56] it if I don't give
[1:47:59] him more of
[1:48:03] me I need more time on my
[1:48:07] knees I need more time asking him for
[1:48:13] Revelation to feed the flock of
[1:48:19] God I need to be led of his spirit
[1:48:24] I need to be a better husband to this
[1:48:26] fine little lady that
[1:48:30] she you know where the answer
[1:48:34] lays in the
[1:48:36] revelation of these Seven
[1:48:39] Seals and we're not
[1:48:41] waiting for these seals to be
[1:48:45] open we're waiting for this word of God
[1:48:48] to be
[1:48:51] revealed to me and each and every one of
[1:48:58] you
[1:49:00] Jesus Apostle AP Prophet propeta
[1:49:04] teacher evangelist evangelist these are
[1:49:08] the
[1:49:10] attributes and fivefold
[1:49:14] characteristics of the very nature of
[1:49:17] God it was to restore Fallen
[1:49:21] man it was how how to teach us how to
[1:49:23] act in his
[1:49:26] presence so we wouldn't grieve
[1:49:30] him not here in the church
[1:49:35] building oh no we all behave ourselves
[1:49:38] here but when you get
[1:49:41] home when you're with your husband when
[1:49:44] you're with your wife when you're with
[1:49:46] your
[1:49:50] children it's there in the those
[1:49:54] moments that's when we need to
[1:49:57] learn not to grieve
[1:50:01] him and he wants to teach
[1:50:04] us how not to grieve
[1:50:09] him if you want
[1:50:12] it and he wants
[1:50:21] it
[1:50:29] he wants to teach us how to act in his
[1:50:34] presence so we won't grieve
[1:50:36] him when he the holy
[1:50:40] spirit is wanting to pour
[1:50:43] out rivers of Living
[1:50:47] Waters to wash
[1:50:49] us with the

[1:51:03] lives this fivefold
[1:51:06] ministry to sound an
[1:51:10] alarm that the devil as a roaring lion
[1:51:15] who seeking to devour
[1:51:18] you God wants to bring you to a son and
[1:51:25] daughter passing through the rights of

[1:52:04] body as Paul spoke
[1:52:07] of in 1 Corinthians
[1:52:11] 12 in Romans
[1:52:16] 12 in Ephesians
[1:52:20] 4:11 Apostle Paul said this
[1:52:24] Ephesians
[1:52:27] 411 we'll be closing with this
[1:52:30] scripture and continue in the next
[1:52:35] service and Paul said and he gave some
[1:52:39] Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:52:42] evangelists and some pastors and
[1:52:51] teachers
[1:52:54] he gave
[1:52:57] some because some of them he didn't
[1:53:02] give some are
[1:53:08] Impostors
[1:53:10] imp some are unjust
[1:53:15] stewards some are
[1:53:18] liars the Bible says in Revelations 2 2
[1:53:22] and
[1:53:24] two in the Ephesian Church
[1:53:27] age he says I Know Thy works and thy
[1:53:32] labor Revelations 22 and thy
[1:53:37] patience and how thou can not bear them
[1:53:40] which are
[1:53:51] evil
[1:53:55] you cannot bear them which are evil he's
[1:53:58] telling the
[1:54:00] church who are these evil
[1:54:03] ones and thou has tried them which say
[1:54:06] they are Apostles
[1:54:10] and and has found them

[1:54:48] Apostles or so they said they
[1:54:51] were
[1:54:53] but by the
[1:54:55] word the church at
[1:54:58] Ephesus found them to be
[1:55:03] Liars instead of those that feed the
