[48:42] it is for Brethren to dwell together in
[48:52] unity it is like the precious ointment
[48:54] upon the head the Rand
[48:57] the that ran down upon the beard even
[48:59] Aaron's beard that went down to the
[49:00] skirts of his
[49:08] garments as a d of Herman and as the D
[49:10] that descended upon the mountains of
[49:12] Zion for there the Lord commanded the
[49:15] blessing even life for every
[49:18] Morey in the Book of
[49:21] Revelations chapter
[49:23] 22 verse 16
[49:27] John by a vision he says
[49:32] this speaking and repeating by
[49:34] inspiration the words of the Lord
[49:41] Jesus I Jesus have sent my angel to
[49:44] testify into the these things into the

[52:06] faith brother Daniel couldn't had a
[52:08] better
[52:10] mother than sister Francis Francis and I
[52:15] remember how that U going back in time
[52:18] that coming out of the off church it was
[52:21] a brother Angel that came to my dad
[52:27] no brother
[52:31] Angel brother brother Daniel's father
[52:33] now our parents had been going and
[52:35] seeing the Evangelist during the 50s and
[52:38] and into the early
[52:43] 60s and and they had seen a lot of
[52:47] Miracles a Allen or
[52:50] Roberts Allan Roberts for the Jaggers
[52:53] and Jagger Tommy higs Tommy osbor
[52:56] Tommy brother Bram was always way above
[52:59] everyone
[53:02] else my parents had the uh had the
[53:06] opportunity of of being in the prayer
[53:08] line in in Phoenix
[53:11] Arizona in
[53:15] 1957 when brother Brandon preached the
[53:17] message what think he of
[53:21] Christ and and brother BR stood there
[53:23] and discerned their hearts
[53:27] and and this this put brother bradam way
[53:30] above all the rest he didn't pull for
[53:35] money he they would never ask for
[53:37] money and they knew there was something
[53:40] special about this
[53:43] man so my dad would leave the apostolic
[53:46] church and start following the
[53:50] evangelists and then time would pass he'
[53:52] get tired of that and he'd come back to
[53:54] the Apostolic Church
[53:58] after doing that several
[54:00] times he told my he told my
[54:03] mom let's go back to the apostolic
[54:05] church he
[54:06] says we're going to we're going to stay
[54:08] there till the Lord
[54:10] comes and my mother
[54:12] said I followed you I don't know how
[54:14] many times in and
[54:17] out you see they were thirsty they were
[54:20] looking for
[54:22] something and he said he said she said
[54:25] if you leave this time I'm not going to
[54:26] follow
[54:28] you well it wasn't very
[54:31] long one day outside the church there in
[54:34] Theos the First Apostolic Church in
[54:36] Tucson on 12th
[54:41] Avenue I know my dad and brother Angel
[54:44] brother his dad they they helped build
[54:46] that
[54:49] church and uh they they the ones that
[54:52] laid the brick and and built that church
[54:54] up
[54:57] and uh so brother Angels tells my
[55:00] dad hey have you heard brother brandham
[55:02] sermons on
[55:05] tape and my dad say he's got sermons on
[55:10] tape and he said yeah you want to come
[55:12] on the house come over to the house and
[55:13] you can I'll let you hear
[55:16] one that was it he went home he says
[55:20] brother
[55:21] Bram is is Malachi
[55:25] 45 he's a prophet of this age he got the
[55:28] Revelation like
[55:30] that and he was out of the Apostolic
[55:33] Church it took my mom a few
[55:36] months but she followed him
[55:39] too and so we have this uh similarities
[55:43] brother Daniel and
[55:46] I and we were both under brother Isaac
[55:48] Nora for for some years
[55:51] well until it was time to move
[55:54] on and then later on we find ourselves
[55:57] pastoring
[56:00] churches and another similarity one is
[56:02] it's a it's a hard
[56:05] one I know that sister Karen brother
[56:07] Daniel you lost lost a
[56:12] child there's no
[56:17] pain greater than
[56:20] that we lost our child to our our
[56:24] firstborn our our dear Ruth
[56:28] conine Ruth conad Ruth conad she died
[56:32] about three years ago during the
[56:35] covid so for some reason God has allowed
[56:39] this and here we are touching base
[56:45] again and I know this it's the Lord
[56:48] amen so I thank brother Dan having the
[56:50] confidence to invite
[56:54] me uh to to to preach in his church
[56:58] amen and I want brother Danny to know

[57:22] half an hour and give the testimony the
[57:24] figuroa testimony like call
[57:30] it six healings that took place in our
[57:35] family through brother Brandon's
[57:38] Ministry 1 Timothy V chapter 2
[57:44] ver8 Paul writes here to a young man
[57:47] named
[57:50] Timothy he says I will therefore that
[57:52] men pray everywhere
[57:58] lifting up holy
[58:00] hands without wrath and
[58:04] doubting notice he says without wrath
[58:06] and
[58:09] doubting lifting up and praying
[58:13] everywhere lifting up our holy
[58:16] hands without any wrath in our
[58:19] hearts and without
[58:21] doubting father
[58:23] tonight we just want to give this
[58:26] this time to you
[58:29] Lord we we are inviting you as as a as a
[58:33] special guest tonight
[58:37] Lord Lord that maybe we could wash your
[58:39] feet tonight with our
[58:42] tears to serve you
[58:44] Lord there's no greater
[58:47] privilege there's no greater
[58:50] calling than to serve you and to be a
[58:54] servant of Christ
[58:57] and to be as far as Paul when he said I
[59:00] am a prisoner of
[59:03] Christ Lord here we
[59:06] are together to hear your
[59:09] word the word that you
[59:11] wrote and we ask that you will
[59:15] anoint everything we say tonight

[59:27] and anoint my lips to speak
[59:30] father and every heart to
[59:33] receive we be careful to give you the
[59:35] honor and the
[59:37] glory in Jesus name we pray and the C
[59:41] Church
[59:42] said God bless you may be seated this
[59:45] evening you want to hold this I'm GNA
[59:47] take off my
[59:49] coat you don't mind amen
[59:58] my message this this evening is a simple
[1:00:02] message I I I've titled it a call to
[1:00:08] prayer you know the the Muslims have
[1:00:10] what they call a call to
[1:00:14] prayer you probably hear them maybe in a
[1:00:17] video somewhere where they're
[1:00:22] wailing through some speakers throughout
[1:00:25] the whole city
[1:00:28] and the Muslims get on their
[1:00:31] knees and they face toward
[1:00:36] Mecca and they pray six times a
[1:00:40] day I wonder how many times we as
[1:00:42] Christians do we
[1:00:45] pray we don't have to be uh kneeling in
[1:00:47] in a secret place to
[1:00:51] pray although that has its
[1:00:54] place but Paul here
[1:00:57] said I would that men would pray
[1:00:59] everywhere I would that men would pray
[1:01:03] everywhere we can pray when we're
[1:01:06] driving you can pray when you're maybe a
[1:01:09] carpet or you're hammering
[1:01:12] away laying laying brick or driving down
[1:01:15] the
[1:01:16] road sisters can be praying while
[1:01:18] they're washing the
[1:01:20] dishes maybe they're vacuuming the floor
[1:01:23] I don't
[1:01:24] know but we can pray always
[1:01:27] there can be a prayer in our heart
[1:01:30] always and we are to pray and keep him
[1:01:32] in our mind and our
[1:01:35] heart throughout the
[1:01:37] day amen amen in Matthew chapter 6 verse
[1:01:43] 6 I'm going to have a few scriptures
[1:01:46] tonight so you might want to keep your
[1:01:48] Bible
[1:01:52] open blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:01:55] Matthew 66 Jesus says but thou when thou
[1:01:59] prayest enter into thy closet and when
[1:02:03] thou has shut the door pray to thy
[1:02:06] father which is in secret go
[1:02:14] ahead and thy father which seeth in
[1:02:19] secret shall reward thee
[1:02:22] openly see there's a time of prayer
[1:02:27] that we as Christians need to be setting
[1:02:29] aside every
[1:02:31] day they asked brother bandam a question
[1:02:34] one
[1:02:35] time they said brother BR how can we
[1:02:38] become greater
[1:02:40] Christians how can we have a greater
[1:02:42] victory in our
[1:02:44] life surely they thought brother Brandon
[1:02:47] would have
[1:02:48] said or you got to fast 40
[1:02:52] days you got to spend three days and
[1:02:55] shut up in the church
[1:02:57] Church no he said he said he said pray
[1:03:03] and read your Bible every
[1:03:06] day but for us it's too
[1:03:09] simple how can that give me that
[1:03:13] Victory try it and you'll
[1:03:16] see amen amen there's a time of prayer
[1:03:20] that we could lay
[1:03:22] aside when we close the door behind us
[1:03:27] by
[1:03:29] ourselves you know brother Brandon says
[1:03:31] when we pray at church many
[1:03:33] times or when we pray in
[1:03:37] public we our prayer is
[1:03:40] different but when we pray by
[1:03:43] ourselves and there's no one but God
[1:03:46] listening let me tell you your prayer
[1:03:49] becomes more
[1:03:51] personal because you're not saying that
[1:03:53] to bless somebody else
[1:03:56] but you're speaking from your
[1:03:58] heart and you're speaking to the heart
[1:04:00] of
[1:04:01] God there's something about the
[1:04:05] prayer the prayer of a
[1:04:08] saint In The Presence of
[1:04:13] Jehovah in the message faith that was
[1:04:16] once delivered to the
[1:04:19] Saints brother BR says he preaches in 55
[1:04:23] he says don't you like to get alone with
[1:04:25] the
[1:04:27] Lord my my just be
[1:04:32] alone there's sometimes we used to sing
[1:04:34] a little
[1:04:36] song There's sometimes like I like to be
[1:04:39] all alone with Christ my
[1:04:43] Lord did you ever hear
[1:04:45] it I can tell him all my troubles all
[1:04:50] alone and that's the way he wants to get
[1:04:53] you Prophet God say that's what that's
[1:04:56] where God wants
[1:04:58] you he wants to get you all alone to
[1:05:02] himself your prayer is not so much as
[1:05:05] when you are or maybe coming you know
[1:05:07] for
[1:05:10] instance uh well out in the public where
[1:05:12] you're praying like in the church or
[1:05:14] around the
[1:05:16] altar you get
[1:05:19] alone you'll pray a different
[1:05:22] prayer when you're by yourself
[1:05:25] that you do when you're than when you do
[1:05:28] when you're in
[1:05:30] public sleep
[1:05:33] alone all of you go out and just have a
[1:05:36] real secret meeting
[1:05:42] place where you and the
[1:05:45] Lord meet several times a day and
[1:05:51] pray it's a little song that
[1:05:54] says if I can think of it in
[1:06:01] Spanish only with God
[1:06:31] amen forgive me for this thing it's the
[1:06:33] devil attacking
[1:06:35] me but we're going to keep on going
[1:06:37] forward in the message show was a
[1:06:45] father the prophet
[1:06:49] says notice any Divine promise of God is
[1:06:51] a
[1:06:54] seed and that's seed in the right
[1:06:58] ground now he said in the right
[1:07:02] ground he said well produce its
[1:07:06] kind corn will bring
[1:07:09] corn barley will bring
[1:07:13] barley wheat will bring
[1:07:17] wheat and any Divine promise of God will
[1:07:20] bring the
[1:07:22] results if it's placed in the
[1:07:27] ground and they watered
[1:07:34] with faith prayer and
[1:07:39] trust God shall bring it to
[1:07:42] pass I'm saying with
[1:07:44] experience I want you to notice he said
[1:07:46] in the right
[1:07:48] ground there's something in the ground
[1:07:51] is right
[1:07:52] here amen amen we we we been made from
[1:07:56] this
[1:07:57] Earth and this ground is was got to be
[1:08:01] prepared there's a way to come to
[1:08:04] God there's a way to approach the King
[1:08:06] of
[1:08:08] Kings when you come to
[1:08:10] church you don't come in chewing gum and
[1:08:13] just sit down
[1:08:14] and maybe never prayed all
[1:08:17] week didn't read your Bible all
[1:08:20] week and you sit down and you want God
[1:08:23] to do something in your life
[1:08:26] let me tell you there's a way to
[1:08:28] approach
[1:08:30] God even in the
[1:08:32] natural if you're going to approach the
[1:08:34] king of
[1:08:36] England they tell you how you got to
[1:08:39] dress you got to dress a certain
[1:08:41] way you got to walk through him a
[1:08:44] certain
[1:08:45] way when you leave him you got to leave
[1:08:47] him a certain
[1:08:48] way there's a
[1:08:50] protocol and and with God there is a way
[1:08:54] to approach it
[1:08:57] remember the prophet one
[1:08:58] time he was out there in the in the
[1:09:02] wilderness and he was seeking for for
[1:09:04] for the presence of the
[1:09:06] Lord and he sat on the
[1:09:09] log he began to pray took off his
[1:09:12] hat and nothing
[1:09:14] happened so then he he got off the
[1:09:19] log and he got on his
[1:09:22] knees lifted up his hands
[1:09:25] began to seek
[1:09:27] God nothing
[1:09:28] happened and then finally he lay himself
[1:09:31] prostrated on the
[1:09:36] ground and he spread out his
[1:09:40] arms and he began to call upon God and
[1:09:44] His presence came
[1:09:46] down God is looking for
[1:09:49] humility and this ground is got to be
[1:09:53] prepared it's got to we got to realize
[1:09:56] that what we
[1:09:57] are that we can't do anything without
[1:10:00] God that way God doesn't need anything
[1:10:02] that we've
[1:10:04] got he doesn't need our
[1:10:07] ability brother say he doesn't need our
[1:10:09] our our our
[1:10:12] knowledge or our ability he need he
[1:10:15] needs our
[1:10:17] availability he needs us to be there a
[1:10:20] present with for
[1:10:22] him giving over to him surrender to
[1:10:26] him amen amen there's nothing wrong with
[1:10:30] the seed that
[1:10:33] comes said that that seed in the right
[1:10:36] ground there's nothing wrong with the
[1:10:39] seed this seed is perfect
[1:10:43] amen this word of God is
[1:10:46] perfect if there's anything wrong it's
[1:10:49] in the
[1:10:50] ground if something's not if something's
[1:10:53] not connecting
[1:10:55] between the seed and the
[1:10:57] ground there something wrong with the
[1:11:00] ground we got to get this ground in the
[1:11:02] right
[1:11:04] place we got to prepare this
[1:11:08] ground the Bible says my word will not
[1:11:16] return but it shall
[1:11:19] accomplish that which I
[1:11:23] please and it will prosper to I sent
[1:11:27] it and that seed in the right
[1:11:30] ground I said that seed in the right
[1:11:34] ground listen in the right
[1:11:36] ground will produce its
[1:11:45] kind the
[1:11:47] problem is the
[1:11:50] soil it's the
[1:11:52] ground Hosea 10:12
[1:11:56] it says soul to yourselves in
[1:11:59] righteousness give a brother a chance to
[1:12:02] find it
[1:12:05] here reap in
[1:12:08] Mercy break up your fellow
[1:12:13] ground for it is time to seek the
[1:12:17] Lord till he come and reing
[1:12:20] righteousness upon
[1:12:22] you soul to yourself in
[1:12:28] righteousness reap in Mercy he
[1:12:33] says break up your fellow
[1:12:37] ground what did the farmer do when he
[1:12:40] when he had the the mule pulling the
[1:12:44] plow what was the plow doing it was
[1:12:47] breaking up the
[1:12:49] ground because it was
[1:12:51] hardened sometimes our hearts get
[1:12:53] hardened
[1:12:55] and God can't penetrate
[1:12:57] that we got to prepare the
[1:13:00] heart and the ground is the heart of
[1:13:03] man that heart's got to be
[1:13:06] prepared it's got to lay before the sun
[1:13:09] yes amen it's got to it's got to be
[1:13:12] broken
[1:13:14] up many of us don't even know what it is
[1:13:16] to break up
[1:13:18] anymore we don't know what it is to a
[1:13:21] tear to come out of our
[1:13:23] eyes for our hearts say oh God I love
[1:13:26] you with all my
[1:13:27] heart for it to come out of your
[1:13:30] soul and the tears begin to
[1:13:34] flow why because sometimes our hearts
[1:13:36] get too
[1:13:38] hard the seed can't penetrate
[1:13:42] that if we want the blessings of
[1:13:45] God we want the promises of God to be
[1:13:47] fulfilled in our
[1:13:49] life we got work to
[1:13:51] do there's a sacrifice that's got to be
[1:13:54] paid
[1:13:56] brother green used to say this all the
[1:13:59] time he says salvation is
[1:14:01] free you can't buy it you can't pay for
[1:14:05] it you can't take all the gold in the
[1:14:08] world and buy
[1:14:11] salvation but let me tell you something
[1:14:14] it'll cost you
[1:14:15] everything I said it'll cost you
[1:14:18] everything it'll cost you your friends
[1:14:22] it'll cost you your popularity
[1:14:25] it will cost you your whole family
[1:14:29] sometimes it's going to hurt and there's
[1:14:32] sacrific
[1:14:34] involved when you break up the fellow
[1:14:37] ground it's not easy it might be hours
[1:14:40] on your
[1:14:42] knees they might be going to church
[1:14:44] service after
[1:14:46] service calling on the name of the
[1:14:49] Lord let me tell you you get that heart
[1:14:51] in the right
[1:14:53] place you break fellow

[1:15:00] again that it can become begin to feel
[1:15:03] the presence of God
[1:15:05] again let me tell you the tears will
[1:15:07] begin to
[1:15:09] flow that's when that's when you know
[1:15:11] you've met with

[1:33:10] today hallelujah
[1:33:14] hallelujah I read a book some time
[1:33:18] ago not a message
[1:33:21] book but it's a book written on a USA
[1:33:26] Street by Frank bartleman Frank I'm
[1:33:29] going to quote you a part of a few pages
[1:33:31] of
[1:33:33] that because we're talking about
[1:33:34] preparing the ground
[1:33:36] and before coming before the presence of
[1:33:39] the
[1:33:41] king he says he talking he's talking
[1:33:43] about that that building that they were
[1:33:47] in there in ausa
[1:33:49] Street the whole place was steeped in
[1:33:52] prayer
[1:33:55] God was in his holy
[1:33:58] Temple it was for man to keep
[1:34:02] silent the Shak Glory rested
[1:34:06] there in fact some claim to have seen
[1:34:09] the glory by night over the
[1:34:13] building a brother brother a brother
[1:34:16] that just passed on just a week
[1:34:19] ago brother Loreno anybody knew brother
[1:34:22] Loreno
[1:34:24] passed
[1:34:25] away he was my companion in in a lot of
[1:34:27] travels we
[1:34:30] made Venezuela in inene in Brazil and
[1:34:33] all through Mexico bra for many
[1:34:37] years and he he he told me once he was
[1:34:42] from cucamanga
[1:34:44] California back there in the 40s when he
[1:34:46] was a young
[1:34:47] man he said there was there was the that
[1:34:50] the presence from sua Street and the
[1:34:53] Revival was still going
[1:34:56] on and a few Believers had gotten
[1:34:58] together in a little
[1:35:01] church to
[1:35:03] pray and and began to pray in the power
[1:35:05] of God F that
[1:35:08] place and someone looked at the building
[1:35:10] and and they saw fire over the
[1:35:13] building and they called the fire
[1:35:17] department but that was a fire the fire
[1:35:19] department couldn't put
[1:35:22] out it was Pillar of Fire over that
[1:35:26] building and here he talks about that
[1:35:28] Pillar of
[1:35:29] Fire he says the Glory by night over the
[1:35:33] building I do not doubt it he
[1:35:36] says I have stopped more than once
[1:35:39] within two blocks of the
[1:35:44] place and prayed for
[1:35:46] strength before I dared go
[1:35:52] on what's the word dared to go
[1:36:02] on it's an important word
[1:36:05] because because this is how he was
[1:36:08] feeling and and he
[1:36:10] says he says the presence of the Lord
[1:36:13] was so
[1:36:15] real oh
[1:36:17] Hallelujah presumptuous men would
[1:36:20] sometimes come Among Us
[1:36:26] especially he says
[1:36:32] preachers it's going to come here
[1:36:35] especially
[1:36:37] preachers but their effort was
[1:36:42] shortlived the breath would be taken
[1:36:44] from
[1:36:45] them we're talking about The Presence of
[1:36:48] Jehovah their minds would
[1:36:51] wonder their brains would
[1:36:56] things would turn black Before Their
[1:36:59] Eyes they couldn't go
[1:37:02] on I never saw one get by with it in
[1:37:05] those
[1:37:08] days the the Holy Spirit did the
[1:37:12] rest we simply
[1:37:14] prayed no one cut them off uhuh did
[1:37:19] these preachers come in they thought
[1:37:20] they had something to tell the
[1:37:22] people and everybody's
[1:37:25] praying people the Holy Spirit people B
[1:37:28] being baptized in the Holy Ghost
[1:37:29] throughout the
[1:37:33] building he said we wanted the spirit to
[1:37:37] control and he wound them up and short
[1:37:42] order and they were carried out as
[1:37:46] dead they generally bit the dust in
[1:37:50] humility going through the process we
[1:37:53] had all all gone
[1:37:55] through in other words they died
[1:37:58] out came to see
[1:38:03] themselves in all their
[1:38:06] weakness then in childlike
[1:38:10] humility confession were taken up of
[1:38:15] God transformed through the mighty
[1:38:17] baptism in the
[1:38:20] spirit The Old Man Died with all
[1:38:25] pride arrogancy and good
[1:38:28] works these were not bad
[1:38:31] men these were men that had done things
[1:38:33] for
[1:38:35] God but when a man begins to do things
[1:38:38] for
[1:38:38] God he needs to remain
[1:38:41] humble well I preaching so so and I
[1:38:44] preach in this church all the hure was
[1:38:47] filled and I did this and
[1:38:50] I there were not bad Works friends
[1:38:54] but even our good works can hinder
[1:38:57] us you might think you did something for
[1:39:01] God and you don't realize it but that
[1:39:04] can hinder your your very walk with
[1:39:11] God what's
[1:39:13] hinder amen so it was not bad works that
[1:39:17] they were doing it was good
[1:39:20] works but even our good works
[1:39:24] when the Bible says our most righteous
[1:39:28] Deeds are as filthy
[1:39:31] rags in the sight of
[1:39:33] God we got to remain humble no matter
[1:39:36] what we've
[1:39:38] done I remember the
[1:39:40] prophet when he went beyond the curtain
[1:39:42] of
[1:39:43] time he said he was laying on his
[1:39:47] bed had his hands behind his head like
[1:39:51] this and he said to himself

[1:39:57] busy if you're going to do anything for
[1:39:59] the
[1:40:00] Lord that's the
[1:40:02] spirit that's the spirit of
[1:40:05] humility if we're going to do anything
[1:40:07] for the Lord Brother
[1:40:08] Daniel anything at all brother Let's Get
[1:40:12] Busy hallelujah hallelujah glory to

[1:41:02] alone but if it
[1:41:04] die it bringeth forth much fruit
[1:41:08] Hallelujah he that loveth his life shall
[1:41:11] lose
[1:41:12] it and he that hateth his
[1:41:16] life Heen in this world shall keep it
[1:41:19] until eternal
[1:41:21] life this man far Frank bartleman
[1:41:26] frankman he
[1:41:28] said in my own
[1:41:31] case I came to uphor
[1:41:35] myself I came to abhor when I would read
[1:41:39] with Jesus where he said
[1:41:42] this if you don't
[1:41:45] hate hate your
[1:41:47] life I how can we hate our life when God
[1:41:51] gave us I didn't understand that but
[1:41:53] when I read this he said I be I came to
[1:41:56] abhor
[1:41:58] myself I Begg the Lord to drop a
[1:42:03] curtain so close behind me and my
[1:42:08] past that it would hit my
[1:42:11] heels one days I was praying and I was
[1:42:14] entering into a prayer life and having a
[1:42:17] good time in the
[1:42:19] Lord fighting battles but I was I was
[1:42:22] trying to do the best I could to
[1:42:25] pray and I and I went through the day
[1:42:27] and I thought I I did pretty good I I
[1:42:30] think I I I kept my my temper I didn't
[1:42:33] lose it I didn't do any of this when I
[1:42:35] heard this other I didn't react wrong
[1:42:37] and you know you get to thinking like
[1:42:45] that and then I got down to
[1:42:48] praying and as I
[1:42:50] prayed the Lord brought to my memory
[1:42:55] this
[1:42:56] thought and what and what my motive was
[1:42:59] here he began to show
[1:43:02] me that my walk wasn't what I thought it
[1:43:06] was and I remember getting beside
[1:43:12] myself I I said
[1:43:15] Lord how can you even stand
[1:43:20] me how can you stand me Lord
[1:43:24] how can you stand this
[1:43:26] world how can you stand
[1:43:30] me I don't
[1:43:32] understand I don't deserve your
[1:43:35] mercy I'm a sinner Lord and I need you I
[1:43:40] to
[1:43:41] realize I had nothing good to bring
[1:43:44] him until you realize you got nothing
[1:43:47] good to bring
[1:43:49] him would you come to ask him Lord would
[1:43:52] you give me something
[1:43:54] Lord give something to me
[1:43:57] Lord my hands Lord are
[1:44:00] empty fill them Lord with your
[1:44:03] blessings hallelujah
[1:44:05] hallelujah I was praying there I was
[1:44:07] work I worked for 10 years as a bus
[1:44:12] driver driving a school
[1:44:17] bus if I ever thought I was getting
[1:44:19] hotti I to remember I'm a school bus
[1:44:21] driver
[1:44:26] and it was early in the morning one
[1:44:29] morning and and I and I was just
[1:44:32] meditating reading the
[1:44:34] Bible about 3:30 in the
[1:44:38] morning and and I was reading there in 2
[1:44:41] Corinthians chapter
[1:44:42] 10 vers 3 to
[1:44:51] 5 it's a scripture that I memorize I
[1:44:53] know it in
[1:44:59] English and it says for though we walk
[1:45:01] in the
[1:45:05] flesh we do not war after the
[1:45:08] flesh for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:45:11] not
[1:45:14] carnal But Mighty through God to the
[1:45:17] pulling down of
[1:45:21] strongholds casting down imag
[1:45:24] ations and everything that exalted
[1:45:26] itself against the knowledge of God
[1:45:28] which is what the word of
[1:45:31] God which is the word of
[1:45:34] God and bringing into captivity every
[1:45:39] thought to The Obedience of
[1:45:42] Christ now I've got this scripture
[1:45:45] memorized I know this scripture when I
[1:45:48] read it that
[1:45:50] morning I read it different
[1:45:54] for though we walk in the
[1:45:56] flesh we do not war after the
[1:46:00] flesh it says for the
[1:46:03] weapons
[1:46:04] weapons
[1:46:06] plural not just one
[1:46:09] weapon if you ever read heard the
[1:46:13] tape greatest battle ever
[1:46:17] fought you know this is a
[1:46:19] weapon brother BR said you take this
[1:46:22] weapon
[1:46:24] it's liken into a
[1:46:26] sword you cut that devil to
[1:46:29] Pieces by his stripes I am
[1:46:32] healed you're using a
[1:46:35] sword in the spirit
[1:46:40] realm and you cut that devil to
[1:46:44] pieces and he said you step
[1:46:46] forward and you say now where's the next
[1:46:51] one that's what he said about that and I
[1:46:54] knew this word was a
[1:46:57] weapon but I said what other weapons do
[1:46:59] we
[1:47:01] have and I began to think and as I
[1:47:03] thought that very
[1:47:06] moment the this thought came to my
[1:47:10] mind when the weakest
[1:47:13] Saint goes to his
[1:47:15] knees before God Satan
[1:47:19] trembles and I stood up said praise the
[1:47:22] Lord I got excited brother
[1:47:25] Daniel I got a revelation that
[1:47:27] morning my prayer is a
[1:47:30] weapon I've been struggling in my
[1:47:33] prayer and I began to remember what
[1:47:35] brother BR said about it we're going to
[1:47:36] quote him in a
[1:47:38] minute but I want you to know this this
[1:47:42] evening that the weapons of our Warfare
[1:47:45] are not
[1:47:47] caral it's not a it's not a
[1:47:50] M16 it's it's not a it's not a a
[1:47:56] k47 but it it is a it is a spiritual
[1:48:00] weapon and it's not
[1:48:03] carnal but it is
[1:48:05] mighty I said it is
[1:48:08] mighty through
[1:48:11] God to the pulling down of
[1:48:17] strongholds hallelujah hallelujah glory
[1:48:20] to God
[1:48:23] around that time I
[1:48:26] saw I I do use Facebook but I had done
[1:48:29] but Christians Karen you're one of my
[1:48:32] friends and because I look at what what
[1:48:35] they're about before I even add them
[1:48:39] in and and so I was looking at
[1:48:43] that and the picture came up of a of a
[1:48:46] black

[1:49:06] she was in in another
[1:49:09] place she was in The Presence of
[1:49:12] Jehovah and that really impacted
[1:49:15] me but what really impacted me what it

[1:49:21] picture he said this is how I fight my
[1:49:26] battles this is how I fight my

[1:51:43] prayer and Satan has attacked
[1:51:46] you to make you
[1:51:49] believe that your prayer doesn't work

[1:52:24] has he done with our

[1:52:31] going to be is going to be anything how
[1:52:33] many times are we KN and we're praying
[1:52:35] and the thought comes it's not going
[1:52:37] past the
[1:52:41] evening doesn't even go past the
[1:52:44] SE what's a what's the purpose of me
[1:52:48] praying if he gets you to disbelieve
[1:52:51] your weapon
[1:52:54] he says Oh Brother
[1:52:56] Neville I hope we never leave
[1:52:59] that look he's disarmed you when he gets
[1:53:03] you to
[1:53:04] disbelieve that weapon when you lay that
[1:53:09] down that finishes your
[1:53:11] fight you're
[1:53:13] done hold that
[1:53:16] weapon hallelujah hallelujah
[1:53:23] my time is running out how much what
[1:53:30] time I'm going to give you some quotes
[1:53:32] of brother
[1:53:33] brandom because after I after I had got
[1:53:36] that Revelation that morning about
[1:53:39] prayer I began to teach it to my
[1:53:42] church and I only had the one quote that
[1:53:44] God gave me in my
[1:53:47] mind but sometime
[1:53:50] later I found in my shelf
[1:53:53] where all my books were
[1:53:55] at it was a little
[1:53:58] pamphlet and I pulled it out and it was
[1:54:01] called a call to
[1:54:04] prayer and if you read brother Daniel
[1:54:07] you know what brother Brown says there I
[1:54:09] didn't I didn't know about and I began
[1:54:12] to
[1:54:13] read all the things brother B said about
[1:54:17] prayer brother BR says blind blind B
[1:54:21] [Music]
[1:54:23] he says you know there's something about
[1:54:25] getting alone to
[1:54:28] yourself many people never pray till
[1:54:30] they come to
[1:54:32] church many people think that's the only
[1:54:35] place to pray is the
[1:54:37] church my but the Bible said that man to
[1:54:41] pray
[1:54:43] everywhere lifting up holy
[1:54:46] hands and then when we get by
[1:54:50] ourself we usually pray different
[1:54:54] amen we would if we prayed in
[1:55:00] church it's the secret prayer that Jesus
[1:55:02] spoke
[1:55:04] of saying enter into the secret
[1:55:08] closet and close the
[1:55:10] door and when you have did so pray to
[1:55:13] your father who sees in
[1:55:17] secret he that seeth in secret should
[1:55:19] reward thee openly
[1:55:23] and when we're praying like
[1:55:25] that there seems to be something to the
[1:55:27] prayer that takes all the
[1:55:31] hypocrisy when you're by
[1:55:34] yourself and you're pouring out your
[1:55:35] heart to God there's no
[1:55:39] hypocrisy it seems like we got we get a
[1:55:42] a better connection with
[1:55:45] God get
[1:55:47] alone he talks about how many many times
[1:55:50] you would go I'm not going to read it
[1:55:51] but
[1:55:53] he get in the car and just
[1:55:55] drive and go out and just drive and and
[1:55:58] just meditate on on
[1:56:01] God and the Holy Spirit would come and
[1:56:04] he'd find himself parked somewhere and
[1:56:06] didn't know how he got
[1:56:08] there it's those Precious Moments by
[1:56:12] myself there were times I was going to
[1:56:14] to work in the
[1:56:16] morning after having a time with God in
[1:56:18] the morning before leaving the
[1:56:20] house I I I
[1:56:22] know how I got from here to
[1:56:26] there I don't remember driving
[1:56:29] that brother Daniel I was under the
[1:56:32] spirit the Holy Spirit had a hold of
[1:56:35] me and I was praising God with
[1:56:37] everything I
[1:56:39] had how God kept me
[1:56:42] safe something about those moments alone
[1:56:45] with
[1:56:51] God secret he is
[1:56:55] listen the devil will try to limit your
[1:56:59] prayer because you're
[1:57:02] praying limits
[1:57:06] him the Muslims pray five times a
[1:57:10] day as a
[1:57:13] lifestyle you know the Jews they they
[1:57:15] pray three times a
[1:57:17] day as a
[1:57:19] lifestyle you pray when you feel like it
[1:57:23] or
[1:57:24] not you pray whether you're blessed or
[1:57:28] not whether you're happy or not
[1:57:31] pray our prayer must be
[1:57:35] consistently so you pray when you feel
[1:57:39] good you pray when you feel
[1:57:41] bad when you feel like
[1:57:44] praying or you don't feel like
[1:57:46] pray it's time to pray I'm going to go

[1:57:52] broke and you pray when you're
[1:57:55] blessed you pray when you're
[1:57:58] down and you pray when you're
[1:58:00] up because your prayer is for
[1:58:04] survival and for
[1:58:07] maintaining your daily Victory with
[1:58:10] God and I'm going to say something here
[1:58:12] this
[1:58:14] evening as I close this
[1:58:18] morning we cannot
[1:58:20] navigate through these end time
[1:58:26] storms these end time
[1:58:28] storms if we don't go
[1:58:31] back to a place of
[1:58:34] prayer we got to get back into that

[2:10:06] 4 praying for the
[2:10:08] sick he move he moved into a second pole
[2:10:11] of his
[2:10:13] ministry he was still praying for the
[2:10:16] sick but now the prayer brought forth a
[2:10:19] gift of discernment
[2:10:23] but the second PLL of his
[2:10:25] ministry it was a prayer meeting
[2:10:28] also third pole of the ministry of Jesus
[2:10:33] Christ it was also about
[2:10:36] prayer and the last thing he did on the
[2:10:39] cross of
[2:10:41] Calvary he prayed because prayer was
[2:10:46] powerful and on the cross of Calvary his
[2:10:48] prayer was this
[2:10:51] I not just for
[2:10:54] Israel as he hung
[2:10:56] there and the blood dripped on the
[2:10:59] ground and the crown was on his head and
[2:11:03] the nails were through his hands in his
[2:11:05] feet he prayed he said father forgive
[2:11:10] them they don't know what they've
[2:11:13] done oh but I'm going to make a way for
[2:11:16] them way will be the way of this Blood
[2:11:19] issue that I'm giving
[2:11:22] oh prayer
[2:11:24] brought
[2:11:25] salvation PR brought
[2:11:28] healing prayer repairs our
[2:11:32] marriages prayer restores our
[2:11:35] families prayer still saves the
[2:11:38] lost from
[2:11:41] 1946 to
[2:11:44] 1949 the first poor
[2:11:46] Ministry at the second coming of Christ
[2:11:51] through a prophetic
[2:11:53] Ministry lasted about three
[2:11:57] years it was a prayer
[2:11:59] meeting his second poll to the ministry
[2:12:02] with the second coming of
[2:12:05] Christ from 1949 to
[2:12:09] 1963 came came to came to a transition
[2:12:13] about July
[2:12:16] 28th it was also a prayer
[2:12:20] meeting and in the third pole
[2:12:23] Ministry from 1963 to
[2:12:27] 1965 the public prayer
[2:12:31] meetings the the public prayer
[2:12:37] meetings the public prayer
[2:12:40] meetings went into the prayer
[2:12:43] closet it says it won't be for the
[2:12:46] public sorry it won't be a public show
[2:12:49] anymore
[2:12:51] but it'll be the greatest prayer
[2:12:53] meetings that have ever been on the face
[2:12:55] of the
[2:12:57] Earth it will be you and I in
[2:13:01] sincerity honest in our hearts looking
[2:13:05] for this revealed
[2:13:06] word to do what it's promised to do to
[2:13:10] change us to Quicken us to translate Us
[2:13:14] by the power of the Holy
[2:13:17] Ghost in the message what is a vision
[2:13:21] brother brandom said this he said notice
[2:13:24] close he
[2:13:26] says there's a difference between the
[2:13:28] angel of the Lord and that
[2:13:31] light he says I heard something
[2:13:35] moving and as it does when it comes here
[2:13:38] on the
[2:13:40] platform kind of like a woo
[2:13:43] woo like a fire whipping around licking
[2:13:48] blazes he says and it left me
[2:13:52] and it went right down over the top of
[2:13:54] that
[2:13:56] audience it was the tent
[2:13:58] vision and then went and stood over the
[2:14:01] top of that little
[2:14:07] building and went and stood over the top
[2:14:09] of that little
[2:14:11] building it's not the big buildings no
[2:14:14] more not the big tents anymore no it's
[2:14:18] you with a restored friendship with the
[2:14:22] Adam had an Eden before he fell but
[2:14:26] God's word won't return
[2:14:28] void you'll have a friend and that
[2:14:32] friend is you tonight
[2:14:35] want he says and it went over down over
[2:14:38] the top of that
[2:14:40] audience went went and stood over the
[2:14:42] top of that little
[2:14:45] building then settled down on top of it
[2:14:49] and when it did this one that was
[2:14:51] standing behind
[2:14:53] me the same voice the Angel's voice he
[2:14:58] said I'll meet you in there and this is
[2:15:01] the third pole but nobody will know
[2:15:04] nothing about
[2:15:05] it what was that third
[2:15:08] pole that little
[2:15:11] building not the great tents
[2:15:14] anymore that little building it was a
[2:15:17] symbol it was symbolic
[2:15:21] God speaking again in a
[2:15:24] parable and and brother bman says and I
[2:15:27] said well I don't understand why in
[2:15:32] there he said it will not be a public
[2:15:38] show this
[2:15:40] time and everyone's still trying to drum
[2:15:43] up some great public
[2:15:46] show and I said I don't understand going
[2:15:49] into that closet like that
[2:15:52] twice he's telling the
[2:15:54] angel I don't understand I don't get it
[2:15:58] I'm not seeing
[2:16:00] it then he the angel
[2:16:03] said he took him back where to the word
[2:16:08] is it not written by our
[2:16:10] Lord when thou prayest be not like the
[2:16:14] Hypocrites who like to be heard before
[2:16:17] men but enter into the secret closet and
[2:16:21] pray to your father who seeth in
[2:16:25] secret and he who seeth in
[2:16:28] secret shall reward thee
[2:16:31] openly and brother brandom says it's
[2:16:34] perfectly to the
[2:16:36] scripture every
[2:16:38] time Matthew
[2:16:40] 66 a scripture laying in the
[2:16:44] word a parable that Jesus had spoke a
[2:16:49] parable is a mystery
[2:16:51] a parable is a
[2:16:56] prophecy and it's been read by
[2:17:00] millions but this
[2:17:02] day this
[2:17:05] scripture is fulfilled before your
[2:17:08] eyes and it's the place where God wants
[2:17:11] to take you
[2:17:12] tonight it's the place he wants to take
[2:17:15] you every
[2:17:16] day the place that he's called us
[2:17:19] to a call to pray
[2:17:22] pray that's this that's this third
[2:17:26] pole that's been so
[2:17:30] confusing to the
[2:17:31] people and yet
[2:17:34] tonight he's touched your heart
[2:17:37] with a call to
[2:17:40] prayer the third pool is preparing our
[2:17:45] hearts because he's coming
[2:17:48] back for the honest in heart
[2:17:53] brother Bram said the right seed in the
[2:17:56] wrong
[2:17:59] womb the right
[2:18:01] seed in the wrong
[2:18:03] room

[2:18:08] man it was an it was
[2:18:12] Esau he lived by his bow and
[2:18:15] arrow a man of violence but he said it

[2:18:21] but in the wrong womb he said the right
[2:18:24] seed in the right seed in in the right
[2:18:28] womb Sarah brought forth a
[2:18:32] gentleman but the spoken word
