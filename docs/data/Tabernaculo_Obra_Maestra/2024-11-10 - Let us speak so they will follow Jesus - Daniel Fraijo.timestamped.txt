[42:41] me
[42:43] up I realized I'd forgotten to put on
[42:45] the microphone that hooks on
[42:50] here um I I do I do know it works better
[42:57] so I'm going to ask brother Kenny to go
[42:58] in the back it's in the office there
[43:00] sitting on the
[43:03] table and it uh it works better for uh
[43:07] the Saints on
[43:11] YouTube and also here it's a help to to
[43:16] our brother Leo or whoever's or the
[43:19] brother's
[43:22] interpreting that way if I move around a
[43:24] little bit so if I move around a little
[43:28] bit then they can still hear they don't
[43:31] lose the
[43:36] voice so this
[43:38] morning we we'd uh had Upon Our
[43:45] Hearts uh to speak on a
[43:48] subject
[43:50] um and I I entitled it let us speak so
[43:53] they will follow Jesus
[44:00] and and uh the
[44:02] subject taking sides with
[44:06] Jesus so if you'll turn with me in your
[44:08] Bibles to St John chapter
[44:13] 1 there in uh verse
[44:19] 35 St John chapter
[44:24] 1 and verse
[44:28] we'll begin right
[44:31] there again the next day after John
[44:36] stood and two of his
[44:42] disciples and looking Upon Jesus as he
[44:45] walked he say he saith Behold the Lamb
[44:49] of
[44:54] God and the two disciples heard him
[45:01] speak and they followed
[45:03] Jesus then Jesus turned and saw them
[45:09] following and saith unto them what seek
[45:20] ye then then Jesus turned and saw them
[45:23] following and saith unto them what seek
[45:25] ye they said un to him Rabbi which is to
[45:28] say being an interpreted Master where
[45:31] dwellest
[45:41] thou and he saith unto
[45:45] them come and
[45:47] see and they
[45:51] came and saw where he dwelt and Abode
[45:55] with him
[45:59] that day for it was about the 10th
[46:03] hour the 10th hour for us would have
[46:07] been about 400
[46:08] [Music]
[46:11] p.m. verse
[46:13] 40 and one of the two which heard John
[46:16] speak and followed him was Andrew Simon
[46:18] Peter's brother
[46:27] let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you
[46:30] once again this
[46:32] morning we ask your blessings upon your
[46:38] word as it goes to every
[46:41] heart may they be may they may there be
[46:47] something may may there be
[46:53] something that will speak to their
[46:55] hearts
[46:57] and encourage them to press
[47:00] forward in Jesus name amen am you may be
[47:11] seated I believe it's the
[47:15] desire I believe it is the
[47:18] desire I
[47:24] believe of every sincere
[47:28] [Music]
[47:29] minister to hear someone
[47:33] say when I heard you
[47:37] speak about the Lamb of
[47:42] God since then I've turned to follow
[47:48] Jesus and now I'm taking sides with
[47:53] Jesus that's our
[47:55] desire when we preach the
[47:59] gospel for the people to
[48:01] say now that I've heard the gospel
[48:05] preached I decided that I
[48:10] too I'm taking sides with
[48:13] Jesus so if we stand for
[48:17] Jesus does does that mean we that we
[48:21] have to openly take a stand against
[48:23] somebody
[48:31] in Acts chapter
[48:34] 5 if if you remember it began with
[48:37] ananas and
[48:40] saf but what followed
[48:43] that was a
[48:46] Revival an
[48:48] explosion of a church being
[48:52] birthed with signs and wonders following
[48:55] them but moving in
[48:59] parallel with his great
[49:02] Revival was a great
[49:05] persecution it's the same pattern that
[49:08] is repeated from the first coming of
[49:11] Christ to the day we're living
[49:14] today there is a revival going on right
[49:19] now under this third pole
[49:23] Ministry not under the first and second
[49:26] Pole
[49:28] that was to catch the
[49:31] attention of those who were honest in
[49:33] their
[49:36] hearts of those who wanted real change
[49:38] in their lives and
[49:42] families so here there had begun a great
[49:46] Revival at the first coming of
[49:50] Christ but moving in parallel with this
[49:53] great
[49:55] Revival a great
[49:58] persecution a persecution on on
[50:02] Israel and a persecution of the
[50:05] Believers in
[50:07] Christ that were following Jesus
[50:12] now it was a
[50:16] persecution by the
[50:18] Romans it was a persecution on the
[50:21] church by the
[50:23] Jews who had no confession of faith
[50:28] and even those Jews who claimed to
[50:30] follow Moses and the
[50:35] law so it was Pagan
[50:38] Rome and the Jewish Orthodox
[50:41] Church became the violent
[50:45] ones that were
[50:49] persecuting the the followers of
[50:53] Jesus A New Testament Church
[50:58] a New Testament
[51:00] Church no no a new
[51:06] testament it was the followers of
[51:16] Jesus it was rising up rising up and
[51:19] they were trying to and and and and the
[51:22] this persecution of Rome and the Jewish
[51:24] Church
[51:28] against the followers of
[51:32] Jesus in other words it was the state
[51:35] and the
[51:37] government and the denomination of that
[51:40] day there was
[51:43] persecuting this Born Again
[51:47] Church and and it repeats again
[51:50] today and it's repeated through all the
[51:54] ages church and state
[51:58] against a little
[52:00] group mystical body of Jesus
[52:05] Christ and this Jewish
[52:08] church and Pagan
[52:10] Rome they were trying to convince all
[52:14] Israel the high
[52:17] priest that the Disciples of Jesus were
[52:23] blasphemers J were Blas
[52:27] fers if you're for us you must openly
[52:34] declare that you're against
[52:36] them and join in an open
[52:41] persecution and be with
[52:43] us a participator in this
[52:49] boycott in the message the handwriting
[52:52] on the wall
[52:57] brother says now I want you to
[52:59] notice now I want you to
[53:02] notice as soon as the king saw this
[53:07] Vision speaking of the
[53:10] Nebuchadnezzar as soon as the king saw
[53:13] this vision and he made
[53:18] it he forced every person in his
[53:23] kingdom to worship this image
[53:27] to this Pagan King he made an
[53:32] image he says and it's believed by
[53:40] Scholars and I do believe that a
[53:42] Spirit-filled person would see
[53:49] it he worshiped
[53:52] Daniel is what they did and he made an
[53:56] image to
[53:58] Daniel and he called it
[54:02] belar and then he called Daniel
[54:07] belar which was the name of his
[54:11] God and he made an
[54:13] image and forced every person to worship
[54:17] that
[54:19] image a prophet says I want you to
[54:23] notice that at the beginning of the
[54:25] Gentiles
[54:28] when God dealt dealt with
[54:31] them they got hotti
[54:36] arrogantes in in their heart and forced
[54:39] every
[54:40] man to worship the image of a holy
[54:45] man and the Gentile age was issued in
[54:49] with
[54:52] that and it will go out the same way
[54:58] in other words
[55:00] today saying it will happen
[55:02] again that they will raise up the
[55:05] worship of a holy
[55:11] man and we're seeing it in this
[55:15] day not only with a man that God sent a
[55:18] prophetic
[55:23] Ministry but it'll go to the next level
[55:28] with a one world global
[55:30] leader with a one world
[55:36] lead the pope of
[55:38] Rome and it'll become church and state
[55:43] again Rome and the great
[55:47] denomination at the second
[55:49] coming it will happen like it happened
[55:51] at the first
[55:54] coming when Pagan Rome
[55:57] and the Orthodox Jewish
[56:00] Church though they were
[56:02] enemies they came they they came in a
[56:05] union
[56:08] together how do enemies come
[56:11] together they have one
[56:14] leader Lucifer Lucifer and the same
[56:17] leader anoints them
[56:19] both ano two
[56:22] enemies to work to his goal
[56:26] to
[56:28] crucify the word made
[56:30] flesh it happened at the first
[56:33] coming it will happen at the second
[56:36] coming it is
[56:39] happening so a prophet says I want you
[56:42] to notice that the beginning of the
[56:47] Gentiles when God dealt with
[56:51] them they got hotty in their heart
[56:56] and forced every man to worship the
[56:59] image of a holy
[57:02] man and the Gentile age was issued
[57:07] in with that and it'll go out the same
[57:12] way the same way a
[57:15] boycot of the mark of the beast that
[57:18] will force
[57:19] people to worship
[57:23] images and to do things
[57:26] that we've been taught that was contrary
[57:29] to the word of
[57:31] God and brother it will be so slick and
[57:37] Sly until it will deceive the very elect
[57:40] if
[57:44] possible so where would this great
[57:46] deception
[57:49] be right within the ranks of what's
[57:51] called this end time message
[57:59] it will deceive the very elect if
[58:05] possible so you better purpose in your
[58:07] heart
[58:09] tonight and be filled with God's holy
[58:13] spirit that you'll be able to discern
[58:15] the right and wrong
[58:19] thing when that Proclamation is
[58:24] issued for the worship of a holy
[58:29] man I believe that a born again
[58:34] believer will take sides with
[58:38] Jesus and he won't be
[58:41] persuaded to
[58:44] boycott against any
[58:46] brother any sister churches or
[58:51] Minister listen to this what if your
[58:55] best friend
[58:57] your mom your dad your brother your
[59:00] sister your uncle your
[59:02] aunt would come and tell you we need to
[59:06] talk because they have some
[59:11] grievances against
[59:13] somebody some church some Minister it's
[59:18] a spirit of
[59:24] boycott and it's working in an infancy
[59:31] stage
[59:33] infancia so that so so what we
[59:37] do so what do we
[59:40] do this is your mother this is your
[59:44] father this is your uncle this is your
[59:46] Aunt perhaps even another
[59:50] Minister and yet it's not
[59:52] them it's Satan
[59:57] trying to divide
[59:58] us to scatter
[1:00:02] us to scatter
[1:00:06] us and and aim our guns at each
[1:00:12] other what do we say in these
[1:00:16] situations the Bible holds our
[1:00:22] answer we don't want to get caught up
[1:00:26] in just getting in just agree in just
[1:00:29] helping someone's anger build by getting
[1:00:32] angry with
[1:00:39] them we want to stand for the
[1:00:43] word because when you stand for the
[1:00:47] word you can help that angry
[1:00:50] brother you can help that angry sister
[1:00:56] by taking sides with
[1:00:59] Jesus Acts chapter
[1:01:02] 5 and verse
[1:01:08] 12 and Luke giving his witness and
[1:01:11] testimony in this book of
[1:01:17] Acts and it says and by the hands of the
[1:01:19] Apostle were many signs and wonders
[1:01:22] wrought among the people and they were
[1:01:24] all with one Accord in in Solomon's
[1:01:33] porch and of the rest there there's no
[1:01:36] man join himself to them but the people
[1:01:39] magnified
[1:01:45] them and Believers were the more added
[1:01:47] to the Lord multitudes both of men and
[1:01:50] women
[1:01:56] a great
[1:01:57] Revival in so much that they brought
[1:01:59] forth the sick into the streets and laid
[1:02:01] them on beds and couches that at the
[1:02:04] least the shadow of Peter passing by
[1:02:07] might overshadow some of
[1:02:20] them there ALS there came also a
[1:02:22] multitude out of the Cities round about
[1:02:25] into Jerusalem bringing sick folks and
[1:02:28] them that were vexed with unclean
[1:02:30] spirits and they were healed
[1:02:42] everyone who could be
[1:02:44] angry at this kind of a
[1:02:48] Revival you would think everyone would
[1:02:50] receive
[1:02:52] it you see so many being blessed
[1:02:58] but there were
[1:03:00] those who had did
[1:03:02] anger because it wasn't happening in
[1:03:05] their
[1:03:06] Church in their
[1:03:09] group verse
[1:03:11] 17 then the high priest rose up and all
[1:03:14] they that were with him which is the
[1:03:16] sect of the Sadducees and were filled
[1:03:19] with indignation
[1:03:29] and laid their hands on the apostles and
[1:03:31] put them in common
[1:03:38] prison in the message Serv we would see
[1:03:44] Jesus the prophet says now notice these
[1:03:47] same
[1:03:49] disciples and how Petty people can be
[1:03:57] how Petty these people can
[1:04:01] be how juvenile that grown-ups can
[1:04:08] be
[1:04:13] how
[1:04:18] grownups in our
[1:04:21] organizations and in our
[1:04:23] denominations and our affili
[1:04:27] ation and our
[1:04:29] Creeds we end them with a
[1:04:33] period when we ought to end them with a
[1:04:37] comma and say we believe
[1:04:40] this plus as much more as God will let
[1:04:43] us
[1:04:45] know but if we end it with a
[1:04:49] period that settles it that's
[1:04:54] all we don't care about what God wants
[1:04:57] to let us
[1:05:00] know we're saying this is all we want
[1:05:03] right
[1:05:05] here and that's what we've
[1:05:08] done when we made a
[1:05:11] mistake in the message Serv we would see
[1:05:14] Jesus Prophet continues to
[1:05:17] say he said now watch the same
[1:05:22] disciples a few days
[1:05:24] later they met a man casting out
[1:05:30] Devils you'll read it in Mark chapter
[1:05:35] n matter of fact let's read it right now
[1:05:38] Mark chapter
[1:05:39] [Music]
[1:05:41] n and it'll be verse 38 and 39
[1:05:56] Mark 9 verse
[1:06:00] 38 and John answered him saying Master
[1:06:04] we saw one casting out
[1:06:14] Devils John said we saw this man casting
[1:06:18] out
[1:06:20] devils and in your name he was doing it
[1:06:25] listen to what John said
[1:06:27] now and he followeth not
[1:06:33] us and we forbade him because he
[1:06:36] followeth not
[1:06:39] us and Jesus
[1:06:42] said forbid him not for there is no man
[1:06:46] which shall do a miracle in my name that
[1:06:49] can lightly speak evil of me
[1:06:58] now this quote again in the message we
[1:07:00] would see s we would see
[1:07:04] Jesus now watch the same
[1:07:08] disciples a few days later they met a
[1:07:11] man casting out
[1:07:14] Devils he was getting the job
[1:07:16] done and so they were very
[1:07:22] jealous they were very jealous
[1:07:25] so he goes down and he
[1:07:27] said now here you so John went down and
[1:07:31] he said now here you either join our
[1:07:38] ranks or or or don't you do that no
[1:07:42] more and the man let them
[1:07:46] know that he didn't need to join their
[1:07:50] denomination their ranks he went up
[1:07:53] there and he heard Jesus
[1:07:56] saying whosoever
[1:07:59] will so he just received it and went
[1:08:02] on and he was getting the job
[1:08:05] done well the disciples
[1:08:08] said we forbid you the
[1:08:12] disciples Peter John
[1:08:15] and
[1:08:18] Matthew the disciples said we forbid you
[1:08:21] in other
[1:08:22] words we'll boycott you
[1:08:26] well we'll do all this if you don't do
[1:08:29] as we
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:32] say so if you take sides with
[1:08:35] Jesus you don't have to boycott
[1:08:40] someone or some
[1:08:42] church to prove
[1:08:45] it you just stand on the word on
[1:08:50] Truth when you stand on the
[1:08:53] word you're not angry angry at
[1:08:57] anyone no because the word that you're
[1:08:59] standing
[1:09:01] on will set the slaves
[1:09:05] free if they'll receive it if they'll
[1:09:09] take the
[1:09:10] key unlock their
[1:09:14] chains are you saying brother Daniel the
[1:09:16] same thing is trying to get amongst us
[1:09:19] today
[1:09:25] in s we would see
[1:09:29] Jesus Prophet
[1:09:31] said he said John John said we forbid
[1:09:36] you in other words we'll boycott you
[1:09:41] we'll do all of this if you don't do
[1:09:45] it so he went back and told Jesus about
[1:09:50] it and Jesus said now don't you do that
[1:09:56] don't you do that there was a time a
[1:10:02] prophet in a message he preached in
[1:10:08] 1963 after the
[1:10:10] seals I'm trying to remember the name of
[1:10:13] the message right
[1:10:16] now and and he said the Lord had told
[1:10:20] him to stop calling the people
[1:10:26] Ricky and Ras from
[1:10:30] the and he told them
[1:10:32] why because there's still a lot of my
[1:10:36] children in those
[1:10:39] denominations and he told them you're
[1:10:40] hurting
[1:10:44] them he said I got a
[1:10:50] complex and I I said well if the people
[1:10:53] won't hear the
[1:10:56] message I'll preach it harder than
[1:11:01] ever and God told him don't do that
[1:11:05] don't be name
[1:11:07] calling don't call them Ricky and
[1:11:10] Ras the prophet had built up a
[1:11:15] complex a feeling so
[1:11:19] rejected and he realized it because God
[1:11:21] spoke to
[1:11:23] him and it was a great struggle in his
[1:11:27] life that was
[1:11:30] 1963 and from
[1:11:32] 63 to
[1:11:35] 65 I went and looked and I said I
[1:11:39] wonder if he was still
[1:11:43] struggling or or if he overcame it
[1:11:45] immediately when God spoke to
[1:11:49] him and as I went to
[1:11:52] search from the time the L he the he
[1:11:55] said said the Lord rebuked them to
[1:11:58] stop there's over 40
[1:12:02] times that he continued to do
[1:12:05] it why because he was a
[1:12:08] man feeling
[1:12:11] broken
[1:12:13] rejected feeling without
[1:12:17] friends and it was a great struggle for
[1:12:20] him and yet he God's prophet
[1:12:25] and that might be happening to some of
[1:12:28] you struggling with feelings of
[1:12:32] rejection feelings of
[1:12:35] anger feelings of the
[1:12:38] past that it hasn't given you the future
[1:12:40] you're looking
[1:12:43] for it's okay to
[1:12:45] struggle but God is speaking to our
[1:12:48] hearts this
[1:12:50] morning don't do that no
[1:12:52] more what if I do do it again
[1:12:57] just say Lord I'm
[1:12:58] sorry forgive me every time it happens
[1:13:03] and keep walking forward in the name of
[1:13:06] Jesus till the love of God Pours Down
[1:13:09] into our
[1:13:13] hearts he said you see what it
[1:13:16] is it's little
[1:13:19] petty
[1:13:24] jealousy of those
[1:13:26] disciples it was in men
[1:13:30] then it's still in men
[1:13:34] today you say where and what man
[1:13:38] starting with this
[1:13:40] man it's there it's part of the Fallen
[1:13:44] nature it's why I needed a born again
[1:13:49] experience to mortify the Deeds of this
[1:13:52] flesh
[1:13:57] brother says that's
[1:13:59] right because the man was getting the
[1:14:01] job
[1:14:03] done and many times you find
[1:14:06] people who are getting the job done that
[1:14:09] don't belong to our
[1:14:13] ranks then we want to fly up about
[1:14:21] it but it's just the same element
[1:14:26] listen to this and if it was in the
[1:14:28] Church of 12 that walked with
[1:14:34] Jesus he says it's bound to be in this
[1:14:39] one brandom
[1:14:42] Tabernacle and all the rest of
[1:14:45] them that's right so
[1:14:49] brethren we are here present we are here
[1:14:52] we are here to represent the Lord Jesus
[1:14:54] Christ
[1:14:57] and his
[1:14:58] resurrection and we pray that you'll
[1:15:00] Fellowship around the word with
[1:15:05] us then he says shall we pray just a
[1:15:10] moment so by the
[1:15:12] Bible when folks you love and
[1:15:18] respect by the Bible when folks you love
[1:15:22] and respect
[1:15:27] so the Bible when folks you
[1:15:36] love are trying to get
[1:15:40] you to take sides with
[1:15:44] them what do you
[1:15:46] do are you
[1:15:48] angry are you now Angry against the same
[1:15:53] person can't look that person person in
[1:15:55] the
[1:15:59] eyee you have just become
[1:16:02] part of a personal
[1:16:06] boycott like the
[1:16:08] disciples like the high priest like the
[1:16:12] Pharisees and a prophet said if it was
[1:16:14] in the Church of 12 that walked with
[1:16:19] Jesus it's bound to be in this one
[1:16:29] and all the rest of
[1:16:31] them that's right because there's
[1:16:35] because there is a certain element
[1:16:37] that's in every
[1:16:40] Church you know what it
[1:16:42] is human
[1:16:45] beings that need to be born
[1:16:48] again acts 5 and verse 27
[1:16:57] the father was about to turn the
[1:17:01] tables the acts
[1:17:06] 5:27 the father was about to turn the
[1:17:14] tables on his
[1:17:16] children to turn the
[1:17:19] hearts of the old
[1:17:22] ways verse 27
[1:17:25] and when they had brought them they sent
[1:17:27] them before the council and the high
[1:17:29] priest asked
[1:17:36] them saying did not we straightly
[1:17:39] command you that you should not teach in
[1:17:41] his
[1:17:47] name and behold you have filled
[1:17:49] Jerusalem with your Doctrine and intend
[1:17:51] to bring this man's blood Upon Us yeah
[1:18:01] what what are they doing to the
[1:18:02] disciples
[1:18:04] here they're forbidding them to talk
[1:18:08] about
[1:18:10] Jesus remember what the disciples
[1:18:14] said in Mark
[1:18:16] 9 the disciples
[1:18:18] said to the man who was getting the job
[1:18:22] done we forbid you
[1:18:25] in other words we'll boycott you we'll
[1:18:29] do all this if you don't do
[1:18:32] it the Pharisees were now doing it to
[1:18:36] them they had done it they had done it
[1:18:39] themselves to another
[1:18:42] man and yet a New Testament Church had
[1:18:46] been
[1:18:48] born but people needed a born again
[1:18:51] experience
[1:18:55] on the day of
[1:18:56] Pentecost 120
[1:18:59] people poor in
[1:19:02] spirit like Sarah they needed that
[1:19:06] experience but that one time
[1:19:10] experience wasn't
[1:19:12] enough they would need a refilling every
[1:19:15] day like you and I a one time experience
[1:19:20] is
[1:19:21] enough you and I need a refilling of the
[1:19:24] Holy
[1:19:26] Spirit to overcome this kind of
[1:19:30] Temptation verse
[1:19:32] 29 then Peter and the other Apostles
[1:19:35] answered and said we ought to obey God
[1:19:38] rather than
[1:19:43] men the god of our fathers raised up
[1:19:46] Jesus whom ye slew and hanged on a tree
[1:19:55] he's now speaking by
[1:19:58] Revelation not trying not trying to make
[1:20:01] them feel bad or accuse
[1:20:05] them this had happened it was
[1:20:09] real him ha God exalted with his right
[1:20:12] hand to be a prince and a savior for to
[1:20:15] give repentance to Israel and
[1:20:17] forgiveness of sins
[1:20:26] and we are his Witnesses of these
[1:20:30] things and so is also the Holy Ghost
[1:20:33] whom God had given to them that obey
[1:20:39] him a principle in the
[1:20:44] scripture obedience restores a
[1:20:48] friendship with the
[1:20:51] father when they heard that they were
[1:20:54] cut to the
[1:20:55] heart and took counsel to slay them in
[1:20:59] the midst of this Angry
[1:21:01] [Music]
[1:21:05] Crowd and this growing boycott in the
[1:21:10] Church of
[1:21:12] Jerusalem there stood a man who took
[1:21:15] sides with
[1:21:18] Jesus he didn't take sides with the
[1:21:22] council he didn't voice himself against
[1:21:24] the
[1:21:31] disciples Acts 34
[1:21:36] 534 then stood there up one in the
[1:21:38] council a
[1:21:43] Pharisee named Gia a doctor of the
[1:21:47] law had in reputation among all the
[1:21:52] people and commanded to put the apostles
[1:21:55] forth a little
[1:22:00] space
[1:22:01] Gia was a wise
[1:22:04] man Gia was an elder in the Church of
[1:22:09] Jerusalem Gia was respected because he
[1:22:12] always stood on the
[1:22:16] words Gia sees
[1:22:20] here a different scene
[1:22:24] because he wasn't getting
[1:22:27] angry with all the other
[1:22:30] ministers so he was looking at the same
[1:22:32] people very
[1:22:35] differently he was looking at them
[1:22:37] through the
[1:22:38] word theia sees here are the children of
[1:22:42] the
[1:22:46] assembly he he says here are are the
[1:22:48] fathers of the
[1:22:51] assembly fighting each other in the name
[1:22:54] of the same father
[1:23:01] Jehovah and said unto
[1:23:04] them ye men of
[1:23:06] Israel take heed to yourselves what you
[1:23:09] intend to do as touching these
[1:23:16] men for before these days rose up thus
[1:23:19] boasting himself to be somebody
[1:23:26] to whom a number of men about 400 joined
[1:23:33] themselves who was slain and all as many
[1:23:36] as obeyed him were scattered and brought
[1:23:38] to
[1:23:43] not after this man rose up Judas of
[1:23:46] Galilee in the days of the
[1:23:52] taxing and Drew away much people after
[1:23:55] him he also
[1:24:00] perished and all even as many as obeyed
[1:24:03] him were
[1:24:07] dispersed and in this message there's
[1:24:09] also risen up all kinds of men with all
[1:24:13] kinds of
[1:24:16] followings so Gia is giving us wisdom
[1:24:19] here for our day too
[1:24:24] don't worry about all that that's
[1:24:29] happened but look at it through the eyes
[1:24:31] of the
[1:24:33] word verse 38 and now I say unto
[1:24:37] you refrain from these men and let them
[1:24:42] alone you see the wisdom in this
[1:24:45] man refrain from these men and let them
[1:24:50] alone but the Pharisees that rose up
[1:24:53] with violence against
[1:24:57] them if if for if this counil or this
[1:25:00] work be of men it will come to
[1:25:08] not but if it be of
[1:25:11] God you cannot overthrow
[1:25:15] it lest happily ye be found even to
[1:25:19] fight against God
[1:25:27] even if they had at that moment killed
[1:25:30] the
[1:25:33] apostles even if at that
[1:25:37] moment if they had killed the
[1:25:41] apostles it would not have stopped
[1:25:44] God like that he would have rose up more
[1:25:51] men if I die tomorrow
[1:25:55] don't
[1:25:55] worry God if God is in
[1:25:58] it God will raise up another
[1:26:01] man help you push
[1:26:04] forward Gia didn't take sides with his
[1:26:07] church or his friends or
[1:26:10] [Music]
[1:26:13] family Gia didn't take sides with the
[1:26:18] disciples he took sides with God
[1:26:27] Gia was a man who was who was who
[1:26:31] absolute was
[1:26:37] God
[1:26:39] Gia what kind of
[1:26:42] man is absolutely a pillar in the
[1:26:48] church Gia that kind of
[1:26:51] man is the best of fathers
[1:26:55] that kind of man is the best of
[1:26:58] friends that kind of man when he's done
[1:27:02] preaching will convince you to
[1:27:05] say I pledge allegiance to the Lamb of
[1:27:13] God with all my heart with all I am I
[1:27:19] want to be that kind of a man
[1:27:25] the men of this
[1:27:27] assembly
[1:27:30] the you should be that kind of
[1:27:34] man I should be that kind of
[1:27:39] man a man that when you get
[1:27:44] home your wife and family are so happy
[1:27:46] to see
[1:27:48] [Music]
[1:27:50] you I missed
[1:27:52] you I haven't seen continue in over
[1:27:55] eight and a half
[1:27:59] hours First
[1:28:01] Corinthians verse
[1:28:05] 10 the Apostle Paul speaking to the
[1:28:10] Corinthians 1 Corinthians chapter 1 and
[1:28:13] verse
[1:28:17] 10 now I beseech you Brethren by the
[1:28:20] name of our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:27] that you all speak the same
[1:28:30] thing and that there be no divisions
[1:28:33] among
[1:28:35] you but that you be perfectly joined
[1:28:37] together in the same mind in the same
[1:28:44] judgment I've been I have been in
[1:28:47] churches of four and 500
[1:28:51] people where the word is not preached
[1:28:56] and though there's hundreds
[1:28:58] there the church is
[1:29:02] filled with little groups
[1:29:06] clicks
[1:29:09] clicks because the word isn't
[1:29:13] preached they're scared to leave the
[1:29:16] church so they find safety
[1:29:24] in in binding themselves to little
[1:29:30] groups of the same
[1:29:33] mind so that they can speak their their
[1:29:38] thoughts and it won't get back to the
[1:29:41] pastor and the
[1:29:43] deacons who will they who will then
[1:29:45] visit them in their homes just to rebuke
[1:29:47] them and Hammer them
[1:29:55] rebuke them and Hammer
[1:30:00] them so four 500 people you you get to
[1:30:04] those
[1:30:06] churches you say wow God must be here
[1:30:10] look at all the
[1:30:13] people but if you could see it
[1:30:17] spiritually you see 400
[1:30:20] people divided in this church
[1:30:24] no
[1:30:26] Harmony and yet they all
[1:30:30] stay because of
[1:30:32] fear because though the word isn't
[1:30:36] preached fear is
[1:30:40] preached and inject it into the hearts
[1:30:42] of the
[1:30:45] people if you leave this
[1:30:48] church you're not leaving
[1:30:50] God you're leaving the word
[1:30:55] that
[1:30:57] statement has been around for thousands
[1:30:59] of
[1:31:01] years it's not new to the day we're
[1:31:05] living it's what
[1:31:08] Lucifer puts in the
[1:31:10] hearts of nian
[1:31:13] leaders but in the midst of this this
[1:31:17] Jewish
[1:31:19] Church men hardened by the law
[1:31:27] there was one man called
[1:31:29] Gia who didn't take
[1:31:32] sides the church
[1:31:35] do didn't even take sides with the
[1:31:39] disciples he took sides with
[1:31:43] God he warned the
[1:31:45] Pharisees if this is of god you find
[1:31:49] yourself fighting against
[1:31:51] God didn't take sides with this
[1:31:56] church and and he said to the
[1:32:00] disciples but if this isn't of
[1:32:03] God you men will come to
[1:32:07] nothing and Gia said what I will
[1:32:11] do I will wait on God In
[1:32:16] Prayer because the word and God will
[1:32:19] manifest
[1:32:21] himself and I'm willing to wait for that
[1:32:24] manifestation of
[1:32:28] Truth First Corinthians
[1:32:31] 1:10 now I beseech you Brethren by the
[1:32:33] name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you
[1:32:36] all speak the same
[1:32:43] thing and there be no divisions among
[1:32:46] you but that you be perfectly joined
[1:32:48] together in the same mind and the same
[1:32:50] judgment
[1:32:58] why did Paul make this
[1:33:02] statement he's going to tell us the
[1:33:04] reason for him making this
[1:33:08] statement for it had been declared unto
[1:33:11] unto me of you my brethren by them which
[1:33:14] are of the House of
[1:33:22] Khloe that there are contentions among
[1:33:27] you now this I
[1:33:30] say verse
[1:33:32] 12 now this I say that every one of you
[1:33:35] saith I am of Paul I am of Apollos I am
[1:33:38] of sephus and I of
[1:33:46] Christ you see what was
[1:33:49] happening they were beginning to enter
[1:33:52] into the worship of holy
[1:33:56] men they were taking sides with
[1:34:01] men no it's all about
[1:34:04] Jesus our savior our Lord Our
[1:34:09] Redeemer Paul didn't preach
[1:34:13] Paul Paul preached Jesus Christ in us
[1:34:16] the hope of
[1:34:18] glory First Corinthians
[1:34:22] 113 is Christ
[1:34:25] divided was Paul crucified for
[1:34:28] you or were you baptized in the name of
[1:34:32] Paul in Acts chapter
[1:34:35] 7 you'll
[1:34:39] remember Steven A Man full of the Holy
[1:34:44] Ghost and Faith with signs and wonders
[1:34:48] preaching
[1:34:51] repentance and forgiveness of sin
[1:34:54] through Jesus
[1:34:56] Christ he preached to the high priest
[1:34:58] and
[1:35:04] Council a long and scorching
[1:35:13] message finally inditing
[1:35:19] them for the first crucifixion of Christ
[1:35:24] he was trying to turn their hearts to
[1:35:29] repentance that all their sin could be
[1:35:33] forgiven he wasn't taking sides against
[1:35:37] them he never cursed
[1:35:40] them just the
[1:35:44] contrary and at the end of his
[1:35:47] message in Acts
[1:35:52] 7:59 they they stoned
[1:35:56] stepen calling upon God and saying Lord
[1:36:00] Jesus receive my
[1:36:05] spirit and he and he kneeled down and
[1:36:08] cried with a loud
[1:36:12] voice
[1:36:15] father curse them these men these evil
[1:36:18] Wicked Violent Men
[1:36:24] he didn't say that and he kneel down and
[1:36:27] cried with a loud voice Lord lay not
[1:36:29] this sin to their charge and when he
[1:36:32] said this he fell
[1:36:36] asleep verse 60 of Acts
[1:36:40] 7 16
[1:36:57] and he kneeled down and cried with a
[1:37:00] loud voice Lord lay not this sin to
[1:37:03] their charge and when he had said this
[1:37:05] he fell
[1:37:14] asleep it would be a good practice for
[1:37:17] all of
[1:37:19] us starting with
[1:37:22] me that as I kneel down in the evenings
[1:37:25] to go to
[1:37:27] bed that I could cry with a loud
[1:37:31] [Music]
[1:37:33] voice remembering all the wrong that I
[1:37:36] think people did
[1:37:41] me and say
[1:37:44] Lord as I go to bed lay not this sin to
[1:37:48] their
[1:37:50] charge then lay my head down and sleep
[1:37:56] Ste Steven had taken sides with
[1:38:01] Jesus that was the very Spirit of Christ
[1:38:04] in
[1:38:06] Sten lay not this sin to their
[1:38:11] charge crying out for the Lord to give
[1:38:18] them crying out to the Lord to give them
[1:38:22] or someone
[1:38:24] in that murderous
[1:38:30] crowdin a space to
[1:38:33] repent even after his
[1:38:36] death let me say it again Steven had
[1:38:40] taken sides with
[1:38:43] Jesus that was the very Spirit of Christ
[1:38:45] in
[1:38:47] stepen he said lay not this sin to their
[1:38:50] charge
[1:38:54] crying out for the Lord to give them or
[1:39:01] someone in that murderous
[1:39:05] crowd a space to
[1:39:08] repent even after his
[1:39:12] death Steven was
[1:39:15] speaking hoping someone would stand up
[1:39:17] in the midst of them
[1:39:21] all and say I'll follow
[1:39:24] Jesus I'll take my stand with the Lord's
[1:39:28] despise
[1:39:33] few taking sides with
[1:39:37] Jesus doesn't mean you're against other
[1:39:40] human
[1:39:43] beings on the
[1:39:45] contrary you're
[1:39:48] for one particular race
[1:39:56] not the black race not the brown not the
[1:40:00] white not the yellow or red the human
[1:40:04] race because in that human race are Sons
[1:40:08] and Daughters of
[1:40:10] God that's why that's why God told the
[1:40:15] prophet don't call them rickes and Ras
[1:40:18] no
[1:40:20] more my children are still in those
[1:40:22] systems
[1:40:25] and when you do that you hurt
[1:40:29] them you stunt their
[1:40:34] growth St John
[1:40:38] 3:16 scripture well known to all of
[1:40:43] us for God so loved the world that he
[1:40:46] gave his only begotten son that
[1:40:48] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:40:50] perish but have everlasting life
[1:40:59] for for God sent not his son into the
[1:41:02] world to condemn the world but the world
[1:41:04] through him might be
[1:41:11] saved he that believeth on him is not
[1:41:17] condemned but he that believeth not is
[1:41:20] condemned already
[1:41:24] because he has not believed in the name
[1:41:26] of the only begotten Son of
[1:41:32] God Lord let us Speak Lord let us
[1:41:37] speak so that all that
[1:41:43] hear will follow
[1:41:48] Jesus and they will want to know where
[1:41:50] he dwells
[1:41:53] in the father's
[1:41:55] house and they
[1:41:58] delivered of this old pest
[1:42:03] house
[1:42:05] ptil Luke 15 and verse
[1:42:15] one the testimony of
[1:42:18] Luke a gospel that he
[1:42:22] gave then Drew near unto him all the
[1:42:25] publicans and sinners for to hear
[1:42:30] him and the Pharisees and Scribe
[1:42:33] murmured saying this man receiveth
[1:42:35] Sinners and eateth with
[1:42:44] them they were
[1:42:46] murmuring but speaking just loud enough
[1:42:49] so all could hear them
[1:42:54] what were they doing provoking the
[1:42:57] People by laying seeds in the hearts of
[1:43:00] the
[1:43:03] people that would ultimately bring forth
[1:43:06] the
[1:43:10] crucifixion the
[1:43:14] fullness of their
[1:43:18] boycott let me read it again what were
[1:43:21] these Pharisees doing and the
[1:43:25] scriptures they were provoking the
[1:43:27] People by laying seeds in the hearts of
[1:43:30] the
[1:43:32] people that would ultimately bring forth
[1:43:35] the
[1:43:43] crucifixion no no that would ultimately
[1:43:47] bring forth the crucifixion
[1:44:02] uh-huh the fullness of their
[1:44:05] boycott for every boycott that
[1:44:10] comes comes to bring a final end and
[1:44:17] result don't get
[1:44:22] involved in the boycotts of this
[1:44:25] world it's not of
[1:44:28] God it's not for
[1:44:31] you God has something better for
[1:44:37] you God has something more excellent for
[1:44:42] you God has a character building process
[1:44:46] for you and me
[1:44:53] Luke
[1:44:57] 1511 this is a parable of a
[1:45:01] father who stood with arms outstretched
[1:45:04] towards the younger and the
[1:45:11] Elder out
[1:45:13] stretched towards the younger and the
[1:45:16] Elder
[1:45:23] not taking sides with either one of
[1:45:28] them but
[1:45:30] realizing that neither the younger or
[1:45:33] the
[1:45:34] [Music]
[1:45:36] Elder understood the
[1:45:42] value the power the glory of the
[1:45:46] inheritance that the father had for
[1:45:50] them neither the younger or the
[1:45:54] Elder
[1:45:56] appreciated or understood the
[1:46:00] value of the inheritance that the father
[1:46:03] had for both of
[1:46:06] them each one wanted give me what's
[1:46:12] mine verse
[1:46:15] 11 and he said a certain man had two
[1:46:20] sons it's a parable
[1:46:23] not to be taken
[1:46:25] literally there's a mystery laying in
[1:46:28] it
[1:46:30] Beyond just that a young man threw
[1:46:32] himself to the
[1:46:35] world and that the older be be be became
[1:46:38] a denominational
[1:46:43] believer full of full of
[1:46:45] anger and yet
[1:46:47] religious no it goes beyond that verse
[1:46:51] 12 and the Young of them said to his
[1:46:54] father father give me the portion of
[1:46:55] goods that falleth to
[1:47:03] me and and he divided unto them his
[1:47:07] living and not many days after the
[1:47:09] younger son gathered all
[1:47:14] [Music]
[1:47:15] together and took his journey into a far
[1:47:19] country and there wasted his substance
[1:47:22] with Riot his
[1:47:25] living and when he had spent all there
[1:47:27] arose a mighty famine in the land and he
[1:47:30] began to be in
[1:47:35] want and he went and joined himself to a
[1:47:38] citizen of that country and he sent him
[1:47:41] into his fields to feed
[1:47:51] swine now listen
[1:47:54] close he joined himself to a man who had
[1:47:57] a a herd of
[1:48:02] swine that tells us that this man was
[1:48:05] not a
[1:48:07] Jew this man was not a
[1:48:10] Believer this one this man was a pagan
[1:48:13] ungodly
[1:48:16] Gentile and this Jewish
[1:48:19] boy who had been taught that this was
[1:48:22] blasphemy for him to touch
[1:48:25] this joined himself to this
[1:48:28] man got a job feeding the
[1:48:35] swine verse
[1:48:37] 16 and he would Fain have filled his
[1:48:40] belly with the hus that the swine did
[1:48:42] eat and no man gave unto
[1:48:50] him the young man
[1:48:54] with a Jewish
[1:48:59] upbringing Jewish father who taught him
[1:49:03] the
[1:49:05] law he he is
[1:49:08] now committing for Israel an
[1:49:11] unpardonable
[1:49:19] sin this young man to return to his
[1:49:23] father
[1:49:25] natural to return to return to a natural
[1:49:28] Jewish
[1:49:31] father that if he would
[1:49:35] return the father would be
[1:49:39] obligated to Stone this son to
[1:49:44] death not receive him for he crossed the
[1:49:49] line but Jesus wasn't speaking naturally
[1:49:54] it was a parable he was speaking
[1:49:58] Supernatural and the younger
[1:50:03] son
[1:50:04] living living in
[1:50:09] sin

[1:52:48] to his
[1:52:50] father but when he was yet a great way
[1:52:57] off his father saw him our father saw
[1:53:03] us when we were all a great way
[1:53:07] off when we were in
[1:53:09] sin when we were
[1:53:11] stealing when we were living when we
[1:53:14] were
[1:53:16] lying when we were when we were drunken
[1:53:19] when we were

[1:53:23] things yet because we were Sons and
[1:53:25] Daughters of
[1:53:27] God God saw us when we were that far
[1:53:33] away and then his father saw
[1:53:36] him and had
[1:53:38] compassion and ran and fell on his
[1:53:42] neck and kissed
[1:53:45] him this is a parable verse
[1:53:48] 20 and verse
[1:53:50] 20 is the day of P
[1:53:53] Pentecost when the father saw
[1:53:57] 120 in the upper
[1:53:59] room
[1:54:01] shaking hiding from the
[1:54:05] Romans hiding from the from the Jewish
[1:54:07] Orthodox

[1:54:13] were being killed and
[1:54:18] persecuted and he arose and came to his
[1:54:21] father verse 20
[1:54:24] but when he was yet a great way off his
[1:54:26] father's St had compassion and ra and
[1:54:29] ran and fell on his neck and kissed
[1:54:38] him and the son said unto
[1:54:42] him
[1:54:44] father I know I haven't been such a good
[1:54:49] boy but you know what you're not such a
[1:54:51] great dad
[1:54:53] either that's not the way a son or a
[1:54:56] daughter should return who are
[1:55:01] repented a son or a daughter a father or
[1:55:04] mother when they're
[1:55:07] repented they come back and say I have
[1:55:10] sinned against heaven and in thy
[1:55:13] sight 21
[1:55:22] and am no more worthy to be called thy
[1:55:28] son
[1:55:30] repentance this man was ready for a
[1:55:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:55:39] repentance opens the doors of
[1:55:43] Heaven for the fire of the Holy Ghost to
[1:55:45] come
[1:55:49] down verse 22
[1:55:53] but the father said to his
[1:55:58] servants that's not good
[1:56:01] enough if you think you're fooling
[1:56:05] me no no one fools the
[1:56:08] father he knew he was
[1:56:11] repented he knew he was sorry for all he
[1:56:13] had
[1:56:16] done but the father said to his
[1:56:20] servants bring forth the best robe and
[1:56:22] put it on
[1:56:23] them put a ring on his hand and shoes on
[1:56:26] his
[1:56:28] feet oh a church was being born on the
[1:56:31] day of Pentecost here it was a
[1:56:35] prophecy bring and bring hither the
[1:56:37] fatted calf and kill
[1:56:39] it let us eat and be
[1:56:42] married for this my son was dead and is
[1:56:45] alive
[1:56:47] again he was lost and is found and they
[1:56:51] began to be
[1:56:53] mared a church is
[1:56:56] born on the day of
[1:56:58] Pentecost it was a
[1:57:01] parable of the younger and older
[1:57:05] son brother Daniel proved that
[1:57:09] prove by the word that a young that two
[1:57:13] boys represented two
[1:57:18] churches because I've only heard said
[1:57:22] the woman represents the
[1:57:25] churches okay go back in your minds to
[1:57:28] the Old
[1:57:31] Testament go with me to the Book of
[1:57:35] Genesis and let's see
[1:57:38] Joseph bringing his two
[1:57:40] sons the younger and the
[1:57:43] older Ephraim and
[1:57:47] Manasses to his Prophet father Jacob
[1:57:53] k a
[1:57:56] prophet and he wants for Jacob to pray
[1:58:00] for his two
[1:58:03] sons as was the custom and tradition of
[1:58:09] Israel is he wants them he wants him to
[1:58:12] to bless the
[1:58:15] firstborn because and the firstborn gets
[1:58:18] all of the father's Goods
[1:58:25] those and the
[1:58:27] younger would just get a
[1:58:31] blessing you've been a good
[1:58:33] boy and uh I'm I'm happy to have you as
[1:58:36] a
[1:58:39] son but you're going to have to go out
[1:58:41] and get a
[1:58:43] job your older brother is the
[1:58:46] firstborn and he gets
[1:58:49] everything and he puts the elders at
[1:58:52] Jacob's right
[1:58:55] hand and the youngest at his
[1:58:59] left and he says we're ready
[1:59:02] father bless
[1:59:04] them and Jacob is blind now remember
[1:59:09] that and Jacob crosses his
[1:59:13] hands and he gives the inheritance of
[1:59:15] the
[1:59:18] firstborn to the
[1:59:20] youngest to the youngest
[1:59:24] girl no no no no no they were
[1:59:28] boys he gives the inheritance of the
[1:59:32] firstborn the youngest
[1:59:36] boy he gives the
[1:59:39] youngest The
[1:59:41] Inheritance that belonged to the
[1:59:44] firstborn and to the
[1:59:48] firstborn just gives a simple blessing
[1:59:52] and Joseph opens his eyes a
[1:59:56] little and he sees his dad crossed his
[2:00:00] hands he said no
[2:00:03] father I've already placed them the way
[2:00:05] they should
[2:00:08] be I have scripturally placed these two
[2:00:13] boys you messed it up you crossed your
[2:00:17] hands Jacob didn't understand
[2:00:20] it but being
[2:00:22] prophet he just obeyed what God
[2:00:26] told cross your
[2:00:29] hands and give the
[2:00:31] inheritance to the
[2:00:35] younger what was it an
[2:00:38] allegory that at the cross of
[2:00:41] Calvary The Inheritance that belonged to
[2:00:46] Israel would be given to a New Testament
[2:00:50] Church
[2:00:52] born at the opening of the first
[2:00:56] seal at the first coming of
[2:01:00] Christ what Israel
[2:01:03] rejected what Israel
[2:01:06] rejected the opening of the book the
[2:01:09] Lamb's Book and the loosing of the Seven
[2:01:16] Seals that's what Israel
[2:01:20] rejected that's what was was given to a
[2:01:22] New Testament
[2:01:25] Church on the day of
[2:01:28] Pentecost verse
[2:01:30] 22 but the father said to his servants

[2:02:18] Christ we are eating today

[2:02:54] verse
[2:02:55] 25 now his Elder son was in the field
[2:02:59] this is the Jewish
[2:03:02] church this was an allegory a
[2:03:06] parable that Jesus was giving to the

[2:03:15] know that they're the Elder
[2:03:19] son and the now this now his Elder son

[2:04:23] and he called the eldest son he called
[2:04:25] he called one of the servants and asked
[2:04:28] what these things
[2:04:36] meant what is this that's
[2:04:41] taken this is the Prophecies of the

[2:04:55] book and Loos the Seven
[2:05:00] Seals this is the prophecy of the
[2:05:02] prophets coming to
[2:05:05] pass and this day these scriptures are
[2:05:09] alive amongst us
[2:05:12] today verse
[2:05:15] 27 and he said unto him thy brother is
[2:05:17] come and thy father hath killed the
[2:05:20] fatted calf because Heath received them
[2:05:23] safe and
[2:05:31] sound and the elder
[2:05:36] brother and the Orthodox Church of
[2:05:40] Israel with their high
[2:05:42] priest and the denomination of that
[2:05:46] day and he was
[2:05:50] angry and would not not go
[2:05:54] in verse
[2:05:58] 28 and would not go
[2:06:00] in to this
[2:06:02] revival to recognize that Jesus was the
[2:06:06] Christ they would not go in and receive
[2:06:09] Jesus of Nazareth as
[2:06:14] Messiah they would not go in and be born
[2:06:19] again therefore came his father out and
[2:06:22] intreated
[2:06:26] them what just happened
[2:06:29] here the the boycott of the
[2:06:32] Elder had just
[2:06:34] begun verse
[2:06:36] 29 and he answering said to his father
[2:06:39] Lo these many years do I serve
[2:06:46] Thee the Jewish
[2:06:48] church is saying Lo these many years I
[2:06:52] serve
[2:06:54] thee how many
[2:06:56] years about 2,000 at
[2:07:01] least since the days that the church got
[2:07:04] established under
[2:07:09] Moses under
[2:07:13] Abraham and lo these many years do I
[2:07:16] serve
[2:07:17] thee
[2:07:19] this verse 29
[2:07:24] the Jewish church had they they claimed

[2:07:30] years neither transgressed I at any time
[2:07:34] thy
[2:07:38] [Music]
[2:07:40] commandment and yet they had broken all
[2:07:43] the Commandments through the
[2:07:46] years and then he said and yet thou

[2:07:59] and yet thou never gavest me a
[2:08:02] [Music]
[2:08:06] kid you never gave
[2:08:09] me a
[2:08:11] sacrifice that would bring me
[2:08:15] happiness with my
[2:08:20] friends and yet
[2:08:22] the
[2:08:24] sacrifice
[2:08:25] Jesus I'll not give you a
[2:08:29] kid I'll give you a
[2:08:31] lamb they didn't want the
[2:08:35] lamb so they haven't been married ever
[2:08:39] since they haven't been
[2:08:42] happy from the days that Israel rejected
[2:08:47] Messiah now they rejected the joy
[2:08:54] unspeakable and full of Glory that comes
[2:08:57] by
[2:08:59] receiving Jesus Christ as your personal
[2:09:04] Savior and staying away from
[2:09:08] boycotting the boycotts of this
[2:09:11] world Luke 15 and verse 30
[2:09:24] but as soon as this thy son was come
[2:09:26] which ha devoured thy living with

[2:09:31] fatted
[2:09:41] calf and he said unto him
[2:09:44] son thou art ever with
[2:09:47] me and all that I have is thine
[2:09:51] God ordained it to Israel from the days
[2:09:53] of
[2:09:56] Abraham and thy s and thy seed shall be
[2:09:59] as the sand upon the
[2:10:04] Earth and when and when they fall into
[2:10:08] bondage under a great
[2:10:12] nation I will deliver

[2:13:10] raptured to be
[2:13:12] quickened changed and
[2:13:16] translated by the power of the Holy
[2:13:18] Ghost
[2:13:21] God rich in
[2:13:24] Mercy is looking not for a big
[2:13:30] group he's not looking for us to have ch
[2:13:33] to to have churches of 10 and 12 and
[2:13:39] 20,000 that's fine but he's looking for
[2:13:42] those who are honest in their
[2:13:48] hearts who are willing to repent
[2:13:52] who want to be
[2:13:54] changed daily who aren't putting periods
[2:13:58] on their
[2:14:00] Revelation but a
[2:14:04] comma God wants you and
[2:14:08] I to
[2:14:11] overcome our
[2:14:13] past how we grew
[2:14:15] up where our fathers and mothers
[2:14:19] were he wants now to look
[2:14:23] up my father who are in
[2:14:27] heaven Hallowed be thy
[2:14:30] name and thank him for the
[2:14:33] victory that he promised
[2:14:36] you by the baptism of the Holy
[2:14:43] Ghost I may not know the details of what
[2:14:46] you've gone through in your life
[2:14:51] but he
[2:14:53] knows and because of what he
[2:14:57] knows that's why he's allowed you to be
[2:15:00] here this
[2:15:03] morning years ago we were in a little
[2:15:07] town preaching the
[2:15:09] gospel s fipe in Guan
[2:15:14] mexo there was 10 people
[2:15:17] there in a tiny little house
[2:15:23] very poorly
[2:15:26] dressed no one in there would win a
[2:15:28] beauty
[2:15:31] contest no one in there would
[2:15:35] win a beauty
[2:15:46] cont but when they heard the pre the
[2:15:48] word preached
[2:15:53] they didn't have
[2:15:55] instruments
[2:15:59] instrumentos I think maybe they had a
[2:16:02] guitar they had a
[2:16:04] guitar they couldn't play it very
[2:16:07] good but when they heard the word
[2:16:12] preached 10
[2:16:14] people became a house on
[2:16:18] fire with praise and worship
[2:16:22] I felt better there than I than I have
[2:16:24] felt in churches where I've preached to
[2:16:32] thousands and the pastor
[2:16:34] came after the
[2:16:36] service
[2:16:38] crying and he gives me an
[2:16:44] offering 60 pesos pesos
[2:16:53] you know what those 60 pesos
[2:16:58] were do you know what they
[2:17:02] were it was the money that they needed
[2:17:05] for their children to
[2:17:17] e that
[2:17:19] night those 10 little
[2:17:22] people they gave
[2:17:24] [Music]
[2:17:26] everything we give from our
[2:17:30] abundance but but may we begin to
[2:17:35] learn to give it all to
[2:17:38] Jesus to give it all one to
[2:17:42] another I'm not just speaking of your
[2:17:46] money I'm speaking of your
[2:17:49] love of your
[2:17:52] trust your obedience to
[2:17:55] Christ as we stand to our feet this

[2:18:56] mother you'll be the best son you'll be

[2:22:22] Daniel

[2:22:29] brother brandom going through a
[2:22:34] struggle he talking about how that
[2:22:37] brother brandham had a
[2:22:42] complex and uh in my heart the Lord said
[2:22:50] don't go by your
[2:22:52] feelings because your feelings go up and
[2:22:56] they go down no
[2:23:01] no and so I believe sometimes we we let
[2:23:05] our feelings lead us
[2:23:11] sometimes and I believe the Lord wants
[2:23:14] us to be led by his spirit
[2:23:23] he wants to see he wants
[2:23:26] us to see
[2:23:29] ourselves as he sees
