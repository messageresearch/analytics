you good morning God bless you all this morning it's good to be here once again his brother Leo had mentioned wherever two or three are gathered in my name is you can do a we've preached to small congregations we've preached to just a few in the South Pacific Islands we preached in a little cabin made of Bamboo Palm leaves on top everybody walked into the little little assembly barefooted and we shared the gospel there was five people personas but they came to hear the word they were as sincere as anyone could be living on a remote island no cars no real houses we have no air conditioning Caliente you didn't have to go apply for jobs there wasn't any there was no building going on in the island except the little Huts that they already had there was no uh bathrooms of field facilities as we know I'm here it was a remote island and on that little island there had been people personas that had come to recognize and understand that a man called Jesus had given his life for them and they wanted to know what it meant for them they wanted to know this Jesus missionaries over the years since even before World War II World War one had gone in and and and and and and and taken the measure of gospel that they had to them and preach them of Christ and during the time when on these islands there was a cannibals I spoke to one man he was about my age then I said how long have you been on this island he said I was born here he says have you ever left the island he says he didn't know if there was another world beyond the island there was maybe a total of a couple of thousand people on the island he says has it gotten better living here because there was nothing there he said oh yes much better there are no more cannibals it's better now he said when I was a little boy my father took me and my sister and he says never go further than this point because on the other side of the island there's a tribe and they eat children and we'll never see you again now the island was free of cannibals and Jesus was now had come to set them free of the worst of cannibals Lucifer himself like a roaring lion wanted to devour them all and on this little island and the name of the island what's called hmm and we shared the gospel didn't have windows at openings didn't have a door we just walked in Ramos everyone wore some kind of a sandals but to go into church they took their sandals off so they wouldn't carry all the mud in but and as I'm getting ready to walk in the brother stops your shoes I go oh excuse me sorry about that I'm American you know but had I been Mexican president I would have had the same problem you see the culture is different but get in the heart there's a longing you know Jesus as a personal savior something inside us tells us this man is offered eternal life he's given his life and became our sins and died in Rose the third day that we could become his righteousness you could say I'll never be that good brother Daniel it has nothing to do with you being that good we were making a few adjustments this morning for our listeners on uh on the internet YouTube I think we had uh some success I hope we hear good good news from them listening this morning and that the volumes are better and they can hear better the God's word and uh and be blessed we posted this morning there on the little board we received uh letters from invitation from the brother in Congo [Music] those are letters that he had to have notarized in Congo and he sent those to us then we had to send those notarized letters of invitations the Congo Embassy there in Washington DC are you in Washington they say and they would issue the Visas so we've received the the Visa back and we do have our plane tickets purchased I believe we leave on October 2nd and we come back on the 11th I think it's uh in the evening sometime so um I look forward to the trip to be with the Saints in Congo I've always enjoyed going places and being with God's people whether it's three or four on a remote island or 1500 in the Caribbean wherever we might be whether it be amongst the Portuguese Brothers in Brazil the Mayan Brothers in in Yucatan oh Los Hermanos everywhere God has a people and you know the cultures can be very different you go to France and the culture is very different from ourselves can you go to England and the culture is very different the language is different but when you meet Believers from around the world regardless of the language that is spoken if they've caught a revelation and recognize the day and their message recognize the great price that Jesus Christ paid for us then we're all speaking the same language we understand each other clearly we Rejoice together and bless the god of Heaven who descended changing forms to get closer to us until he finally achieved the form he wanted to come to see us the great Holy Spirit moving in the midst of the seven churches which we realize that this prophecy in Revelations it's a vision they were they were actual churches in the days of the Apostles okay it was churches where where the Apostle Paul had gone and he had taken this Gospel of Jesus Christ they were real literal places but but they were also an allegory within themselves they actually ripped they were also actually prophetic churches that were represented the time of the Gentiles just as the Bible speaks of the time of the Jews he had allotted the Jewish people 70 weeks [Music] and they were symbolic weeks they were not literal weeks it was a space of time and in the midst of those weeks it said that that Christ would come but he would be cut off in the midst of the last week and that's exactly what happened and the time allotted for Israel paused at the cross when the high priest rejected Jesus Christ and took Caesar as their King then then God moved the very same message that we received of Christ the very same message that was first offered to to Israel by Jesus himself will be given to them again and they'll come to recognize that this Jesus was Messiah he was almighty God he was their lord he was their savior they'll realize that their ancestors crucified ancestors the Bible says that they will go into deep mournings and and out of a Nation but God is using those politicians to hold back the wrath of God to hold back the Nations that want to Destroyer foreign is holding back the Wrath because there is Believers in America there is Gentile Believers throughout the world that are believing in Christ that aren't hooked up to any denominations there are they are looking for Jesus Christ that see the writings of the prophets and the things that the prophets have written and they can see by Revelation that we're living in the last days that once again the world has become a Sodom and Gomorrah and judgment is about to strike but God is holding the judgment to increase our faith Rapture in faith to be changed in the moment in the moment in the twinkling of an hour as a pass to Paul taught that there will be a people in this last Church which was the last Church age of these seven churches God rich in Mercy as we stand to our feet and read about a book of Revelations Revelations chapter one and verse a prophet taught us that the Book of Revelations represented the whole book of the Bible that had been sealed to the hearts and minds of the people and when Christ came he opened the book he was the first it's written in the Bible all you have to do is read it behold don't weep John for the line of the tribe the root of David had prevailed and loose the Seven Seals the book that he was opening was the Lamb's Book and the lambest book was a book of life the Lamb's Book was a book of eternal life but the lamb and the lion in prophecies it was the same man it was Jesus Christ Jesus of Nazareth the Lord Jesus Christ that means this man Jesus was the Son of God the body that God created God called that body the Son of God not another God no no a body that God created was given the title The Son of God we believe that and then God that body was formed and came forth and grew it's true that body had a human Spirit it had to have a human Spirit human race because the law of redemption required a Kinsmen to lift up a fallen brother it had to be a Kinsmen to redeem a Kinsmen so God kept his word and came as the Kinsman um and the nature the soul of that man Jehovah God in flesh Emmanuel Emmanuel and he shall be called Emmanuel Emmanuel God With Us and one day India after his death burial and Resurrection he would be called The Son of God once again representing the Holy Spirit then it wouldn't be God just in one man but now God could come and dwell in the hearts of all his children he changed forms from the throne to the Cross resurrected the third day to come back is the great Holy Spirit from Heart to Heart even this morning Revelations 1 verse the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sentence signified it but his Angel unto his servant John revelation Manifesto is John was given the revelation of Jesus Christ is it to show one to his servants things which will shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant Johnson so Jesus didn't appear to to John again in a flesh body but in a supernatural body in a Celestial body the Bible in verse 2 says who bear record of of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all the things that he saw yeah John Juan was an eyewitness and and he was chosen to see these visions and share them he was more than an apostle he was more than just a prophet he was chosen to write this last book of the Bible a book A book that contained things passed a book that contained prophecies and a book that contained prophecies that were yet to come to pass so in this book it's not just future things that were written but when John saw the Visions some of the things he was saying they're already history it already happened as a matter of fact he had been alive and watched them with his eyes when they happened [Music] [Music] [Music] the Holy Spirit speaking to our hearts and we can be a happy people not a bunch of jokers not just always saying jokes I probably say too many jokes myself it's okay be funny but not so silly till it walks us out of the presence of God we must stay in this presence and verse 3 basically blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand blessed is he that readeth the words of His prophets sounds like a family altar doesn't it reading to the kids hmm well my kids are already older brother blessed is he that readeth here why if anyone should be able to sit down and hear Dad read a few Scriptures it should be the older kids in the home you might be saying you're saying that because of me brother Daniel I am I absolutely am I'm targeting you this morning let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for your word and we ask your blessings in Jesus name amen you may be seated Revelations the plan unfolding a prophetic plan um to take us back into the presence of God to return us back to what Adam had had been giveness and Eve but they fell from it the first Adam partook of the of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and it brought forth death is he he became a part of that transgression no he was not the transgressor himself God was tutoring this first Adam to bring forth the family of God and just the way he brought Adam into existence he formed to the body from the dust of the earth and he called that Spirit man that he made in Genesis remember it was in Genesis then he formed the man from the dust of the earth it wasn't two separate men one was Adam the spirit man and then one was the flesh man a body of Flesh a vessel of clay he was going to put the spirit man and when he put Adam spirit in this flesh body to them the Bible says he became a living Soul there he was a spirit man living in a flesh body living in a body of Flesh because the Bible said that God needed a man to tell the Earth and a spirit man didn't have arms and legs natural ones that could pick and touch anything up on this Earth are the spirit mans From Another Dimension so God brought that Spirit man wrapped him into a body here on Earth now Adam had hands with which he could till the Earth this Eden that God had given him but but the tilling of the earth that God wanted Adam to do was the telling that God the Father himself had done you know how Adam's been telling you that he'll he'll just speak the word and he'll place a germanized seed within you and he'll place it in a in a virgin womb and it'll bring forth the family your family Adams Adams children Adam's Sons Adams daughters but Adam hasn't been given that Authority yet Adam hasn't been able to do that yet this tutoring of of the of God the spirit of God with Adam it's taken a long time don't you think Eve well it does seem like a long time well I've got a shortcut for you that will give you the same results and you'll bring forth life you'll bring forth the family but the shortcut turned out to be a a a shortcut to death and then she offered the shortcut to Adam was uncomfortable but it was his wife hmm and when the shortcut was done the Bible says they both realized they were naked and they were ashamed and they heard the spirit of God moving in the midst of the garden is nice he didn't mean what part of Eden are you in are you on the North Side East Side the south side where are you at and he didn't mean geographically no no are you still standing on the word are you still believing on the promise are you still living by faith no no no no no but it's this woman that you gave me foreign the first Adam partook of the eve the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil and it brought death sometimes we're told and I've heard people over the ages yes well I guess my son and daughter had to go out into the world so they could better appreciate when and if they ever come to Christ Christo how much better it is but that's not a true statement that's a lie of the devil that you have to partake of wickedness to appreciate the goodness those things put baggage and complexes on our lives and God's able to deliver us there is a more excellent way the first Adam compromise God's word the first Adam accepted a shortcut through the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil that tree was Lucifer that tree was Satan but it's not written that of the second Adam with me to Isaiah yes Isaiah 7 is Isaiah chapter 7 and verse 15. I'm sure you're all familiar with the scripture once we begin reading it families speaking to Israel and in this as he's speaking to Israel the spirit comes upon him and he moves into this prophetic word and he says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and call his name Emmanuel a prophecy is coming he's on the way listen to this is eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good yes butter and that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the goods all the children give them the goodness of God give them the word of God dress them modestly from the time they're little oh I see little little girls today two and three years old even in folks in the message and they'll take them swimming and put them in a little bikini bikini when do we start teaching the modesty it's not the child that's having a problem with modesty the child is unconscious she stood there she's too little to know they are innocent could it be the parents still having a problem with Mother's Day foreign could we begin too early I don't think we can begin too early you might be judged for it but we can begin too late and when the child Hits 10 11 and 12. Mom why can't I wear shorts are shorts why can't can I run around in a tank top anymore I've done it for the last 11 years why are the rules why are the rules it could be too late do you think you can change the rules it could be by that time the child is thinking this is hypocrisy because believe me by the time they hit 11 and 12. they can see the discrepancies God help us to set our homes in order to hold the standards if the children weren't very patient maybe the fathers are very patients if the children's have an outburst and yell back at us maybe they learned that from our outbursts that we yelled at them has offered us something Revelations chapter one and one Revelation says the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto her serpents servants things which was shortly come to pass and you signified it by his Angel unto his service it's the tree of knowledge and Good and Evil Eve the serpente it didn't bother him one bit to search out and take another man's wife that's the anointing on every man and on every woman they were cheat to that that would be unfaithful in their marriage vows and take another man and make another woman it's the same anointing that was in the garden with the serpent is Lucifer it destroyed the first family in Eden and Lucifer will use that tactic to destroy every family thereafter is this destroying America and the world today the foundation of a man and a woman in a sacred vowel [Music] marriage one to the other matrimony was God's plan from the beginning of the backbone of America and every nation was broken and it's that bro transgenders started with Eve and she fell into an act of adultery against her own husband and it threw the whole world into chaos and Satan has used the plan over and over and he's always used The Serpent of a man is a serpent of a woman and he gives lessons it's called Hollywood Hollywood has been Satan's tool to prompt by the lust of the flesh to destroy the family of God to destroy every marriage relationship but God rich in Mercy he said he would have a bride he said he would have a people were called by his name the first Steve received the seed of the serpenter she offered a shortcut to the teachings of God the Father you see what she part took of represented the shortcut but God was bringing Adam and Eve too Adam and Eve were to bring forth the family of God by the spoken word offered another plan telling her it would get her to the same place but it's God's word or only God's word can take you back to God that's what we're looking for second is Mary Maria was the first Eve Mary was the second Mary Mary was the second Eve in this picture in this prophecy in this allegory of back in Genesis the first Steve by the first Adam should have brought forth children through an Immaculate birth just as they were brought into Creations brings forth the second Adam and the second Adam brings forth a plan all over again in the beginning plan he said you've got a perverted birth the sex birth is the curse it's what the human race fell to is when Jesus came born is buried Rose the third day took captivative Captain the Bible says he set all the slaves free from himself Jesus Christ the son of God and he offered All God's Children he offered everyone whosoever will but only his children can be he offered you an Immaculate birth like we should have had from the beginning like it was his intention for us but when no man was found worthy he became that man he became the Lamb of God he became the lamb that would take away our sins his blood would wash the curse away that we could be born again that was the first coming of Christ that was the opening of the first seal that was part one but at the end time today at the second coming part seven what's he offering to us again that was lost through dark ages of a Roman Catholic system it's available again today that we can be born again and be changed and mortify the Deeds of the flesh Los Angeles is the second Eve brought forth the second Adam Jesus Christ God made flesh that almighty God himself could be our Mentor again like he was with Adam and take you through a personal experience of being born again justified by faith we believe what Jesus did for us Sanctified by the spirit we start changing all our old habits we start changing the way we talk we start losing our fits of anger we we we start rising up above the depressions that hold us we start being more like Jesus not just with visitors but especially at home that's in John to the seven churches which are in Asia John John begins his ministry John begins to declare what God has called him too and here's his letter John to the seven churches which are in Asia Grace be unto you and peace from him which is which was and which is to come and from the seven spirits which are before his throne and from Jesus Christ who is the faithful witness and the first begotten of the dead and the prince of the kings of the Earth is the Bible says here he was the prince of the kings of the Earth wouldn't he be the king of all the kings he will it's a future prophecy but here it's still Satan's Eden you see the prince of all the kings of the earth a prince is an heir to a king um and when that King dies the prince Rises up and he becomes the king he becomes the air so God one day will inherit this Earth because he holds the title deed to it and Satan is just a squatter on this Earth but one day the prince will rise up and take back all his possession and we'll live with the father on an earth it's been cleansed with the fire of the Holy Spirit the same fire that's cleansing us today in our daily walk in our daily life the same fire that stops us from saying certain things the same fire that tell that keeps us from acting a certain way the same fire that's that that's changing us from the old man we are to to a new man in Christ is the same fire that will clean this Earth the Bible says of all sins he says and the prince of the kings of the earth unto him that love us and washed us from our sins in his own blood amen he's lifting him up Jesus Christ now remember there's been prophets since the day of Adam Adam himself was a prophet of God and you go through the old testamento and the prophetic Ministry has been a key Ministry that God is and even in the new testamento the prophetic Ministry was never announced turn with me to I believe it's Luke Chapter 16. he says hmm Jesus speaking to the Pharisees and he's speaking to them of course in Parables for the psalmist had had prophesied that the ministry of Jesus the ministry of Messiah that he would speak in Parables and without a parable he would not speak but in Parables when he came he would speak things that had been hidden since the foundation of the world and here once again God speaking to Pharisees and he says no servant can serve two masters like Adam and Eve they couldn't serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other foreign and the Pharisees also who were Covetous heard all these things and they derided him and he said unto them ye are they which justify yourselves before men but God knoweth your hearts for that which is highly esteemed among men is abomination in the sight of God the law and the prophets were until John and immediately folks think that means there's no more profits from that day but that's stopping in the middle of the sentence was John a prophet Jesus said he was since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presses into it God wasn't doing away with the prophetic Ministry God was changing what they would preach they would no longer preach law and judgment but they were going to be preaching the kingdom of God like John they were going to be preaching repent and be baptized that was the new ministry of this new testament prophecy prophet [Music] that you've come to partake of an inward work of an outward expression that you partake when you're baptized it's then when God has made a promise he baptizes you there with the Holy Ghost and tongues no Holy Ghost and Fire I mean once you rise up out of the water you know your change might you speak in tongues it's a gift of God might God call you to preach the gospel it's a gift of God but called to preach the gospel isn't what saves you might be what condemns you but what saves you is the blood of Jesus Christ my grace are you saved through faith not of yourself but the faith to serve them is the gift of God the law and the prophets were to preach this message it was the New Covenant it was the New Testament you say are you sure that the prophetic ministry didn't end could you be mistaken I I could be mistaken if it was just means but I'm positive it was a ministerial change and the prophets of the New Testament would preach the kingdom of God turn with me to Matthew 23.3 once again in Matthew 23 Jesus speaking with scribes and Pharisees in verse 14 to Matthew 23 says woe to you scribes and Pharisees these were the Ministers of the largest denomination in that day and he calls them Hypocrites he says for ye devour widow's houses you know ministers do that yet today in the 21st century and for a pretense make long prayer therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation and it goes on rebuking the Pharisees the pastors of Israel the evangelists of Israel the Apostles of Israel that day even their Prophet she's rebuking them blind guides and he goes on in in the rebuke of the ministry that was taking the people the children of Israel further from God and not closer hmm in verse 31. he says this he says wherefore ye be Witnesses unto yourselves that ye are the children of them which killed the prophets of all the prophets that God sent Israel probably more than 90 percent of them Israel the Israel killed their own Prophets he said fill you up then the measure of your fathers and he tells these Pharisees these ministers these pastors of Israel he says ye serpents ye Generation of Vipers how can you escape the damnation of Health this is Jesus speaking and then Jesus says remember this is long after John had been killed this is long after John had been beheaded John had been dead for a year or more and Jesus says wherefore behold I jesus long after John is gone I send unto you prophets and wise men and scribes shall kill and crucified and some of them you shall Scourge in your synagogues and persecute them from City to city that upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon the Earth from the blood of the righteous unto the blood of Zechariah son of barcience he says barely I sent you all these things shall come on this generation then he said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem how often would I have gathered I have gathered thy children together even as a hen gather through chickens under her wings Jehovah Jesus we're always here he types himself onto a great Eagle but dealing with Israel hear Jesus God and flesh types himself to a hint because Israel Israel was like chickens in a chicken yard it wasn't a rude statement it was God revealing to us the condition of the church at his first coming and it will be and is the condition of the church foreign but in verse 34. long after John had died long after Herod had put him to death Jesus says he said wherefore behold I still have a prophetic Ministry I kill Jesus Jesus will send you prophets and wise men and scribes yes there will be men after my own heart there will be men that follow me not tell us come join our denomination and you'll be saved no come and have a personal experience with Jesus Christ and his blood will wash away every stain and make you a new creature in Christ you'll never be the same and he'll be changing you daily as we live in his presence Mercy is raising up a bride Revelations apocalypses chapter 12. and Revelations 12 excuse me and verse 1. you ever had that problem you just can't find that scripture in the Bible you're looking for problems seems to be happening more often to me and I just got to trust him Revelations 12 1. the Bible's written in a way that it's hidden from the wise and Prudence a little here a little there as we shared with you when we read Revelations 5. everything in Revelations five had to happen before there could even be a Revelations one because it was from Revelations 5. when there's now an image of a lamb slain before the altars that wasn't the place where God stopped and couldn't move no more no no until he changes you completely kill you and I Surrender everything God is interceding for us there before the Father [Music] the father looks down she says they don't look like they're trying too hard just give me a little more time with them I'll make it work I know they're hard they wanna change he's interceding for you these are mediators to bring forth a woman the bride of Christ Revelations 12 1 says he's looking up into the heavens as he's sitting on some rocks in an island the entire Blue Sky becomes his television and he's catching these Visions in this giant blue sky it's a picture scene greater than the IMAX that they have today they say IMAX is the is the largest theater screen that exists in the world today well the visions that John was seen in the heavens it was like a super super IMAX it was so real to him more than real and he saw this here and he said and there appeared a great Wonder in heaven it filled the sky he said I saw a woman clothed with the sun and the moon under her feet but in a symbolic sense this was the Bride of Jesus Christ a gentile people she was clothed with the Sun and upon her head a crown of twelve Stars the first 12 Apostles to begin preaching the Kingdom of Heaven being with child cried yesterday and pain to be delivered this was a gentile bride because Israel never got to this place where Christ was birthed in here Israel never entered into the pains to be delivered and bring forth Christ enter the hope of glory in a natural sense it was little Mary but in a supernatural prophetic sense it's you and I it's a gentile church and then he says and there appeared another Wonder in heaven and behold a great red dragon it was Lucifer Lucifer he had seven heads seven crowns upon his head representing kings crowns represents it represents Kings horns represents dictatorships Lucifer Lucifer he had in his hands all the nations of that day and the Bible says and with this tale is the third part of the Stars now John is reaching back to the beginning when Michael and Lucifer fought in the heavens and Lucifer was cast down and he convinced the third part of the Stars representing the celestial beings the angels and then cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as it was born that represents in the days of Jesus when Lucifer anointed when he heard by the voice of the three Magi we've been following a star the prophecy of the prophets and it's it's to take us to him that's to be born wait a minute I'm King of the Jews we can't have two kings can't have it I won't have it deal wisely he tells them where is this King to be born he says we're not sure he says I'll find out all the high priests call the Levites call the scribes bring them in for a meeting where is Messiah King of the Jews and they begin searching the Prophecies of the prophets to be born in the city of David he will anointed of the Dragon there was little Mary which was ready to be delivered he wanted to devour this child as soon as it was born but the Bible said the Magi were warned of God that Herod wanted to just destroy this child and they went another way it was the Shepherds that were first there at the birth of Christ they celebrated the ministry of the Lamb told them where Messiah was being born said he will be the savior of the whole world you see that was the lamb Ministry the line of the tribe of Jews the king of the Jews was that to be the savior of the whole world and yet it was the same man but two different ministers that when the line of the tribes we'll take the Lion's Share and give this gospel the preaching of the Kingdom of Heaven to Israel when Israel rejected it then the king of the Jews went to get 70. there he took off his crowns he walked in King of the Jews and one hour later in deep prayer before the father he accepted his new ministry who will give his life's blood to save his children to save his son to save his daughter heal me come a lamb worthy of the father to accept for your place [Music] right I mean and his tail do the third part of the stars of Heaven and it cast them to the Earth that happened way back in Genesis and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered that was four thousand years later you see how this Bible is written and how does it matter how smart you are you can it takes Revelation and the dragon Steward before the woman which was ready to be delivered to devour her child as soon as it was born it was Herod anointed of Lucifer in that day and verse 5 says and she brought forth A Man Child Jesus Christ who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron watch how the scripture now jumps this is Christ the Holy Spirit at the white Throne judgment it's at the white Throne where this man child will rule All Nations it jumps back now to where he's a child again and her child was caught up unto God and to his throne foreign but it was just going to be 10 more days because that would be 50 days from the time of his resurrection and it would Mark a jubilee time in other words Pentecost was a jubilee year is they would be born again and the Bible says but you see how the scriptures jumps from us from from the word and it can be a future prophecy it can be a past prophecy verse 6 says and the woman fled Into the Wilderness the church the bride of Christ where she had the place prepared of God that they should feed her there a thousand two hundred and three Square days and there was war in heaven is dropping back and picking up on the last verse where Satan was cast down now he's adding more detail to that verse and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought and his angels and prevailed not neither was there a place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out that old serpenter you see there was a time that Satan was allowed to go before the Throne of God you can read in the Book of Job well that Satan could come before the Throne of God and begin to accuse job and God stood up and said no job's a man of God the Son of God no job you've made him a rich man he'll give giving him everything of course he serves you he says no you don't know job like I know foreign and there was war in heaven Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and the dragon fought his angels they were fighting once again to continue to have access Before the Throne of God but the Bible says they prevailed not available because God was vacating the place the place where he wants to loud Lucifer and those Devil's to accuse his people he was going to empty that spot in heaven because that spot was now for someone else that was the spot where there would be a lamb slain they would no longer bring accusations [Music] another negative thing about you everything the father hears about you in heaven no that's my son that's my daughter and these Angels were fighting for that spot the Bible said they prevailed either was their place found anymore in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out call the devil and Satan of which you and I are this morning it says he was cast out into the Earth and his angels were cast out with him you know when that happened that day on Calvary when God ascended and John scene and I seen a lamb as though it had been slain you know where that lamb was sitting now don't you in the spot that God vacated and pushed out Lucifer he says I'll never allow you in the spot again in this spot until my last child comes in will be a lamb slain natural and give and cause them to be born again that for you is immaculate birth because that has nothing to do the man or a woman it's God birth in you like he gave to Adam in the beginning verse 10. and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of His Christ for the accuser of our Brethren is cast down do you see it which accused them before God day and night foreign and the Brethren they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb hello and by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death throughout seven this is the body of Christ therefore Rejoice see heavens and neither dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the scene for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he hath but a short time and when the dragon saw that he was cast into the Earth he persecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child Equinox not a Jewish Church a gentile church this is Christ inner is and to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the Wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time and times and a half time from the face of the serpent this woman is the church this woman here is both wise and foolish virgin is because they're all believers they were all believers they were virgins they were living a holy Sanctified lives but one had the oil and one didn't one had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and was receiving refillings one was growing until the very statue of Christ one her faith was rising up to the place where her faith would rise up to Rapture in faith and the Bible says and the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after the woman the water represents the masses of people thank you that flood your life we allowed to flood our lives by the movies we watch by the little short clips we look at foreign hmm the high take the high-tech world is enchanting to the human mind until the word of God Appears boring we can't read it without falling asleep we can follow it for hours and the serpent cast out of his mouth as a flood our after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away of the flood of lost Humanity and the Earth helped the woman and the Earth opened her mouth and swallow up the flood which is help the woman okay earthquakes tsunamis tsunamis hurricanes tornadoes and tornadoes and the believer looks and sees how quick life can be snapped away and the Earth is helping us to see how short this life can be and the only safety zone is in Christ and the Earth helped the woman and the Earth opened her mouth and swallowed up the flood which the Dragon cast out of us and the dragon was Wrath with the woman the woman was Believers the woman was both wise and foolish virgins and the dragon was Wrath with the woman and went to make war with the remnant of her seeds listen close again and the dragon was Wrath with the woman he saw Believers he said I'm going to destroy these people Satan cannot distinguish between the wise virgins and the foolish he saw Believers because they all are can he says and he went the dragon was Wrath with the woman but he didn't make war with the woman he went to make war with the remnant of her seeds those that were left what happened between the karma the wise virgins were taken in a Rapture the dead in Christ will be caught up to meet him and when we're taken off the Earth the remnant of the seed of God the foolish version who are believers they just didn't surrender everything to God they needed another step deeper in their Christian world but they loved God but God wanted to bring them higher into his presence and they just couldn't take the next step of surrendering somewhere busy I just bought a yoke of oxen there's nothing wrong with that I just married a wife that's a wonderful thing I just bought a plot of land I want to make a cabin on it nothing wrong with that but it was these little things it became distractions Matthew 5 48. even as your father which is in heaven if you're struggling to see how to get to that perfection that's spoken of in Matthew 5 48. which Jesus is calling you to come to then go back and in prayer carefully read the last 47 verses because those 47 steps will take you to 48. the conclusion the conclusion of Jesus preaching on you being perfect if God requires it again through the blood of Christ let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this faithful group of people I pray that you continue to Open the Eyes of our understanding maybe maybe we may we be ever so wise the wise version who are lamps were trimmed and our vessels full of oil representing not only the baptism of the Holy Spirit which is the beginning of our Christian walk but the refilling after
