[50:18] evening we're going to be reading from a
[50:21] starting at Psalms 34 and verse
[50:25] 7 and brother Joshua I sent you some
[50:29] emails there some quotes for tonight's
[50:32] service Psalms 34 and verse
[50:46] 7 and it reads like this see the angel
[50:50] of the Lord encampeth round about them
[50:53] that fear Him and delivereth them and
[51:01] the angel of the
[51:03] Lord encampeth round about them that
[51:06] fear
[51:07] Him and deliver
[51:11] him and I and I am a
[51:14] witness that he's done just
[51:17] that and I'm sure if you look at your
[51:19] lives you can say you too are a
[51:23] witness of his presence of this Angel of
[51:26] the Lord
[51:30] that he's been with you and now even in
[51:34] you to the ends of the Earth let's pray
[51:38] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[51:42] presence ever with
[51:44] us and we ask your blessings
[51:47] now upon your word may something be said
[51:52] to bless the
[51:53] hearts to encourage your children
[51:57] to press
[52:00] forward with a Victorious Life In
[52:03] Christ we thank you now in Jesus
[52:06] name amen amen you may be
[52:11] seated tonight like to speak on a on a
[52:17] thought and we've shared it
[52:20] before but I thought it was timely to
[52:22] share it once
[52:25] again because there's many things that
[52:28] go that go into this
[52:31] thought that will share with us more
[52:34] than what the title
[52:38] reveals and the title is the Angel With
[52:41] The Sweep back
[52:44] Wings many of you have seen the the Life
[52:51] Magazine it was from
[52:54] 1963 I I have one I have two of
[52:57] them and in
[53:01] 1963 Life Magazine their
[53:05] photographers they took a
[53:07] picture of a mysterious
[53:10] Cloud that appeared uh in the
[53:14] heavens in in in this area of the world
[53:17] where we
[53:19] live uh from Tucson Arizona you could
[53:22] see
[53:23] it people in Flagstaff could see it
[53:28] people who lived out towards Willcox
[53:30] Arizona could see
[53:33] it they said people could see it from a
[53:36] radius of 200 miles
[53:40] around and this picture of this
[53:42] mysterious ring Cloud as they called
[53:49] it they they they they never could
[53:52] figure out what it
[53:55] was and yet we know what it
[53:58] was because it was a prophetic
[54:01] sign and it was a sign of the second
[54:04] coming of the
[54:05] Lord and it was a sign of the opening of
[54:08] part
[54:11] seven of the Lamb's Book of
[54:15] Life the Lamb's Book of Life is exactly
[54:19] what it says it
[54:21] is it is a book of
[54:23] life it's this new testament
[54:27] in the Bible this is the Lamb's Book of
[54:31] Life because the Lamb's Book of
[54:33] Life Begins how any how shall we say
[54:37] biography would
[54:40] begin speaking about the person that the
[54:43] biography is writing
[54:46] of and the New Testament in the Book of
[54:49] Matthew
[54:51] begins and this is the
[54:54] generation of Jesus Christ
[54:58] the lamb and and and it's going to and
[55:00] he's going to display and he's going to
[55:03] tell us who his generation
[55:06] is and that's where the New Testament
[55:10] started the Holy Spirit through
[55:14] Matthew
[55:16] declaring you read this you read this
[55:19] book of the Lamb's Book of Life and
[55:23] you'll find out who you
[55:25] are brother Bram says I found
[55:28] out that I wasn't a son of Charles and
[55:31] Ella
[55:33] Branham not just that I was more I was a
[55:38] son I was a daughter of
[55:40] God in the mind of God for the
[55:43] foundation of the
[55:45] world so in in the I would say it was
[55:49] about the late
[55:51] 70s early
[55:54] 80s when I first began to
[55:57] here of of uh of men
[56:02] speaking that the that the angel in the
[56:05] cloud
[56:08] picture the one who who when you look at
[56:11] the picture that Life Magazine
[56:14] took you can see this Angel and his
[56:17] wings are swept
[56:20] back and uh so there was raising up a a
[56:25] teaching I guess you could say
[56:28] that the angel in the cloud
[56:31] picture was William brandom's
[56:34] theop or Celestial
[56:38] body they they took one
[56:41] quote and of course they've added
[56:44] more out of the Feast of the
[56:47] trumpets to prove their
[56:49] Revelation but with one
[56:52] quote of whether it be what William
[56:54] brandham said
[56:57] or or be one quote in the
[57:00] Bible you cannot prove it to be a
[57:05] truth you can prove that's the way you
[57:07] see
[57:09] it but you can't prove that it's a that
[57:12] it's a truth a Biblical
[57:15] truth because it must be word upon
[57:18] word and line upon line you can take one
[57:22] thought of
[57:24] anything and and run often say it means
[57:27] this and this and this and
[57:30] this and the further you go with your
[57:32] human
[57:34] reasoning the further you get away from
[57:36] the
[57:38] truth and of course one of the first
[57:42] times I heard a man speaking on this
[57:45] they went to this
[57:49] scripture the one we just read Psalms
[57:52] 34 it said the angel of the Lord
[57:55] encampeth round the about them that fear
[57:57] Him and deliver
[58:01] them they read the scripture then they
[58:04] make the
[58:05] statement they say you see that's your
[58:10] theophany that's your Celestial body and
[58:14] then they go on speaking for 30 minutes
[58:16] an
[58:17] hour but that's not Bible
[58:20] teaching that's building your own
[58:23] Doctrine or
[58:25] Creed because you're not going from
[58:27] scripture upon scripture line upon
[58:31] line here a little in the Bible and
[58:34] there's some more in the
[58:36] Bible so so First Corinthians 2
[58:41] Corinthians
[58:43] 5 the Apostle Paul said
[58:46] this for we know that if our Earthly
[58:50] House of this Tabernacle were
[58:55] dissolved
[58:58] we have a building of
[59:00] God and house not made with
[59:04] hands a house not made with
[59:07] hands Eternal in the
[59:09] heavens so God doesn't build natural
[59:14] buildings he's building Supernatural
[59:18] buildings and Paul is speaking here of
[59:22] our celestial
[59:24] bodies and this body that he's speaking
[59:27] of is what it's called our
[59:31] theophany a Celestial
[59:34] body now a
[59:37] theophany it's a
[59:39] body Celestial body that doesn't have a
[59:43] spirit in
[59:45] it listen to this
[59:47] quote 1957 1 for
[59:51] life he said and the lust which was the
[59:55] son of God
[59:58] created by these great Fountains of
[1:00:03] Purity God as those Spirits went
[1:00:06] out and they created the
[1:00:09] logus and it was a
[1:00:12] body it was in the form of what we are
[1:00:16] now which is called in the clergy way of
[1:00:19] speaking
[1:00:21] it a theop it's a body that doesn't have
[1:00:25] a spirit in it
[1:00:27] it's a body that's waiting for you
[1:00:31] Christians as soon as the life leaves
[1:00:34] this this body you go into that body
[1:00:39] when this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:00:43] dissolved we have one already
[1:00:46] waiting a
[1:00:49] theop but a theophany remember what he
[1:00:52] said it's a body that doesn't have a
[1:00:59] Spirit they call it a
[1:01:02] theophany but it's our Celestial
[1:01:06] body Paul spoke of
[1:01:08] it brother bam says in the message in
[1:01:19] tment uh he says he says as job of
[1:01:23] old when we hear that
[1:01:26] ashes to
[1:01:27] ashes dust to
[1:01:30] dust it reminds me of Long Fellow the
[1:01:35] poet he said tell me not in Mor in
[1:01:38] mournful
[1:01:40] numbers life is just an empty
[1:01:44] dream and the soul is dead that
[1:01:48] Slumbers and things are not what they
[1:01:52] seem he said he he said this yay life is
[1:01:56] real life is
[1:01:59] earnest and the grave it's not is not
[1:02:02] its
[1:02:03] goal for dust Thou Art to dust
[1:02:07] returnest was not spoken of the
[1:02:11] Soul it has a different
[1:02:14] promise it has a greater
[1:02:17] promise they call it a
[1:02:19] theophany that when we leave here we go
[1:02:23] in somewhere
[1:02:24] else he said whatever it may
[1:02:27] be I take the apostles
[1:02:31] word when he said if this Earthly
[1:02:35] Tabernacle or Dwelling Place be
[1:02:38] dissolved we have one already waiting to
[1:02:41] move from
[1:02:43] this this flesh
[1:02:46] body into that into a theophany
[1:02:50] body remember we just read
[1:02:53] it in the message thirsting for life
[1:02:57] brother brandom says a
[1:02:59] theophany is a body that doesn't have a
[1:03:02] spirit in
[1:03:04] it he made a statement he said your
[1:03:08] spirit breaks up when you
[1:03:12] die it takes a
[1:03:14] flight just like your natural flesh
[1:03:18] body it breaks
[1:03:21] up and turns into the 16 different
[1:03:24] elements of the Earth
[1:03:28] and it's dust from where it came
[1:03:30] from and God's spoken
[1:03:33] word created these
[1:03:35] bodies well the
[1:03:38] spirit the human
[1:03:40] Spirit just like the human
[1:03:42] body will also break up when you
[1:03:46] die and it will be no more because it's
[1:03:50] that human
[1:03:51] Spirit and the and and and the Soul when
[1:03:54] it's born again
[1:03:56] that's the inner
[1:03:58] battle that's the battle of the
[1:04:00] Mind between this natural human
[1:04:04] spirit and a man and a woman that's been
[1:04:06] born
[1:04:08] again the soul is the
[1:04:10] seed that's the Son and Daughter of
[1:04:13] God the human spirit that we had was
[1:04:17] because of the
[1:04:18] fall this flesh body that'll
[1:04:22] die because of the
[1:04:24] Fall but but there is lays within
[1:04:28] us a soul that's a seed of
[1:04:32] God so he says in the message
[1:04:36] leadership
[1:04:38] 1965 he says if you believe me to be
[1:04:41] God's
[1:04:42] Prophet you listen to my
[1:04:45] words it was
[1:04:48] 1965 December the
[1:04:51] 7th so just about 20 just about 19 or 18
[1:04:57] days before he passed
[1:05:01] away I would say he dared to say this
[1:05:05] you believe me to be God's
[1:05:08] Prophet you listen to my words he said
[1:05:12] that's a deception in this
[1:05:14] day didn't the Bible say it be so close
[1:05:17] it would deceive the elected of
[1:05:24] possible to the
[1:05:26] soul but if you dance in the
[1:05:29] spirit and still with the things of the
[1:05:33] world there's something wrong if you
[1:05:36] speak with
[1:05:37] tongues Paul said I can speak with
[1:05:39] tongues of man and
[1:05:42] angels and still not even be
[1:05:46] saved yes both
[1:05:48] kinds I can do all the
[1:05:52] emotions I can have faith I can preach
[1:05:55] the gospel
[1:05:56] El I can give all the goods to feed the
[1:06:00] poor I can carry the word in Mission
[1:06:06] fields and I'm still
[1:06:08] nothing see it's the inside of the
[1:06:11] inside
[1:06:13] brother see your spirit breaks up when
[1:06:16] you
[1:06:18] die so this human Spirit breaks
[1:06:23] up when you die this flesh body this
[1:06:26] human body breaks up when you
[1:06:30] die it takes its flight but your soul is
[1:06:34] the one that lives you
[1:06:37] see he made a
[1:06:39] statement the soul in a
[1:06:43] man is your
[1:06:46] theophany the soul in a
[1:06:49] woman is your
[1:06:51] theophany if you're a son and daughter
[1:06:53] of
[1:06:54] God it's already in you it's part of you
[1:06:57] it's who you
[1:06:59] are and it's all lay in the seed called
[1:07:02] the
[1:07:04] soul in the message Hebrews chapter
[1:07:09] 2 and it's uh
[1:07:15] 1957 it says now when man become into
[1:07:18] that
[1:07:20] body he had control of all the fishes
[1:07:23] and fowls and beasts of the field
[1:07:28] and then there was no man to till the
[1:07:32] soil because the first
[1:07:34] man was was that
[1:07:37] theophany and a theophany a Celestial
[1:07:41] body doesn't have
[1:07:43] hands to till the
[1:07:47] ground Genesis
[1:07:49] 2 he he had made them male and
[1:07:54] female but there there was no man to
[1:07:56] till the
[1:07:58] soil then God made Man Out of the Dust
[1:08:00] of the
[1:08:02] earth he gave him a hand like a
[1:08:06] chimpanzee he gave him a foot like a
[1:08:10] bear then God made Man Out of the Dust
[1:08:13] of the earth oh he made him on the image
[1:08:17] and this of this Earthly body is a image
[1:08:19] of animal
[1:08:23] life and it's made out of the same kind
[1:08:25] of
[1:08:27] material your body is made just the same
[1:08:30] kind of material as a horse or a dog
[1:08:32] anything like
[1:08:36] that in other words it's made out of
[1:08:38] it's made out of
[1:08:40] calcium as
[1:08:43] petroleum Cosmic Light Elements right
[1:08:46] from the dust of the
[1:08:48] Earth
[1:08:49] all All Flesh like that is not the same
[1:08:54] flesh it's different flesh but it's made
[1:08:57] out of the Dust of the earth that's
[1:09:00] that's where it come from but the
[1:09:02] difference between an animal and a
[1:09:05] man is God put a soul in a
[1:09:08] man that's the
[1:09:11] seed that's the spoken word
[1:09:14] seed God put a soul in a
[1:09:17] man and he didn't put it in the
[1:09:20] animal because the soul is the seed of
[1:09:24] God the soul is the gene of
[1:09:28] God the soul is what makes you a son and
[1:09:31] daughter of
[1:09:33] God and the animal doesn't have
[1:09:37] that because he's an animal because he's
[1:09:40] not a sin and daughter of
[1:09:43] God he says you see the soul that was in
[1:09:46] the
[1:09:48] man is that
[1:09:51] theop how is the soul in a
[1:09:54] believer
[1:09:56] also it's his or her
[1:10:00] theophany or Celestial
[1:10:02] body because one is the
[1:10:06] seed and the
[1:10:09] theophany is the body that the seed will
[1:10:12] finally
[1:10:15] manifest when you plant a seed in the
[1:10:22] ground and you let it grow
[1:10:26] first the the the ground and the
[1:10:28] chemicals and everything that's in the
[1:10:31] Earth with the
[1:10:34] water it actually makes the seed look
[1:10:37] like it's like like it's coming
[1:10:42] undone and it doesn't look very nice if
[1:10:45] you were to open it up to look at its
[1:10:49] condition but what's really
[1:10:52] happening is that seed is being born
[1:10:56] because it's been placed in the proper
[1:10:59] soil and the harsh
[1:11:02] conditions begin to break it
[1:11:05] down is actually a seed being
[1:11:10] born to bring forth the stature of what
[1:11:12] that seed
[1:11:15] is
[1:11:16] wheat corn an oak
[1:11:20] tree and yet it All Began from a little
[1:11:24] seed
[1:11:26] that's you and I that's the natural now
[1:11:29] what about the supernatural today in our
[1:11:35] hearts how is the
[1:11:37] soul in a
[1:11:39] Believer also his or her
[1:11:42] theop this Celestial
[1:11:45] body that will
[1:11:48] receive by rapturing
[1:11:52] faith Psalms 91
[1:11:56] verse
[1:11:58] 11 the Bible says for he shall give his
[1:12:02] angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[1:12:06] all thy
[1:12:13] ways they shall bear thee up in their
[1:12:16] hands lest thou Dash thy foot against a
[1:12:21] stone it's a
[1:12:24] promise
[1:12:25] and it's a promise for every
[1:12:28] believer but they've also used this
[1:12:32] scripture to say that these
[1:12:35] angels are your
[1:12:37] theop and they're alive somewhere in a
[1:12:40] different
[1:12:43] dimension and when you need help they
[1:12:45] come down to the Earth and help
[1:12:49] you that means they've got their own
[1:12:53] minds that means can make choices
[1:12:56] independent from
[1:13:00] you and when you and when you're in
[1:13:03] trouble here on planet
[1:13:05] Earth your angel your
[1:13:08] theophany who is really you comes down
[1:13:12] to help
[1:13:13] you on this Earth that's not
[1:13:19] true but they take one
[1:13:22] scripture and expound on it they don't
[1:13:25] connect it to the
[1:13:27] Bible neither do they connect it to what
[1:13:31] a prophet
[1:13:34] taught there's three
[1:13:37] principles that I want you to
[1:13:39] consider when we speak on this
[1:13:42] subject one is found in Genesis 1 and
[1:13:45] verse
[1:13:47] 12 if you'll turn with me to Genesis
[1:13:54] 1 you're all familiar with
[1:13:57] it but we'll read it just to remind
[1:14:01] us and the Earth brought forth grass and
[1:14:04] Herb yelding seed after his
[1:14:10] kind and the tree yielding fruit whose
[1:14:13] seed was in
[1:14:16] itself after his kind and God saw that
[1:14:20] it was
[1:14:21] good so the
[1:14:23] principle in this
[1:14:26] scripture is let everything produce of
[1:14:29] its own
[1:14:30] kind every
[1:14:32] seed whether it be
[1:14:35] Botanical a beast of the
[1:14:37] field but every seed will produce of its
[1:14:41] own
[1:14:43] kind that's a principle laying in the
[1:14:47] Bible that applies both
[1:14:49] naturally and spiritually so Genesis
[1:14:54] 112 though it sounds like a very literal
[1:14:58] scripture and just a very natural point
[1:15:01] point that's been
[1:15:03] made Genesis
[1:15:05] 112 still requires
[1:15:08] Revelation and if God made us men and
[1:15:13] women that type of
[1:15:15] seed he won't change us to Wing Angels
[1:15:21] later you say why is that because winged
[1:15:26] angels are a different
[1:15:31] kind that every seed produce of its own
[1:15:36] kind here's something else amazing I'll
[1:15:39] tell
[1:15:41] you me and sister Karen had six
[1:15:45] children not one of them was a winged
[1:15:49] angel when they were growing up I
[1:15:51] wondered if they were Angels at all
[1:15:53] after a while
[1:15:55] but they
[1:15:56] were in their own way
[1:16:00] Matthew
[1:16:03] 13:34 a second principle laying in the
[1:16:07] word it says all these things spake
[1:16:11] Jesus unto the multitude in Parables and
[1:16:14] without a parable spoking not unto
[1:16:19] them in other words he was going to be
[1:16:21] speaking
[1:16:23] prophecy and hide it in
[1:16:27] statements that seemed very
[1:16:30] natural like genesis
[1:16:32] 11:12 it's a statement that seems very
[1:16:35] natural but it was really a prophetic
[1:16:39] word verse 35 that it might be fulfilled
[1:16:43] which was spoken by the
[1:16:46] prophet I will open my mouth in
[1:16:49] Parables I will utter things which have
[1:16:52] been kept secret from the foundation of
[1:16:54] the world
[1:16:57] then then Jesus sent the multitude
[1:17:01] away after he spoke these
[1:17:04] Parables none of them understood the
[1:17:07] parable and it says and went into the
[1:17:11] house and his disciples came unto
[1:17:14] him saying declare unto us the parable
[1:17:17] of the tears of the
[1:17:20] field in other words what they were
[1:17:22] asking for and they didn't realize it
[1:17:27] but Jesus knew what they were
[1:17:29] asking you know sometimes we ask and we
[1:17:32] pray for
[1:17:33] things and we don't really know what
[1:17:36] what we're asking
[1:17:38] for and when the answer
[1:17:41] comes you can better understand what you
[1:17:43] prayed for by the answer he gave
[1:17:51] you you may have thought well I didn't
[1:17:54] think I asked it that
[1:17:57] way but nonetheless he gave you an
[1:18:01] answer to what you were
[1:18:05] asking and if you can see
[1:18:09] that you can
[1:18:11] realize what you really
[1:18:13] needed and he gave
[1:18:15] it remember the little
[1:18:18] story it was a little
[1:18:21] boy he' sit down and pray
[1:18:25] and and uh and every time he
[1:18:28] prayed he'd close his eyes put his hands
[1:18:32] together he'd say
[1:18:35] Lord
[1:18:37] ABC then he'd pause d
[1:18:41] f then he
[1:18:44] paused g
[1:18:47] i
[1:18:50] jkl and he pause and every time you can
[1:18:53] come to church he'd pray that way at the
[1:18:56] altar finally one day the pastor called
[1:18:59] him over and said son come
[1:19:02] here he says I don't think you know how
[1:19:05] to
[1:19:07] pray and I want to help you no he says
[1:19:11] no no no no I do know how to
[1:19:15] pray you're just reciting the
[1:19:20] alphabet he says I do know how to
[1:19:23] pray I just don't know how to say
[1:19:27] it but I know if I give God all the
[1:19:31] letters he'll put it together for me
[1:19:35] he'll send me just what I
[1:19:38] need so Matthew
[1:19:41] 13 Jesus is telling us that this Lamb's
[1:19:45] Book of
[1:19:47] Life that that Jesus was opening to
[1:19:51] Israel requires
[1:19:53] revelation
[1:19:55] and no one but the lamb can give it to
[1:19:59] you that's what was happening in Matthew
[1:20:02] 13 and then of course there's Hebrews 13
[1:20:07] and8 Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:20:10] today and
[1:20:13] forever so that means that there's a
[1:20:15] pattern to God's
[1:20:17] word pattern to his
[1:20:20] teachings that means there's a pattern
[1:20:22] to how he redeems us and saves
[1:20:28] and Jesus said the Book of Matthew I
[1:20:31] think it's chapter 16 he said Upon This
[1:20:34] Rock I'll build my
[1:20:36] church and the Gates of Hell will not
[1:20:40] Prevail and what was that
[1:20:43] rock Revelation
[1:20:48] again so now that we have these three
[1:20:52] principles set in our mind
[1:20:55] in the mouth of two or three
[1:20:57] witnesses that everything be
[1:21:00] established now we'll go
[1:21:03] forward and ask God for
[1:21:07] Revelation in the message Israel and the
[1:21:10] church in
[1:21:13] 1953 brother Brandon makes a
[1:21:16] statement you'll go back to a young man
[1:21:19] or woman
[1:21:20] again you'll go
[1:21:23] back to a young man or woman
[1:21:27] [Music]
[1:21:29] again so in the quote he says this
[1:21:32] here we here who are getting along
[1:21:37] past you see he too was speaking in
[1:21:41] Parables what he meant
[1:21:43] was we here who are getting
[1:21:47] older you didn't know he said
[1:21:50] that because he spoke it in a
[1:21:52] parable he said we here who are getting
[1:21:55] along
[1:21:57] past words we who are getting
[1:22:01] older how do you know that's what he
[1:22:03] meant then he says when a man and woman
[1:22:05] passes 25 years
[1:22:09] old you might as well face
[1:22:11] it your youthful days are
[1:22:15] finished and to think that glorious
[1:22:19] promise as we're facing the setting of
[1:22:21] the
[1:22:23] Sun what is is it is life
[1:22:26] finished oh no no life just hasn't begun
[1:22:31] yet oh we're just
[1:22:34] going I just wish that there was some
[1:22:37] way we could settle
[1:22:40] down till time didn't mean
[1:22:44] nothing and just stay in like that and
[1:22:47] get those
[1:22:51] things out of the scriptures before the
[1:22:56] people they are there friends I can
[1:22:59] prove it by God's
[1:23:02] Bible and the help of the holy spirit
[1:23:05] that every one of you that's in
[1:23:07] Christ born again that one of these days
[1:23:11] those gray hairs will
[1:23:14] change and the and the wrinkles will run
[1:23:17] from your
[1:23:19] face you'll go back to a young man or
[1:23:22] woman
[1:23:23] again
[1:23:25] and live forever with Christ
[1:23:28] Jesus I can show you where God proved it
[1:23:30] in the
[1:23:32] Bible showed the shadows and the marks
[1:23:35] of
[1:23:36] it and promised it and swore by it that
[1:23:41] he'd do
[1:23:42] it oh how marvelous that
[1:23:45] is then he goes on to say
[1:23:48] this mom used to tell
[1:23:52] me excuse me Mom that was before you
[1:23:55] knew better
[1:23:58] too that we'd have wings and fly around
[1:24:01] up there you
[1:24:03] know why I like to eat drink shake hands
[1:24:06] with
[1:24:09] people
[1:24:10] Fellowship I thought oh my that that'll
[1:24:14] all be finished
[1:24:16] then I found
[1:24:18] out God never did make me an
[1:24:23] angel
[1:24:25] he made me a
[1:24:26] man and I'll always be a man and never
[1:24:31] be an
[1:24:32] angel that's an error God's got Angels
[1:24:36] sure he made angels He made cherubims
[1:24:40] with
[1:24:41] wings and he made Angels without
[1:24:44] wings when I used to hear these old
[1:24:48] songs when I was a
[1:24:50] sinner and would go into them
[1:24:53] places brown eyed angel awaits
[1:24:58] me I thought oh my Me an
[1:25:03] Angel and I found out that's a lie of
[1:25:06] the
[1:25:10] devil never was such a thing
[1:25:13] see we are absolutely men and
[1:25:17] women and we'll return back to this
[1:25:19] earth men and
[1:25:21] women that's right that's God's
[1:25:25] teaching when you see those things it
[1:25:28] makes you appreciate Jesus
[1:25:31] Christ because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:25:35] yesterday today and
[1:25:37] forever unchanging in all his
[1:25:41] ways and in the beginning he said let
[1:25:44] every seed produce of its own
[1:25:53] kind God
[1:25:56] rich in
[1:26:05] Mercy the message
[1:26:08] job preached in
[1:26:12] 1955 brother says
[1:26:15] this the statement is this he made us
[1:26:19] humans he ain't redeemed us back to
[1:26:23] Angels
[1:26:25] so here it begins the
[1:26:27] quote see the
[1:26:30] plan how God wants to redeem
[1:26:33] us when we left
[1:26:35] Eden it was a beautiful pair there in
[1:26:38] the Garden of
[1:26:40] Eden that lovely little sweetheart and
[1:26:42] the
[1:26:46] husband and then by
[1:26:48] Falling see God just brings us right
[1:26:51] back again through
[1:26:53] Redemption
[1:26:55] to to redeem us right back to our origin
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:01] again we're he he's not taking us back
[1:27:05] to the
[1:27:07] angels and you'll go into
[1:27:11] restaurant and hear that old squeaky
[1:27:14] juice
[1:27:16] boxes or whatever you call it squeaking
[1:27:20] out a brown eyed angel waits for
[1:27:23] me
[1:27:25] nonsense if your beloved wife was
[1:27:29] gone or somebody she waits for you there
[1:27:33] as a human being
[1:27:36] Immortal God made
[1:27:38] Angels but he made us
[1:27:41] men he made us humans he hasn't redeemed
[1:27:45] us back to
[1:27:48] angels He redeemed us back to where we
[1:27:51] was in the first place
[1:27:56] where Adam and Eve were in the first
[1:27:58] place human beings eating
[1:28:02] drinking you see just the way of the
[1:28:07] Cross leads us back
[1:28:11] home in the message
[1:28:13] Hebrews chapter one brother says the
[1:28:17] logos of
[1:28:19] God had a theophany
[1:28:22] body and the body body was like a
[1:28:26] man now the quote in Hebrews
[1:28:31] 1957 he says now when these great lights
[1:28:35] went
[1:28:36] out or great rays of
[1:28:40] spirit love
[1:28:42] peace that's all there was there wasn't
[1:28:45] no suffering there wasn't no
[1:28:48] hate nor malice it couldn't come from
[1:28:51] this
[1:28:52] fountain that was
[1:28:54] Jehovah that was Jehovah
[1:28:57] God now as the theologians call
[1:29:00] it a theophany went from
[1:29:03] that which was called in the scriptures
[1:29:06] the
[1:29:07] logos the logos that went out of God
[1:29:11] it's hard to explain but it was a part
[1:29:14] of God now here is what
[1:29:16] happened oh this just gets me right
[1:29:19] where I love
[1:29:21] it the lust this great
[1:29:25] Fountain this great Fountain of spirit
[1:29:28] which had no beginning or no
[1:29:30] end this great spirit began to
[1:29:33] form in the creation and the logus went
[1:29:37] out from it it was the son of God it was
[1:29:41] the only visible
[1:29:42] form that the spirit had it was a
[1:29:46] theophany which means a
[1:29:49] body and the body of Jehovah was like a
[1:29:55] man Moses saw
[1:29:58] it when it passed by The
[1:30:01] Rock he looked at it and
[1:30:04] said it looked like the hind part of a
[1:30:08] man in the mind of God he always had a
[1:30:13] body and one day that body that Moses
[1:30:17] saw the back
[1:30:19] part one day that body that walked in
[1:30:23] the garden with Adam
[1:30:25] one day that body would come to Earth
[1:30:29] and become a flesh body you'd say how
[1:30:32] did become a flesh body just like Adam
[1:30:36] was first a spirit man and come into a
[1:30:39] flesh body so the body of
[1:30:43] Jesus before it ever became a flesh
[1:30:48] body it was a Celestial Supernatural
[1:30:51] body that God dwelt in
[1:30:55] one
[1:30:56] day God came down in that
[1:30:59] body the same one he used that
[1:31:02] Calvary but he came down and visited
[1:31:07] Abraham in that same
[1:31:09] body it was God in flesh speaking with
[1:31:14] his
[1:31:15] son bringing him a
[1:31:18] promise and swearing when he could swear
[1:31:21] by no
[1:31:22] greater Sarah is going to have a
[1:31:26] son and he'll
[1:31:28] represent the Son of God Christ himself
[1:31:33] this
[1:31:34] Isaac he said Moses saw it when it
[1:31:37] passed it looked like the hind part of
[1:31:39] the
[1:31:40] man it's the same type of body we
[1:31:43] receive when we die
[1:31:46] here if this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:31:50] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:31:54] that was it and that was the
[1:31:57] theophany which was the son of God that
[1:32:00] logos became flesh because we're put in
[1:32:04] flesh and the theophany the logos became
[1:32:10] flesh here amongst us and it was nothing
[1:32:13] else but the dwelling place for the
[1:32:17] entire
[1:32:19] fountain dwelt in him oh do you see it
[1:32:24] there it is Exodus
[1:32:27] 33 and verse
[1:32:30] 20 the Bible
[1:32:32] says
[1:32:34] Moses asked God to see his
[1:32:38] glory in other words I want to see you
[1:32:40] face to
[1:32:43] face and he said in Exodus 33 and
[1:32:48] 20 he said thou can not see my
[1:32:52] face
[1:32:54] for there shall no man see me and
[1:32:57] live and the Lord said behold there is a
[1:33:01] place by me that thou shalt stand upon a
[1:33:09] rock and it shall come to pass while my
[1:33:11] glory passes
[1:33:13] by that I will put thee in the Cliff of
[1:33:16] The
[1:33:17] Rock and will cover thee with my hand
[1:33:20] while I
[1:33:21] pass and I will take away my my
[1:33:25] hand and thou shalt see my back part but
[1:33:28] my face shall not be
[1:33:30] seen it was a
[1:33:33] prophecy telling us the book has been
[1:33:37] sealed with Seven
[1:33:39] Seals no man can see it
[1:33:44] now but the day would come when the W
[1:33:47] the when the book would be
[1:33:50] open and you'd see me face to face you'd
[1:33:54] know exactly what I look
[1:33:58] like I'd reveal
[1:34:00] it you'd know
[1:34:02] me in all my
[1:34:05] glory in the message the seventh
[1:34:16] seal bam says
[1:34:19] this another thing I want you to
[1:34:22] notice the statement he
[1:34:25] made was one Angel was very notable to
[1:34:29] me you remember the
[1:34:32] quote and men will say well what could
[1:34:35] be more
[1:34:37] notable than if he saw
[1:34:41] himself his face in that angel why what
[1:34:44] could be more notable they
[1:34:46] said well I've got an answer for
[1:34:49] that to see Christ would be more
[1:34:52] notable look at our own image in a
[1:34:56] mirror Fallen
[1:35:01] image he says another thing I want you
[1:35:03] to notice what taken
[1:35:06] place and if you're listening to the
[1:35:10] tape what time is it
[1:35:12] sir you will notice that one Angel was
[1:35:15] very notable to
[1:35:20] me the rest of them just seem more
[1:35:25] ordinarily but this Angel was a noted
[1:35:28] Angel he was to my left in the
[1:35:33] constellation in a form of a
[1:35:36] pyramid you remember it was in the
[1:35:40] pyramid where the mysterious White Rock
[1:35:43] was not written
[1:35:46] on and the angels took me into that
[1:35:48] pyramid of
[1:35:51] themselves the the mysteries of God
[1:35:54] known only to
[1:35:56] them and now they with the
[1:35:59] messengers they come to interpret that
[1:36:03] pyramid that message of the secret of
[1:36:07] these Seven Seals which lays inside the
[1:36:11] pyramid now the angel was to my
[1:36:15] left he would really be the last or
[1:36:18] seventh
[1:36:20] angel if we would count them from left
[1:36:22] to right
[1:36:24] because he was on my left and me looking
[1:36:28] looking to him towards the
[1:36:31] West him coming towards the
[1:36:35] east would be on my
[1:36:37] left so that would be the last Angel's
[1:36:41] message very notable you remember how I
[1:36:45] how I
[1:36:46] said he he had his head
[1:36:49] back and his great sharp
[1:36:52] wings and he flew right to
[1:36:55] me now that is this seventh
[1:37:00] seal or that was this part
[1:37:05] seven of this Plan of
[1:37:08] Redemption in this Lamb's Book of Life
[1:37:11] he said still a notable
[1:37:13] thing then he said when he preached the
[1:37:15] seventh
[1:37:17] seal we don't know what it is as
[1:37:20] yet because it's not permitted to be
[1:37:23] broken
[1:37:25] but today in
[1:37:27] 2024 we do know what it is because he
[1:37:31] continued preaching on this seven seal
[1:37:34] on part seven and never stopped in
[1:37:39] 1964 and
[1:37:41] 1965 until God took him home and he made
[1:37:44] it clear to us what it was which we'll
[1:37:48] share another
[1:37:50] time in the mystery Christ The Mystery
[1:37:53] of God
[1:37:56] revealed paragraph 6
[1:38:02] 629 brother brandom says
[1:38:05] this
[1:38:07] Glory the great Angel of the
[1:38:11] Covenant the one who was with Moses in

[1:38:32] of the
[1:38:33] Covenant the one who was with Moses in
[1:38:36] the
[1:38:37] wilderness the one who came to Paul on
[1:38:40] the road to
[1:38:42] Damascus that same one permitted his
[1:38:46] picture to be taken with us he's talking
[1:38:50] about the picture when he was in Dallas
[1:38:54] of the pillar of
[1:38:56] fire he said the same
[1:38:58] one that was in the picture in the Life
[1:39:02] Magazine the other
[1:39:05] day the same word by the same
[1:39:08] God through the same channels by the
[1:39:12] same way by the same
[1:39:15] promise wherever two or three are
[1:39:17] gathered in my
[1:39:19] name I'm there in the
[1:39:21] midst then here he then he is
[1:39:25] here did you hear it he said the great
[1:39:29] Angel of the
[1:39:31] Covenant who was with Moses in the
[1:39:36] wilderness the one who came to Paul on
[1:39:38] the road to
[1:39:41] Damascus he's lining this up in the
[1:39:44] mouth of two other
[1:39:46] Witnesses and what he says will be the
[1:39:49] third
[1:39:50] witness the same one who was with Moses
[1:39:54] in the
[1:39:55] wilderness he called him the great Angel
[1:39:57] of the
[1:39:58] Covenant the one who came to Paul on the

[1:40:20] Magazine so who was that one that whose
[1:40:22] picture was in the Life
[1:40:25] Magazine who was that angel with the
[1:40:27] sweep back
[1:40:28] Wings it was the angel of the Covenant
[1:40:32] it was Christ he's telling
[1:40:35] us the same word by the same God through
[1:40:40] the same channel by the same way by the
[1:40:43] same promis wherever two or three are
[1:40:46] gathered in my
[1:40:48] name you notice what he's saying
[1:40:51] here in the mouth of three
[1:40:54] Witnesses the one who spoke with Moses
[1:40:58] the one who spoke with Paul met him on
[1:41:01] the road to
[1:41:02] Damascus the one that met me on Sunset

[1:41:08] it's the angel of the
[1:41:09] coven it's God the pillar of
[1:41:15] fire he said the angels of God are
[1:41:18] encamped about those who fear
[1:41:21] Him those that hang only to his
[1:41:25] word no man can respect that
[1:41:29] word without fearing

[1:41:36] with
[1:41:38] us as we worship Him

[1:41:45] Covenant the one that was with
[1:41:48] Moses in the wilderness the one that met
[1:41:51] Paul on the road to Damascus
[1:41:54] the one that caught William brandham up
[1:41:56] in this constellation of
[1:42:00] Angels the same God by the same channels
[1:42:04] by the same word and he's with
[1:42:08] us as we worship Him in
[1:42:12] spirit
[1:42:22] tonight
[1:42:25] in the message in questions and answers
[1:42:28] number
[1:42:32] four4 BR makes a
[1:42:35] statement you
[1:42:38] can't live in two bodies at the same
[1:42:42] time so for your theophany to be a body
[1:42:46] living somewhere
[1:42:48] else another dimension and then you're
[1:42:51] living in a flesh body
[1:42:54] that's living in two bodies at the same
[1:42:56] time he says you can't do that listen to
[1:43:00] this quote questions and
[1:43:02] answers
[1:43:05] 1964 this is a dying
[1:43:10] spirit in a dying
[1:43:12] body in other words this human
[1:43:16] spirit this flesh body one day will be
[1:43:19] no
[1:43:20] more but now he says but but you can't
[1:43:23] be in two bodies at one
[1:43:27] time there can be two Natures in you at
[1:43:30] one
[1:43:31] time now the nature of the spirit of the
[1:43:34] Lord when you're born again you're not
[1:43:38] born of
[1:43:39] physically like a baby is but what's
[1:43:43] happened the spiritual Birth has come to
[1:43:49] you and while the spiritual birth is
[1:43:51] growing in your heart
[1:43:55] there's a physical or Celestial
[1:43:58] body growing to receive that
[1:44:02] spirit and when the life leaves this
[1:44:06] body goes to that body just as when the
[1:44:10] body is presented to the
[1:44:12] earth a natural
[1:44:14] birth there's a spirit that comes in and
[1:44:18] when the spirit goes out of the
[1:44:20] body there's a body waiting
[1:44:23] for we know that after this Earthly
[1:44:27] Tabernacle be dissolved we have one
[1:44:30] already
[1:44:32] waiting that's it the spiritual
[1:44:35] body of the
[1:44:38] people a
[1:44:40] question on these seven
[1:44:43] angels that appeared on Sunset
[1:44:47] Mountain the question is did the seven
[1:44:50] angels in the Life Magazine
[1:44:53] that appeared there over sunset
[1:44:57] Mountain that they represent the seven
[1:44:59] Earthly Church age
[1:45:05] Messengers The answer is
[1:45:09] no and yet human
[1:45:12] reasoning has said well if there were
[1:45:14] seven angels in a
[1:45:17] constellation and there's and there was
[1:45:19] and there was seven Church age
[1:45:21] Messengers
[1:45:24] Ah that's
[1:45:26] easy 127
[1:45:29] 127 so one of those angels must have
[1:45:31] been Paul the next
[1:45:34] irus the next Martin the next Luther the
[1:45:37] next W and of course then that means the
[1:45:39] seventh angel was was William
[1:45:42] brandham human
[1:45:46] reasoning but the answer is did the
[1:45:49] seven angels in Life Magazine represent
[1:45:52] the seven Earthly Church
[1:45:59] Messengers The answer is
[1:46:02] no why is the answer
[1:46:04] no this is why in the message
[1:46:10] 1965 April the 18th brother brandham
[1:46:14] entitled it is the rising of the
[1:46:19] sun he said he is the one who opened
[1:46:23] those
[1:46:24] seals talking about Christ the
[1:46:27] lamb he is those seals for the whole
[1:46:30] word of God is
[1:46:32] Christ and Christ is the seals that was
[1:46:37] open what is the opening of the seals
[1:46:40] then revealing Christ seven
[1:46:44] parts that open up the Lamb's Book of
[1:46:48] Life Book of
[1:46:50] redemption and the Very seven
[1:46:54] Angels which represented the seven
[1:46:58] churches all
[1:47:00] completed and we couldn't even see
[1:47:03] it we always think it's something
[1:47:06] else he said they
[1:47:09] did they took the picture not
[1:47:13] us the seven angels he's speaking of is
[1:47:17] the ones in the Life
[1:47:19] Magazine life took the picture of it
[1:47:23] it's these seven
[1:47:24] angels that the prophet is
[1:47:27] saying they represented the seven
[1:47:30] churches all
[1:47:33] completed he says and there he is
[1:47:36] standing there Supreme
[1:47:39] judge showing that he's alpha and
[1:47:42] omega beginning and the end oh what
[1:47:47] identification quickening
[1:47:50] power did that for us
[1:47:54] the
[1:47:55] message that was coming through the
[1:47:57] angel of the
[1:47:59] Covenant was
[1:48:01] Christ and the
[1:48:04] angel and and he and and was was given
[1:48:07] it to
[1:48:08] Moses and Moses gave it to the children
[1:48:11] of
[1:48:12] Israel on the road to the promised
[1:48:15] land we have experienced the same
[1:48:20] thing the angel of the Covenant
[1:48:23] give a message to another Exodus
[1:48:28] Prophet the Third
[1:48:31] Exodus
[1:48:32] Elijah and as this Angel of the
[1:48:36] Covenant is giving this
[1:48:38] message to this 20 Century
[1:48:42] Prophet then he's giving it to the
[1:48:44] children of
[1:48:45] God on their on our road to our promised
[1:48:50] land on our road to our rapture
[1:48:54] in our road being
[1:48:57] changed and being victorious in
[1:49:01] Christ
[1:49:03] 1965 the message does God change his
[1:49:06] mind he said and Moses was leading the
[1:49:09] children of
[1:49:12] Israel just as God would tell them where
[1:49:15] to
[1:49:16] go led by a pillar of fire and a
[1:49:20] supernatural
[1:49:21] being was leading the
[1:49:24] way and Moses was getting his
[1:49:26] information through the
[1:49:29] logos he's not just telling us a
[1:49:32] story the Old Testament he's hoping
[1:49:36] you'll you'll have eyes of
[1:49:38] understanding to see this day this
[1:49:42] scripture fulfilling in our lives
[1:49:47] also Mo he
[1:49:51] says and Moses Mo was leading the
[1:49:53] children of
[1:49:55] Israel just as God would tell them where
[1:49:57] to go led by a pillar of fire and a
[1:50:01] supernatural being that was leading the
[1:50:05] way and Moses was getting his
[1:50:07] information through the
[1:50:10] L that went out of God that Pillar of
[1:50:13] Fire the angel of the Covenant which was
[1:50:17] Christ the anointed one and he was
[1:50:20] getting his message through there
[1:50:23] and giving it to the children of
[1:50:25] Israel on the road to a Promised
[1:50:28] Land we too have received a
[1:50:33] message that the angel of the Covenant
[1:50:35] gave to a
[1:50:38] prophet on our road to our promised
[1:50:46] land in the message scriptural
[1:50:49] signs of the time
[1:50:56] brother says don't be
[1:51:01] ashamed if you're ashamed of him
[1:51:04] here he said I'll be ashamed of you
[1:51:07] before the father and the Holy
[1:51:10] Angels you're in his presence
[1:51:13] now he's here he's absolutely here the
[1:51:18] great Holy Spirit the pillar of fire was
[1:51:20] with MES is right here
[1:51:23] remember when he was here on Earth he
[1:51:25] said I come from God and I go to God
[1:51:29] they said Moses forsook the treasures of
[1:51:34] Egypt considering the treasures of
[1:51:37] Christ
[1:51:39] greater than all the reproach of
[1:51:42] Christ greater than all the treasures of
[1:51:45] Egypt he went in the wilderness with
[1:51:48] Christ and any Bible reader
[1:51:51] knows the pillar of the fire was the
[1:51:55] angel of the Covenant the logus that
[1:51:57] went out of God which was
[1:52:00] Jesus and then when he died he ascended
[1:52:04] up into heaven and when he met Saul on
[1:52:07] the road to
[1:52:08] Damascus he had done turned back to the
[1:52:10] pillar of fire
[1:52:12] again and even put Paul's eyes out with
[1:52:15] the
[1:52:16] brightness he says now he's here now
[1:52:19] he's here
[1:52:21] tonight the same yesterday today and for
[1:52:24] he said would you like to identify
[1:52:28] yourself before him and say Lord God I
[1:52:33] haven't got that kind of an
[1:52:37] experience I want to have it I'm not
[1:52:40] asking you to come up
[1:52:42] here I'm just asking you to raise your
[1:52:44] hand to
[1:52:45] him if you feel like that he says was
[1:52:49] there some that wasn't that haven't
[1:52:51] raised their hands
[1:52:54] he said God
[1:52:58] bless in the message does God change his
[1:53:03] mind the prophet
[1:53:05] said Moses was leading the children of
[1:53:08] Israel just as God would let him
[1:53:11] go led by a pillar of fire and a
[1:53:14] supernatural being that was leading the
[1:53:18] way and Moses was getting in his
[1:53:20] information through the logus of
[1:53:25] just as this end time
[1:53:27] Prophet did the
[1:53:30] same that Pillar of
[1:53:32] Fire which was the angel of the
[1:53:36] Covenant that angel in the Life
[1:53:39] Magazine the one that was the most
[1:53:40] notable to
[1:53:42] him a prophet told us clearly it was the
[1:53:46] angel of the
[1:53:48] Covenant that's why it meant so much to
[1:53:50] him he said which was Christ the
[1:53:53] anointed
[1:53:58] one in the message the fifth
[1:54:08] seal we'll close with this we won't
[1:54:10] finish
[1:54:13] tonight brother Bram speaks to us of the
[1:54:15] experience that he
[1:54:19] had when he went beyond the curtain at
[1:54:21] time
[1:54:24] he said it's been about a year ago or a
[1:54:26] little
[1:54:28] more this is
[1:54:30] 1963 he preaching the fifth
[1:54:32] seal it's been about a year ago or a
[1:54:35] little
[1:54:36] more I woke up one
[1:54:38] morning and I said
[1:54:40] sweetheart to my wife she didn't
[1:54:44] move uh I had to get the kids up take
[1:54:48] them to
[1:54:50] school right up there at the old
[1:54:53] place and I raised up out of bed you
[1:54:56] know and I
[1:54:58] leaned lean forward you
[1:55:01] know to sit
[1:55:03] up and I just lean and I just lean my
[1:55:05] head back against the
[1:55:09] headboard we got one of those
[1:55:11] oldfashioned
[1:55:13] beds so I so I just leaned
[1:55:16] back and I thought boy you're already
[1:55:21] 53 and and if you're going to do
[1:55:23] anything for God you better get doing
[1:55:26] it because you're you're going to just
[1:55:29] be too old after a
[1:55:31] while I was laying there
[1:55:34] thinking thinking that and all at once
[1:55:38] there was something
[1:55:41] happened now you know and all of you who
[1:55:45] are acquainted with the
[1:55:48] visions and if this was a
[1:55:51] vision never had one like
[1:55:54] it and and I've had them since I was a
[1:55:56] little bitty
[1:55:58] boy and all one something
[1:56:01] happened and I felt myself
[1:56:04] leaving I thought well I've already
[1:56:09] died I'm gone
[1:56:11] on see see I got a
[1:56:14] place uh I I was on the
[1:56:17] bed I was stretched
[1:56:20] out laying by the side of my wife
[1:56:24] I thought well it's probably a heart
[1:56:25] attack
[1:56:27] see I thought well I just died
[1:56:33] instantly which would be a fine way of
[1:56:36] going so I thought that's a heart
[1:56:39] attack I didn't have to
[1:56:42] suffer I looked and I thought well now
[1:56:45] that's
[1:56:46] strange there I lay right
[1:56:49] there in the bed and here I'm standing
[1:56:54] here he had left his
[1:56:57] body the body on the
[1:56:59] bed was what we would
[1:57:02] call dead he had left that body and God
[1:57:06] had allowed him to
[1:57:08] enter into that
[1:57:12] theophany he's going to take him on a
[1:57:15] trip he's going to go through
[1:57:21] dimensions
[1:57:23] he said well it's probably a heart
[1:57:24] attack
[1:57:26] see I just died
[1:57:29] instantly so I thought that's a heart
[1:57:32] attack I didn't have to suffer I thought
[1:57:35] well now that's
[1:57:36] strange there I'm laying right there
[1:57:39] he's seeing his body an old man it says
[1:57:43] and here I'm standing
[1:57:46] here so then we're going to jump up jump
[1:57:49] a few paragraphs ahead
[1:57:52] and then brother brandom is in this
[1:57:55] other
[1:57:57] dimension then he says so then but
[1:57:59] however there was Fritz standing there
[1:58:01] licking me on the
[1:58:04] hand that was his old
[1:58:06] dog he said I looked I couldn't
[1:58:09] cry no one could cry it was all joy you
[1:58:14] couldn't be
[1:58:17] sad because it was all
[1:58:19] happiness you couldn't die it was all
[1:58:22] life there see you couldn't get old
[1:58:25] there cuz it was all
[1:58:27] youth that's what it was just
[1:58:30] perfect I thought oh isn't this
[1:58:33] wonderful and the millions that were
[1:58:36] there oh Maya was right at home
[1:58:40] see and just then I heard a
[1:58:43] voice and it cried out and
[1:58:46] said all that you ever
[1:58:48] loved you know reward for my service
[1:58:53] he said I don't need no
[1:58:55] reward all that you ever
[1:58:57] loved and all that ever loved
[1:59:00] you God has given to you I said praise
[1:59:03] the
[1:59:04] Lord I felt
[1:59:08] funny I thought what's the
[1:59:11] matter I feel
[1:59:13] funny I turned around and
[1:59:16] looked and on the bed my body was
[1:59:20] moving I said oh I don't have to go back
[1:59:23] surely don't let me go but the gospel
[1:59:27] had to be
[1:59:28] preached and just a second I was on the
[1:59:32] bed
[1:59:33] again like that the body he
[1:59:36] left was a man of
[1:59:39] 53 but you go back and read the fifth
[1:59:43] seal and it's and it's several pages
[1:59:46] that he's giving the account of what
[1:59:50] happened and in that account he he
[1:59:52] says he says when he arrived there he
[1:59:56] said I looked at my
[1:59:58] hands they were
[2:00:00] young I put my head up and touched my
[2:00:04] head I had a head full of
[2:00:07] hair everybody that was
[2:00:09] there no people there was no babies
[2:00:13] there was no
[2:00:15] elderly
[2:00:18] amen he said millions of sisters came up
[2:00:23] to
[2:00:24] him and embraced him and hugged
[2:00:28] him he and he said I Heard a Voice tell
[2:00:32] me did you recognize her he said no no
[2:00:36] he says you let her to
[2:00:39] Christ when she was 90 years
[2:00:42] old she wasn't 90
[2:00:45] anymore and guess what nobody there in
[2:00:50] their theophany body
[2:00:53] had
[2:00:53] wings not a
[2:00:55] one there were young men and young
[2:01:00] women but you get
[2:01:02] off on a false
[2:01:05] teaching and the devil will take you
[2:01:07] further and further and
[2:01:11] further and you'll never see the
[2:01:16] truth may God have mercy on
[2:01:20] us
[2:01:28] I was hoping I'd
[2:01:31] finish but that would take another two
[2:01:33] hours
[2:01:34] tonight you're not busy tonight are
